Biden has said he has the stamina and mental sharpness to do the job.\n\nTrump also said Harris's record would hurt her electoral chances, the latest sign that he and his Republican allies are starting an all-out assault on Harris to prepare for Biden possibly ending his re-election bid.\n\n\"I don't think Kamala Harris's California socialism is going to go down well with the people of Doral, the people of Miami or the people of Florida. Because in Florida we don't like socialism, we want our freedom,\" Trump said.\n\nThe Biden campaign accused Trump of lying about Harris, and said he was trying to deflect from growing attention paid to Project 2025, a conservative group's controversial plans to remake the presidency should Trump win the Nov. 5 election.\n\n\"Trump's bizarre and unhinged rants won't stop Vice President Harris from defending the Biden-Harris record and prosecuting the case against Donald Trump's extreme record,\" Biden campaign spokesperson Ammar Moussa said.\n\nGOLF CHALLENGE\n\nSeemingly joking, Trump challenged Biden to another debate, saying that it should be \"man to man, no moderators, no holds barred,\" and to 18 holes of golf - a reference to their argument during the debate over who was better at the sport.\n\n\"It will be among the most watched sporting events in history, maybe bigger than the Ryder Cup or even the Masters,\" Trump said, adding that he would give Biden 20 strokes.\n\nThe Biden campaign dismissed Trump's golf challenge as a stunt. They said Biden, who gave a speech at the NATO summit in Washington today vowing to defend Ukraine against Russian President Vladimir Putin's invasion, was too busy governing.\n\n\"We'd challenge Donald Trump to stand up to Putin, but he bent the knee to him,\" said campaign spokesperson James Singer.\n\nTrump praised what he called an \"incredible decision\" by the Supreme Court last week determining that he could not be prosecuted for actions within his constitutional powers as president, a landmark decision that could have broad implications for the criminal charges he is facing.\n\nBiden called the ruling \"a dangerous precedent\" because the power of the presidency will no longer be constrained by law.\n\nCalling the prosecutions against him politically motivated, Trump said he had \"great respect for the courage\" shown by the conservative justices who ruled in his favor. \"They have great intellect and great insight, incredible insight,\" he said.\n\nOn Saturday, the former president will travel to Pennsylvania for an afternoon rally in Butler, just outside of Pittsburgh, where the focus will be on any hint - or announcement - about whom he will pick as vice president.\n\nRubio, Ohio Senator J.D. Vance and North Dakota Governor Doug Burgum are seen as the leading contenders to join Trump on the Republican ticket. Trump said this week that he would likely make a decision \"a little before\" or during the Republican Party's national convention, which kicks off on July 15.\n\nCalling out Rubio by name, Trump pointed out the large number of journalists in attendance. \"I think they probably think I'm going to be announcing that Marco is going to be vice president, because that's a lot of press,\" he said.", "source": {"uri": "staradvertiser.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Honolulu Star Advertiser"}, "authors": [{"uri": "reuters@staradvertiser.com", "name": "Reuters", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kamala_Harris", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Kamala Harris"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Biden", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Democratic Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republican_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Republican Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golf", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Golf"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doral,_Florida", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Doral, Florida"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Doral, Florida"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miami", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Miami"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Miami"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Biden_2020_presidential_campaign", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Joe Biden 2020 presidential campaign"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Florida_Senate", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Florida Senate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Socialism", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Socialism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Running_mate", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Running mate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Florida", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Florida"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Florida"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Attorney_General_of_California", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Attorney General of California"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marco_Rubio", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Marco Rubio"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vice_President_of_the_United_States", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Vice President of the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Senate", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United States Senate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conservatism_in_the_United_States", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Conservatism in the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vladimir_Putin", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Vladimir Putin"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/California", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "California"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "California"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doug_Burgum", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Doug Burgum"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ohio_Senate", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Ohio Senate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/J._D._Vance", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "J.

He also again used dehumanizing language about undocumented immigrants as he laid out his border priorities for a second term. Trump has long vowed mass deportations across the country if he returns to the White House, and border debates have taken center stage during his third White House bid.\n\nHere are four key takeaways from Trump's Florida campaign rally.\n\nBashing Biden while he's down\n\nTrump, who has laid low in recent days as Democrats debated Biden's age and mental fitness, sought to take full advantage of concerns from Democratic voters and lawmakers.\n\nTrump accused Biden of being a \"part-time president\" in front of his crowd of supporters after his 2024 rival struggled to articulate his pitch to Americans on the debate stage. During his speech, Trump said his opponents are \"having a full-scale breakdown\" because \"they can't decide which of their candidates is more unfit to be president,\" Biden or Harris.\n\nSeveral Democrats in Congress have suggested that Biden withdraw, fearing that his falling poll numbers will take them all down on Election Day. Biden has said that Democratic disunity is the bigger threat, and he has urged the party to stick with him.\n\nA CBS/You Gov national survey conducted in the days after the debate found that 72% of voters do not believe Biden has the mental or cognitive health to serve as president, as well as nearly half of his own party. That was up seven points from the beginning of June.\n\nThe Biden campaign said Trump's debate proposal was not serious, only part of a performance that included extended comments about golf and references to fictional serial killer Hannibal Lecter. Trump during his speech made fun of Biden by challenging him to a golf match at Doral.\n\n\"Joe Biden doesn't have time for Donald Trump's weird antics - he's busy leading America and defending the free world,\" said Biden spokesperson James Singer.\n\nTargeting Harris, just in case\n\nTrump, who said Monday that Biden may well hang on to the nomination, spent most of the Florida rally attacking the incumbent - but also found time to go after his potential replacement, Harris.\n\nAt one point, Trump claimed that some Democrats would be reluctant to elevate Harris - and that's why Biden picked her in the first place. \"The best insurance policy I've ever seen,\" Trump said.\n\nDuring a campaign event earlier in the day on Tuesday in Las Vegas, Harris knocked the former president, alleging that he \"wants to turn our democracy into a dictatorship.\"\n\nA poll conducted last week by the firm Bendixen & Amandi Inc. showed that Harris could narrowly beat Trump in November. In the national survey conducted by the Democratic pollster, she would edge out Trump, 42% - 41%. The survey showed 12% undecided and 3% support going to third-party candidates.\n\nAttacking undocumented immigrants\n\nTrump also noted that Biden tapped Harris earlier in his administration to take on an issue that's at the heart of the presidential campaign: The southern border.\n\nRepeatedly assailing illegal border crossings and accusing migrants of widely committing crimes, Trump said immigration will be a top issue regardless of his opponent.\n\nIt's not the first time in recent months Trump has used the rhetoric against migrants. Trump told crowds in June that he that he has floated the idea of a migrant fight club to UFC President Dana White, calling migrants to the United States \"nasty\" and \"mean.\"\n\nTrump also told a New Hampshire crowd last year that immigrants who enter the U.S. illegally are \"poisoning the blood of our country.\" A 2019 USA Today analysis of more than five dozen of the former president's rallies found he had used words like 'invasion' and 'killer' to discuss immigrants at rallies 500 times.\n\nSidestepping the running mate search\n\nTrump also staged his Florida rally as he prepares to announce his running mate. It featured one of the top contenders: Sen.

Two weeks after telling reporters he had made his decision, he told Fox News' Sean Hannity that he was still weighing his options. Trump said the debate and uncertainty over whether Biden would be the Democratic nominee had emerged as a last-minute factor in his deliberations.\n\nFormer President Donald Trump leaves a campaign rally at Trump National Doral Golf Club in Doral, Florida, on Tuesday.Joe Raedle/Getty Images\n\n\"I haven't made a final decision yet, but I have some ideas about where we're going,\" Trump said in a phone interview for Hannity's show. \"And kind of, you know, we wanted to see what they do, to be honest. Because, you know, it might make a difference. I don't know. I'm not sure it would, but some people are saying that Trump is waiting to see what happens with corrupt Joe Biden, and we'll see what happens with Biden.\"\n\nTrump's teasing continued Tuesday night with a rally in Doral, Florida, where he apparently hurled more sharp insults at Vice President Kamala Harris, who could be his general election opponent if Biden withdraws.\n\nThe location also fueled speculation that Trump was poised to select Sen. Marco Rubio, who, like Sen. J.D. Vance of Ohio and Gov. Doug Burgum of North Dakota, became a finalist and whose political base is near Miami.\n\nSen. Marco Rubio, R-Florida, attends a campaign rally for former President Donald Trump at Trump National Doral Golf Club in Doral, Fla., on Tuesday. Joe Raedle/Getty Images\n\nRubio addressed the rally audience two hours before Trump took the stage, shortly after Trump's campaign sent a fundraising email suggesting his announcement could come at the event.\n\nThis never happened, although Trump playfully alluded to the speculation.\n\nI think they probably think I'm going to announce that Marco is going to be vice president, because that's a lot of press, Trump said at one point.\n\nQuestions about Biden's fitness to last four more years in the White House have dominated the political landscape since his June 27 debate with Trump in Atlanta. Biden, 81, had a hoarse voice and a slack jaw and appeared to lose his train of thought at times during the 90-minute event.\n\nSome Democrats have called for Biden to withdraw from the presidential race, while others have said he needs to do more to demonstrate he can beat Trump, 78, in a rematch of the 2020 election. Other discussions have focused on how Biden might be replaced and who might replace him. Harris and a group of Democratic governors have been mentioned as alternatives if Biden drops out of reelection.\n\nTrump's comments to Hannity suggest that his decision may now be influenced by whether he will run against a politically weakened Biden or against an entirely new Democratic ticket. A running mate who makes sense in a race against Biden and Harris might make less sense in a race against Harris or against someone else who appeals to a particular electorate.\n\nAt his Florida rally, Trump focused on Harris, whose first name he repeatedly mentioned more than usual in his campaign speeches, describing her as a left-wing ally of Sen. Bernie Sanders and saying she had failed as Biden's running mate. Trump also suggested that Biden would stay in the race because Democrats would prefer not to run with Harris at the top of their ticket.\n\nIf Joe had picked someone even halfway competent, they would have removed him from office years ago, Trump said. But they can't, because she has to be their second choice.\n\nA source close to Trump who has been in contact with him about the selection process does not believe the Biden fallout has changed the calculus around who to choose, the source said Tuesday.\n\nAnother Republican who spoke to Trump about the vice presidential selection process said: \"I don't think that's part of this plan, and I certainly haven't heard that's the plan. I think they have an idea of what they want to do and they're going to stick to that process.\"\n\nMeanwhile, Trump senior adviser Brian Hughes offered the same written response he has given to previous articles about the running mate search, namely that anyone who tells you who or when President Trump will pick his vice president is lying, unless that person's name is Donald J. Trump.\n\nOhio Republican Sen. J.D. Vance is on Trump's running mate list. Drew Angerer/Getty Images file\n\nA Republican with close ties to Trump's world said Vance, the new senator from Ohio, has the best case to make in any scenario the Republican ticket might face.\n\nAll I have seen and believe is [Democrats] According to the source, who was granted anonymity to share his candid observations, it would be best to partner with Kamala and a Midwestern governor like Josh Shapiro of Pennsylvania. Someone like JD really expands the map and provides a safety net for the idea that turns to Kamala and someone like Shapiro who can go and reinforce the blue wall. So in that regard, he may be the only one who brings something interesting to the table, and given who he is and the way he communicates, you could see him just burning states.\n\nRubio is helping attract Latino voters, the source said, but the campaign is confident about his chances in Arizona and Nevada, key states with large Hispanic populations.\n\nDoug Burgum is, as most say, safe, the source said. He's not doing anything special, not helping you, not hurting you. He's kind of allowing Trump to shine.\n\nOthers see this as a selling point for Burgum.\n\nRubio and Vance have been more rhetoric than action, said a former senior Trump adviser who has remained close to him and has spoken with him about the search for a running mate. Burgum, a former independent tech executive, has really gotten things done as governor, as a leader, and the one thing about Burgum that I think really appeals to Trump is that he's not in this for the money or the fame.\n\nWhile Biden has given several interviews and made several campaign appearances since the debate in an effort to reassure nervous Democrats, Trump has been relatively quiet until Monday's call with Hannity. As one Trump adviser said Tuesday, campaign officials have been keen to stay away from Biden as he racks up headlines.\n\nTrump told Hannity he wants to wait until next week's Republican National Convention to reveal his choice, sticking to a timeline that has long been his preference.\n\n\"I think it'll probably be in the next week or so,\" Trump said, referring to the introduction of running mates. \"I'd love to do it at the convention. My people say it's a little complicated.\"\n\nTrump is enjoying the suspense and theater surrounding his choice and is likely thinking about how to leverage the moment to have the greatest impact, the source close to Trump said.\n\n\"It's hard to anticipate that with all the craziness going on with Biden, you really can't break through,\" the source said. He could choose Jesus Christ, and you're not going to break through now.\n\n\"I take his word for it last night that he really wants to do it at the convention,\" the source added. \"I think he wants to do it like a WWE walk-out, with smoke and a black screen and then the person comes out, because that would be good fucking TV.\"\n\nWhat Are The Main Benefits Of Comparing Car Insurance Quotes Online", "source": {"uri": "exbulletin.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "ExBulletin"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kamala_Harris", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Kamala Harris"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Biden", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marco_Rubio", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Marco Rubio"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vice_President_of_the_United_States", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Vice President of the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Running_mate", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Running mate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Democratic Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doral,_Florida", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Doral, Florida"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Doral, Florida"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hannity", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Hannity"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_House", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "White House"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golf", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Golf"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ohio", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Ohio"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Ohio"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fox_News", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Fox News"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doug_Burgum", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Doug Burgum"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/J._D._Vance", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "J.

He also again used dehumanizing language about undocumented immigrants as he laid out his border priorities for a second term. Trump has long vowed mass deportations across the country if he returns to the White House, and border debates have taken center stage during his third White House bid.\n\nHere are four key takeaways from Trump's Florida campaign rally.\n\nTrump, who has laid low in recent days as Democrats debated Biden's age and mental fitness, sought to take full advantage of concerns from Democratic voters and lawmakers.\n\nTrump accused Biden of being a \"part-time president\" in front of his supporters after his 2024 rival struggled to articulate his pitch to Americans on the debate stage. During his speech, Trump said his opponents are \"having a full-scale breakdown\" because \"they can't decide which of their candidates is more unfit to be president,\" Biden or Harris.\n\nSeveral Democrats in Congress have suggested that Biden withdraw, fearing that his falling poll numbers will take them all down on Election Day. Biden has said Democratic disunity is the bigger threat and urged the party to stick with him.\n\nA CBS/You Gov national survey conducted in the days after the debate found that 72% of voters do not believe Biden has the mental or cognitive health to serve as president, as well as nearly half of his party. That was up seven points from the beginning of June.\n\nThe Biden campaign said Trump's debate proposal was not serious, only part of a performance that included extended comments about golf and references to fictional serial killer Hannibal Lecter. Trump during his speech made fun of Biden by challenging him to a golf match at Doral.\n\n\"Joe Biden doesn't have time for Donald Trump's weird antics - he's busy leading America and defending the free world,\" said Biden spokesperson James Singer.\n\nTrump, who said Monday that Biden may well hang on to the nomination, spent most of the Florida rally attacking the incumbent - but also found time to go after his potential replacement, Harris.\n\nAt one point, Trump claimed that some Democrats would be reluctant to elevate Harris - and that's why Biden picked her in the first place. \"The best insurance policy I've ever seen,\" Trump said.\n\nDuring a campaign event earlier in the day on Tuesday in Las Vegas, Harris knocked the former president, alleging that he \"wants to turn our democracy into a dictatorship.\"\n\nA poll conducted last week by Bendixen & Amandi Inc. showed that Harris could narrowly beat Trump in November.

'Where is Barron? Stand up. Look at him! ... You're pretty popular. He may be more popular than Don and Eric. We gotta talk about this. Hey, Don, we've gotta talk about this huh?'\n\nThe 78-year-old ex-president said 'welcome to the scene, Barron,' and cracked that his youngest son 'had such a nice, easy life - now it's a little bit changed,' earning raucous cheers.\n\nBut Trump led the rally with a new challenge for President Joe Biden, 81, whose reelection campaign has been imperiled by his poor debate performance late last month.\n\nThe ex-president first said he wanted to debate Biden again - 'next week' - which would coincide with the Republican National Convention. Biden is due to debate Trump a second time already, but on September 10.\n\nTrump also said he wanted to play Biden in a game of golf - and staked $1 million on the deal.\n\nBarron Trump stands and pumps his fists as the crowd cheers at Tuesday night's Trump rally in Doral, Florida. Former President Donald Trump commented that the 18-year-old 'may be more popular than Don and Eric'\n\nBarron, the youngest son of the former president, earned raucous applause as former President Donald Trump told the crowd that it was the first campaign rally that the 18-year-old attended\n\nFormer President Donald Trump also challenged President Joe Biden to another debate - asking to have one next week - and a round of golf, saying he'd donate $1 million to the president's charity of choice\n\nBarron Trump waved to the crowd at Tuesday night's Trump rally held on the greens of the ex-president's Doral, Florida golf club. 'Welcome to the scene,' former President Donald Trump exclaimed from the podium\n\n'I'm also officially challenging Crooked Joe to an 18-hole golf match right here. On Doral's Blue Monster considered one of the greatest tournament golf courses anywhere in the world,' Trump said. 'It will be among the most-watched sporting events in history.'\n\nTrump said it could be bigger than the Ryder Cup or the Masters.\n\n'I will even give Joe Biden 10 strokes aside, 10 strokes, that's a lot. That means 20 strokes in case you don't play golf,' he continued.\n\n'And if he wins I will give the charity of his choice - any charity that he wants - 10 million dollars,' the ex-president added. 'And I bet he doesn't take the offer.'\n\nThe Biden campaign quickly clapped back, calling Trump's rally 'deranged.'\n\n'Joe Biden doesn't have time for Donald Trump's weird antics - he's busy leading America and defending the free world,' said campaign spokesperson James Singer.\n\nSinger noted that Trump's rally consisted of the ex-president 'inviting fictional serial killers to dinner, teasing lil' Marco Rubio, praising Project 2025 architect Tom Homan, and challenging the President of the United States to golf.'\n\nDonald Trump Jr. was one of the opening acts at the Tuesday night Trump rally in Doral, Florida. He noted how Democrats don't want Americans to own an AR-15 'but they gave a vegetable the nuclear codes'\n\n'Donald Trump is a liar, a convict, and a fraud only out for himself - par for the course.'\n\nTrump has stayed off the campaign trail for 10 days - holding his last rally in Chesapeake, Virginia the day after Biden's debate - allowing the Democratic president's campaign to implode as he stayed uncharacteristically quiet.\n\nThe ex-president was seen at Fourth of July festivities.\n\nAt the rally, Trump came aimed with a number of insults for his rival Tuesday night, surrounded by supporters and family members.\n\nDonald Trump Jr. was among those to warm up the crowd, noting how Democrats don't want Americans to own an AR-15, 'but they gave a vegetable the nuclear codes.'\n\nTrump Jr. was joined by his ex-wive Vanessa and three children - and his current fiance Kimberly Guilfoyle.\n\nEric Trump was also on hand.\n\nFormer President Donald Trump stoked speculation that he could choose Florida Sen. Marco Rubio - a 2016 rival - as his VP. Rubio warmed up the crowd ahead of Trump's arrival and then was seated front row at the Doral golf club\n\nAlso there - one of Trump's top veepstakes candidates: Florida Sen. Marco Rubio, a former 2016 rival.\n\nThroughout the night, Trump teased Rubio, seated front row.\n\n'I think they probably think I'm going to be announcing that Marco's going to be vice president,' the presumptive Republican nominee said.\n\nTrump trashed talked Vice President Kamala Harris and floated that Biden had put her in the position as an 'insurance policy.'\n\n'Maybe the best insurance policy I've ever seen, Marco,' Trump said. 'If Joe had picked someone at least halfway competent they would have bounced him for office years ago, but they can't because - she's gotta be, their second choice, has no chance.'\n\nAs the ex-president talked about his proposal to eliminate tax from tips - to shore up support from service industry workers, especially in swing states like Nevada, Trump stoked VP speculation again.\n\n'Marco you're going to vote for it, I hope. Well, you may or may not be there to vote for it. But you'll be involved,' Trump said, a nod to Rubio no longer being in the Senate.\n\nVice presidents, however, can cast a tie-breaking Senate vote.\n\nTrump is expected to announce his vice presidential pick within days.\n\nAlso on the list are North Dakota Gov.

He also again used dehumanizing language about undocumented immigrants as he laid out his border priorities for a second term. Trump has long vowed mass deportations across the country if he returns to the White House, and border debates have taken center stage during his third White House bid.\n\nHere are four key takeaways from Trump's Florida campaign rally.\n\nTrump, who has laid low in recent days as Democrats debated Biden's age and mental fitness, sought to take full advantage of concerns from Democratic voters and lawmakers.\n\nTrump called Biden a \"part-time president\" in front of his crowd of supporters after his 2024 rival struggled to articulate his pitch to Americans on the debate stage. During his speech, Trump said his opponents are \"having a full-scale breakdown\" because \"they can't decide which of their candidates is more unfit to be president,\" Biden or Harris.\n\nSeveral Democrats in Congress have suggested that Biden withdraw, fearing that his falling poll numbers will take them all down on Election Day. Biden has said that Democratic disunity is the bigger threat, and he has urged the party to stick with him.\n\nA CBS/You Gov national survey conducted in the days after the debate found that 72% of voters do not believe Biden has the mental or cognitive health to serve as president, as well as nearly half of his own party. That was up seven points from the beginning of June.\n\nThe Biden campaign said Trump's debate proposal was not serious, only part of a performance that included extended comments about golf and references to fictional serial killer Hannibal Lecter. Trump during his speech made fun of Biden by challenging him to a golf match at Doral.\n\n\"Joe Biden doesn't have time for Donald Trump's weird antics - he's busy leading America and defending the free world,\" said Biden spokesperson James Singer.\n\nTrump, who said Monday that Biden may well hang on to the nomination, spent most of the Florida rally attacking the incumbent - but also found time to go after his potential replacement, Harris.\n\nAt one point, Trump claimed that some Democrats would be reluctant to elevate Harris - and that's why Biden picked her in the first place. \"The best insurance policy I've ever seen,\" Trump said.\n\nDuring a campaign event earlier in the day on Tuesday in Las Vegas, Harris knocked the former president, alleging that he \"wants to turn our democracy into a dictatorship.\"\n\nA poll conducted last week by the firm Bendixen & Amandi Inc. showed that Harris could narrowly beat Trump in November. In the national survey conducted by the Democratic pollster, she would edge out Trump, 42% - 41%. The survey showed 12% undecided and 3% support going to third-party candidates.\n\nTrump also noted that Biden earlier in his administration tapped Harris to take on an issue that's at the heart of the presidential campaign: The southern border.\n\nRepeatedly assailing illegal border crossings and accusing migrants of widely committing crimes, Trump said immigration will be a top issue regardless of who his opponent is.\n\nIt's not the first time in recent months Trump has used the rhetoric against migrants. Trump told crowds last month that he that he has floated the idea of a migrant fight club to UFC President Dana White, calling migrants to the United States \"nasty\" and \"mean.\"\n\nTrump also told a New Hampshire crowd last year that immigrants who enter the U.S. illegally are \"poisoning the blood of our country.\" A 2019 USA Today analysis of more than five dozen of the former president's rallies found he had used words like 'invasion' and 'killer' to discuss immigrants at rallies 500 times.\n\nTrump also staged his Florida rally as he prepares to announce his running mate. It featured one of the top contenders: Florida Sen. Marco Rubio.\n\nThe former president made several positive references to Rubio during the speech, noting at one point that the two of them played rough during the 2016 Republican primaries. \"We had a vicious campaign for a while,\" Trump said of the former opponent he once called \"Little Marco.\"\n\nDuring that campaign, Rubio called Trump a \"con man\" with \"small hands,\" but he became more supportive after Trump won the White House.\n\nDuring the rally, Trump joked about Rubio's chances to be the running mate, noting that his proposal to eliminate taxes on tips would need Senate approval: \"You may or may not be there to vote for it.\"\n\nOther vice presidential contenders include Ohio Sen. J.D. Vance and North Dakota Gov. Doug Burgum.\n\nTrump said he may announce his decision just before or during the Republican convention, which opens Monday in Milwaukee.\n\nContributing: Karissa Waddick and Rachel Barber, USA TODAY", "source": {"uri": "ca.news.yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kamala_Harris", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Kamala Harris"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Biden", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Democratic Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golf", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Golf"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Florida", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Florida"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Florida"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Incumbent", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Incumbent"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_House", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "White House"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doral,_Florida", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Doral, Florida"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Doral, Florida"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deportation", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Deportation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mental_health", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Mental health"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Illegal_immigration", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Illegal immigration"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ABC_News", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "ABC News"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Washington_(state)", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Washington (state)"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Washington (state)"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miami", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Miami"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Miami"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Biden_2020_presidential_campaign", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Joe Biden 2020 presidential campaign"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serial_killer", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Serial killer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CBS", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "CBS"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Election_Day_(United_States)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Election Day (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Congress", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United States Congress"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immigration", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Immigration"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2016_Republican_Party_presidential_primaries", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "2016 Republican Party presidential primaries"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump_2016_presidential_campaign", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump 2016 presidential campaign"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doug_Burgum", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Doug Burgum"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/J._D._Vance", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "J.

(AP Photo/Marta Lavandier)\n\nAfter days spent lying low, golfing and letting Democratic infighting play out in public, Trump used his return to the campaign trail in Florida to ratchet up his attacks on both Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris, indulging speculation that she could replace the president as the Democratic nominee this year and alleging, without evidence, that his son Hunter Biden is \"running our government\" and first lady Jill Biden \"is helping.\" Biden has repeatedly insisted he won't withdraw from the race.\n\nTrump rallied his supporters at one of his Miami-area golf courses as the presumptive Republican nominee nears a deadline to announce his running mate. But he appears in no rush, as much of the political world's attention is still centered on questions about Biden's ability to govern for another four-year term. Some Democrats have started calling for Biden to step down as their presumptive nominee following his dismal debate performance last month.\n\nTrump, speaking from the 10th hole of his course, challenged Biden to another debate or even a \"golf-off\" reviving an offbeat argument from their debate. But mostly, he rubbed in how their meetup left Biden's campaign facing a grim prognosis.\n\n\"Our victory was so absolute that Joe's own party now wants him to throw in the towel and surrender the presidency after a single 90-minute performance,\" Trump said Tuesday night. \"They want 'Crooked Joe' out of the race. It's a shame the way they're treating him. But don't feel sorry for him. He's a very bad guy.\"\n\nJames Singer, a spokesperson for Biden's campaign, responded to Trump with a series of challenges, saying in a statement that, \"We'd challenge Donald Trump to create jobs, but he lost 3 million. We'd challenge Donald Trump to stand up to Putin, but he bent the knee to him. We'd challenge Donald Trump to follow the law, but he breaks it.\"\n\nSinger also said, \"Joe Biden doesn't have time for Donald Trump's weird antics - he's busy leading America and defending the free world.\n\nTrump laced into Harris with more specifics than usual. She has become a focus of the former president and his allies as speculation has mounted that she would replace Biden as the Democratic nominee. Trump called her \"Laughing Kamala,\" and referred to the \"Biden-Harris administration,\" rather than just pinning actions on Biden as he had for months, and blamed Harris for the White House's immigration policies.\n\n\"Despite all the Democrat panic this week, the truth is, it doesn't matter who they nominate because we are going to beat any one of them in thundering landslides and this November's going to be amazing,\" he said.\n\nTrump, ever the showman, repeatedly played into the speculation that he might elevate Rubio to his ticket.\n\nRubio, a Miami native and one of the contenders for the vice presidential post, was among the Florida politicians who spoke at the event.\n\nAt one point, Trump marveled at the number of reporters in attendance and said, \"I think they probably think I'm going to be announcing that Marco is going to be vice president.\"\n\nLater, when he talked about his pledge to make tips tax-free, he remarked that Rubio \"may or may not be there to vote for it.\"\n\nRubio, the son of Cuban immigrants, is seen as a potential running mate who could help Trump as he tries to secure support from Hispanic Americans, a point the senator emphasized in his remarks as he switched several times in his remarks to Spanish.\n\nThe senator did not openly acknowledge any of the speculation about him joining Trump as a running mate. He instead skewered not only Biden, whom he called \"the figurehead of a left-wing government, shadow government,\" but Harris, whom he would need to debate head-on if he's chosen for Trump's ticket.\n\nRubio referred to Harris not by name at first but called her Biden's \"replacement\" and \"a real-life, verified left-winger.\" At another point in his remarks, he mocked the way Harris laughs.\n\nHe notably seemed to insert himself into Trump's signature \"Make America Great Again\" slogan by saying: \"Together, we're not just going to make it great again. We elect this man as president, we will make together America greater than it has ever been.\"\n\nThousands of people turned out in the humid summer evening for the rally. Attendees were fanning themselves and holding signs featuring Trump's mug shot, along with others that said, \"You're fired!\" -- Trump's signature phrase on his former reality show, \"The Apprentice.\"\n\nTrump's youngest child who recently turned 18, Barron, also made his first-ever appearance at one of his father's rallies. Trump implored his son to stand, with the young man pumping his fist a few times as Trump said, \"Welcome to the scene, Barron.\"\n\nOne attendee, 28-year-old Austin Stiglin, said he traveled from northern Florida to participate in his first Trump rally. He was wearing a star-patterned navy blue jacket and red pants and said he was \"tired of the left telling him to vote left just because I am gay.\"\n\n\"I have a lot more to say than just my sexual orientation,\" Stiglin said. \"I would like to vote for policies that support the United States.\"\n\nNicole Farrell, a 57-year-old immigrant from Trinidad, said she voted for Trump in 2020, \"but I was not a strong supporter like now. I just preferred him over Biden.\"\n\nFarrell said she specifically likes Trump's hardline immigration policies, which include plans for mass raids and the largest deportation operation in U.S. history.\n\n\"I am an immigrant but I came here legally. They need to come here legally,\" Farrell said of migrants coming to the U.S.\n\nBoth Biden, 81, and Trump, 78, are at least two decades older than most American presidents have been, according to the Pew Research Center, which said the median age for all U.S. presidents on their first inauguration is 55 years old. But that has not stopped Trump from arguing he is stronger than Biden, who repeatedly stumbled, paused and could not complete sentences at times during the June 27 debate. Trump was criticized by Democrats for making false statements during the debate about the Jan. 6, 2021, riot at the U.S. Capitol and suggesting immigrants entering the U.S. illegally were taking so-called \"Black jobs\" and \"Hispanic jobs.\"", "source": {"uri": "mb.com.ph", "dataType": "news", "title": "Manila Bulletin"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

He was wearing a star-patterned navy blue jacket and red pants and said he was \"tired of the left telling him to vote left just because I am gay.\"\n\n\"I have a lot more to say than just my sexual orientation,\" Stiglin said. \"I would like to vote for policies that support the United States.\"\n\nNicole Farrell, a 57-year-old immigrant from Trinidad, said she voted for Trump in 2020, \"but I was not a strong supporter like now. I just preferred him over Biden.\"\n\nFarrell said she specifically likes Trump's hardline immigration policies, which include plans for mass raids and the largest deportation operation in U.S. history.\n\n\"I am an immigrant but I came here legally. They need to come here legally,\" Farrell said of migrants coming to the U.S.\n\nBoth Biden, 81, and Trump, 78, are at least two decades older than most American presidents have been, according to the Pew Research Center, which said the median age for all U.S. presidents on their first inauguration is 55 years old. But that has not stopped Trump from arguing he is stronger than Biden, who repeatedly stumbled, paused and could not complete sentences at times during the June 27 debate. Trump was criticized by Democrats for making false statements during the debate about the Jan. 6, 2021, riot at the U.S. Capitol and suggesting immigrants entering the U.S. illegally were taking so-called \"Black jobs\" and \"Hispanic jobs.\"", "source": {"uri": "castanet.net", "dataType": "news", "title": "Castanet"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

But it was sort of easy if you want to know the truth,\" Trump told supporters in Miami.\n\n\"But don't feel sorry for he's a very bad guy. He weaponized government. Remember that -- he's a very bad guy. Don't feel sorry for him. So tonight, I'm officially offering Joe the chance to redeem himself in front of the entire world,\" Trump said.\n\n\"Let's do another debate this week -- so that sleepy Joe Biden can prove to everyone all over the world that he has what it takes to be president,\" he added. \"But this time, it will be man to man, no moderators, no holds barred, just name the place, any time.\"\n\nThe first presidential debate in Atlanta on June 27 was widely seen as disastrous for Biden, 81, and has led to questions about his fitness to lead and ability to win reelection even within his own party.\n\nTrump, 78, went on to challenge Biden to an \"18-hole golf match\", something the two men clashed over bizarrely during the debate.\n\n\"It will be among the most watched sporting events in history, maybe bigger than the Ryder Cup or even the Masters,\" Trump declared.\n\n\"I will even give Joe Biden 10 strokes a side. 10 strokes, that's a lot. That means 20 strokes in case you don't play golf. I will give him 10 strokes a side and if he wins, I will give the charity of his choice, any charity that he wants, $1 million.\"\n\nBiden campaign spokesperson James Singer said Trump \"hasn't been seen in public for 12 days\" and is now \"challenging the President of the United State to play golf.\"\n\nSinger said the president would instead challenge Trump to create jobs, stand up to Russian President Vladimir Putin, and not break the law.\n\n\"Joe Biden doesn't have time for Trump's weird antics,\" he said in a statement. \"He's busy leading America and defending the free world.\"\n\nA day after the debate with Biden, Trump performed somewhat of a victory lap in Chesapeake, Virginia, where he piled in on the president, deriding him as \"grossly incompetent\" and a \"train wreck.\"\n\n\"The question every voter should be asking themselves today is not whether Joe Biden can survive a 90-minute debate performance, but whether America can survive four more years of crooked Joe Biden the White House,\" Trump said from Virginia on June 28.\n\n\"In fact, I don't know if we can really survive five more months.\"\n\nIndeed, the president has faced multiple calls, both publicly and privately from senior members of his own party, while the eyes of the world are on him during this week's NATO summit in Washington DC.\n\nA new poll shows Vice President Kamala Harris now has a better shot than Biden at defeating Trump in the 2024 election. The survey, conducted by the Democratic firm Bendixen & Amandi, showed Biden slightly behind Trump, 42 to 43 percent, with Harris inching past the former president 42 to 41 percent.\n\nTrump is expected to name his pick for vice president shortly, with just one week to go before the Republican National Convention on July 14.\n\nOhio Senator JD Vance and Florida Senator Marco Rubio are leading contenders to join Trump on the Republican ticket, people familiar with the matter have told Reuters, with North Dakota Governor Doug Burgum also still in the mix.\n\nRemarking on the amount of press attending his rally in Florida, Trump speculated that it was only due to the anticipation surrounding his choice for vice president.\n\n\"I think they probably think I'm going to be announcing that Marco [Rubio] is going to be vice president because that's a lot of press. That's a lot of press,\" he said, though did not make any further announcement.", "source": {"uri": "yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

Two weeks after telling reporters that he had made up his mind, the former president told Fox News' Sean Hannity that he was still evaluating his options. Trump indicated that the debate -- and uncertainty about whether Biden will be the Democratic nominee -- had emerged as a last-minute factor in his deliberations.\n\n\"I haven't made a final decision, but I have some ideas as to where we're going,\" Trump said during a telephone interview for Hannity's primetime show. \"And a little bit, you know, we wanted to see what they're doing, to be honest. Because, you know, it might make a difference. I don't know. I'm not sure that it would, but there are those who say Trump's waiting until he finds out what's going to happen with crooked Joe Biden, and we'll see what happens with Biden.\"\n\nTrump's rollout tease continued Tuesday night with a rally in Doral, Florida, where he noticeably aimed sharper insults at Vice President Kamala Harris, who could be his general election opponent if Biden steps aside.\n\nThe location also fueled speculation that Trump was about to select Sen. Marco Rubio -- who along with Sen. JD Vance of Ohio and Gov. Doug Burgum of North Dakota, has emerged as a finalist, and whose political base is in nearby Miami.\n\nRubio addressed the rally audience two hours before Trump took the stage, not long after Trump's campaign sent out a fundraising email suggesting his announcement could come at the event.\n\nIt never did, though Trump playfully alluded to the speculation.\n\n\"I think they probably think I'm going to be announcing that Marco is going to be vice president, because that's a lot of press,\" Trump said at one point.\n\nQuestions about Biden's fitness to serve another four years have dominated the political landscape since his June 27 debate with Trump in Atlanta. Biden, 81, was raspy-voiced and slack-jawed and appeared to lose his train of thought at times during the 90-minute event.\n\nSome Democrats have called for Biden to step aside as the party's presidential nominee, while others have said he must do more to demonstrate that he is capable of beating Trump, 78, in a rematch of the 2020 election. Other conversations have focused on how Biden could be replaced -- and who might replace him. Harris and a crop of Democratic governors have been mentioned as alternatives should Biden drop his re-election bid.\n\nTrump's comments to Hannity hinted that his decision could now be swayed by the possibility of running against a politically weakened Biden or an altogether new Democratic ticket. A running mate who makes sense for a race against Biden and Harris might make less sense in a race against Harris or against someone else who appeals to a particular constituency.\n\nAt his Florida rally, Trump focused on Harris -- whose first name he repeatedly mispronounced -- more than he typically does in campaign speeches, describing her as a left-wing ally of Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., and asserting that she has underperformed as Biden's vice president. Trump also suggested that Biden would remain in the race because Democrats would rather not run with Harris at the top of their ticket.\n\n\"If Joe had picked someone even halfway competent, they would have bounced him from office years ago,\" Trump said. \"But they can't, because she's got to be their second choice.\"\n\nA source close to Trump who has been in touch with him on the selection process said Tuesday that they did not believe the Biden fallout had changed the calculus around who to choose.\n\n\"I just don't think that's part of this, and I certainly have not heard that is the plan,\" said another Republican who has spoken to Trump about the vice presidential selection process. \"I think they have an idea of what they want to do, and are going to stick with that process.\"\n\nMeanwhile, senior Trump adviser Brian Hughes offered the same written reply he has for previous stories about the VP search -- that \"anyone telling you they know who or when President Trump will choose his VP is lying unless that person is named Donald J. Trump.\"\n\nA Republican who is closely tied to Trump world said that Vance, the freshman senator from Ohio, has the best case to make under any scenario the GOP ticket might face.\n\n\"Everything that I've seen and believe is [Democrats] would go with Kamala and a Midwestern governor like Josh Shapiro,\" of Pennsylvania, the source, who requested anonymity to share candid observations, added. \"Somebody like JD actually expands the map and is a backstop to the idea where it flips to Kamala and somebody like Shapiro who can go and reinforce the blue wall. So in that regard, he may be the only one that actually adds something of interest, and given who he is and how he communicates, you could see him just barn-burning states.\"\n\nRubio helps appeal to Latino voters, the source said, but the campaign is feeling confident about its chances in Arizona and Nevada, two swing states with large Hispanic populations.\n\n\"Doug Burgum is, as most say, safe,\" the source continued. \"He doesn't really do anything, doesn't help you, doesn't hurt you. He kind of allows Trump to shine.\"\n\nOthers see that as a selling point for Burgum.\n\nRubio and Vance \"have been more rhetoric than they've been substance,\" said one former senior Trump adviser, who remains close with the former president and has discussed the VP search with him. Burgum, an independently wealthy former tech executive, \"has actually gotten things done as a governor, as an executive, and the one thing about Burgum that I think really appeals to Trump is that he's not doing this for the money or for the fame.\"\n\nWhile Biden has done several interviews and made several campaign appearances since the debate as part of an effort to reassure nervous Democrats, Trump had kept a relatively low profile until Monday's call to Hannity. As one Trump adviser put it Tuesday, campaign officials have been eager to stay out of Biden's way while he racks up rough headlines.\n\nTrump told Hannity that he wants to wait until next week's Republican National Convention to reveal his choice -- sticking to a timeline that has long been his preference.\n\n\"I think probably within the next week,\" Trump said, referring to the running mate rollout. \"I'd love to do it during the convention. My people say that's a little complicated.\"\n\nTrump is enjoying the suspense and \"theatrics\" surrounding his pick and likely weighing how to \"leverage the moment to have the highest impact,\" the

Christ, and you're not going to punch through right now.\"\n\n\"I do take him at his word that he said last night, which he really wants to do it at the convention,\" the source added. \"I think he

Biden has said he has the stamina and mental sharpness to do the job.\n\nTrump also said Harris's record would hurt her electoral chances, the latest sign that he and his Republican allies are starting an all-out assault on Harris to prepare for Biden possibly ending his re-election bid.\n\n\"I don't think Kamala Harris's California socialism is going to go down well with the people of Doral, the people of Miami or the people of Florida. Because in Florida we don't like socialism, we want our freedom,\" Trump said.\n\nThe Biden campaign accused Trump of lying about Harris, and said he was trying to deflect from growing attention paid to Project 2025, a conservative group's controversial plans to remake the presidency should Trump win the Nov. 5 election.\n\n\"Trump's bizarre and unhinged rants won't stop Vice President Harris from defending the Biden-Harris record and prosecuting the case against Donald Trump's extreme record,\" Biden campaign spokesperson Ammar Moussa said.\n\nGOLF CHALLENGE\n\nSeemingly joking, Trump challenged Biden to another debate, saying that it should be \"man to man, no moderators, no holds barred,\" and to 18 holes of golf - a reference to their argument during the debate over who was better at the sport.\n\n\"It will be among the most watched sporting events in history, maybe bigger than the Ryder Cup or even the Masters,\" Trump said, adding that he would give Biden 20 strokes.\n\nThe Biden campaign dismissed Trump's golf challenge as a stunt. They said Biden, who gave a speech at the NATO summit in Washington on Tuesday vowing to defend Ukraine against Russian President Vladimir Putin's invasion, was too busy governing.\n\n\"We'd challenge Donald Trump to stand up to Putin, but he bent the knee to him,\" said campaign spokesperson James Singer.\n\nTrump praised what he called an \"incredible decision\" by the Supreme Court last week determining that he could not be prosecuted for actions within his constitutional powers as president, a landmark decision that could have broad implications for the criminal charges he is facing.\n\nBiden called the ruling \"a dangerous precedent\" because the power of the presidency will no longer be constrained by law.\n\nCalling the prosecutions against him politically motivated, Trump said he had \"great respect for the courage\" shown by the conservative justices who ruled in his favor. \"They have great intellect and great insight, incredible insight,\" he said.\n\nOn Saturday, the former president will travel to Pennsylvania for an afternoon rally in Butler, just outside of Pittsburgh, where the focus will be on any hint - or announcement - about whom he will pick as vice president.\n\nRubio, Ohio Senator J.D. Vance and North Dakota Governor Doug Burgum are seen as the leading contenders to join Trump on the Republican ticket. Trump said this week that he would likely make a decision \"a little before\" or during the Republican Party's national convention, which kicks off on July 15.\n\nCalling out Rubio by name, Trump pointed out the large number of journalists in attendance. \"I think they probably think I'm going to be announcing that Marco is going to be vice president, because that's a lot of press,\" he said.\n\nMeanwhile, a growing number of Democrats in the Congress said they worried that President Joe Biden could not beat Donald Trump in the election, though they emerged from closed-door meetings on Tuesday with no plans for collective action.\n\nA seventh Democrat in the U.S. House of Representatives publicly called on the 81-year-old incumbent to end his wounded reelection campaign, and the first Senate Democrat came forward to say that Biden could not win, though he stopped short of calling on him to drop out.\n\n\"Donald Trump is on track, I think, to win this election and maybe win it by a landslide and take with it the Senate and the House,\" Democratic Senator Michael Bennet said in an interview on CNN. Asked if Biden should end his campaign, he replied, \"This is something for the president to consider.\"\n\nIf Trump wins the White House and Republicans win majorities in both chambers of Congress, he will face few obstacles in pursuit of major policy changes. Democrats already face an uphill battle to protect their 51-49 Senate majority, as they must defend multiple seats in Republican-leaning states.\n\nRepublicans hold a 220-213 majority in the House.\n\nThe party's leaders in the U.S. Senate and House, Chuck Schumer and Hakeem Jeffries, said little about hours of closed-door talks among Democratic lawmakers, who in any event lack the authority to push Biden aside even if they agreed on a course of action.\n\nBiden's halting June 27 debate performance against Trump and low public approval have raised fresh doubts among some Democrats about his ability to win or to keep up with the demands of his grueling job for another 4-1/2 years.\n\nRepresentative Mikie Sherrill became the seventh House Democrat to call on Biden publicly to drop out of the race, saying in a statement, \"The stakes are too high - and the threat is too real - to stay silent.\"\n\nMany more lawmakers have expressed worries that Biden has not done enough in the ensuing days to convince voters that the debate was an aberration, rather than a true reflection of his abilities.\n\nBut the president continues to argue that he is best positioned to defeat former President Trump, 78, whom he casts as a singular threat to American democracy.\n\nSenate Majority Leader Schumer brushed off questions about Biden's fitness, saying three times, \"I'm with Joe,\" during a brief exchange with reporters after Senate Democrats met over lunch to discuss the president's campaign.\n\n\"While President Biden has made clear he feels he is the best candidate to win this election, nothing that has happened over the past twelve days suggests that voters see things the same way,\" Representative Lori Trahan said in a statement on Tuesday.\n\nA Reuters/Ipsos poll last week found that one in three registered Democratic voters believed that Biden should quit the race, with 59% saying he is too old to work in government.\n\nThe poll also found that none of his possible replacements fared better in a matchup against Trump. The poll showed Biden and Trump tied at 40% each.\n\nSWING-STATE SHIFT\n\nWhile national public opinion polls offer a view of candidates' standing, U.S. presidential elections are decided state by state. The nonpartisan Cook Political Report on Tuesday changed its ratings on three of the most competitive states -- Arizona, Georgia and Nevada -- to \"lean Republican\" from \"toss-up,\" citing shifting voter views of Biden following the debate.\n\nBiden delivered a forceful speech to a gathering of NATO leaders in Washington on Tuesday, while Vice President Kamala Harris - seen as the most likely candidate to replace Biden if he were to stand down - campaigned in Nevada.\n\n\"The one thing we know about Joe Biden is he is a fighter. He is the first to say when you get knocked down, you get back up,\" Harris told supporters in Las Vegas.\n\nWhite House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre faced another salvo of questions from reporters about Biden's health on Tuesday. In a statement, the White House physician said Biden was not being treated for any neurological condition and had received a clean bill of health at his most recent physical examination in February.\n\nBiden has secured renewed support from several key constituencies, including from members of the Congressional Black Caucus. Black voters make up a crucial component of the party's base.\n\nSome House Democrats expressed frustration that the party was focused on Biden's shortcomings rather than unifying against Trump, who falsely claims that his 2020 loss was the result of fraud and has not committed to accepting this year's results if he loses.\n\n\"I think the president has decided that the discussion has come to an end and that he is firm in his commitment to run,\" Representative Stephen Lynch said of Biden, adding that the dissidents \"are gonna have to get on board.\"", "source": {"uri": "cyprus-mail.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Cyprus Mail"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Biden_2020_presidential_campaign", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Joe Biden 2020 presidential campaign"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kamala_Harris", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Kamala Harris"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Biden", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marco_Rubio", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Marco Rubio"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Senate", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "United States Senate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Democratic Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republican_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Republican Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golf", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Golf"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miami", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Miami"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Miami"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doral,_Florida", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Doral, Florida"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Doral, Florida"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Socialism", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Socialism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vice_President_of_the_United_States", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Vice President of the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conservatism_in_the_United_States", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Conservatism in the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Florida", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Florida"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Florida"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Attorney_General_of_California", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Attorney General of California"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Florida_Senate", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Florida Senate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Running_mate", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Running mate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vladimir_Putin", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Vladimir Putin"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/California", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "California"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "California"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump_2020_presidential_campaign", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump 2020 presidential campaign"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Landslide_victory", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Landslide victory"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doug_Burgum", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Doug Burgum"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ohio_Senate", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Ohio Senate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/J._D._Vance", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "J.

Marco Rubio, in attendance.\n\nAfter days spent lying low, golfing and letting Democratic infighting play out in public, Trump used his return to the campaign trail in Florida to ratchet up his attacks on both Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris, indulging speculation that she could replace the president as the Democratic nominee this year and alleging, without evidence, that his son Hunter Biden is \"running our government\" and first lady Jill Biden \"is helping.\" Biden has repeatedly insisted he won't withdraw from the race.\n\nTrump rallied his supporters at one of his Miami-area golf courses as the presumptive Republican nominee nears a deadline to announce his running mate. But he appears in no rush, as much of the political world's attention is still centered on questions about Biden's ability to govern for another four-year term. Some Democrats have started calling for Biden to step down as their presumptive nominee following his dismal debate performance last month.\n\nTrump, speaking from the 10th hole of his course, challenged Biden to another debate or even a \"golf-off\" reviving an offbeat argument from their debate. But mostly, he rubbed in how their meetup left Biden's campaign facing a grim prognosis.\n\n\"Our victory was so absolute that Joe's own party now wants him to throw in the towel and surrender the presidency after a single 90-minute performance,\" Trump said Tuesday night. \"They want 'Crooked Joe' out of the race. It's a shame the way they're treating him. But don't feel sorry for him. He's a very bad guy.\"\n\nJames Singer, a spokesperson for Biden's campaign, responded to Trump with a series of challenges, saying in a statement: \"We'd challenge Donald Trump to create jobs, but he lost 3 million. We'd challenge Donald Trump to stand up to Putin, but he bent the knee to him. We'd challenge Donald Trump to follow the law, but he breaks it.\"\n\nSinger also said, \"Joe Biden doesn't have time for Donald Trump's weird antics -- he's busy leading America and defending the free world.\"\n\nTrump laced into Harris with more specifics than usual. She has become a focus of the former president and his allies as speculation has mounted that she would replace Biden as the Democratic nominee. Trump called her \"Laughing Kamala,\" and referred to the \"Biden-Harris administration,\" rather than just pinning actions on Biden as he had for months, and blamed Harris for the White House's immigration policies.\n\n\"Despite all the Democrat panic this week, the truth is, it doesn't matter who they nominate because we are going to beat any one of them in thundering landslides and this November's going to be amazing,\" he said.\n\nTrump, ever the showman, repeatedly played into the speculation that he might elevate Rubio to his ticket.\n\nRubio, a Miami native and one of the contenders for the vice presidential post, was among the Florida politicians who spoke at the event.\n\nAt one point, Trump marveled at the number of reporters in attendance and said, \"I think they probably think I'm going to be announcing that Marco is going to be vice president.\"\n\nLater, when he talked about his pledge to make tips tax-free, he remarked that Rubio \"may or may not be there to vote for it.\"\n\nRubio, the son of Cuban immigrants, is seen as a potential running mate who could help Trump as he tries to secure support from Hispanic Americans, a point the senator emphasized in his remarks as he switched several times in his remarks to Spanish.\n\nThe senator did not openly acknowledge any of the speculation about him joining Trump as a running mate. He instead skewered not only Biden, whom he called \"the figurehead of a left-wing government, shadow government,\" but Harris, whom he would need to debate head-on if he's chosen for Trump's ticket.\n\nRubio referred to Harris not by name at first but called her Biden's \"replacement\" and \"a real-life, verified left-winger.\" At another point in his remarks, he mocked the way Harris laughs.\n\nHe notably seemed to insert himself into Trump's signature \"Make America Great Again\" slogan by saying: \"Together, we're not just going to make it great again. We elect this man as president, we will make together America greater than it has ever been.\"\n\nThousands of people turned out in the humid summer evening for the rally. Attendees were fanning themselves and holding signs featuring Trump's mug shot, along with others that said, \"You're fired!\" -- Trump's signature phrase on his former reality show, \"The Apprentice.\"\n\nTrump's youngest child who recently turned 18, Barron, also made his first-ever appearance at one of his father's rallies. Trump implored his son to stand, with the young man pumping his fist a few times as Trump said, \"Welcome to the scene, Barron.\"\n\nBoth Biden, 81, and Trump, 78, are at least two decades older than most American presidents have been, according to the Pew Research Center, which said the median age for all US presidents on their first inauguration is 55 years old.\n\nBut that has not stopped Trump from arguing he is stronger than Biden, who repeatedly stumbled, paused and could not complete sentences at times during the June 27 debate.", "source": {"uri": "arab.news", "dataType": "news",

Biden has said he has the stamina and mental sharpness to do the job.\n\nTrump also said Harris's record would hurt her electoral chances, the latest sign that he and his Republican allies are starting an all-out assault on Harris to prepare for Biden possibly ending his re-election bid.\n\n\"I don't think Kamala Harris's California socialism is going to go down well with the people of Doral, the people of Miami or the people of Florida. Because in Florida we don't like socialism, we want our freedom,\" Trump said.\n\nThe Biden campaign accused Trump of lying about Harris, and said he was trying to deflect from growing attention paid to Project 2025, a conservative group's controversial plans to remake the presidency should Trump win the Nov 5 election.\n\n\"Trump's bizarre and unhinged rants won't stop Vice President Harris from defending the Biden-Harris record and prosecuting the case against Donald Trump's extreme record,\" Biden campaign spokesperson Ammar Moussa said.\n\nGolf challenge\n\nSeemingly joking, Trump challenged Biden to another debate, saying that it should be \"man to man, no moderators, no holds barred,\" and to 18 holes of golf - a reference to their argument during the debate over who was better at the sport.\n\n\"It will be among the most watched sporting events in history, maybe bigger than the Ryder Cup or even the Masters,\" Trump said, adding that he would give Biden 20 strokes.\n\nThe Biden campaign dismissed Trump's golf challenge as a stunt. They said Biden, who gave a speech at the Nato summit in Washington on Tuesday vowing to defend Ukraine against Russian President Vladimir Putin's invasion, was too busy governing.\n\n\"We'd challenge Donald Trump to stand up to Putin, but he bent the knee to him,\" said campaign spokesperson James Singer.\n\nTrump praised what he called an \"incredible decision\" by the Supreme Court last week determining that he could not be prosecuted for actions within his constitutional powers as president, a landmark decision that could have broad implications for the criminal charges he is facing.\n\nBiden called the ruling \"a dangerous precedent\" because the power of the presidency will no longer be constrained by law.\n\nCalling the prosecutions against him politically motivated, Trump said he had \"great respect for the courage\" shown by the conservative justices who ruled in his favor. \"They have great intellect and great insight, incredible insight,\" he said.\n\nOn Saturday, the former president will travel to Pennsylvania for an afternoon rally in Butler, just outside of Pittsburgh, where the focus will be on any hint - or announcement - about whom he will pick as vice president.\n\nRubio, Ohio Senator J.D. Vance and North Dakota Governor Doug Burgum are seen as the leading contenders to join Trump on the Republican ticket. Trump said this week that he would likely make a decision \"a little before\" or during the Republican Party's national convention, which kicks off on July 15.\n\nCalling out Rubio by name, Trump pointed out the large number of journalists in attendance. \"I think they probably think I'm going to be announcing that Marco is going to be vice president, because that's a lot of press,\" he said.

Marco Rubio, in attendance.\n\nAfter days spent lying low, golfing and letting Democratic infighting play out in public, Trump used his return to the campaign trail in Florida to ratchet up his attacks on both Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris, indulging speculation that she could replace the president as the Democratic nominee this year and alleging, without evidence, that his son Hunter Biden is \"running our government\" and first lady Jill Biden \"is helping.\" Biden has repeatedly insisted he won't withdraw from the race.\n\nTrump rallied his supporters at one of his Miami-area golf courses as the presumptive Republican nominee nears a deadline to announce his running mate. But he appears in no rush, as much of the political world's attention is still centered on questions about Biden's ability to govern for another four-year term. Some Democrats have started calling for Biden to step down as their presumptive nominee following his dismal debate performance last month.\n\nTrump, speaking from the 10th hole of his course, challenged Biden to another debate or even a \"golf-off\" reviving an offbeat argument from their debate. But mostly, he rubbed in how their meetup left Biden's campaign facing a grim prognosis.\n\n\"Our victory was so absolute that Joe's own party now wants him to throw in the towel and surrender the presidency after a single 90-minute performance,\" Trump said Tuesday night. \"They want 'Crooked Joe' out of the race. It's a shame the way they're treating him. But don't feel sorry for him. He's a very bad guy.\"\n\nJames Singer, a spokesperson for Biden's campaign, responded to Trump with a series of challenges, saying in a statement: \"We'd challenge Donald Trump to create jobs, but he lost 3 million. We'd challenge Donald Trump to stand up to Putin, but he bent the knee to him. We'd challenge Donald Trump to follow the law, but he breaks it.\"\n\nSinger also said, \"Joe Biden doesn't have time for Donald Trump's weird antics -- he's busy leading America and defending the free world.\"\n\nTrump laced into Harris with more specifics than usual. She has become a focus of the former president and his allies as speculation has mounted that she would replace Biden as the Democratic nominee. Trump called her \"Laughing Kamala,\" and referred to the \"Biden-Harris administration,\" rather than just pinning actions on Biden as he had for months, and blamed Harris for the White House's immigration policies.\n\n\"Despite all the Democrat panic this week, the truth is, it doesn't matter who they nominate because we are going to beat any one of them in thundering landslides and this November's going to be amazing,\" he said.\n\nTrump, ever the showman, repeatedly played into the speculation that he might elevate Rubio to his ticket.\n\nRubio, a Miami native and one of the contenders for the vice presidential post, was among the Florida politicians who spoke at the event.\n\nAt one point, Trump marveled at the number of reporters in attendance and said, \"I think they probably think I'm going to be announcing that Marco is going to be vice president.\"\n\nLater, when he talked about his pledge to make tips tax-free, he remarked that Rubio \"may or may not be there to vote for it.\"\n\nRubio, the son of Cuban immigrants, is seen as a potential running mate who could help Trump as he tries to secure support from Hispanic Americans, a point the senator emphasized in his remarks as he switched several times in his remarks to Spanish.\n\nThe senator did not openly acknowledge any of the speculation about him joining Trump as a running mate. He instead skewered not only Biden, whom he called \"the figurehead of a left-wing government, shadow government,\" but Harris, whom he would need to debate head-on if he's chosen for Trump's ticket.\n\nRubio referred to Harris not by name at first but called her Biden's \"replacement\" and \"a real-life, verified left-winger.\" At another point in his remarks, he mocked the way Harris laughs.\n\nHe notably seemed to insert himself into Trump's signature \"Make America Great Again\" slogan by saying: \"Together, we're not just going to make it great again. We elect this man as president, we will make together America greater than it has ever been.\"\n\nThousands of people turned out in the humid summer evening for the rally. Attendees were fanning themselves and holding signs featuring Trump's mug shot, along with others that said, \"You're fired!\" -- Trump's signature phrase on his former reality show, \"The Apprentice.\"\n\nTrump's youngest child who recently turned 18, Barron, also made his first-ever appearance at one of his father's rallies. Trump implored his son to stand, with the young man pumping his fist a few times as Trump said, \"Welcome to the scene, Barron.\"\n\nOne attendee, 28-year-old Austin Stiglin, said he traveled from northern Florida to participate in his first Trump rally. He was wearing a star-patterned navy blue jacket and red pants and said he was \"tired of the left telling him to vote left just because I am gay.\"\n\n\"I have a lot more to say than just my sexual orientation,\" Stiglin said. \"I would like to vote for policies that support the United States.\"\n\nNicole Farrell, a 57-year-old immigrant from Trinidad, said she voted for Trump in 2020, \"but I was not a strong supporter like now. I just preferred him over Biden.\"\n\nFarrell said she specifically likes Trump's hardline immigration policies, which include plans for mass raids and the largest deportation operation in U.S. history.\n\n\"I am an immigrant but I came here legally. They need to come here legally,\" Farrell said of migrants coming to the U.S.\n\nBoth Biden, 81, and Trump, 78, are at least two decades older than most American presidents have been, according to the Pew Research Center, which said the median age for all U.S. presidents on their first inauguration is 55 years old. But that has not stopped Trump from arguing he is stronger than Biden, who repeatedly stumbled, paused and could not complete sentences at times during the June 27 debate. Trump was criticized by Democrats for making false statements during the debate about the Jan. 6, 2021, riot at the U.S. Capitol and suggesting immigrants entering the U.S. illegally were taking so-called \"Black jobs\" and \"Hispanic jobs.\"", "source": {"uri": "thenationalherald.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The National Herald"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

So, Trump offered Biden a lifeline.\n\n\"So tonight, I'm officially offering Joe the chance to redeem himself in front of the entire world,\" Trump said. \"So [Sen.] Marco [Rubio, R., Fla.] and [Rep.] Byron [Donalds, R., Fla.] and everybody, here's what we're going to do; you guys can be referees if you like. Let's do another debate this week so that sleepy Joe Biden can prove to everyone all over the world that he has what it takes to be president. But this time it will be man to man. No moderators, no holds barred. Just name the place anytime, anywhere.\"\n\nRubio, reported to be one of the three finalists for Trump's vice-presidential pick, spoke at the rally ahead of Trump's speech. Rubio reportedly was the only VP candidate in Doral.\n\nAt one point, Trump recognized the amount of press at the rally.\n\n\"They're probably expecting me to announce Rubio as vice president,\" Trump said. \"That's a lot of press. Lot of press.\"\n\nLater in the speech, he said Rubio might not be in the Senate to vote for Trump's plan to not tax tips, \"but you'll be involved.\"\n\nTrump is expected to announce his pick before the Republican National Convention kicks off on Monday in Milwaukee.\n\nTrump segued from a second debate to a golf contest against Biden, a topic of debate toward the end of their first debate on June 27.\n\n\"I got my handicap, when I was vice president, down to a 6,\" Biden said at the end of the first debate. \"And by the way, I told you before, I'm happy to play golf if you carry your own bag. Think you can do it?\"\n\nTrump threw down the gauntlet.\n\n\"Sleepy Joe also declared that he wanted to test his skills and stamina against mine on the golf course. Can you believe this? Did you ever see him swing?\" Trump said. \"That's why this evening ...

And I'll bet you he doesn't take the offer.\"\n\nTrump also took aim at Vice President Kamala Harris, saying choosing her as his VP was a \"brilliant decision\" by Biden.\n\n\"Picking Kamala Harris as his vice president was the greatest insurance policy of all time,\" Trump said. \"If Joe had picked someone even half-way competent, they would have bounced him from office years ago.\"\n\nMark Swanson \u2709\n\nMark Swanson, a Newsmax writer and editor, has nearly three decades of experience covering news, culture and politics.", "source": {"uri": "newsmax.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "NewsMax"}, "authors": [{"uri": "mark_swanson@newsmax.com", "name": "Mark Swanson", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Biden", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marco_Rubio", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Marco Rubio"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vice_President_of_the_United_States", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Vice President of the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doral,_Florida", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Doral, Florida"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Doral, Florida"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2020_United_States_presidential_debates", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "2020 United States presidential debates"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2016_United_States_presidential_debates", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "2016 United States presidential debates"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newsmax_TV", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Newsmax TV"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trump_National_Doral_Miami", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Trump National Doral Miami"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republican_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Republican Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golf", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Golf"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atlanta", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Atlanta, Georgia"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Atlanta, Georgia"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vice_president", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Vice president"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Senate", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United States Senate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republican_National_Convention", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Republican National Convention"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Milwaukee", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Milwaukee"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Milwaukee"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newsmax", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Newsmax"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kamala_Harris", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Kamala Harris"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stroke", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Stroke"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disability", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Disability"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ryder_Cup", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Ryder Cup"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Golf", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Golf", "wgt": 9}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Golf", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Golf", "wgt": 9}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Golf/Instruction", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Golf/Instruction", "wgt": 9}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Golf/Tournaments_and_Events", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Golf/Tournaments and Events", "wgt": 9}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Golf/Humor", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Golf/Humor", "wgt": 9}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 98}], "image": "https://www.newsmax.com/CMSPages/GetFile.aspx?guid=2651b681-4d86-46d8-8e27-7f6c253a028f&SiteName=Newsmax&maxsidesize=280", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9717617", "eventUri": "eng-9717617", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-06-27", "textStart": 1709, "textEnd": 1716}], "sentiment": 0.02745098039215677, "wgt": 191, "relevance": 1}

Marco Rubio, in attendance.\n\nAfter days spent lying low, golfing and letting Democratic infighting play out in public, Trump used his return to the campaign trail in Florida to ratchet up his attacks on both Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris, indulging speculation that she could replace the president as the Democratic nominee this year and alleging, without evidence, that his son Hunter Biden is \"running our government\" and first lady Jill Biden \"is helping.\" Biden has repeatedly insisted he won't withdraw from the race.\n\nTrump rallied his supporters at one of his Miami-area golf courses as the presumptive Republican nominee nears a deadline to announce his running mate. But he appears in no rush, as much of the political world's attention is still centered on questions about Biden's ability to govern for another four-year term. Some Democrats have started calling for Biden to step down as their presumptive nominee following his dismal debate performance last month.\n\nTrump, speaking from the 10th hole of his course, challenged Biden to another debate or even a \"golf-off\" reviving an offbeat argument from their debate. But mostly, he rubbed in how their meetup left Biden's campaign facing a grim prognosis.\n\n\"Our victory was so absolute that Joe's own party now wants him to throw in the towel and surrender the presidency after a single 90-minute performance,\" Trump said Tuesday night. \"They want 'Crooked Joe' out of the race. It's a shame the way they're treating him. But don't feel sorry for him. He's a very bad guy.\"\n\nJames Singer, a spokesperson for Biden's campaign, responded to Trump with a series of challenges, saying in a statement: \"We'd challenge Donald Trump to create jobs, but he lost 3 million. We'd challenge Donald Trump to stand up to Putin, but he bent the knee to him. We'd challenge Donald Trump to follow the law, but he breaks it.\"\n\nSinger also said, \"Joe Biden doesn't have time for Donald Trump's weird antics -- he's busy leading America and defending the free world.\"\n\nTrump laced into Harris with more specifics than usual. She has become a focus of the former president and his allies as speculation has mounted that she would replace Biden as the Democratic nominee. Trump called her \"Laughing Kamala,\" and referred to the \"Biden-Harris administration,\" rather than just pinning actions on Biden as he had for months, and blamed Harris for the White House's immigration policies.\n\n\"Despite all the Democrat panic this week, the truth is, it doesn't matter who they nominate because we are going to beat any one of them in thundering landslides and this November's going to be amazing,\" he said.\n\nTrump, ever the showman, repeatedly played into the speculation that he might elevate Rubio to his ticket.\n\nRubio, a Miami native and one of the contenders for the vice presidential post, was among the Florida politicians who spoke at the event.\n\nAt one point, Trump marveled at the number of reporters in attendance and said, \"I think they probably think I'm going to be announcing that Marco is going to be vice president.\"\n\nLater, when he talked about his pledge to make tips tax-free, he remarked that Rubio \"may or may not be there to vote for it.\"\n\nRubio, the son of Cuban immigrants, is seen as a potential running mate who could help Trump as he tries to secure support from Hispanic Americans, a point the senator emphasized in his remarks as he switched several times in his remarks to Spanish.\n\nThe senator did not openly acknowledge any of the speculation about him joining Trump as a running mate. He instead skewered not only Biden, whom he called \"the figurehead of a left-wing government, shadow government,\" but Harris, whom he would need to debate head-on if he's chosen for Trump's ticket.\n\nRubio referred to Harris not by name at first but called her Biden's \"replacement\" and \"a real-life, verified left-winger.\" At another point in his remarks, he mocked the way Harris laughs.\n\nHe notably seemed to insert himself into Trump's signature \"Make America Great Again\" slogan by saying: \"Together, we're not just going to make it great again. We elect this man as president, we will make together America greater than it has ever been.\"\n\nThousands of people turned out in the humid summer evening for the rally. Attendees were fanning themselves and holding signs featuring Trump's mug shot, along with others that said, \"You're fired!\" -- Trump's signature phrase on his former reality show, \"The Apprentice.\"\n\nTrump's youngest child who recently turned 18, Barron, also made his first-ever appearance at one of his father's rallies. Trump implored his son to stand, with the young man pumping his fist a few times as Trump said, \"Welcome to the scene, Barron.\"\n\nBoth Biden, 81, and Trump, 78, are at least two decades older than most American presidents have been, according to the Pew Research Center, which said the median age for all US presidents on their first inauguration is 55 years old.\n\nBut that has not stopped Trump from arguing he is stronger than Biden, who repeatedly stumbled, paused and could not complete sentences at times during the June 27 debate.", "source": {"uri": "thefrontierpost.com", "dataType":

Biden has said he has the stamina and mental sharpness to do the job.\n\nTrump also said Harris's record would hurt her electoral chances, the latest sign that he and his Republican allies are starting an all-out assault on Harris to prepare for Biden possibly ending his re-election bid.\n\n\"I don't think Kamala Harris's California socialism is going to go down well with the people of Doral, the people of Miami or the people of Florida. Because in Florida we don't like socialism, we want our freedom,\" Trump said.\n\nThe Biden campaign accused Trump of lying about Harris, and said he was trying to deflect from growing attention paid to Project 2025, a conservative group's controversial plans to remake the presidency should Trump win the November 5 election.\n\n\"Trump's bizarre and unhinged rants won't stop Vice President Harris from defending the Biden-Harris record and prosecuting the case against Donald Trump's extreme record,\" Biden campaign spokesperson Ammar Moussa said.\n\nSeemingly joking, Trump challenged Biden to another debate, saying that it should be \"man to man, no moderators, no holds barred,\" and to 18 holes of golf - a reference to their argument during the Atlanta debate over who was better at the sport.\n\n\"It will be among the most watched sporting events in history, maybe bigger than the Ryder Cup or even the Masters,\" Trump said, adding that he would give Biden 20 strokes.\n\nThe Biden campaign dismissed Trump's golf challenge as a stunt. They said Biden, who gave a speech at the NATO summit in Washington on Tuesday vowing to defend Ukraine against Russian President Vladimir Putin's invasion, was too busy governing.\n\n\"We'd challenge Donald Trump to stand up to Putin, but he bent the knee to him,\" said campaign spokesperson James Singer.\n\nTrump praised what he called an \"incredible decision\" by the Supreme Court last week determining that he could not be prosecuted for actions within his constitutional powers as president, a landmark decision that could have broad implications for the criminal charges he is facing.\n\nBiden called the ruling \"a dangerous precedent\" because the power of the presidency will no longer be constrained by law.\n\nCalling the prosecutions against him politically motivated, Trump said he had \"great respect for the courage\" shown by the conservative justices who ruled in his favour. \"They have great intellect and great insight, incredible insight,\" he said.\n\nOn Saturday, the former president will travel to Pennsylvania for an afternoon rally in Butler, just outside of Pittsburgh, where the focus will be on any hint - or announcement - about whom he will pick as vice president.\n\nRubio, Ohio Senator J.D.

In a mocking tone, Trump called Biden's choice of Harris, the first Black and woman vice president, his \"one brilliant decision,\" implying that she was so inept that Democrats were reluctant to replace Biden with her on the top of the ticket.\n\nRepublican presidential candidate Donald Trump ratcheted up his attacks on Vice President Kamala Harris at a rally near Miami on Tuesday, trying to discredit her as the Democratic Party tussles over whether President Joe Biden should remain in the race. Speaking at his golf club in Doral, Florida, Trump stayed mum on his planned choice for his running mate, although he name-checked Florida Senator Marco Rubio, who was in attendance and is a leading contender for the role, multiple times.\n\nTaking the stage nearly an hour late on a hot night, Trump blasted the 81-year-old Biden about his shaky debate performance on June 27, which prompted worries about his mental fitness for office and calls from some Democrats for him to step aside. Biden said he had a bad night and that he will not drop out of the presidential race.\n\nIn a mocking tone, Trump called Biden's choice of Harris, the first Black and woman vice president, his \"one brilliant decision,\" implying that she was so inept that Democrats were reluctant to replace Biden with her on the top of the ticket. \"It was an insurance policy, maybe the best insurance policy I've ever seen,\" Trump said. \"If Joe had picked someone even halfway competent, they would have bounced him from office years ago.\"\n\nTrump also accused Harris, a former U.S. Senator and California attorney general, of working with other Democrats on covering up Biden's alleged mental acuity issues. Biden has said he has the stamina and mental sharpness to do the job. Trump also said Harris's record would hurt her electoral chances, the latest sign that he and his Republican allies are starting an all-out assault on Harris to prepare for Biden possibly ending his re-election bid.\n\n\"I don't think Kamala Harris's California socialism is going to go down well with the people of Doral, the people of Miami or the people of Florida. Because in Florida we don't like socialism, we want our freedom,\" Trump said. The Biden campaign accused Trump of lying about Harris, and said he was trying to deflect from growing attention paid to Project 2025, a conservative group's controversial plans to remake the presidency should Trump win the Nov. 5 election.\n\n\"Trump's bizarre and unhinged rants won't stop Vice President Harris from defending the Biden-Harris record and prosecuting the case against Donald Trump's extreme record,\" Biden campaign spokesperson Ammar Moussa said. GOLF CHALLENGE\n\nSeemingly joking, Trump challenged Biden to another debate, saying that it should be \"man to man, no moderators, no holds barred,\" and to 18 holes of golf - a reference to their argument during the debate over who was better at the sport. \"It will be among the most watched sporting events in history, maybe bigger than the Ryder Cup or even the Masters,\" Trump said, adding that he would give Biden 20 strokes.\n\nThe Biden campaign dismissed Trump's golf challenge as a stunt. They said Biden, who gave a speech at the NATO summit in Washington on Tuesday vowing to defend Ukraine against Russian President Vladimir Putin's invasion, was too busy governing. \"We'd challenge Donald Trump to stand up to Putin, but he bent the knee to him,\" said campaign spokesperson James Singer.\n\nTrump praised what he called an \"incredible decision\" by the Supreme Court last week determining that he could not be prosecuted for actions within his constitutional powers as president, a landmark decision that could have broad implications for the criminal charges he is facing. Biden called the ruling \"a dangerous precedent\" because the power of the presidency will no longer be constrained by law.\n\nCalling the prosecutions against him politically motivated, Trump said he had \"great respect for the courage\" shown by the conservative justices who ruled in his favor. \"They have great intellect and great insight, incredible insight,\" he said. On Saturday, the former president will travel to Pennsylvania for an afternoon rally in Butler, just outside of Pittsburgh, where the focus will be on any hint - or announcement - about whom he will pick as vice president.\n\nRubio, Ohio Senator J.D. Vance and North Dakota Governor Doug Burgum are seen as the leading contenders to join Trump on the Republican ticket. Trump said this week that he would likely make a decision \"a little before\" or during the Republican Party's national convention, which kicks off on July 15. Calling out Rubio by name, Trump pointed out the large number of journalists in attendance. \"I think they probably think I'm going to be announcing that Marco is going to be vice president, because that's a lot of press,\" he said.\n\n(This story has not been edited by Devdiscourse staff and is auto-generated from a syndicated feed.)", "source": {"uri": "devdiscourse.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Devdiscourse"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kamala_Harris", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Kamala Harris"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Biden", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Democratic Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vice_President_of_the_United_States", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Vice President of the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republican_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Republican Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golf", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Golf"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miami", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Miami"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Miami"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doral,_Florida", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Doral, Florida"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Doral, Florida"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Biden_2020_presidential_campaign", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Joe Biden 2020 presidential campaign"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Florida_Senate", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Florida Senate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Socialism", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Socialism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Running_mate", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Running mate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Florida", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Florida"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Florida"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Attorney_General_of_California", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Attorney General of California"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marco_Rubio", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Marco Rubio"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Senate", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United States Senate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conservatism_in_the_United_States", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Conservatism in the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vladimir_Putin", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Vladimir Putin"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/California", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "California"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "California"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doug_Burgum", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Doug Burgum"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ohio_Senate", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Ohio Senate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/J._D._Vance", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "J.

Gomez and Matt Dixon and Allan Smith and Jonathan Allen and Jake Traylor\n\nJuly 10, 2024 at 3:18 AM\n\nPresident Joe Biden's poor debate performance has not only thrown Donald Trump's long-anticipated announcement of a vice presidential running mate into a holding pattern.\n\nThe fallout, which has included a relentlessly bad news cycle for Biden, has also provided Trump an opportunity to gut-check perhaps the biggest decision of his bid to return to the White House.\n\nTrump acknowledged as much Monday night. Two weeks after telling reporters that he had made up his mind, the former president told Fox News' Sean Hannity that he was still evaluating his options. Trump indicated that the debate -- and uncertainty about whether Biden will be the Democratic nominee -- had emerged as a last-minute factor in his deliberations.\n\n\"I haven't made a final decision, but I have some ideas as to where we're going,\" Trump said during a telephone interview for Hannity's primetime show. \"And a little bit, you know, we wanted to see what they're doing, to be honest. Because, you know, it might make a difference. I don't know. I'm not sure that it would, but there are those who say Trump's waiting until he finds out what's going to happen with crooked Joe Biden, and we'll see what happens with Biden.\"\n\nTrump's rollout tease continued Tuesday night with a rally in Doral, Florida, where he noticeably aimed sharper insults at Vice President Kamala Harris, who could be his general election opponent if Biden steps aside.\n\nThe location also fueled speculation that Trump was about to select Sen. Marco Rubio -- who along with Sen. JD Vance of Ohio and Gov. Doug Burgum of North Dakota, has emerged as a finalist, and whose political base is in nearby Miami.\n\nRubio addressed the rally audience two hours before Trump took the stage, not long after Trump's campaign sent out a fundraising email suggesting his announcement could come at the event.\n\nIt never did, though Trump playfully alluded to the speculation.\n\n\"I think they probably think I'm going to be announcing that Marco is going to be vice president, because that's a lot of press,\" Trump said at one point.\n\nQuestions about Biden's fitness to serve another four years have dominated the political landscape since his June 27 debate with Trump in Atlanta. Biden, 81, was raspy-voiced and slack-jawed and appeared to lose his train of thought at times during the 90-minute event.\n\nSome Democrats have called for Biden to step aside as the party's presidential nominee, while others have said he must do more to demonstrate that he is capable of beating Trump, 78, in a rematch of the 2020 election. Other conversations have focused on how Biden could be replaced -- and who might replace him. Harris and a crop of Democratic governors have been mentioned as alternatives should Biden drop his re-election bid.\n\nTrump's comments to Hannity hinted that his decision could now be swayed by the possibility of running against a politically weakened Biden or an altogether new Democratic ticket. A running mate who makes sense for a race against Biden and Harris might make less sense in a race against Harris or against someone else who appeals to a particular constituency.\n\nAt his Florida rally, Trump focused on Harris -- whose first name he repeatedly mispronounced -- more than he typically does in campaign speeches, describing her as a left-wing ally of Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., and asserting that she has underperformed as Biden's vice president. Trump also suggested that Biden would remain in the race because Democrats would rather not run with Harris at the top of their ticket.\n\n\"If Joe had picked someone even halfway competent, they would have bounced him from office years ago,\" Trump said. \"But they can't, because she's got to be their second choice.\"\n\nA source close to Trump who has been in touch with him on the selection process said Tuesday that they did not believe the Biden fallout had changed the calculus around who to choose.\n\n\"I just don't think that's part of this, and I certainly have not heard that is the plan,\" said another Republican who has spoken to Trump about the vice presidential selection process. \"I think they have an idea of what they want to do, and are going to stick with that process.\"\n\nMeanwhile, senior Trump adviser Brian Hughes offered the same written reply he has for previous stories about the VP search -- that \"anyone telling you they know who or when President Trump will choose his VP is lying unless that person is named Donald J. Trump.\"\n\nA Republican who is closely tied to Trump world said that Vance, the freshman senator from Ohio, has the best case to make under any scenario the GOP ticket might face.\n\n\"Everything that I've seen and believe is [Democrats] would go with Kamala and a Midwestern governor like Josh Shapiro,\" of Pennsylvania, the source, who requested anonymity to share candid observations, added. \"Somebody like JD actually expands the map and is a backstop to the idea where it flips to Kamala and somebody like Shapiro who can go and reinforce the blue wall. So in that regard, he may be the only one that actually adds something of interest, and given who he is and how he communicates, you could see him just barn-burning states.\"\n\nRubio helps appeal to Latino voters, the source said, but the campaign is feeling confident about its chances in Arizona and Nevada, two swing states with large Hispanic populations.\n\n\"Doug Burgum is, as most say, safe,\" the source continued. \"He doesn't really do anything, doesn't help you, doesn't hurt you. He kind of allows Trump to shine.\"\n\nOthers see that as a selling point for Burgum.\n\nRubio and Vance \"have been more rhetoric than they've been substance,\" said one former senior Trump adviser, who remains close with the former president and has discussed the VP search with him. Burgum, an independently wealthy former tech executive, \"has actually gotten things done as a governor, as an executive, and the one thing about Burgum that I think really appeals to Trump is that he's not doing this for the money or for the fame.\"\n\nWhile Biden has done several interviews and made several campaign appearances since the debate as part of an effort to reassure nervous Democrats, Trump had kept a relatively low profile until Monday's call to Hannity. As one Trump adviser put it Tuesday, campaign officials have been eager to stay out of Biden's way while he racks up rough headlines.\n\nTrump told Hannity that he wants to wait until next week's Republican National Convention to reveal his choice -- sticking to a timeline that has long been his preference.\n\n\"I think probably within the next week,\" Trump said, referring to the running mate rollout. \"I'd love to do it during the convention. My people say that's a little complicated.\"\n\nTrump is enjoying the suspense and \"theatrics\" surrounding his pick and likely weighing how to \"leverage the moment to have the highest impact,\" the source close to Trump world said.\n\n\"It's been hard to anticipate that with all of the craziness happening with Biden that you really can't punch through,\" the source said. \"He could pick Jesus Christ, and you're not going to punch through right now.\"\n\n\"I do take him at his word that he said last night, which he really wants to do it at the convention,\" the source added. \"I think he wants to do it like a WWE walk-out, where there's smoke and a black screen and then the person appears, because that'd be good f---ing TV.\"", "source": {"uri": "aol.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Aol"}, "authors": [{"uri": "allan_smith@aol.com", "name": "Allan Smith", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}, {"uri": "jonathan_allen@aol.com", "name": "Jonathan Allen", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}, {"uri": "matt_dixon@aol.com", "name": "Matt Dixon", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}, {"uri": "jake_traylor@aol.com", "name": "Jake Traylor", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}, {"uri": "henry_j_gomez@aol.com", "name": "Henry J.

Biden has repeatedly insisted he won't withdraw from the race.\n\nTrump rallied his supporters at one of his Miami-area golf courses as the presumptive Republican nominee nears a deadline to announce his running mate. But he appears in no rush, as much of the political world's attention is still centred on questions about Biden's ability to govern for another four-year term. Some Democrats have started calling for Biden to step down as their presumptive nominee following his dismal debate performance last month.\n\nTrump, speaking from the 10th hole of his course, challenged Biden to another debate or even a \"golf-off\", reviving an offbeat argument from their debate. But mostly, he rubbed in how their meetup left Biden's campaign facing a grim prognosis.\n\n\"Our victory was so absolute that Joe's own party now wants him to throw in the towel and surrender the presidency after a single 90-minute performance,\" Trump said Tuesday night. \"They want 'Crooked Joe' out of the race. It's a shame the way they're treating him. But don't feel sorry for him. He's a very bad guy.\"\n\nJames Singer, a spokesperson for Biden's campaign, responded to Trump with a series of challenges, saying in a statement: \"We'd challenge Donald Trump to create jobs, but he lost 3 million. We'd challenge Donald Trump to stand up to Putin, but he bent the knee to him. We'd challenge Donald Trump to follow the law, but he breaks it.\"\n\nSinger also said, \"Joe Biden doesn't have time for Donald Trump's weird antics -- he's busy leading America and defending the free world.\"\n\nTrump laced into Harris with more specifics than usual. She has become a focus of the former president and his allies as speculation has mounted that she would replace Biden as the Democratic nominee. Trump called her \"Laughing Kamala\", and referred to the \"Biden-Harris administration\", rather than just pinning actions on Biden as he had for months, and blamed Harris for the White House's immigration policies.\n\n\"Despite all the Democrat panic this week, the truth is, it doesn't matter who they nominate because we are going to beat any one of them in thundering landslides and this November's going to be amazing,\" he said.\n\nTrump, ever the showman, repeatedly played into the speculation that he might elevate Rubio to his ticket.\n\nRubio, a Miami native and one of the contenders for the vice presidential post, was among the Florida politicians who spoke at the event.\n\nAt one point, Trump marvelled at the number of reporters in attendance and said, \"I think they probably think I'm going to be announcing that Marco is going to be vice president.\"\n\nLater, when he talked about his pledge to make tips tax-free, he remarked that Rubio \"may or may not be there to vote for it.\"\n\nRubio, the son of Cuban immigrants, is seen as a potential running mate who could help Trump as he tries to secure support from Hispanic Americans, a point the senator emphasised in his remarks as he switched several times in his remarks to Spanish.\n\nThe senator did not openly acknowledge any of the speculation about him joining Trump as a running mate. He instead skewered not only Biden, whom he called \"the figurehead of a left-wing government, shadow government,\" but Harris, whom he would need to debate head-on if he's chosen for Trump's ticket.\n\nRubio referred to Harris not by name at first but called her Biden's \"replacement\" and \"a real-life, verified left-winger.\" At another point in his remarks, he mocked the way Harris laughs.\n\nHe notably seemed to insert himself into Trump's signature \"Make America Great Again\" slogan by saying: \"Together, we're not just going to make it great again. We elect this man as president, we will make America greater together than it has ever been.\"\n\nThousands of people turned out in the humid summer evening for the rally. Attendees were fanning themselves and holding signs featuring Trump's mug shot, along with others that said, \"You're fired!\" -- Trump's signature phrase on his former reality show, \"The Apprentice.\"\n\nTrump's youngest child who recently turned 18, Barron, also made his first-ever appearance at one of his father's rallies. Trump implored his son to stand, with the young man pumping his fist a few times as Trump said, \"Welcome to the scene, Barron.\"\n\nOne attendee, 28-year-old Austin Stiglin, said he travelled from northern Florida to participate in his first Trump rally. He was wearing a star-patterned navy blue jacket and red pants and said he was \"tired of the left telling him to vote left just because I am gay.\"\n\n\"I have a lot more to say than just my sexual orientation,\" Stiglin said. \"I would like to vote for policies that support the United States.\"\n\nNicole Farrell, a 57-year-old immigrant from Trinidad, said she voted for Trump in 2020, \"but I was not a strong supporter like now. I just preferred him over Biden.\"\n\nFarrell said she specifically likes Trump's hardline immigration policies, which include plans for mass raids and the largest deportation operation in US history.\n\n\"I am an immigrant, but I came here legally. They need to come here legally,\" Farrell said of migrants coming to the US.\n\nBoth Biden, 81, and Trump, 78, are at least two decades older than most American presidents have been, according to the Pew Research Center, which said the median age for all US presidents on their first inauguration is 55 years old. But that has not stopped Trump from arguing he is stronger than Biden, who repeatedly stumbled, paused and could not complete sentences at times during the June 27 debate.\n\nTrump was criticised by Democrats for making false statements during the debate about the January 6, 2021, riot at the US Capitol and suggesting immigrants entering the US illegally were taking so-called \"Black jobs\" and \"Hispanic jobs\".", "source": {"uri": "indiatoday.in", "dataType": "news", "title": "India Today"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kamala_Harris", "type": "person",

so-called \"Black jobs\" and \"Hispanic jobs.\"", "source": {"uri": "firstcoastnews.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "WTLV 12 - Jacksonville"}, "authors": [{"uri": "assets@firstcoastnews.com",

'Where is Barron? Stand up. Look at him! ... You're pretty popular. He may be more popular than Don and Eric. We gotta talk about this. Hey, Don, we've gotta talk about this huh?'\n\nThe 78-year-old ex-president said 'welcome to the scene, Barron,' and cracked that his youngest son 'had such a nice, easy life - now it's a little bit changed,' earning raucous cheers.\n\nBut Trump led the rally with a new challenge for President Joe Biden, 81, whose reelection campaign has been imperiled by his poor debate performance late last month.\n\nThe ex-president first said he wanted to debate Biden again - 'next week' - which would coincide with the Republican National Convention. Biden is due to debate Trump a second time already, but on September 10.\n\nTrump also said he wanted to play Biden in a game of golf - and staked $1 million on the deal.\n\n'I'm also officially challenging Crooked Joe to an 18-hole golf match right here. On Doral's Blue Monster considered one of the greatest tournament golf courses anywhere in the world,' Trump said. 'It will be among the most-watched sporting events in history.'\n\nTrump said it could be bigger than the Ryder Cup or the Masters.\n\n'I will even give Joe Biden 10 strokes aside, 10 strokes, that's a lot. That means 20 strokes in case you don't play golf,' he continued.\n\n'And if he wins I will give the charity of his choice - any charity that he wants - 10 million dollars,' the ex-president added. 'And I bet he doesn't take the offer.'\n\nThe Biden campaign quickly clapped back, calling Trump's rally 'deranged.'\n\n'Joe Biden doesn't have time for Donald Trump's weird antics - he's busy leading America and defending the free world,' said campaign spokesperson James Singer.\n\nSinger noted that Trump's rally consisted of the ex-president 'inviting fictional serial killers to dinner, teasing lil' Marco Rubio, praising Project 2025 architect Tom Homan, and challenging the President of the United States to golf.'\n\n'Donald Trump is a liar, a convict, and a fraud only out for himself - par for the course.'\n\nTrump has stayed off the campaign trail for 11 days - holding his last rally in Chesapeake, Virginia the day after Biden's debate - allowing the Democratic president's campaign to implode as he stayed uncharacteristically quiet.\n\nThe ex-president was seen at Fourth of July festivities.\n\nAt the rally, Trump came aimed with a number of insults for his rival Tuesday night, surrounded by supporters and family members.\n\nHe boasted about his debate win.\n\n'Our victory was so absolute that Joe's own party wants him to throw in the towel and surrender the presidency after a single 90-minute performance. They want Crooked Joe out of the race,' Trump said.\n\nAnd he relished the Democrats being in disarray.\n\n'The radical left Democrat Party is divided, in chaos and having a full-scale breakdown because they can't decide which of their candidates is more unfit to be president. Sleepy Joe Biden or Laughing Kamala,' Trump said.\n\nThe ex-president pointed to a report that said Biden's peak hours are 10 a.m. to 4 p.m., ridiculing him for being a 'part time president.'\n\nAt another, he mocked Biden and claimed the president had bad plastic surgery.\n\n'Outside of his really bad hair, he was sort of a good looking guy at the time. Getting a face lift did not help him,' Trump said. 'He tried it three or four times. Didn't work. ... You know what took him so long to get into the race? The face lift didn't work.'\n\nDonald Trump Jr. was among those to warm up the crowd, noting how Democrats don't want Americans to own an AR-15, 'but they gave a vegetable the nuclear codes.'\n\nTrump Jr. was joined by his ex-wive Vanessa and three children - and his current fiance Kimberly Guilfoyle.\n\nEric Trump was also on hand.\n\nAlso there - one of Trump's top veepstakes candidates: Florida Sen. Marco Rubio, a former 2016 rival.\n\nThroughout the night, Trump teased Rubio, seated front row.\n\n'I think they probably think I'm going to be announcing that Marco's going to be vice president,' the presumptive Republican nominee said.\n\nTrump trashed talked Vice President Kamala Harris and floated that Biden had put her in the position as an 'insurance policy.'\n\n'Maybe the best insurance policy I've ever seen, Marco,' Trump said. 'If Joe had picked someone at least halfway competent they would have bounced him for office years ago, but they can't because - she's gotta be, their second choice, has no chance.'\n\nAs the ex-president talked about his proposal to eliminate tax from tips - to shore up support from service industry workers, especially in swing states like Nevada, Trump stoked VP speculation again.\n\n'Marco you're going to vote for it, I hope. Well, you may or may not be there to vote for it. But you'll be involved,' Trump said, a nod to Rubio no longer being in the Senate.\n\nVice presidents, however, can cast a tie-breaking Senate vote.\n\nTrump is expected to announce his vice presidential pick within days.\n\nAlso on the list are North Dakota Gov. Doug Burgum, Sen. Tim Scott and Sen. J.D.

Because in Florida, we don't like socialism, we want our freedom,\" Trump said.\n\nThe Biden campaign accused Trump of lying about Harris, and said he was trying to deflect from the growing attention on Project 2025, a conservative group's controversial plans to remake the presidency should Trump win the Nov 5 election.\n\nBiden campaign spokesman Ammar Moussa said: \"Trump's bizarre and unhinged rants won't stop Vice-President Harris from defending the Biden-Harris record and prosecuting the case against Donald Trump's extreme record.\"\n\nSeemingly joking, Trump challenged Biden to another debate, saying it should be \"man to man, no moderators, no holds barred\", and to 18 holes of golf - a reference to their argument during the debate over who was better at the sport.\n\n\"It will be among the most watched sporting events in history, maybe bigger than the Ryder Cup or even the Masters,\" Trump said, adding that he would give Biden 20 strokes.\n\nThe Biden campaign dismissed Trump's golf challenge as a stunt. It said Biden, who gave a speech at the NATO summit in Washington on July 9 vowing to defend Ukraine against Russian President Vladimir Putin's invasion, was too busy governing.\n\nCampaign spokesman James Singer said: \"We'd challenge Donald Trump to stand up to Putin, but he bent the knee to him.\"\n\nTrump praised what he called an \"incredible decision\" by the Supreme Court last week determining that he could not be prosecuted for actions within his constitutional powers as president, a landmark decision that could have broad implications for the criminal charges he is facing.\n\nBiden called the ruling \"a dangerous precedent\" because the power of the presidency will no longer be constrained by law.\n\nCalling the prosecutions against him politically motivated, Trump said he had \"great respect for the courage\" shown by the conservative justices who ruled in his favor. \"They have great intellect and great insight, incredible insight,\" he said.\n\nOn July 13, the former president will travel to Pennsylvania for an afternoon rally in Butler, just outside of Pittsburgh, where the focus will be on any hint - or announcement - about whom he will pick as vice-president.\n\nRubio, Ohio Senator J.D. Vance and North Dakota Governor Doug Burgum are seen as the leading contenders to join Trump on the Republican ticket.\n\nTrump said this week that he would likely make a decision \"a little before\" or during the Republican Party's national convention, which kicks off on July 15.\n\nCalling out Rubio by name, Trump pointed out the large number of journalists in attendance.\n\n\"I think they probably think I'm going to be announcing that Marco is going to be vice-president, because that's a lot of press,\" he said.", "source": {"uri": "tasnimnews.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "\u062e\u0628\u0631\u06af\u0632\u0627\u0631\u06cc \u062a\u0633\u0646\u06cc\u0645"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kamala_Harris", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Kamala Harris"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Biden", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Democratic Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vice_President_of_the_United_States", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Vice President of the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republican_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Republican Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golf", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Golf"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miami", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Miami"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Miami"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doral,_Florida", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Doral, Florida"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Doral, Florida"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Biden_2020_presidential_campaign", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Joe Biden 2020 presidential campaign"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Florida_Senate", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Florida Senate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Socialism", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Socialism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Running_mate", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Running mate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/California", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "California"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "California"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Florida", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Florida"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Florida"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tehran", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Tehran"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Tehran"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Iran"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Attorney_general", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Attorney general"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marco_Rubio", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Marco Rubio"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Senate", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United States Senate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conservatism", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Conservatism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vladimir_Putin", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Vladimir Putin"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doug_Burgum", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Doug Burgum"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ohio_Senate", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Ohio Senate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/J._D._Vance", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "J.

Two weeks after he told reporters that he had made up his mind, he told Fox News' Sean Hannity that he was still evaluating his options. Trump indicated that the debate -- and uncertainty about whether Biden will be the Democratic nominee -- had emerged as a last-minute factor in his deliberations.\n\n\"I haven't made a final decision, but I have some ideas as to where we're going,\" Trump said in a telephone interview for Hannity's prime-time show. \"And a little bit, you know, we wanted to see what they're doing, to be honest. Because, you know, it might make a difference. I don't know. I'm not sure that it would, but there are those who say Trump's waiting until he finds out what's going to happen with crooked Joe Biden, and we'll see what happens with Biden.\"\n\nTrump's rollout tease continued Tuesday night with a rally in Doral, Florida, where he noticeably aimed sharper insults at Vice President Kamala Harris, who could be his general election opponent if Biden steps aside.\n\nThe location also fueled speculation that Trump was about to select Sen. Marco Rubio, who -- like Sen. JD Vance of Ohio and North Dakota Gov. Doug Burgum -- has emerged as a finalist and whose political base is in nearby Miami.\n\nRubio addressed the rally audience two hours before Trump took the stage, not long after Trump's campaign sent out a fundraising email suggesting his announcement could come at the event.\n\nIt never did, though Trump playfully alluded to the speculation.\n\n\"I think they probably think I'm going to be announcing that Marco is going to be vice president, because that's a lot of press,\" Trump said at one point.\n\nQuestions about Biden's fitness to serve another four years have dominated the political landscape since his June 27 debate with Trump in Atlanta. Biden, 81, was raspy-voiced and slack-jawed and appeared to lose his train of thought at times during the 90-minute event.\n\nSome Democrats have called for Biden to step aside as the party's presidential nominee, while others have said he must do more to demonstrate that he is capable of beating Trump, 78, in a rematch of the 2020 election. Other conversations have focused on how Biden could be replaced -- and who might replace him. Harris and a crop of Democratic governors have been mentioned as alternatives should Biden drop his re-election bid.\n\nTrump's comments to Hannity hinted that his decision could now be swayed by the possibility of running against a politically weakened Biden or an altogether new Democratic ticket. A running mate who makes sense for a race against Biden and Harris might make less sense in a race against Harris or against someone else who appeals to a particular constituency.\n\nAt his Florida rally, Trump focused on Harris -- whose first name he repeatedly mispronounced -- more than he typically does in campaign speeches, describing her as a left-wing ally of Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., and asserting that she has underperformed as Biden's vice president. Trump also suggested that Biden would remain in the race because Democrats would rather not run with Harris at the top of their ticket.\n\n\"If Joe had picked someone even halfway competent, they would have bounced him from office years ago,\" Trump said. \"But they can't, because she's got to be their second choice.\"\n\nA source close to Trump who has been in touch with him about the selection process did not believe the Biden fallout had changed the calculus around who to choose, the source said Tuesday.\n\nAnother Republican who has spoken to Trump about the vice presidential selection process said: \"I just don't think that's part of this, and I certainly have not heard that is the plan. I think they have an idea of what they want to do and are going to stick with that process.\"\n\nMeanwhile, senior Trump adviser Brian Hughes offered the same written reply he has for previous stories about the running mate search -- that \"anyone telling you they know who or when President Trump will choose his VP is lying unless that person is named Donald J. Trump.\"\n\nA Republican who is closely tied to Trump world said Vance, the freshman senator from Ohio, has the best case to make under any scenario the GOP ticket might face.\n\n\"Everything that I've seen and believe is [Democrats] would go with Kamala and a Midwestern governor like Josh Shapiro\" of Pennsylvania, said the source, who was granted anonymity to share candid observations. \"Somebody like JD actually expands the map and is a backstop to the idea where it flips to Kamala and somebody like Shapiro who can go and reinforce the blue wall. So in that regard, he may be the only one that actually adds something of interest, and given who he is and how he communicates, you could see him just barn-burning states.\"\n\nRubio helps appeal to Latino voters, the source said, but the campaign feels confident about its chances in Arizona and Nevada, swing states with large Hispanic populations.\n\n\"Doug Burgum is, as most say, safe,\" the source said. \"He doesn't really do anything, doesn't help you, doesn't hurt you. He kind of allows Trump to shine.\"\n\nOthers see that as a selling point for Burgum.\n\nRubio and Vance \"have been more rhetoric than they've been substance,\" said a former senior Trump adviser, who remains close with him and has discussed the running mate search with him. Burgum, an independently wealthy former tech executive, \"has actually gotten things done as a governor, as an executive, and the one thing about Burgum that I think really appeals to Trump is that he's not doing this for the money or for the fame.\"\n\nWhile Biden has done several interviews and made several campaign appearances since the debate as part of an effort to reassure nervous Democrats, Trump had kept a relatively low profile until Monday's call to Hannity. As a Trump adviser put it Tuesday, campaign officials have been eager to stay out of Biden's way while he racks up rough headlines.\n\nTrump told Hannity that he wants to wait until next week's Republican National Convention to reveal his choice -- sticking to a timeline that has long been his preference.\n\n\"I think probably within the next week,\" Trump said, referring to the running mate rollout. \"I'd love to do it during the convention. My people say that's a little complicated.\"\n\nTrump is enjoying the suspense and \"theatrics\" surrounding his pick and is most likely weighing how to \"leverage the moment to have the highest impact,\" the source close to Trump world said.\n\n\"It's been hard to anticipate that with all of the craziness happening with Biden that you really can't punch through,\" the source said. \"He could pick Jesus Christ, and you're not going to punch through right now.\n\n\"I do take him at his word that he said last night, which he really wants to do it at the convention,\" the source added. \"I think he wants to do it like a WWE walk-out, where there's smoke and a black screen and then the person appears, because that'd be good f---ing TV.\"", "source": {"uri": "yahoo.com", "dataType":

Because in Florida we don't like socialism, we want our freedom,\" Trump said.\n\nThe Biden campaign accused Trump of lying about Harris, and said he was trying to deflect from growing attention paid to Project 2025, a conservative group's controversial plans to remake the presidency should Trump win the Nov. 5 election.\n\n\"Trump's bizarre and unhinged rants won\u00b4t stop Vice President Harris from defending the Biden-Harris record and prosecuting the case against Donald Trump\u00b4s extreme record,\" Biden campaign spokesperson Ammar Moussa said.\n\nGOLF CHALLENGE\n\nSeemingly joking, Trump challenged Biden to another debate, saying that it should be \"man to man, no moderators, no holds barred,\" and to 18 holes of golf - a reference to their argument during the debate over who was better at the sport.\n\n\"It will be among the most watched sporting events in history, maybe bigger than the Ryder Cup or even the Masters,\" Trump said, adding that he would give Biden 20 strokes.\n\nThe Biden campaign dismissed Trump's golf challenge as a stunt. They said Biden, who gave a speech at the NATO summit in Washington on Tuesday vowing to defend Ukraine against Russian President Vladimir Putin's invasion, was too busy governing.\n\n\"We'd challenge Donald Trump to stand up to Putin, but he bent the knee to him,\" said campaign spokesperson James Singer.\n\nTrump praised what he called an \"incredible decision\" by the Supreme Court last week determining that he could not be prosecuted for actions within his constitutional powers as president, a landmark decision that could have broad implications for the criminal charges he is facing.\n\nBiden called the ruling \"a dangerous precedent\" because the power of the presidency will no longer be constrained by law.\n\nCalling the prosecutions against him politically motivated, Trump said he had \"great respect for the courage\" shown by the conservative justices who ruled in his favor. \"They have great intellect and great insight, incredible insight,\" he said.\n\nOn Saturday, the former president will travel to Pennsylvania for an afternoon rally in Butler, just outside of Pittsburgh, where the focus will be on any hint - or announcement - about whom he will pick as vice president.\n\nRubio, Ohio Senator J.D. Vance and North Dakota Governor Doug Burgum are seen as the leading contenders to join Trump on the Republican ticket. Trump said this week that he would likely make a decision \"a little before\" or during the Republican Party's national convention, which kicks off on July 15.\n\nCalling out Rubio by name, Trump pointed out the large number of journalists in attendance. \"I think they probably think I'm going to be announcing that Marco is going to be vice president, because that's a lot of press,\" he said.

I will give him 10 strokes a side and if he wins, I will give the charity of his choice, any charity that he wants, $1 million.\"\n\nA day after the debate with Biden, Trump performed somewhat of a victory lap in Chesapeake, Virginia, where he piled in on the president, deriding him as \"grossly incompetent\" and a \"train wreck.\"\n\n\"The question every voter should be asking themselves today is not whether Joe Biden can survive a 90-minute debate performance, but whether America can survive four more years of crooked Joe Biden the White House,\" Trump said from Virginia on June 28.\n\n\"In fact, I don't know if we can really survive five more months.\"\n\nIndeed, the president has faced multiple calls, both publicly and privately from senior members of his own party, while the eyes of the world are on him during this week's NATO summit in Washington DC.\n\nA new poll shows Vice President Kamala Harris now has a better shot than Biden at defeating Trump in the 2024 election. The survey, conducted by the Democratic firm Bendixen & Amandi, showed Biden slightly behind Trump, 42 to 43 percent, with Harris inching past the former president 42 to 41 percent.\n\nTrump is expected to name his pick for vice president shortly, with just one week to go before the Republican National Convention on July 14.\n\nOhio Senator JD Vance and Florida Senator Marco Rubio are leading contenders to join Trump on the Republican ticket, people familiar with the matter have told Reuters, with North Dakota Governor Doug Burgum also still in the mix.\n\nRemarking on the amount of press attending his rally in Florida, Trump speculated that it was only due to the anticipation surrounding his choice for vice president.\n\n\"I think they probably think I'm going to be announcing that Marco [Rubio] is going to be vice president because that's a lot of press.

A friendly round of golf? It's all on the table, Trump said at a rally Tuesday night.\n\nDonald Trump, apparently feeling quite confident after his debate showing against President Joe BIden late last month, on Tuesday offered the likely Democratic nominee the opportunity to \"redeem himself in front of the entire world\" via a follow-up debate at some point this week, while also challenging Biden to a round of golf.\n\nAt a rally in Doral, Florida, alongside potential running mates Sen. Marco Rubio (R-FL) and Rep. Byron Donalds (R-FL), Trump opened by seeking to capitalize on the disagreements among Democrats regarding Biden's candidacy, which has been under the microscope since his poor debate performance on June 27.\n\n\"Our victory was so absolute that Joe's own party now wants him to throw in the towel and surrender the presidency after a single 90-minute performance. They want 'Crooked Joe' out of the race. It's a shame the way they're treating him,\" Trump said, before telling his audience not to pity him because \"he's a very bad guy.\"\n\n\"So tonight, I'm officially offering Joe the chance to redeem himself in front of the entire world ... Let's do another debate this week so that sleepy Joe Biden can prove to everyone all over the world that he has what it takes to be president,\" Trump proposed.\n\nThis rematch, however, would not be moderated, Trump said.\n\n\"It will be man to man. No moderators, no holds barred. Just name the place. Anytime, anywhere.\"\n\nTrump's second challenge for Biden was also rooted in a debate moment: when the pair insisted on bragging about their respective golf skills.\n\nAfter mocking his successor's swing, Trump said he was also challenging Biden to an 18-hole match at his golf resort in Doral, where he was currently speaking.\n\n\"It will be among the most-watched sporting events in history -- maybe bigger than the Ryder Cup or even The Masters,\" he predicted, adding that he would allow Biden a ten-shot advantage for the front and back nine.\n\nTrump then offered to put money on the line.\n\n\"If he wins, I will give the charity of his choice -- any charity that he wants -- $1 million. And I will bet you he does not take the offer, because he's all talk,\" said Trump, who illegally misused charity money at the Trump Foundation and was forced by a judge to pay a $2 million fine for doing so. (One such payment that came out of the foundation, which no longer exists, was golf-related: $158,000 to resolve a lawsuit over a prize for a hole-in-one contest at a course that Trump owned.)\n\nThe Biden campaign quickly dismissed Trump's offer.\n\n\"Donald Trump hasn't been seen in public for 12 days, now he's inviting fictional serial killers to dinner, teasing lil' Marco Rubio, praising Project 2025 architect Tom Homan, and challenging the President of the United States to golf,\" it said in a statement.\n\n\"We'd challenge Donald Trump to create jobs, but he lost 3 million. We'd challenge Donald Trump to stand up to Putin, but he bent the knee to him. We'd challenge Donald Trump to follow the law, but he breaks it. We'd challenge Donald Trump to not destroy our country, but that's all his Project 2025 aims to do,\" the campaign added.\n\n\"Joe Biden doesn't have time for Donald Trump's weird antics -- he's busy leading America and defending the free world. Donald Trump is a liar, a convict, and a fraud only out for himself -- par for the course.\"", "source": {"uri": "thedailybeast.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Daily Beast"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Biden", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golf", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Golf"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Democratic Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Byron_Donalds", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Byron Donalds"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marco_Rubio", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Marco Rubio"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Running_mate", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Running mate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doral,_Florida", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Doral, Florida"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Doral, Florida"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swing_(politics)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Swing (politics)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ryder_Cup", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Ryder Cup"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Biden_2020_presidential_campaign", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Joe Biden 2020 presidential campaign"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thomas_Homan", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Thomas Homan"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Masters_Tournament", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Masters Tournament"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serial_killer", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Serial killer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coming_out", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Coming out"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fraud", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Fraud"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lawsuit", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Lawsuit"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vladimir_Putin", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Vladimir Putin"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_J._Trump_Foundation", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Donald J.

Both will be closely watched for any hint - or announcement - about whom Trump will pick for the vice president role.\n\nOhio Senator J.D. Vance and Florida Senator Marco Rubio are leading contenders to join Trump on the Republican ticket, people familiar with the matter have told Reuters, with North Dakota Governor Doug Burgum also still in the mix.\n\nThe decision will come at a moment of turmoil for Democrats following 81-year-old President Joe Biden's disastrous debate against Trump on June 27, which has prompted growing calls within his party for him to step aside for a younger nominee.\n\nIn an interview with Fox News host Sean Hannity on Monday evening, Trump was asked whether Rubio, Vance and Burgum as well as South Carolina Senator Tim Scott were on his short list.\n\n\"The names that you mentioned, absolutely they're under consideration,\" Trump responded, adding that he wanted to see how the confusion gripping the Democratic Party plays out \"because, you know, it might make a difference.\"\n\nTrump said he would likely make a decision \"a little before\" or during the Republican Party's national convention, which kicks off on July 15.\n\nTrump will use the Doral rally to blame Biden for inflation and slam his immigration policies, in part by highlighting cases of migrants who entered the country illegally and committed violent crimes, according to a Trump campaign release.\n\nFord O'Connell, a Republican operative in Florida, said Trump will likely let disarray in the Democratic Party and pressure on Biden dominate the media coverage rather than divert attention at Doral by announcing whom he wants to be vice president.\n\n\"If you are Trump, it doesn't get much better than this. And the key is to just keep talking inflation, closing the border, crime and instability abroad,\" said O'Connell, who worked with Trump during the 2020 campaign.\n\nOn Saturday, Trump will travel to Pennsylvania for an afternoon rally in Butler, just outside of Pittsburgh.

Miami-Dade County is under a heat advisory.\n\nMIAMI (AP) -- After largely ceding the spotlight to the mounting turmoil surrounding President Joe Biden 's campaign in the wake of their debate, former President Donald Trump returns to the campaign trail Tuesday after days of laying low, golfing and letting Democratic infighting play out in public.\n\nTrump is set to rally his voters at one of his Miami-area golf courses as he nears a deadline to announce his running mate. But he appears in no rush as much of the attention is still centered on questions about Biden's ability to govern for another four-year term. Some Democrats have started calling for Biden to step down as their presumptive nominee following his dismal debate performance last month.\n\nBoth Biden, 81, and Trump, 78, are at least two decades older than most American presidents have been, according to the Pew Research Center, which said the median age for all U.S. presidents on their first inauguration is 55 years old. But that has not stopped Trump from arguing he is stronger than Biden, who repeatedly stumbled, paused and could not complete sentences at times during the June 27 debate. Trump was criticized by Democrats for making false statements during the debate about the Jan. 6, 2021, riot at the U.S. Capitol and suggesting immigrants entering the U.S. illegally were taking so-called \"Black jobs\" and \"Hispanic jobs.\"\n\nIn an interview Monday with Fox News Channel's Sean Hannity, Trump said he thought Biden \"might very well stay in\" the race. \"Nobody to wants to give that up that way,\" Trump added. \"He is going to feel badly about himself for a long time. It's hard to give it up that way, the way where they're trying to force him out.\"\n\nIn the Miami suburb of Doral, Trump is expected to underscore his strong support in a former battleground state that has now shifted toward the GOP. U.S. Sen. Marco Rubio, a Miami native and one of the contenders for the vice presidential post, was among the Florida politicians who spoke at the event.\n\nRubio, the son of Cuban immigrants, is seen as a potential running mate who could help Trump as he tries to secure support from Hispanic Americans, a point the senator emphasized in his remarks as he switched several times in his remarks to Spanish.\n\nThe senator did not openly acknowledge any of the speculation about him joining Trump as a running mate. He instead skewered not only Biden, whom he called \"the figurehead of a left-wing government, shadow government,\" but Vice President Kamala Harris, whom he would need to debate head-on if he's chosen for Trump's ticket.\n\nRubio referred to Harris not by name at first but called her Biden's \"replacement\" and \"a real-life, verified left-winger.\" At another point in his remarks, he mocked the way Harris laughs.\n\nHe notably seemed to insert himself into Trump's signature \"Make America Great Again\" slogan by saying: \"Together, we're not just going to make it great again. We elect this man as president, we will make together America greater than it has ever been.\"\n\nKevin Cabrera, a Miami-Dade County commissioner who was Florida state director for Trump's 2020 reelection campaign, spoke at the rally, saying ahead of the event that it would be an \"overwhelming show of unity.\"\n\n\"The rally will display our unified front, showcasing a stark contrast to the Democrats, who are lost and fighting with each other over Biden's health and ability to continue,\" Cabrera said.\n\nThousands of people turned out in the humid summer evening for the rally. Attendees were fanning themselves and holding signs featuring Trump's mug shot, along with others that said, \"You're fired!\" -- Trump's signature phrase on his former reality show, \"The Apprentice.\"\n\nOne man, 28-year-old Austin Stiglin, said he traveled from northern Florida to participate in his first Trump rally. He was wearing a star-patterned navy blue jacket and red pants and said he was \"tired of the left telling him to vote left just because I am gay.\"\n\n\"I have a lot more to say than just my sexual orientation,\" Stiglin said. \"I would like to vote for policies that support the United States.\"\n\nNicole Farrell, a 57-year-old immigrant from Trinidad, said she voted for Trump in 2020, \"but I was not a strong supporter like now. I just preferred him over Biden.\"\n\nFarrell said she specifically likes Trump's hardline immigration policies, which include plans for mass raids and the largest deportation operation in U.S. history.\n\n\"I am an immigrant but I came here legally. They need to come here legally,\" Farrell said of migrants coming to the U.S.\n\nThe presumptive GOP nominee is expected in his remarks to touch on Biden's handling of immigration and the economy, highlighting the rise in home prices and goods. Trump will also talk about how Florida is affected by the increasing arrivals of immigrants as the final destination for many people illegally crossing the U.S.-Mexico border.\n\nThe leadership crisis among Democrats has perhaps given Trump a reason to wait for his VP announcement so as to not draw attention away from Biden's woes. Senior advisers and key allies say they still don't know whom Trump will choose as his running mate, and many believe the choice is still in flux.\n\nSpeaking on MSNBC Monday, Biden criticized Trump for not having held events since the debate and suggested he had been \"riding around in his golf cart.\"\n\nPrice reported from New York.", "source": {"uri": "eagletribune.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Eagle-Tribune"}, "authors": [{"uri": "associated_press@eagletribune.com", "name": "Associated Press", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}, {"uri": "adriana_gomez_licon@eagletribune.com", "name": "Adriana Gomez Licon", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}, {"uri": "michelle_l_price@eagletribune.com", "name": "Michelle L.

But it was sort of easy if you want to know the truth,\" Trump told the cheering crowds.\n\n\"But don't feel sorry for he's a very bad guy. He weaponized government. Remember that - he's a very bad guy. Don't feel sorry for him. So tonight, I'm officially offering Joe the chance to redeem himself in front of the entire world.\n\n\"Let's do another debate this week - so that sleepy Joe Biden can prove to everyone all over the world that he has what it takes to be president. But this time, it will be man to man, no moderators, no holds barred, just name the place, any time.\"\n\nThe first presidential debate in Atlanta on June 27 was widely seen as disastrous for Biden, 81, and has led to questions about his fitness to lead and ability to win reelection even within his own party.\n\nTrump, 78, went on to challenge Biden to an \"18-hole golf match\", something the two men clashed over bizarrely during the debate.\n\n\"It will be among the most watched sporting events in history, maybe bigger than the Ryder Cup or even the Masters,\" Trump declared.\n\n\"I will even give Joe Biden 10 strokes a side. 10 strokes, that's a lot. That means 20 strokes in case you don't play golf. I will give him 10 strokes a side and if he wins, I will give the charity of his choice, any charity that he wants, $1 million.\"\n\nA day after the debate with Biden, Trump performed somewhat of a victory lap in Chesapeake, Virginia, where he piled in on the president, deriding him as \"grossly incompetent,\" and a \"train wreck.\"\n\n\"He studied so hard that he didn't know what the hell he was doing,\" Trump said, noting that Biden and his team had secured their desired date, rules, and even the television network for the debate.\n\n\"The question every voter should be asking themselves today is not whether Joe Biden can survive a 90-minute debate performance, but whether America can survive four more years of crooked Joe Biden the White House,\" he said.\n\n\"In fact, I don't know if we can really survive five more months.\"\n\nIndeed, the president has faced multiple calls, both publicly and privately from senior members of his own party, and the eyes of the world are on him ahead of the Nato summit in Washington DC.\n\nA new poll showed Vice President Kamala Harris now has a better shot than Biden at defeating Trump in the 2024 election. The survey, conducted by the Democratic firm Bendixen & Amandi, showed Biden slightly behind Trump, 42 to 43 percent, with Harris inching past the former president 42 to 41 percent.\n\nTrump is expected to name his pick for vice president shortly, with just one week to go before the Republican Party national convention, set to begin on July 14.\n\nOhio Senator JD Vance and Florida Senator Marco Rubio are leading contenders to join Trump on the Republican ticket, people familiar with the matter have told Reuters, with North Dakota Governor Doug Burgum also still in the mix.\n\nRemarking on the amount of press attending his rally in Florida, Trump speculated that it was only due to the anticipation surrounding his choice for vice president.\n\n\"I think they probably think I'm going to be announcing that Marco [Rubio] is going to be vice president because that's a lot of press. That's a lot of press,\" he said, though did not make any further announcement.", "source": {"uri": "yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

But he appears to be in no rush. (Scripps News)\n\nAfter largely ceding the spotlight to the mounting turmoil surrounding President Joe Biden 's campaign in the wake of their debate, former President Donald Trump returned to the campaign trail Tuesday and reveled in the Democratic infighting that has played out in public.\n\nTrump rallied his supporters at one of his Miami-area golf courses as he nears a deadline to announce his running mate. But he appears in no rush as much of the attention is still centered on questions about President Biden's ability to govern for another four-year term. Some Democrats have started calling for President Biden to step down as their presumptive nominee following his dismal debate performance last month.\n\n\"Our victory was so absolute that Joe's own party now wants him to throw in the towel and surrender the presidency after a single 90-minute performance,\" Trump said Tuesday night. \"They want 'Crooked Joe' out of the race. It's a shame the way they're treating him. But don't feel sorry for him. He's a very bad guy.\"\n\nTrump also laced into Vice President Kamala Harris, who has become a focus of the former president and his allies as speculation has mounted that she would replace President Biden as the Democratic nominee. Trump called her \"Laughing Kamala,\" and referred to the \"Biden-Harris administration,\" rather than just pinning actions on President Biden, as he had for months, as he criticized their immigration policies.\n\n\"Despite all the Democrat panic this week, the truth is, it doesn't matter who they nominate -- because we are going to beat any one of them in a thundering landslide and this November's going to be amazing,\" he said.\n\nRELATED STORY | Trump veepstakes heats up as running mate pick looms\n\nBoth President Biden, 81, and Trump, 78, are at least two decades older than most American presidents have been, according to the Pew Research Center, which said the median age for all U.S. presidents on their first inauguration is 55 years old. But that has not stopped Trump from arguing he is stronger than President Biden, who repeatedly stumbled, paused and could not complete sentences at times during the June 27 debate. Trump was criticized by Democrats for making false statements during the debate about the Jan. 6, 2021, riot at the U.S. Capitol and suggesting immigrants entering the U.S. illegally were taking so-called \"Black jobs\" and \"Hispanic jobs.\"\n\nIn an interview Monday with Fox News Channel's Sean Hannity, Trump said he thought President Biden \"might very well stay in\" the race. \"Nobody wants to give that up that way,\" Trump added. \"He is going to feel badly about himself for a long time. It's hard to give it up that way, the way where they're trying to force him out.\"\n\nIn the Miami suburb of Doral, Trump underscored his strong support in a former battleground state that has now shifted toward the GOP. U.S. Sen. Marco Rubio, a Miami native and one of the contenders for the vice presidential post, was among the Florida politicians who spoke at the event.\n\nRubio, the son of Cuban immigrants, is seen as a potential running mate who could help Trump as he tries to secure support from Hispanic Americans, a point the senator emphasized in his remarks as he switched several times in his remarks to Spanish.\n\nThe senator did not openly acknowledge any of the speculation about him joining Trump as a running mate. He instead skewered not only President Biden, whom he called \"the figurehead of a left-wing government, shadow government,\" but Harris, whom he would need to debate head-on if he's chosen for Trump's ticket.\n\nRubio referred to Harris not by name at first but called her President Biden's \"replacement\" and \"a real-life, verified left-winger.\" At another point in his remarks, he mocked the way Harris laughs.\n\nHe notably seemed to insert himself into Trump's signature \"Make America Great Again\" slogan by saying: \"Together, we're not just going to make it great again. We elect this man as president, we will make together America greater than it has ever been.\"\n\nThousands of people turned out in the humid summer evening for the rally. Attendees were fanning themselves and holding signs featuring Trump's mugshot, along with others that said, \"You're fired!\" -- Trump's signature phrase on his former reality show, \"The Apprentice.\"\n\nOne man, 28-year-old Austin Stiglin, said he traveled from northern Florida to participate in his first Trump rally. He was wearing a star-patterned navy blue jacket and red pants and said he was \"tired of the left telling him to vote left just because I am gay.\"\n\n\"I have a lot more to say than just my sexual orientation,\" Stiglin said. \"I would like to vote for policies that support the United States.\"\n\nNicole Farrell, a 57-year-old immigrant from Trinidad, said she voted for Trump in 2020, \"but I was not a strong supporter like now. I just preferred him over Biden.\"\n\nFarrell said she specifically likes Trump's hardline immigration policies, which include plans for mass raids and the largest deportation operation in U.S. history.\n\n\"I am an immigrant but I came here legally. They need to come here legally,\" Farrell said of migrants coming to the U.S.\n\nThe leadership crisis among Democrats has perhaps given Trump a reason to wait for his VP announcement so as to not draw attention away from President Biden's woes. Senior advisers and key allies say they still don't know whom Trump will choose as his running mate, and many believe the choice is still in flux.\n\nSpeaking on MSNBC Monday, President Biden criticized Trump for not having held events since the debate and suggested he had been \"riding around in his golf cart.\"\n\nRELATED STORY | Biden insists he's the best bet for beating Trump as

But it was sort of easy if you want to know the truth,\" Trump told the cheering crowds.\n\n\"But don't feel sorry for he's a very bad guy. He weaponized government. Remember that - he's a very bad guy. Don't feel sorry for him. So tonight, I'm officially offering Joe the chance to redeem himself in front of the entire world.\n\n\"Let's do another debate this week - so that sleepy Joe Biden can prove to everyone all over the world that he has what it takes to be president. But this time, it will be man to man, no moderators, no holds barred, just name the place, any time.\"\n\nThe first presidential debate in Atlanta on June 27 was widely seen as disastrous for Biden, 81, and has led to questions about his fitness to lead and ability to win reelection even within his own party.\n\nTrump, 78, went on to challenge Biden to an \"18-hole golf match\", something the two men clashed over bizarrely during the debate.\n\n\"It will be among the most watched sporting events in history, maybe bigger than the Ryder Cup or even the Masters,\" Trump declared.\n\n\"I will even give Joe Biden 10 strokes a side. 10 strokes, that's a lot. That means 20 strokes in case you don't play golf. I will give him 10 strokes a side and if he wins, I will give the charity of his choice, any charity that he wants, $1 million.\"\n\nA day after the debate with Biden, Trump performed somewhat of a victory lap in Chesapeake, Virginia, where he piled in on the president, deriding him as \"grossly incompetent,\" and a \"train wreck.\"\n\n\"He studied so hard that he didn't know what the hell he was doing,\" Trump said, noting that Biden and his team had secured their desired date, rules, and even the television network for the debate.\n\n\"The question every voter should be asking themselves today is not whether Joe Biden can survive a 90-minute debate performance, but whether America can survive four more years of crooked Joe Biden the White House,\" he said.\n\n\"In fact, I don't know if we can really survive five more months.\"\n\nIndeed, the president has faced multiple calls, both publicly and privately from senior members of his own party, and the eyes of the world are on him ahead of the Nato summit in Washington DC.\n\nA new poll showed Vice President Kamala Harris now has a better shot than Biden at defeating Trump in the 2024 election. The survey, conducted by the Democratic firm Bendixen & Amandi, showed Biden slightly behind Trump, 42 to 43 percent, with Harris inching past the former president 42 to 41 percent.\n\nTrump is expected to name his pick for vice president shortly, with just one week to go before the Republican Party national convention, set to begin on July 14.\n\nOhio Senator JD Vance and Florida Senator Marco Rubio are leading contenders to join Trump on the Republican ticket, people familiar with the matter have told Reuters, with North Dakota Governor Doug Burgum also still in the mix.\n\nRemarking on the amount of press attending his rally in Florida, Trump speculated that it was only due to the anticipation surrounding his choice for vice president.\n\n\"I think they probably think I'm going to be announcing that Marco [Rubio] is going to be vice president because that's a lot of press. That's a lot of press,\" he said, though did not make any further announcement.", "source": {"uri": "independent.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Independent"}, "authors": [], "concepts":

But he appears in no rush as much of the attention is still centered on questions about Biden's ability to govern for another four-year term. Some Democrats have started calling for Biden to step down as their presumptive nominee following his dismal debate performance last month.\n\n\"Our victory was so absolute that Joe's own party now wants him to throw in the towel and surrender the presidency after a single 90-minute performance,\" Trump said Tuesday night. \"They want 'Crooked Joe' out of the race. It's a shame the way they're treating him. But don't feel sorry for him. He's a very bad guy.\"\n\nTrump also laced into Vice President Kamala Harris, who has become a focus of the former president and his allies as speculation has mounted that she would replace Biden as the Democratic nominee. Trump called her \"Laughing Kamala,\" and referred to the \"Biden-Harris administration,\" rather than just pinning actions on Biden, as he had for months, as he criticized their immigration policies.\n\n\"Despite all the Democrat panic this week, the truth is, it doesn't matter who they nominate -- because we are going to beat any one of them in a thundering landslides and this November's going to be amazing,\" he said.\n\nBoth Biden, 81, and Trump, 78, are at least two decades older than most American presidents have been, according to the Pew Research Center, which said the median age for all U.S. presidents on their first inauguration is 55 years old. But that has not stopped Trump from arguing he is stronger than Biden, who repeatedly stumbled, paused and could not complete sentences at times during the June 27 debate. Trump was criticized by Democrats for making false statements during the debate about the Jan. 6, 2021, riot at the U.S. Capitol and suggesting immigrants entering the U.S. illegally were taking so-called \"Black jobs\" and \"Hispanic jobs.\"\n\nIn an interview Monday with Fox News Channel's Sean Hannity, Trump said he thought Biden \"might very well stay in\" the race. \"Nobody to wants to give that up that way,\" Trump added. \"He is going to feel badly about himself for a long time. It's hard to give it up that way, the way where they're trying to force him out.\"\n\nIn the Miami suburb of Doral, Trump underscored his strong support in a former battleground state that has now shifted toward the GOP. U.S. Sen. Marco Rubio, a Miami native and one of the contenders for the vice presidential post, was among the Florida politicians who spoke at the event.\n\nRubio, the son of Cuban immigrants, is seen as a potential running mate who could help Trump as he tries to secure support from Hispanic Americans, a point the senator emphasized in his remarks as he switched several times in his remarks to Spanish.\n\nThe senator did not openly acknowledge any of the speculation about him joining Trump as a running mate. He instead skewered not only Biden, whom he called \"the figurehead of a left-wing government, shadow government,\" but Harris, whom he would need to debate head-on if he's chosen for Trump's ticket.\n\nRubio referred to Harris not by name at first but called her Biden's \"replacement\" and \"a real-life, verified left-winger.\" At another point in his remarks, he mocked the way Harris laughs.\n\nHe notably seemed to insert himself into Trump's signature \"Make America Great Again\" slogan by saying: \"Together, we're not just going to make it great again. We elect this man as president, we will make together America greater than it has ever been.\"\n\nThousands of people turned out in the humid summer evening for the rally. Attendees were fanning themselves and holding signs featuring Trump's mug shot, along with others that said, \"You're fired!\" -- Trump's signature phrase on his former reality show, \"The Apprentice.\"\n\nOne man, 28-year-old Austin Stiglin, said he traveled from northern Florida to participate in his first Trump rally. He was wearing a star-patterned navy blue jacket and red pants and said he was \"tired of the left telling him to vote left just because I am gay.\"\n\n\"I have a lot more to say than just my sexual orientation,\" Stiglin said. \"I would like to vote for policies that support the United States.\"\n\nNicole Farrell, a 57-year-old immigrant from Trinidad, said she voted for Trump in 2020, \"but I was not a strong supporter like now. I just preferred him over Biden.\"\n\nFarrell said she specifically likes Trump's hardline immigration policies, which include plans for mass raids and the largest deportation operation in U.S. history.\n\n\"I am an immigrant but I came here legally. They need to come here legally,\" Farrell said of migrants coming to the U.S.\n\nThe presumptive GOP nominee is expected in his remarks to touch on Biden's handling of immigration and the economy, highlighting the rise in home prices and goods. Trump will also talk about how Florida is affected by the increasing arrivals of immigrants as the final destination for many people illegally crossing the U.S.-Mexico border.\n\nThe leadership crisis among Democrats has perhaps given Trump a reason to wait for his VP announcement so as to not draw attention away from Biden's woes. Senior advisers and key allies say they still don't know whom Trump will choose as his running mate, and many believe the choice is still in flux.\n\nSpeaking on MSNBC Monday, Biden criticized Trump for not having held events since the debate and suggested he had been \"riding around in his golf cart.\"", "source": {"uri": "fox61.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "fox61.com"}, "authors":

So, Trump offered Biden a lifeline.\n\n\"So tonight, I'm officially offering Joe the chance to redeem himself in front of the entire world,\" Trump said. \"So [Sen.] Marco [Rubio, R-Fla.] and [Rep.] Byron [Donalds, R-Fla.] and everybody, here's what we're going to do; you guys can be referees if you like. Let's do another debate this week so that sleepy Joe Biden can prove to everyone all over the world that he has what it takes to be president. But this time it will be man to man. No moderators, no holds barred. Just name the place anytime, anywhere.\"\n\nRubio, reported to be one of the three finalists for Trump's vice-presidential pick, spoke at the rally ahead of Trump's speech. Rubio reportedly was the only vice presidential candidate in Doral.\n\nAt one point, Trump recognized the amount of press at the rally.\n\n\"They're probably expecting me to announce Rubio as vice president,\" Trump said. \"That's a lot of press. Lot of press.\"\n\nLater in the speech, he said Rubio might not be in the Senate to vote for Trump's plan to not tax tips, \"but you'll be involved.\"\n\nTrump is expected to announce his pick before the Republican National Convention kicks off on Monday in Milwaukee.\n\nTrump segued from a second debate to a golf contest against Biden, a topic of debate toward the end of their first debate on June 27.\n\n\"I got my handicap, when I was vice president, down to a 6,\" Biden said at the end of the first debate. \"And by the way, I told you before, I'm happy to play golf if you carry your own bag. Think you can do it?\"\n\nTrump threw down the gauntlet.\n\n\"Sleepy Joe also declared that he wanted to test his skills and stamina against mine on the golf course. Can you believe this? Did you ever see him swing?\" Trump said. \"That's why this evening ... I'm also officially challenging Crooked Joe to an 18-hole golf match.\n\n\"It will be among the most watched sporting events in history, maybe bigger than the Ryder Cup or even the Masters, and I will even give Joe Biden 10 strokes a side, 10 strokes. That's a lot. That means 20 strokes in case you don't play golf. ... And if he wins, I will give the charity of his choice -- any charity that he wants -- $1 million. And I'll bet you he doesn't take the offer.\"\n\nTrump also took aim at Vice President Kamala Harris, saying choosing her as his vice president was a \"brilliant decision\" by Biden.\n\n\"Picking Kamala Harris as his vice president was the greatest insurance policy of all time,\" Trump said. \"If Joe had picked someone even half-way competent, they would have bounced him from office years ago.\"\n\nAbout NEWSMAX TV:\n\nNEWSMAX is the fastest-growing cable news channel in America!\n\nFind Newsmax channel in your home via cable and satellite systems - More Info Here Watch Newsmax+ on your home TV app or smartphone and watch it anywhere!

But he appears in no rush as much of the attention is still centered on questions about Biden's ability to govern for another four-year term. Some Democrats have started calling for Biden to step down as their presumptive nominee following his dismal debate performance last month.\n\nBoth Biden, 81, and Trump, 78, are at least two decades older than most American presidents have been, according to the Pew Research Center, which said the median age for all U.S. presidents on their first inauguration is 55 years old. But that has not stopped Trump from arguing he is stronger than Biden, who repeatedly stumbled, paused and could not complete sentences at times during the June 27 debate. Trump was criticized by Democrats for making false statements during the debate about the Jan. 6, 2021, riot at the U.S. Capitol and suggesting immigrants entering the U.S. illegally were taking so-called \"Black jobs\" and \"Hispanic jobs.\"\n\nIn an interview Monday with Fox News Channel's Sean Hannity, Trump said he thought Biden \"might very well stay in\" the race. \"Nobody to wants to give that up that way,\" Trump added. \"He is going to feel badly about himself for a long time. It's hard to give it up that way, the way where they're trying to force him out.\"\n\nIn the Miami suburb of Doral, Trump is expected to underscore his strong support in a former battleground state that has now shifted toward the GOP. U.S. Sen. Marco Rubio, a Miami native and one of the contenders for the vice presidential post, was among the Florida politicians who spoke at the event.\n\nRubio, the son of Cuban immigrants, is seen as a potential running mate who could help Trump as he tries to secure support from Hispanic Americans, a point the senator emphasized in his remarks as he switched several times in his remarks to Spanish.\n\nThe senator did not openly acknowledge any of the speculation about him joining Trump as a running mate. He instead skewered not only Biden, whom he called \"the figurehead of a left-wing government, shadow government,\" but Vice President Kamala Harris, whom he would need to debate head-on if he's chosen for Trump's ticket.\n\nRubio referred to Harris not by name at first but called her Biden's \"replacement\" and \"a real-life, verified left-winger.\" At another point in his remarks, he mocked the way Harris laughs.\n\nHe notably seemed to insert himself into Trump's signature \"Make America Great Again\" slogan by saying: \"Together, we're not just going to make it great again. We elect this man as president, we will make together America greater than it has ever been.\"\n\nKevin Cabrera, a Miami-Dade County commissioner who was Florida state director for Trump's 2020 reelection campaign, spoke at the rally, saying ahead of the event that it would be an \"overwhelming show of unity.\"\n\n\"The rally will display our unified front, showcasing a stark contrast to the Democrats, who are lost and fighting with each other over Biden's health and ability to continue,\" Cabrera said.\n\nOne attendee, 28-year-old Austin Stiglin, said he traveled from northern Florida to participate in his first Trump rally. He was wearing a star-patterned navy blue jacket and red pants and said he was \"tired of the left telling him to vote left just because I am gay.\"\n\n\"I have a lot more to say than just my sexual orientation,\" Stiglin said. \"I would like to vote for policies that support the United States.\"\n\nThe presumptive GOP nominee is expected in his remarks to touch on Biden's handling of immigration and the economy, highlighting the rise in home prices and goods. Trump will also talk about how Florida is affected by the increasing arrivals of immigrants as the final destination for many people illegally crossing the U.S.-Mexico border.\n\nThe leadership crisis among Democrats has perhaps given Trump a reason to wait for his VP announcement so as to not draw attention away from Biden's woes. Senior advisers and key allies say they still don't know whom Trump will choose as his running mate, and many believe the choice is still in flux.\n\nSpeaking on MSNBC Monday, Biden criticized Trump for not having held events since the debate and suggested he had been \"riding around in his golf cart.\"\n\nPrice reported from New York.", "source": {"uri": "register-herald.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Beckley Register-Herald"}, "authors": [{"uri": "associated_press@register-herald.com", "name": "Associated Press", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}, {"uri": "adriana_gomez_licon@register-herald.com", "name": "Adriana Gomez Licon", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}, {"uri": "michelle_l_price@register-herald.com", "name": "Michelle L.

Some Democrats have begun calling for Biden to resign as the presumptive nominee after his disappointing performance in last month's debate.\n\nRepublican presidential candidate former President Donald Trump gestures during a presidential debate with Joe Biden, Thursday, June 27, 2024, in Atlanta. (AP Photo/Gerald Herbert)\n\nBiden, 81, and Trump, 78, are both at least 20 years older than most U.S. presidents, according to the Pew Research Center, which said the median age of all U.S. presidents at their first inauguration is 55. But that hasn't stopped Trump from claiming he is stronger than Biden, who repeatedly stumbled, stopped and couldn't finish his sentences at times during the June 27 debate. Trump was criticized by Democrats for making false statements during the debate about the Jan. 6, 2021, riot at the U.S. Capitol and for suggesting that immigrants entering the United States illegally were taking so-called Black and Hispanic jobs.\n\nIn an interview Monday with Fox News host Sean Hannity, Trump said he believes Biden could very well stay in the race. \"Nobody wants to give up that way,\" Trump added. \"He's going to feel bad about himself for a long time. It's hard to give up that way, the way they're trying to force him out.\"\n\nWhat you need to know about the 2024 elections\n\nIn the Miami suburb of Doral, Trump will highlight his strong support for a former swing state that has now swung to the Republican Party. U.S. Sen. Marco Rubio, a Miami native and one of the contenders for vice president, will attend the rally along with other Florida politicians.\n\nMiami-Dade County Commissioner Kevin Cabrera, who was the Florida state director for Trump's 2020 re-election campaign and is expected to speak at the rally, said an overwhelming show of unity is to be expected.\n\nThe rally will show our united front, highlighting a stark contrast to Democrats, who are lost and fighting among themselves over Biden's health and ability to continue, Cabrera said.\n\nThe presumptive Republican nominee will also discuss Biden's handling of immigration and the economy, highlighting rising real estate and property prices. Trump will also talk about how Florida is being affected by the growing influx of immigrants, the final destination for many people crossing the U.S.-Mexico border illegally.\n\nThe leadership crisis within the Democratic Party may have given Trump a reason to wait for his vice presidential announcement so as not to distract from Biden's woes. Senior advisers and key allies say they still don't know who Trump will choose as his running mate, and many believe the choice is still uncertain.\n\nSpeaking on MSNBC on Monday, Biden criticized Trump for not holding any events since the debate and suggested he was driving around in his golf cart.\n\nWhat Are The Main Benefits Of Comparing Car Insurance Quotes Online", "source": {"uri":

Vance and North Dakota Governor Doug Burgum, with outside names Vivek Ramaswamy and Byron Donalds also floated in recent months.\n\nIn recent days, a DailyMail.com poll found that South Carolina Senator Tim Scott led the pack at 13 percent support, with Rubio in second at 12 percent tied with former Trump cabinet member Ben Carson.\n\nFlorida Senator Marco Rubio is believed to be in the final VP shortlist, and found himself being teased by Trump at Tuesday's rally about his potential place on the GOP ticket\n\nBarron Trump made his debut at his father's rallies on Tuesday, where he was seen flashing a trademark fist bump to a raucous crowd\n\nTrump has frequently said he will announce his running mate at the Republican National Convention in Milwaukee next week, however Bolton said he may break from tradition and hold off because of the negative press cycle surrounding President Biden.\n\n'Look, there's no news coming out of the Republican National Convention, other than the vice presidential nomination,' Bolton concluded.\n\n'Why waste it in a week when the Democrats may still be talking about whether Joe Biden's competent to be president?'\n\nTrump used the occasion to introduce his son Barron to his adoring crowd, receiving raucous applause as he announced, 'Welcome to the scene, Barron.'\n\nThe former president joked that his son 'had such a nice, easy life - now it's a little bit changed,' and the 6-foot-9 teen was seen pumping his fist to the crowd in typical Trump fashion.\n\n'Where is Barron? Stand up. Look at him! You're pretty popular,' Trump said from the stage, where he was joined by a number of Republican figureheads including Florida Senator Rick Scott.\n\nTrump went on to issue several challenges to Biden, first saying he wants to debate the 81-year-old ahead of their next scheduled bout on September 10.\n\nFormer President Donald Trump also challenged President Joe Biden to another debate - asking to have one next week - and a round of golf, saying he'd donate $1 million to the president's charity of choice\n\nBarron, the youngest son of the former president, earned raucous applause as former President Donald Trump told the crowd that it was the first campaign rally that the 18-year-old attended\n\nHe then challenged Biden to a golf match and staked $1 million on the game, while offering to give the president a 20-shot handicap after they sparred over their golf games at the debate.\n\n'I'm also officially challenging Crooked Joe to an 18-hole golf match right here. On Doral's Blue Monster considered one of the greatest tournament golf courses anywhere in the world,' Trump said. 'It will be among the most-watched sporting events in history.\n\n'And if he wins I will give the charity of his choice - any charity that he wants - 10 million dollars,' the ex-president added. 'And I bet he doesn't take the offer.'\n\nThe Biden campaign quickly clapped back, calling Trump's rally 'deranged.'\n\n'Joe Biden doesn't have time for Donald Trump's weird antics - he's busy leading America and defending the free world,' said campaign spokesperson James Singer.\n\nSinger noted that Trump's rally consisted of the ex-president 'inviting fictional serial killers to dinner, teasing lil' Marco Rubio, praising Project 2025 architect Tom Homan, and challenging the President of the United States to golf.'\n\nIn recent days, a DailyMail.com poll found that South Carolina Senator Tim Scott led the pack among potential Trump VP picks\n\nFlorida Congressman Byron Donalds attended Trump's rally in Miami on Tuesday, as his name continues to be floated as an outside contender for the VP pick\n\nNorth Dakota Governor Doug Burgum, who ran for president himself this election, is consistently touted as being on Trump's shortlist\n\nOhio Senator J.D. Vance, a former Trump critic, has become one of the former president's most popular supporters on the campaign trail\n\nAnalysts and pundits noted that Trump was unusually restrained following Biden's disastrous debate performance against him, which sparked furious speculation that Democrats could look to replace the 81-year-old before November's election.\n\nBiden's every move has come under scrutiny following the debate, and his speech to NATO leaders on Tuesday was his latest chance to dispel rumors he is too old for another four years in the White House.\n\nThe octogenarian president narrowly avoided a near disastrous slip-up during his welcome speech, although he read a three-word instruction to himself as he visibly read from a teleprompter.\n\nAs he awarded the Presidential Medal of Freedom to NATO Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg, Biden was seemingly saved from utter embarrassment by the audience applause, as he declared: 'Ask the military aide.'\n\nBiden then quickly caught himself, while the crowd drowned up the flub with cheers.\n\n'Military come forward,' he said. He proceeded to award the medal, hanging it around Stoltenberg's neck, without incident.\n\nPresident Joe Biden (right) averted a near flub when awarding NATO Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg (left) the Presidential Medal of Freedom\n\nA growing number of Democrats argue that Vice President Kamala Harris should take over as the party's nominee for president\n\nWith a growing number of congressional Democrats calling for Biden to step aside, many pointed to Vice President Kamala Harris as his natural successor to take on Trump.\n\nWith speculation falling on Harris' potential candidacy, several Democrats have been named as potential running mates if she had to step up to the top of the ticket.\n\nAs the first black and Asian American female presidential nominee of a major party if Biden were to drop out, analysts believe she would need a running mate who looks like nearly all the former presidents to temper any shocks to identity politics.\n\nAmong the names being floated are Governors Roy Cooper of North Carolina, Andy Beshear of Kentucky and Josh Shapiro of Pennsylvania, two people close to the Biden-Harris campaign told the New York Times.", "source": {"uri": "dailymail.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "Daily Mail Online"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Florida_Senate", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Florida Senate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Biden", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marco_Rubio", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Marco Rubio"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vice_President_of_the_United_States", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Vice President of the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Running_mate", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Running mate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republican_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Republican Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golf", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Golf"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miami", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Miami"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Miami"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_House", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "White House"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Byron_Donalds", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Byron Donalds"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2020_United_States_presidential_election", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "2020 United States presidential election"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doug_Burgum", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Doug Burgum"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Bolton", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "John Bolton"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Carolina_Senate", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "South Carolina Senate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ohio_Senate", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Ohio Senate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/J._D._Vance", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "J.

He didn't hold back.\n\nSpeaking to thousands of supporters at Trump National Doral Miami, Trump piled on Biden, Vice President Kamala Harris and the entirety of the Democratic Party. He mocked Biden's performance at last month's presidential debate, and at one point, he challenged Biden to another debate -- and then an \"18-hole golf match.\"\n\n\"The radical left Democrat Party is divided, in chaos and having a full-scale breakdown because they can't decide which of their candidates is more unfit to be president. Sleepy Joe Biden or Laughing Kamala,\" Trump said to loud cheers.\n\nBiden, who beat Trump nearly four years ago, has spent the last 10 days trying to rehabilitate his image -- and his party's confidence in him -- following a floundering performance in the first presidential debate that intensified concerns about his age and fitness for office.\n\nSince then, Biden has faced growing calls from some in his own party -- including donors, lawmakers and voters - to withdraw from the presidential race and make room for a new candidate to step in and challenge Trump, who vowed on Tuesday to defeat any Democrat who runs against him.\n\n\"It doesn't matter who they nominate because we're going to beat any one of them,\" he said.\n\nWhile Biden has insisted that he will continue to seek a second term, some Republicans at Tuesday's rally saw the debate flub as a chance to bury Biden's campaign months before voters begin casting their ballots.\n\n\"We wanted to give the Democrats a little bit of time to self-destruct, and that's exactly what's happened over the past week and a half,\" said Kevin Cabrera, a Miami-Dade County Commissioner and a surrogate for the Trump campaign. \"They don't even know who their nominee is going to be right now, and we're here to rally around our candidate.\"\n\nIn the leadup to Trump's remarks, the rally more closely resembled a Fourth of July picnic rather than a political hypefest. Thousands of supporters sprawled out across the lawn of Trump's Doral golf course, while hundreds more crowded in a line for water bottles, hoping for some relief from near-triple-digit temperatures.\n\nSome attendees wafted themselves with American-flag-emblazoned paper fans. Taking the stage as the heat began to let up on Tuesday evening, U.S. Sen. Marco Rubio joked that \"next time we need to do it indoors somewhere.\"\n\nSupporters decked head-to-toe in red, white and blue Trump merchandise expressed a sense of ease with the presidential race. Recent polls show the former president leading Biden both nationally and in key battleground states. Florida, a longtime swing state, has become friendly territory for Trump.\n\nEven Miami-Dade County, a one-time Democratic bastion, and the state's Hispanic electorate are within reach for Trump, said Jaime Florez, the Republican National Committee's Hispanic communications director.\n\n\"Look around,\" Florez said at the Doral rally. \"You have Venezuelans, Nicarguans, Cubans -- a really diverse group of Hispanic voters all here to support President Trump and Republicans.\"\n\nAdding to the sense of optimism at Tuesday's rally was Biden's debate performance. Several Trump supporters who attended the event said that the debate was proof that Biden isn't fit to serve in the White House for another four years. What's more, they said, the debate had tanked any remaining chance he had of winning a second term in November.\n\nGwen Buchel, 48, said that even if Biden ultimately backs out of his reelection bid, as some Democrats have urged him to do, any replacement would face an uphill battle against Trump.\n\n\"I think at this point in the game it might be too late, regardless of who they choose,\" said Buchel, who made the three-hour drive from her home in Cocoa, Fla. to attend the rally. \"Whoever they pull in at the last minute, it's not going to be good for them. Biden's just done. He should stay in for the next few months and just be done with it.\"\n\nAnother Trump supporter, Greg Reed, said that he wants Biden to stick around in the presidential race, arguing that it would only make it easier for Trump to coast to victory in November.\n\n\"I want him to stay,\" Reed said. \"It's an easy win for us but no matter who they bring in, I don't think anybody stands a chance. There is nobody.\"\n\nAdding to the excitement around the rally is Trump's highly anticipated announcement of whom his running mate will be. In an interview with Fox News' Sean Hannity on Monday night, Trump said that he'd \"love to\" reveal his pick at the Republican National Convention in Milwaukee, which kicks off next week.\n\nAmong those he's considering for the job is Rubio, a Miami native whose presence at Trump's rally in Doral on Tuesday only intensified speculation that he could join Trump on the Republican ticket in November.", "source": {"uri": "miamiherald.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Miami Herald"}, "authors": [{"uri": "max_greenwood@miamiherald.com", "name": "Max Greenwood", "type": "author",

He didn't hold back.\n\nSpeaking to thousands of supporters at Trump National Doral Miami, Trump piled on Biden, Vice President Kamala Harris and the entirety of the Democratic Party. He mocked Biden's performance at last month's presidential debate, and at one point, he challenged Biden to another debate -- and then an \"18-hole golf match.\"\n\n\"The radical left Democrat Party is divided, in chaos and having a full-scale breakdown because they can't decide which of their candidates is more unfit to be president. Sleepy Joe Biden or Laughing Kamala,\" Trump said to loud cheers.\n\nBiden, who beat Trump nearly four years ago, has spent the last 10 days trying to rehabilitate his image -- and his party's confidence in him -- following a floundering performance in the first presidential debate that intensified concerns about his age and fitness for office.\n\nSince then, Biden has faced growing calls from some in his own party -- including donors, lawmakers and voters -- to withdraw from the presidential race and make room for a new candidate to step in and challenge Trump, who vowed on Tuesday to defeat any Democrat who runs against him.\n\n\"It doesn't matter who they nominate because we're going to beat any one of them,\" he said.\n\nLive coverage: Donald Trump rallies supporters at his Doral golf resort\n\nWhile Biden has insisted that he will continue to seek a second term, some Republicans at Tuesday's rally saw the debate flub as a chance to bury Biden's campaign months before voters begin casting their ballots.\n\n\"We wanted to give the Democrats a little bit of time to self-destruct, and that's exactly what's happened over the past week and a half,\" said Kevin Cabrera, a Miami-Dade County Commissioner and a surrogate for the Trump campaign. \"They don't even know who their nominee is going to be right now, and we're here to rally around our candidate.\"\n\nIn the leadup to Trump's remarks, the rally more closely resembled a Fourth of July picnic rather than a political hypefest. Thousands of supporters sprawled out across the lawn of Trump's Doral golf course, while hundreds more crowded in a line for water bottles, hoping for some relief from near-triple-digit temperatures.\n\nSome attendees wafted themselves with American-flag-emblazoned paper fans. Taking the stage as the heat began to let up on Tuesday evening, U.S. Sen. Marco Rubio joked that \"next time we need to do it indoors somewhere.\"\n\nSupporters decked head-to-toe in red, white and blue Trump merchandise expressed a sense of ease with the presidential race. Recent polls show the former president leading Biden both nationally and in key battleground states. Florida, a longtime swing state, has become friendly territory for Trump.\n\nRELATED CONTENT: Cocky Trump struts at Doral political rally: '\"It doesn't matter who they nominate'\n\nEven Miami-Dade County, a one-time Democratic bastion, and the state's Hispanic electorate are within reach for Trump, said Jaime Florez, the Republican National Committee's Hispanic communications director.\n\n\"Look around,\" Florez said at the Doral rally. \"You have Venezuelans, Nicarguans, Cubans -- a really diverse group of Hispanic voters all here to support President Trump and Republicans.\"\n\nAdding to the sense of optimism at Tuesday's rally was Biden's debate performance. Several Trump supporters who attended the event said that the debate was proof that Biden isn't fit to serve in the White House for another four years. What's more, they said, the debate had tanked any remaining chance he had of winning a second term in November.\n\nGwen Buchel, 48, said that even if Biden ultimately backs out of his reelection bid, as some Democrats have urged him to do, any replacement would face an uphill battle against Trump.\n\n\"I think at this point in the game it might be too late, regardless of who they choose,\" said Buchel, who made the three-hour drive from her home in Cocoa, Fla. to attend the rally. \"Whoever they pull in at the last minute, it's not going to be good for them. Biden's just done. He should stay in for the next few months and just be done with it.\"\n\nAnother Trump supporter, Greg Reed, said that he wants Biden to stick around in the presidential race, arguing that it would only make it easier for Trump to coast to victory in November.\n\nTake a Look: Trump supporters flood the former president's Doral resort for campaign rally\n\n\"I want him to stay,\" Reed said. \"It's an easy win for us but no matter who they bring in, I don't think anybody stands a chance. There is nobody.\"\n\nAdding to the excitement around the rally is Trump's highly anticipated announcement of whom his running mate will be. In an interview with Fox News' Sean Hannity on Monday night, Trump said that he'd \"love to\" reveal his pick at the Republican National Convention in Milwaukee, which kicks off next week.\n\nAmong those he's considering for the job is Rubio, a Miami native whose presence at Trump's rally in Doral on Tuesday only intensified speculation that he could join Trump on the Republican ticket in November.", "source": {"uri": "bradenton.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Bradenton Herald"}, "authors": [{"uri": "max_greenwood@bradenton.com", "name": "Max Greenwood", "type": "author",

The speech followed by a day after Republican National Committee officials released the party's platform. Many of ideas in the document are ones Trump has talked up in rally speeches for three years, including a \"drill baby drill\" energy policy, more tax cuts and the \"largest\" deportation effort in U.S. history.\n\nNo less prominent in his Tuesday rally address was an attack on President Joe Biden's competence -- an issue that has surged to the forefront of political conversations since a June 27 debate in which Biden alternated between confused and incoherent.\n\n1. Trump challenges Biden to man-to-man debate, golf contest\n\nTrump again reiterated his \"offer\" to another debate with the incumbent president. This time, however, he said it would be man-to-man\" and \"no holds barred\" with no moide3rators.\n\nThen Trump upped the ante by also challenging Biden to an 18-hole contest on the Trump's Doral golf course, the famed \"Blue Monster.\"\n\n\"It will be among the most watched sporting events in history,\" Trump said, adding that if Biden won Trump would write a $1 million check to the charity of the president's choice.\n\nBut the 45th president said he doubted Biden would accept.\n\n\"I bet you you he doesn't take the offer, because he is all talk,\" he said.\n\n2. Trump takes aim at Kamala Harris\n\nAs Biden's attempts to dispel concerns about about his mental acumen, Trump addressed speculation that Vice President Kamala Harris might succeed the president as the Democratic Party's presidential nominee.\n\nWhen the crowd booed the thought, Trump sarcastically called Biden's selection of Harris as his running mate four years ago \"brilliant,\" eliciting more catcalls.\n\n\"No, it was brilliant because it was an insurance policy, maybe the best insurance policy I have ever seen,\" he said. \"If Joe had picked someone even halfway competent they would have bounced him from office years ago.\"\n\nTrump excoriated Harris saying she had two jobs, securing the border and preventing Russia's invasion of Ukraine, and \"both times the result was a deadly failure.\"\n\n3. Trump said Democrats engaged in historic cover-up about Biden's 'cognitive abilities'\n\nTrump accused Harris, Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer and former House Speaker Nancy Pelosi of concealing Biden's cognitive decline from the U.S. public.\n\n\"They are co-conspirators in the sinister plot to defraud the American public about the cognitive abilities of the man in the Oval Office,\" he said.\n\n4. Trump harkens to debate comment about 'Black jobs'\n\nTrump again decried the flow of immigrants across the border, again stating he believes many are coming from insane asylums and prisons and alluding to the fictional serial murder Hannibal Lecter from the 1990s \"Silence of the Lambs\" movie.\n\nHe then said that the people who \"most want\" the \"open border\" sealed are Hispanics and Black workers and families who he said are at most risk of losing employment and housing.\n\n\"They don't want their jobs taken. They don't want their homes taken,\" he said of Latinos, and then added: \"And you know who it affects the most is Black people because these people are coming in and taking jobs at levels no one has seen before.\"\n\nAmerica at 250: Fear of polarization grows with landmark Declaration of Independence anniversary in two years\n\n5. No announcement of a vice presidential running mate\n\nTrump is said to be considering Florida U.S. Sen. Marco Rubio, who grew up in West Miami, just south of Trump National Doral, as his vice presidential running mate. He has also said U.S. Sens. J.D. Vance of Ohio and Tim Scott of South Carolina are on the list, along with North Dakota Gov. Doug Burgum.\n\nTrump did name drop Rubio various times, starting after he chided Vice President Harris.\n\n\"I don't think Kamala Harris' California socialism is going to go down well with the p[eople of Doral, the people of Miami or the people of Florida,\" he said. \"Because in Florida we don't want socialism, we want our freedom, right? And we have a lot of people, right Marco, from Cuba, from Venezuela, from all over and they don't want to hear about socialism or communism.\"\n\nThen, in noting the large media presence covering the speech he quipped: \"I think they probably think I'm going to be announcing that Marco's going to be vice president because that's a lot of press.\"\n\nTrump later teased Rubio's veep possibility in noting that he would offer legislation to Congress to end the taxation of tips.

'Where is Barron? Stand up. Look at him! ... You're pretty popular. He may be more popular than Don and Eric. We gotta talk about this. Hey, Don, we've gotta talk about this huh?'\n\nThe 78-year-old ex-president said 'welcome to the scene, Barron,' and cracked that his youngest son 'had such a nice, easy life - now it's a little bit changed,' earning raucous cheers.\n\nBut Trump led the rally with a new challenge for President Joe Biden, 81, whose reelection campaign has been imperiled by his poor debate performance late last month.\n\nThe ex-president first said he wanted to debate Biden again - 'next week' - which would coincide with the Republican National Convention. Biden is due to debate Trump a second time already, but on September 10.\n\nTrump also said he wanted to play Biden in a game of golf - and staked $1 million on the deal.\n\n'I'm also officially challenging Crooked Joe to an 18-hole golf match right here. On Doral's Blue Monster considered one of the greatest tournament golf courses anywhere in the world,' Trump said. 'It will be among the most-watched sporting events in history.'\n\nTrump said it could be bigger than the Ryder Cup or the Masters.\n\n'I will even give Joe Biden 10 strokes aside, 10 strokes, that's a lot. That means 20 strokes in case you don't play golf,' he continued.\n\n'And if he wins I will give the charity of his choice - any charity that he wants - 10 million dollars,' the ex-president added. 'And I bet he doesn't take the offer.'\n\nThe Biden campaign quickly clapped back, calling Trump's rally 'deranged.'\n\n'Joe Biden doesn't have time for Donald Trump's weird antics - he's busy leading America and defending the free world,' said campaign spokesperson James Singer.\n\nSinger noted that Trump's rally consisted of the ex-president 'inviting fictional serial killers to dinner, teasing lil' Marco Rubio, praising Project 2025 architect Tom Homan, and challenging the President of the United States to golf.'\n\n'Donald Trump is a liar, a convict, and a fraud only out for himself - par for the course.'\n\nTrump has stayed off the campaign trail for 10 days - holding his last rally in Chesapeake, Virginia the day after Biden's debate - allowing the Democratic president's campaign to implode as he stayed uncharacteristically quiet.\n\nThe ex-president was seen at Fourth of July festivities.\n\nAt the rally, Trump came aimed with a number of insults for his rival Tuesday night, surrounded by supporters and family members.\n\nDonald Trump Jr. was among those to warm up the crowd, noting how Democrats don't want Americans to own an AR-15 'but they gave a vegetable the nuclear codes.'\n\nTrump Jr. was joined by his ex-wive Vanessa and three children - and his current fiance Kimberly Guilfoyle. Eric Trump was also on hand.\n\nAlso there - one of Trump's top veepstakes candidates: Florida Sen. Marco Rubio, a former 2016 rival.\n\nThroughout the night, Trump teased Rubio, seated front row.\n\nTrump trashed talked Vice President Kamala Harris and floated that Biden had put her in the position as an 'insurance policy.'\n\n'Maybe the best insurance policy I've ever seen, Marco,' Trump said. 'If Joe had picked someone at least halfway competent they would have bounced him for office years ago, but they can't because - she's gotta be, their second choice, has no chance.'", "source": {"uri": "internewscast.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Internewscast Journal"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Biden", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golf", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Golf"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stroke", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Stroke"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doral,_Florida", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Doral, Florida"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Doral, Florida"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump_2020_presidential_campaign", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump 2020 presidential campaign"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barron's_(newspaper)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Barron's (newspaper)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eric_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Eric Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Biden_2020_presidential_campaign", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Joe Biden 2020 presidential campaign"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golf_course", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Golf course"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ryder_Cup", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Ryder Cup"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republican_National_Convention", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Republican National Convention"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump_Jr.", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump Jr."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kimberly_Guilfoyle", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Kimberly Guilfoyle"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thomas_Homan", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Thomas Homan"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kamala_Harris", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Kamala Harris"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Independence_Day_(United_States)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Independence Day (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marco_Rubio", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Marco Rubio"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Democratic Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fraud", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Fraud"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Insurance", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Insurance"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chesapeake,_Virginia", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Chesapeake, Virginia"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Chesapeake, Virginia"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Florida", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Florida"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Florida"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Golf", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Golf", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Golf", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Golf", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Golf/Tournaments_and_Events", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Golf/Tournaments and Events", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Golf/Community_and_Clubs", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Golf/Community and Clubs", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Golf/Humor", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Golf/Humor", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 98}], "image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2024/07/10/02/87140733-13616195-image-a-12_1720575542325.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9717617", "eventUri": "eng-9717617", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "date": "-09-10", "textStart": 1050, "textEnd": 1062}], "sentiment": 0.2549019607843137, "wgt": 175, "relevance": 1}

Both will be closely watched for any hint - or announcement - about whom Trump will pick for the vice president role.\n\nOhio Senator J.D. Vance and Florida Senator Marco Rubio are leading contenders to join Trump on the Republican ticket, people familiar with the matter have told Reuters, with North Dakota Governor Doug Burgum also still in the mix.\n\nThe decision will come at a moment of turmoil for Democrats following 81-year-old President Joe Biden's disastrous debate against Trump on June 27, which has prompted growing calls within his party for him to step aside for a younger nominee.\n\nIn an interview with Fox News host Sean Hannity on Monday evening, Trump was asked whether Rubio, Vance and Burgum as well as South Carolina Senator Tim Scott were on his short list.\n\n\"The names that you mentioned, absolutely they're under consideration,\" Trump responded, adding that he wanted to see how the confusion gripping the Democratic Party plays out \"because, you know, it might make a difference.\"\n\nTrump said he would likely make a decision \"a little before\" or during the Republican Party's national convention, which kicks off on July 15.\n\nTrump will use the Doral rally to blame Biden for inflation and slam his immigration policies, in part by highlighting cases of migrants who entered the country illegally and committed violent crimes, according to a Trump campaign release.\n\nFord O'Connell, a Republican operative in Florida, said Trump will likely let disarray in the Democratic Party and pressure on Biden dominate the media coverage rather than divert attention at Doral by announcing whom he wants to be vice president.\n\n\"If you are Trump, it doesn't get much better than this. And the key is to just keep talking inflation, closing the border, crime and instability abroad,\" said O'Connell, who worked with Trump during the 2020 campaign.\n\nOn Saturday, Trump will travel to Pennsylvania for an afternoon rally in Butler, just outside of Pittsburgh. Trump won the state in 2016 but lost it to Biden in 2020, and victory there could prove critical to the winner of the Nov. 5 election.\n\n(Reporting by Nathan Layne in Wilton, Connecticut and Costas Pitas in Los Angeles; editing by Ross Colvin and Cynthia Osterman)", "source": {"uri": "usnews.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "U.S. News & World Report"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Running_mate", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Running mate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republican_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Republican Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reuters", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Reuters"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ohio_Senate", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Ohio Senate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/J._D._Vance", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "J.

PRICE - Associated Press\n\nMIAMI (AP) -- After largely ceding the spotlight to the mounting turmoil surrounding President Joe Biden 's campaign in the wake of their debate, former President Donald Trump returned to the campaign trail Tuesday and reveled in the Democratic infighting that has played out in public.\n\nTrump rallied his supporters at one of his Miami-area golf courses as he nears a deadline to announce his running mate. But he appears in no rush as much of the attention is still centered on questions about Biden's ability to govern for another four-year term. Some Democrats have started calling for Biden to step down as their presumptive nominee following his dismal debate performance last month.\n\n\"Our victory was so absolute that Joe's own party now wants him to throw in the towel and surrender the presidency after a single 90-minute performance,\" Trump said Tuesday night. \"They want 'Crooked Joe' out of the race. It's a shame the way they're treating him. But don't feel sorry for him. He's a very bad guy.\"\n\nTrump also laced into Vice President Kamala Harris, who has become a focus of the former president and his allies as speculation has mounted that she would replace Biden as the Democratic nominee. Trump called her \"Laughing Kamala,\" and referred to the \"Biden-Harris administration,\" rather than just pinning actions on Biden, as he had for months, as he criticized their immigration policies.\n\n\"Despite all the Democrat panic this week, the truth is, it doesn't matter who they nominate -- because we are going to beat any one of them in a thundering landslides and this November's going to be amazing,\" he said.\n\nBoth Biden, 81, and Trump, 78, are at least two decades older than most American presidents have been, according to the Pew Research Center, which said the median age for all U.S. presidents on their first inauguration is 55 years old. But that has not stopped Trump from arguing he is stronger than Biden, who repeatedly stumbled, paused and could not complete sentences at times during the June 27 debate. Trump was criticized by Democrats for making false statements during the debate about the Jan. 6, 2021, riot at the U.S. Capitol and suggesting immigrants entering the U.S. illegally were taking so-called \"Black jobs\" and \"Hispanic jobs.\"\n\nIn an interview Monday with Fox News Channel's Sean Hannity, Trump said he thought Biden \"might very well stay in\" the race. \"Nobody to wants to give that up that way,\" Trump added. \"He is going to feel badly about himself for a long time. It's hard to give it up that way, the way where they're trying to force him out.\"\n\nIn the Miami suburb of Doral, Trump underscored his strong support in a former battleground state that has now shifted toward the GOP. U.S. Sen. Marco Rubio, a Miami native and one of the contenders for the vice presidential post, was among the Florida politicians who spoke at the event.\n\nRubio, the son of Cuban immigrants, is seen as a potential running mate who could help Trump as he tries to secure support from Hispanic Americans, a point the senator emphasized in his remarks as he switched several times in his remarks to Spanish.\n\nThe senator did not openly acknowledge any of the speculation about him joining Trump as a running mate. He instead skewered not only Biden, whom he called \"the figurehead of a left-wing government, shadow government,\" but Harris, whom he would need to debate head-on if he's chosen for Trump's ticket.\n\nRubio referred to Harris not by name at first but called her Biden's \"replacement\" and \"a real-life, verified left-winger.\" At another point in his remarks, he mocked the way Harris laughs.\n\nHe notably seemed to insert himself into Trump's signature \"Make America Great Again\" slogan by saying: \"Together, we're not just going to make it great again. We elect this man as president, we will make together America greater than it has ever been.\"\n\nThousands of people turned out in the humid summer evening for the rally. Attendees were fanning themselves and holding signs featuring Trump's mug shot, along with others that said, \"You're fired!\" -- Trump's signature phrase on his former reality show, \"The Apprentice.\"\n\nOne man, 28-year-old Austin Stiglin, said he traveled from northern Florida to participate in his first Trump rally. He was wearing a star-patterned navy blue jacket and red pants and said he was \"tired of the left telling him to vote left just because I am gay.\"\n\n\"I have a lot more to say than just my sexual orientation,\" Stiglin said. \"I would like to vote for policies that support the United States.\"\n\nNicole Farrell, a 57-year-old immigrant from Trinidad, said she voted for Trump in 2020, \"but I was not a strong supporter like now. I just preferred him over Biden.\"\n\nFarrell said she specifically likes Trump's hardline immigration policies, which include plans for mass raids and the largest deportation operation in U.S. history.\n\n\"I am an immigrant but I came here legally. They need to come here legally,\" Farrell said of migrants coming to the U.S.\n\nThe presumptive GOP nominee is expected in his remarks to touch on Biden's handling of immigration and the economy, highlighting the rise in home prices and goods. Trump will also talk about how Florida is affected by the increasing arrivals of immigrants as the final destination for many people illegally crossing the U.S.-Mexico border.\n\nThe leadership crisis among Democrats has perhaps given Trump a reason to wait for his VP announcement so as to not draw attention away from Biden's woes. Senior advisers and key allies say they still don't know whom Trump will choose as his running mate, and many believe the choice is still in flux.\n\nSpeaking on MSNBC Monday, Biden criticized Trump for not having held events since the debate and suggested he had been \"riding around in his golf cart.\"\n\nPrice reported from New York.\n\nMore from this section\n\nMocPOGO Pokemon GO Hacks Updated: Fixes Failed to Detect Location Error 12\n\nUnited Filmmakers Announces an Exciting Financing Opportunity for Independent Filmmakers\n\nDirect Mail Benchmark Report 2024 reveals 61% of marketers have increased direct mail investments in the last year", "source": {"uri": "kulr8.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "KULR-8 Local News"}, "authors": [{"uri": "associated_press@kulr8.com", "name": "Associated Press", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}, {"uri": "michelle_l_price@kulr8.com", "name": "Michelle L.

Vance and North Dakota Governor Doug Burgum, with outside names Vivek Ramaswamy and Byron Donalds also floated in recent months.\n\nIn recent days, a DailyMail.com poll found that South Carolina Senator Tim Scott led the pack at 13 percent support, with Rubio in second at 12 percent tied with former Trump cabinet member Ben Carson.\n\nTrump has frequently said he will announce his running mate at the Republican National Convention in Milwaukee next week, however Bolton said he may break from tradition and hold off because of the negative press cycle surrounding President Biden.\n\n'Look, there's no news coming out of the Republican National Convention, other than the vice presidential nomination,' Bolton concluded.\n\n'Why waste it in a week when the Democrats may still be talking about whether Joe Biden's competent to be president?'\n\nTrump used the occasion to introduce his son Barron to his adoring crowd, receiving raucous applause as he announced, 'Welcome to the scene, Barron.'\n\nThe former president joked that his son 'had such a nice, easy life - now it's a little bit changed,' and the 6-foot-9 teen was seen pumping his fist to the crowd in typical Trump fashion.\n\n'Where is Barron? Stand up. Look at him! You're pretty popular,' Trump said from the stage, where he was joined by a number of Republican figureheads including Florida Senator Rick Scott.\n\nTrump went on to issue several challenges to Biden, first saying he wants to debate the 81-year-old ahead of their next scheduled bout on September 10.\n\nHe then challenged Biden to a golf match and staked $1 million on the game, while offering to give the president a 20-shot handicap after they sparred over their golf games at the debate.\n\n'I'm also officially challenging Crooked Joe to an 18-hole golf match right here. On Doral's Blue Monster considered one of the greatest tournament golf courses anywhere in the world,' Trump said. 'It will be among the most-watched sporting events in history.\n\n'And if he wins I will give the charity of his choice - any charity that he wants - 10 million dollars,' the ex-president added. 'And I bet he doesn't take the offer.'\n\nThe Biden campaign quickly clapped back, calling Trump's rally 'deranged.'\n\n'Joe Biden doesn't have time for Donald Trump's weird antics - he's busy leading America and defending the free world,' said campaign spokesperson James Singer.\n\nSinger noted that Trump's rally consisted of the ex-president 'inviting fictional serial killers to dinner, teasing lil' Marco Rubio, praising Project 2025 architect Tom Homan, and challenging the President of the United States to golf.'\n\nAnalysts and pundits noted that Trump was unusually restrained following Biden's disastrous debate performance against him, which sparked furious speculation that Democrats could look to replace the 81-year-old before November's election.\n\nBiden's every move has come under scrutiny following the debate, and his speech to NATO leaders on Tuesday was his latest chance to dispel rumors he is too old for another four years in the White House.\n\nThe octogenarian president narrowly avoided a near disastrous slip-up during his welcome speech, although he read a three-word instruction to himself as he visibly read from a teleprompter.\n\nAs he awarded the Presidential Medal of Freedom to NATO Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg, Biden was seemingly saved from utter embarrassment by the audience applause, as he declared: 'Ask the military aide.'\n\nBiden then quickly caught himself, while the crowd drowned up the flub with cheers.\n\n'Military come forward,' he said. He proceeded to award the medal, hanging it around Stoltenberg's neck, without incident.\n\nWith a growing number of congressional Democrats calling for Biden to step aside, many pointed to Vice President Kamala Harris as his natural successor to take on Trump.\n\nWith speculation falling on Harris' potential candidacy, several Democrats have been named as potential running mates if she had to step up to the top of the ticket.\n\nAs the first black and Asian American female presidential nominee of a major party if Biden were to drop out, analysts believe she would need a running mate who looks like nearly all the former presidents to temper any shocks to identity politics.\n\nAmong the names being floated are Governors Roy Cooper of North Carolina, Andy Beshear of Kentucky and Josh Shapiro of Pennsylvania, two people close to the Biden-Harris campaign told the New York Times.", "source": {"uri": "internewscast.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Internewscast Journal"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Security_Advisor_(United_States)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "National Security Advisor (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Biden", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marco_Rubio", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Marco Rubio"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vice_President_of_the_United_States", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Vice President of the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Running_mate", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Running mate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_House", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "White House"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golf", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Golf"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2020_United_States_presidential_election", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "2020 United States presidential election"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Bolton", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "John Bolton"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Florida_Senate", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Florida Senate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mike_Pence", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Mike Pence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republican_National_Convention", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Republican National Convention"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CNN", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "CNN"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republican_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Republican Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miami", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Miami"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Miami"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Byron_Donalds", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Byron Donalds"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vivek_Ramaswamy", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Vivek Ramaswamy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doug_Burgum", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Doug Burgum"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Carolina_Senate", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "South Carolina Senate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ohio_Senate", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Ohio Senate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/J._D._Vance", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "J.

President Joe Biden and the Democratic Party continue to grapple with his dismal debate performance and the intensifying calls for the 81-year-old president to step aside in favor of a younger candidate.\n\nThe Democrats' crisis has given Trump little incentive to change the subject with a VP announcement that would be sure to draw a flurry of attention and focus.\n\n\" READ MORE: Panicked Pennsylvania Democrats launch into cleanup mode after Biden's bad debate night\n\nTrump has also been waiting to see how things shake out with Biden.\n\n\"A little bit, you know, we wanted to see what they're doing, to be honest.

The first is scheduled for Tuesday evening at his golf club in Doral, Florida, near Miami. The primetime scheduling and location would seem to provide an ideal opportunity to unveil his pick if it is Florida Sen. Marco Rubio, a Miami native who is one of his top contenders.\n\nRubio will be in attendance at the event, according to an adviser familiar with the senator's plans, who, like others, spoke on condition of anonymity about the selection process.\n\n\" READ MORE: Trump's youth movement: Why some young voters in deep blue Philadelphia are backing the former president\n\nOn Saturday Trump will travel to the critical battleground state of Pennsylvania for another rally at the Butler Farm Show. The venue, outside Pittsburgh, is not far from the border of Ohio, which is home to Sen. JD Vance, another potential pick.\n\nAlso on Trump's short list is North Dakota Gov. Doug Burgum, who has grown close to the former president since he dropped his own bid for the nomination before voting began.\n\nTrump doesn't need a rally to unveil his pick. He could simply announce the news on his Truth Social platform at any moment between now and the Republican National Convention, which kicks off in Milwaukee on July 15. Or he could wait until the convention opens to make a grand, onstage curtain reveal reminiscent of his days as the host of the \"The Apprentice\" reality TV show.\n\nHe said Monday the announcement will come \"probably a little before the convention, but not much.

Marco Rubio as a potential VP pick. \"But this time it will be man-to-man, no moderators, no holds barred,\" Trump added, sounding a lot like his factitious invite of July 5.\n\n\"Just name the place, anytime, anywhere.\"\n\nStill fighting a war on many fronts to retain both his party and the public's faith that he is the man to beat Trump and complete another term, the 81-year-old Biden had one of his best days in over a week on Tuesday. Delivering some domestic and, with a strong speech at the NATO Summit in DC, international realpolitik, the self-declared \"running the world\" POTUS ended Tuesday in a more robust position that he went into the day.\n\nHowever, if Donald Trump thought the Biden campaign was going to treat his offer \"officially challenging crooked Joe to an 18-hole golf match\" on live TV on one of his own courses with anything more than contempt, he was sadly mistaken. Maybe he was right that the game between the rivals \"will be among the most watched sporting events in history, maybe bigger than the Ryder Cup or even the Masters,\" but otherwise the Biden team weren't playing around.\n\n\"Donald Trump hasn't been seen in public for 12 days, now he's inviting fictional serial killers to dinner, teasing lil' Marco Rubio, praising Project 2025 architect Tom Homan, and challenging the President of the United States to golf,\" said Biden-Harris 2024 spokesperson James Singer in a statement this evening.\n\nThen the still reeling reelection campaign tried to turn the tables on their 2020 and now 2024 rival just days before the GOP convention opens in Milwaukee, a town 78-year-old Trump reportedly called \"horrible\" to some fellow Republicans last month.\n\n\"We'd challenge Donald Trump to create jobs, but he lost 3 million,\" said the Biden-Harris team. \"We'd challenge Donald Trump to stand up to Putin, but he bent the knee to him. We'd challenge Donald Trump to follow the law, but he breaks it. We'd challenge Donald Trump to not destroy our country, but that's all his Project 2025 aims to do.\"\n\n\"Joe Biden doesn't have time for Donald Trump's weird antics - he's busy leading America and defending the free world,\" Singer concluded. \"Donald Trump is a liar, a convict, and a fraud only out for himself - par for the course.\"\n\nOf course, it was Biden who got into trash talk with Trump over golf in the train wreck June 27 face-off. In one of the few direct exchanges of the night between the two, and one of the few times that night that Biden seemed engaged, the current POTUS challenged the rather bloated former POTUS to a golf game \"if you (Trump) carry your own bag.\" Trump responded by calling Biden's boosts about his handicap \"a lie.\" Embaressing everyone, including moderators Dana Bash and Jake Tapper, the back and forth ended even more schoolyard than before with Trump stating \"let's not act like children,\" and Biden reacting \"you are a child.\"\n\nYep, that's the two senior citizens running for to be the most powerful person on Earth.\n\nIn terms of real debates, Trump and Biden are set to meet up again on ABC on September 10 at 9 pm ET -

But I have some ideas as to where we're going,\" Trump said in an interview with Fox News Channel's Sean Hannity that aired Monday night.\n\nThe decision will come at an unprecedented time of upheaval in the presidential race. President Joe Biden and the Democratic Party continue to grapple with his dismal debate performance and the intensifying calls for the 81-year-old president to step aside in favor of a younger candidate.\n\nThe Democrats' crisis has given Trump little incentive to change the subject with a VP announcement that would be sure to draw a flurry of attention and focus.\n\nTrump has also been waiting to see how things shake out with Biden.\n\n\"A little bit, you know, we wanted to see what they're doing, to be honest. Because, you know, it might make a difference,\" he told Hannity.\n\nOpportunities to announce\n\nBut Trump will have plenty of opportunities this week to ratchet up the speculation about a process that his team has kept extraordinarily close to the vest.\n\n\"It could happen anytime this week,\" Trump senior adviser Jason Miller said in an appearance on \"Fox & Friends.\"\n\nTrump has two rallies planned. The first is scheduled for Tuesday evening at his golf club in Doral, Florida, near Miami. The primetime scheduling and location would seem to provide an ideal opportunity to unveil his pick if it is Florida Sen. Marco Rubio, a Miami native who is one of his top contenders.\n\nRubio will be in attendance at the event, according to an adviser familiar with the senator's plans, who, like others, spoke on condition of anonymity about the selection process.\n\nOn Saturday Trump will travel to the critical battleground state of Pennsylvania for another rally at the Butler Farm Show. The venue, outside Pittsburgh, is not far from the border of Ohio, which is home to Sen. JD Vance, another potential pick.\n\nAlso on Trump's short list is North Dakota Gov. Doug Burgum, who has grown close to the former president since he dropped his own bid for the nomination before voting began.\n\nTrump doesn't need a rally to unveil his pick. He could simply announce the news on his Truth Social platform at any moment between now and the Republican National Convention, which kicks off in Milwaukee on July 15. Or he could wait until the convention opens to make a grand, onstage curtain reveal reminiscent of his days as the host of the \"The Apprentice\" reality TV show.\n\nHe said Monday the announcement will come \"probably a little before the convention, but not much. It could even be during the convention that we'd do it. I'd love to do it during the convention. ... It would make it even more exciting.\"\n\nTrump has spent months now teasing his choice.\n\nLate last month, before the debate, Trump told NBC News at a campaign stop in Philadelphia that he'd already made a decision.\n\n\"In my mind, yeah,\" he said.\n\nBut less than a week later, he told a local Virginia television station that his decision was still in flux.\n\n\"Well I have people in mind. I have so many good people. We have such a deep bench,\" he said. \"But we'll be making a decision sometime early convention or before convention.\"\n\nThe front-runners say they don't know yet\n\n''(A)nyone telling you they know who or when President Trump will choose his VP is lying unless that person is named Donald J. Trump,\" Trump adviser Brian Hughes said in a statement he has issued repeatedly.\n\nThat includes the front-runners for the job.\n\nOn CNN's \"State of the Union\" on Sunday, Rubio said he remained in the dark.\n\n\"Look, I've heard nothing, I know nothing, and you probably know more than I do about it,\" he said. \"Donald Trump has a decision to make. He'll make it when he needs to make it. He'll make a good decision. I know for certain that I will be out there over the next three or four months, working on behalf of his campaign in some capacity.\"\n\nHe also dismissed questions about whether he has discussed changing his residence from Florida if he's chosen as \"presumptuous.\" The Constitution bars the president and vice president from hailing from the same state.\n\n\"We'll confront those issues when they come,\" he said. \"But we're not there yet. But we will be soon, one way or the other.\"\n\nOn NBC's \"Meet the Press,\" Vance, too, said he has not received news one way or the other: \"I have not gotten the call.\"\n\n\"But most importantly,\" he went on, \"we're just trying to work to elect Donald Trump. Whoever his vice president is -- he's got a lot of good people he could choose from -- it's the policies that worked and the leadership style that worked for the American people.\"\n\nA top ally is still pushing for Tim Scott\n\nOn CBS's \"Face the Nation,\" Sen. Lindsey Graham, a longtime Trump ally, continued to push for his fellow South Carolinian, Sen. Tim Scott, the only Black Republican in the Senate.\n\n\"I don't think he's decided,\" he said, adding that Scott would be a particularly smart choice if Biden were to be replaced at the top of the ticket by Vice President Kamala Harris, the first Black woman and person of South Asian descent to serve in the office.\n\n\"If I were President Trump, I would make sure I pick somebody that could add value in 2024. Expand the map,\" he said.\n\nBiden has insisted he won't drop out and said only \" the Lord Almighty \" could get him to change his mind.", "source": {"uri": "huffpost.com", "dataType": "news",

Some Democrats have started calling for Biden to step down as their presumptive nominee following his dismal debate performance last month.\n\nBoth Biden, 81, and Trump, 78, are at least two decades older than most American presidents have been, according to the Pew Research Center, which said the median age for all U.S. presidents on their first inauguration is 55 years old. But that has not stopped Trump from arguing he is stronger than Biden, who repeatedly stumbled, paused and could not complete sentences at times during the June 27 debate. Trump was criticized by Democrats for making false statements during the debate about the Jan. 6, 2021, riot at the U.S. Capitol and suggesting immigrants entering the U.S. illegally were taking so-called \"Black jobs\" and \"Hispanic jobs.\"\n\nIn an interview Monday with Fox News Channel's Sean Hannity, Trump said he thought Biden \"might very well stay in\" the race. \"Nobody to wants to give that up that way,\" Trump added. \"He is going to feel badly about himself for a long time. It's hard to give it up that way, the way where they're trying to force him out.\"\n\nIn the Miami suburb of Doral, Trump will underscore his strong support in a former battleground state that has now shifted toward the GOP. U.S. Sen. Marco Rubio, a Miami native and one of the contenders for the vice presidential post, will be attending the rally along with other Florida politicians.\n\nKevin Cabrera, a Miami-Dade County commissioner who was Florida state director for Trump's 2020 reelection campaign and is set to speak at the rally, said to expect an \"overwhelming show of unity.\"\n\n\"The rally will display our unified front, showcasing a stark contrast to the Democrats, who are lost and fighting with each other over Biden's health and ability to continue,\" Cabrera said.\n\nThe presumptive GOP nominee will also touch on Biden's handling of immigration and the economy, highlighting the rise in home prices and goods. Trump will also talk about how Florida is affected by the increasing arrivals of immigrants as the final destination for many people illegally crossing the U.S.-Mexico border.\n\nThe leadership crisis among Democrats has perhaps given Trump a reason to wait for his VP announcement so as to not draw attention away from Biden's woes. Senior advisers and key allies say they still don't know whom Trump will choose as his running mate, and many believe the choice is still in flux.", "source": {"uri": "macaudailytimes.com.mo",

Marco Rubio as a potential VP pick. \"But this time it will be man-to-man, no moderators, no holds barred,\" Trump added, sounding a lot like his factitious invite of July 5.\n\n\"Just name the place, anytime, anywhere.\"\n\nStill fighting a war on many fronts to retain both his party and the public's faith that he is the man to beat Trump and complete another term, the 81-year-old Biden had one of his best days in over a week on Tuesday. Delivering some domestic and, with a strong speech at the NATO Summit in DC, international realpolitik, the self-declared \"running the world\" POTUS ended Tuesday in a more robust position that he went into the day.\n\nHowever, if Donald Trump thought the Biden campaign was going to treat his offer \"officially challenging crooked Joe to an 18-hole golf match\" on live TV on one of his own courses with anything more than contempt, he was sadly mistaken. Now, maybe Trump was right that the game between the rivals \"will be among the most watched sporting events in history, maybe bigger than the Ryder Cup or even the Masters,\" but otherwise the Biden team weren't playing around.\n\n\"Donald Trump hasn't been seen in public for 12 days, now he's inviting fictional serial killers to dinner, teasing lil' Marco Rubio, praising Project 2025 architect Tom Homan, and challenging the President of the United States to golf,\" said Biden-Harris 2024 spokesperson James Singer in a statement this evening about the \"deranged rally,\" as the campaign termed it on social media.\n\nThen the still reeling reelection campaign tried to turn the tables on their 2020 and now 2024 rival just days before the GOP convention opens in Milwaukee, a town 78-year-old Trump reportedly called \"horrible\" to some fellow Republicans last month.\n\n\"We'd challenge Donald Trump to create jobs, but he lost 3 million,\" said the Biden-Harris team. \"We'd challenge Donald Trump to stand up to Putin, but he bent the knee to him. We'd challenge Donald Trump to follow the law, but he breaks it.

There's no reason to insert yourself in that conversation.\"\n\nIn Florida on Tuesday night, before a loyal crowd at the Doral golf club he owns, and in the first of two rallies he is staging this week, the presumptive Republican nominee is expected to revert to his usually voluble self - at least if messaging from inside his campaign is a guide.\n\nTrump's media office did not respond to a question from the Guardian seeking confirmation that the campaign was deliberately avoiding talking much about Biden's shaky debate performance. But in a statement, Trump acolytes attacked the president's \"flailing candidacy\" and urged him to stay in the race.\n\n\"Please keep doing these interviews,\" said Jake Schneider, rapid response director for the Republican National Committee (RNC), referring to Biden calling into MSNBC's Morning Joe on Monday and insisting \"I am not going anywhere.\"\n\nOnly in Biden's mind, the statement said, \"is his defiance helping his case as a steady drip of Democrats call for a change at the top of their ticket\".\n\nSome senior Democrats also have thoughts on the former president's silence, including David Axelrod, a senior adviser for the Obama White House, whose relationship with Biden has been fractious.\n\n\"Trump's not talking much about Biden's bad debate. Trump's campaign is not blitzing ads about it. And Lara Trump [RNC co-chair and Trump's daughter-in-law] said last week it would be an affront to democracy if Biden were not the nominee,\" he wrote Monday on X.\n\n\"Why do you think they are uncharacteristically holding fire?\"\n\nIt is also possible that Trump is more concerned about advancing his own campaign, notably who to choose as his running mate one week before the Republican national convention in Milwaukee will confirm his third run at the White House as a Republican candidate.\n\nAmong those who will attend Tuesday's rally is Marco Rubio, a senior Florida US senator, believed to be one of the leading contenders for Trump's vice-presidential pick. A failed challenger to Trump for the Republican presidential nomination in 2016, when Mike Pence emerged as Trump's running mate, Rubio said on CNN on Sunday that he had \"heard nothing\".\n\n\"Donald Trump has a decision to make. He'll make it when he needs to make it. He'll make a good decision,\" he said.\n\nSpeculation has grown that the Doral event will provide Trump the perfect opportunity to unveil Rubio, particularly as Jason Miller, a senior Trump adviser, told Fox News on Monday that a decision was imminent.\n\nTrump will also rally Saturday at Pittsburgh's Butler Farm Show, close to Pennsylvania's border with Ohio, where JD Vance - another understood to be on the shortlist - is a senator.\n\nVance, on NBC's Meet the Press on Sunday, also attempted to dampen expectations. \"I have not gotten the call,\" he said.\n\n\"Whoever his vice-president is, he's got a lot of good people he could choose from, it's the policies that worked and the leadership style that worked for the American people.\"\n\nMiller's comments, meanwhile, hinted that Trump might also choose to wait to see if Biden drops out before declaring his hand.\n\n\"I look ahead as a campaign strategist to what does that vice-presidential debate look like,\" he said, citing the hypothesis that Kamala Harris, Biden's vice-president, would replace him at the top of the ticket.\n\n\"We don't know if that's going to be Kamala, or maybe they swap her out for someone who's even more liberal, more extreme, although that might be tough to do.\"\n\nThe Trump campaign's announcement of the Doral rally, meanwhile, gave little indication of what he will talk about, other than how the Biden administration was \"having catastrophic consequences on Floridians\", economically and in terms of immigration.\n\n\"Florida is a place near and dear to president Trump's heart as his home state,\" it said, referring to his Mar-a-Lago mansion in Palm Beach.\n\nTrump holds a solid 10-point advantage over Biden in Florida, according to fivethirtyeight.com's average of polls.", "source":

There's no reason to interfere in that conversation.\"\n\nIn Florida on Tuesday night, before a crowd loyal to his Doral golf club, the first of two rallies he is holding this week, the presumptive Republican nominee is expected to return to his usually voluble self, at least according to messages from inside his campaign.\n\nTrump's press office did not respond to a Guardian query seeking confirmation that the campaign was deliberately avoiding discussing Biden's shaky debate performance. But in a statement, Trump's acolytes attacked the president's faltering candidacy and urged him to stay in the race.\n\n\"Please keep doing these interviews,\" said Jake Schneider, the Republican National Committee's (RNC) rapid response director, referring to Biden who called into MSNBC's Morning Joe on Monday and insisted that I wasn't going anywhere.\n\nAccording to the statement, it is only in Biden's mind that his challenge helps his cause as a steady stream of Democrats call for a change at the top of their ticket.\n\nSome senior Democrats also have thoughts on the former president's silence, including Obama White House senior adviser David Axelrod, whose relationship with Biden is strained.\n\nTrump doesn't talk much about Biden's bad debate. The Trump campaign doesn't run ads about it. And Lara Trump [RNC co-chair and Trumps daughter-in-law] He said last week that it would be an affront to democracy if Biden were not the nominee, he wrote on X on Monday.\n\nWhy do you think they hold fire in an unusual way?\n\nIt is also possible that Trump is more concerned with advancing his own campaign, including choosing his running mate a week before the Republican National Convention in Milwaukee that will confirm his third bid for the White House as the Republican nominee.\n\nAmong those at Tuesday's rally was Marco Rubio, a Florida senator considered a leading contender for Trump's vice presidential nomination. An unsuccessful challenger to Trump for the Republican presidential nomination in 2016, when Mike Pence became Trump's running mate, Rubio told CNN Sunday that he hadn't heard anything.\n\nDonald Trump has a decision to make. He will make it when he has to. He will make the right decision, he said.\n\nSpeculation is rife that the Doral event will provide Trump with the perfect opportunity to unveil Rubio, especially since Jason Miller, a senior Trump adviser, told Fox News on Monday that a decision was imminent.\n\nThe Guardian guides you through the chaos of a presidential election with far-reaching consequences\n\nPrivacy Notice: Newsletters may contain information about charities, online advertising, and content funded by third parties.

Vance, another candidate reportedly on the short list, is a senator.\n\nVance, who also tried to calm expectations on NBC's Meet the Press on Sunday, said: \"I haven't gotten a call.\"\n\nWhoever his vice president is, he has a lot of good people to choose from, these are the policies that have worked and the style of leadership that has worked for the American people.\n\nMiller's comments, meanwhile, suggested that Trump might also choose to wait and see if Biden steps down before declaring his hand.\n\nAs a campaign strategist, I wonder what this vice presidential debate will look like, he said, citing the possibility that Kamala Harris, Biden's running mate, would replace him at the top of the ticket.\n\nWe don't know if it will be Kamala, or maybe they will swap her for someone even more liberal, more extreme, although that might be difficult to do.\n\nThe Trump campaign's announcement of the Doral rally, meanwhile, gave little indication of what he will talk about, other than the catastrophic impact of the Biden administration on Floridians, economically and in terms of immigration.\n\nFlorida is a place near and dear to President Trump's heart as his home state, he said, referring to his Mar-a-Lago mansion in Palm Beach.\n\nAccording to the fivethirtyeight.com polling average, Trump holds a solid 10-point lead over Biden in Florida.\n\nWhat Are The

But I have some ideas as to where we're going,\" Trump said in an interview with Fox News Channel's Sean Hannity that aired Monday night.\n\nThe decision will come at an unprecedented time of upheaval in the presidential race. President Joe Biden and the Democratic Party continue to grapple with his dismal debate performance and the intensifying calls for the 81-year-old president to step aside in favor of a younger candidate.\n\nThe Democrats' crisis has given Trump little incentive to change the subject with a VP announcement that would be sure to draw a flurry of attention and focus.\n\nTrump has also been waiting to see how things shake out with Biden.\n\n\"A little bit, you know, we wanted to see what they're doing, to be honest. Because, you know, it might make a difference,\" he told Hannity.\n\nBut Trump will have plenty of opportunities this week to ratchet up the speculation about a process that his team has kept extraordinarily close to the vest.\n\n\"It could happen anytime this week,\" Trump senior adviser Jason Miller said in an appearance on Fox News.\n\nTrump has two rallies planned. The first is scheduled for Tuesday evening at his golf club in Doral, Florida, near Miami. The primetime scheduling and location would seem to provide an ideal opportunity to unveil his pick if it is Florida Sen. Marco Rubio, a Miami native who is one of his top contenders.\n\nRubio will be in attendance at the event, according to an adviser familiar with the senator's plans, who, like others, spoke on condition of anonymity about the selection process.\n\nOn Saturday Trump will travel to the critical battleground state of Pennsylvania for an afternoon rally at the Butler Farm Show. The venue, outside of Pittsburgh, is not far from the border of Ohio, which is home to Sen. JD Vance, another potential pick.\n\nListen now and subscribe: Apple Podcasts | Google Podcasts | Spotify | RSS Feed | SoundStack | All Of Our Podcasts\n\nAlso said to be on Trump's short list is North Dakota Gov. Doug Burgum, who has grown close to the former president since he dropped his own bid for the nomination before voting began.\n\nTrump doesn't need a rally to unveil his pick. He could simply announce the news on his Truth Social platform at any moment between now and the Republican National Convention, which kicks off in Milwaukee on July 15. Or he could wait until the convention opens to make a grand, on-stage curtain reveal reminiscent of his days as the host of the \"The Apprentice\" reality TV show.\n\nHe said Monday the announcement will come \"probably a little before the convention, but not much. It could even be during the convention that we'd do it. I'd love to do it during the convention. ... It would make it even more exciting.\"\n\nTrump has repeatedly said he intends to unveil his pick just before or during the convention. But he has been coy about his choice.\n\nLate last month, before the debate, Trump told NBC News at a campaign stop in Philadelphia that he'd already made a decision.\n\n\"In my mind, yeah,\" he said.\n\nBut less than a week later, he told a local Virginia television station that his decision was still in flux.\n\n\"Well I have people in mind. I have so many good people. We have such a deep bench,\" he said. \"But we'll be making a decision sometime early convention or before convention.\"\n\n\"As President Trump has said himself, the top criteria in selecting a Vice President is a strong leader who could make a great President,\" Trump adviser Brian Hughes said in a statement he has issued repeatedly. \"But anyone telling you they know who or when President Trump will choose his VP is lying unless that person is named Donald J. Trump.\"\n\nThat includes the front-runners for the job.\n\nOn CNN's \"State of the Union\" on Sunday, Rubio said he remained in the dark.\n\n\"Look, I've heard nothing, I know nothing, and you probably know more than I do about it,\" he said. \"Donald Trump has a decision to make. He'll make it when he needs to make it. He'll make a good decision. I know for certain that I will be out there over the next three or four months, working on behalf of his campaign in some capacity.\"\n\nHe also dismissed questions about whether he has discussed changing his residence from Florida if he's chosen as \"presumptuous.\" The Constitution bars the president and vice president from hailing from the same state.\n\n\"We'll confront those issues when they come,\" he said. \"But we're not there yet. But we will be soon, one way or the other.\"\n\nOn NBC's \"Meet the Press,\" Vance, too, said he has not received news one way or the other: \"I have not gotten the call.\"\n\n\"But most importantly,\" he went on, \"we're just trying to work to elect Donald Trump. Whoever his vice president is -- he's got a lot of good people he could choose from -- it's the policies that worked and the leadership style that worked for the American people. I think we have to bring that back to the White House, and I'm fighting to try to do that.\"\n\nBe the first to know\n\nGet local news delivered to your inbox!\n\nSign up!\n\n* I understand and agree

PRICE - Associated Press\n\nMIAMI (AP) -- After largely ceding the spotlight to the mounting turmoil surrounding President Joe Biden 's campaign in the wake of their debate, former President Donald Trump returns to the campaign trail Tuesday after days of laying low, golfing and letting Democratic infighting play out in public.\n\nTrump is set to rally his voters at one of his Miami-area golf courses as he nears a deadline to announce his running mate. But he appears in no rush as much of the attention is still centered on questions about Biden's ability to govern for another four-year term. Some Democrats have started calling for Biden to step down as their presumptive nominee following his dismal debate performance last month.\n\nBoth Biden, 81, and Trump, 78, are at least two decades older than most American presidents have been, according to the Pew Research Center, which said the median age for all U.S. presidents on their first inauguration is 55 years old. But that has not stopped Trump from arguing he is stronger than Biden, who repeatedly stumbled, paused and could not complete sentences at times during the June 27 debate. Trump was criticized by Democrats for making false statements during the debate about the Jan. 6, 2021, riot at the U.S. Capitol and suggesting immigrants entering the U.S. illegally were taking so-called \"Black jobs\" and \"Hispanic jobs.\"\n\nIn an interview Monday with Fox News Channel's Sean Hannity, Trump said he thought Biden \"might very well stay in\" the race. \"Nobody to wants to give that up that way,\" Trump added. \"He is going to feel badly about himself for a long time. It's hard to give it up that way, the way where they're trying to force him out.\"\n\nIn the Miami suburb of Doral, Trump is expected to underscore his strong support in a former battleground state that has now shifted toward the GOP. U.S. Sen. Marco Rubio, a Miami native and one of the contenders for the vice presidential post, was among the Florida politicians who spoke at the event.\n\nRubio, the son of Cuban immigrants, is seen as a potential running mate who could help Trump as he tries to secure support from Hispanic Americans, a point the senator emphasized in his remarks as he switched several times in his remarks to Spanish.\n\nThe senator did not openly acknowledge any of the speculation about him joining Trump as a running mate. He instead skewered not only Biden, whom he called \"the figurehead of a left-wing government, shadow government,\" but Vice President Kamala Harris, whom he would need to debate head-on if he's chosen for Trump's ticket.\n\nRubio referred to Harris not by name at first but called her Biden's \"replacement\" and \"a real-life, verified left-winger.\" At another point in his remarks, he mocked the way Harris laughs.\n\nHe notably seemed to insert himself into Trump's signature \"Make America Great Again\" slogan by saying: \"Together, we're not just going to make it great again. We elect this man as president, we will make together America greater than it has ever been.\"\n\nKevin Cabrera, a Miami-Dade County commissioner who was Florida state director for Trump's 2020 reelection campaign, spoke at the rally, saying ahead of the event that it would be an \"overwhelming show of unity.\"\n\n\"The rally will display our unified front, showcasing a stark contrast to the Democrats, who are lost and fighting with each other over Biden's health and ability to continue,\" Cabrera said.\n\nOne attendee, 28-year-old Austin Stiglin, said he traveled from northern Florida to participate in his first Trump rally. He was wearing a star-patterned navy blue jacket and red pants and said he was \"tired of the left telling him to vote left just because I am gay.\"\n\n\"I have a lot more to say than just my sexual orientation,\" Stiglin said. \"I would like to vote for policies that support the United States.\"\n\nThe presumptive GOP nominee is expected in his remarks to touch on Biden's handling of immigration and the economy, highlighting the rise in home prices and goods. Trump will also talk about how Florida is affected by the increasing arrivals of immigrants as the final destination for many people illegally crossing the U.S.-Mexico border.\n\nThe leadership crisis among Democrats has perhaps given Trump a reason to wait for his VP announcement so as to not draw attention away from Biden's woes. Senior advisers and key allies say they still don't know whom Trump will choose as his running mate, and many believe the choice is still in flux.\n\nSpeaking on MSNBC Monday, Biden criticized Trump for not having held events since the debate and suggested he had been \"riding around in his golf cart.\"\n\nPrice reported from New York.\n\nMore from this section\n\nDirect Mail Benchmark Report 2024 reveals 61% of marketers have increased direct mail investments in the last year\n\nVice Capital Markets Launches Integration with Fannie Mae Mission Score API\n\nMocPOGO Pokemon GO Hacks Updated: Fixes Failed to Detect Location Error 12", "source": {"uri": "kulr8.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "KULR-8 Local News"}, "authors": [{"uri": "associated_press@kulr8.com", "name": "Associated Press", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}, {"uri": "michelle_l_price@kulr8.com", "name": "Michelle L.

Rubio spoke to the crowd earlier in the evening at a rally that also featured Trump's sons.\n\n\"Will I announce my VP in 90 minutes?\" a fundraising appeal from Trump asked, telling supporters that they were \"NOT going to want to miss this.\" Shortly before Trump took the stage, his campaign also released prepared remarks, including the phrase, \"Tonight, I am officially\" before abruptly cutting off, adding to the intrigue.\n\nBut Trump did not announce his pick, instead saying that he was \"officially\" challenging President Joe Biden to another debate -- this time without moderators -- a format he has pushed in recent days to needle the incumbent over a poor performance in their first showdown of the cycle.\n\nThroughout the event, held outdoors in sweltering temperatures, Trump teased Rubio. The former president discussed a proposal to exclude tipped wages from taxes, a plan which would require legislation passing the House and Senate, but suggested Rubio might not be be a senator much longer to vote on the idea.\n\n\"Marco, you're going to vote for it, I hope,\" Trump said. \"Well, you may or may not be there to vote for it, but you'll be involved.\"\n\nTrump has said Rubio is on his shortlist, also mentioning Senators JD Vance of Ohio and Tim Scott of South Carolina, as well as North Dakota Governor Doug Burgum as under consideration, in response to a question from Fox News host Sean Hannity during an interview aired Monday.\n\nTrump told Hannity he had yet to make a final decision on his pick but plans an announcement in the coming week, and suggested it could \"even be during the convention,\" which begins on July 15 in Milwaukee. Trump has suggested that announcing during the convention could increase viewership of televised event.\n\nTuesday's event marked Trump reemergence on the campaign trail after a stretch that saw the presumptive Republican nominee largely lay low. That alloweded media glare to focus on Biden as the president sought to quell a Democratic revolt after his debate performance left some in the party worrying that he would not be able to defeat Trump and should stand aside for another candidate.\n\nTrump is also holding a rally on Saturday in Pennsylvania before the Repuvlican convention.\n\nTrump's campaign trail resurgence comes as Cook Political Report updated their Electoral College analysis that shows a more favorable map for Trump in November. The report moved Nevada, Arizona and Georgia from \"toss up\" to \"lean\" Republican. It also shifted Minnesota, New Hampshire and Nebraska's second congressional district from \"likely\" Democratic\" to \"lean\" Democratic", "source": {"uri": "ca.news.yahoo.com", "dataType": "news",

Marco Rubio throughout his rally here on Tuesday night, leaving the crowd in suspense over who he'd pick as running mate -- while also seemingly toying with the vice presidential hopeful.\n\nTrump pulled the rumors surrounding his running mate into the open early in his 75-minute speech. \"They'll probably be thinking that I'll be announcing Rubio as my vice president,\" he said about the journalists gathered to cover the rally, \"because that's a lot of press.\" Trump, who withheld naming his running mate, then moved on to a rant about President Joe Biden and the economy.\n\nAt another point in his speech, Trump asked the Florida Republican senator whether he'd support his proposal to remove taxes from tips before teasing the senator with, \"you may or not be there to vote for it -- but you'll be involved.\" He later talked about his closeness to Rubio, acknowledging that during the 2016 presidential race \"we had a vicious campaign for a while,\" before introducing all the members of the Florida GOP congressional delegation and state lawmakers who attended. It is, in a way, classic Trump: trying to drum up drama for the sake of attention, while demanding fealty from those who hope to advance their political careers on his coattails.\n\nRubio is reportedly on the vice presidential short list, one of the last big decisions that Trump has to announce before being officially designated as the party's nominee at the Republican National Convention in Milwaukee next week. Also thought to be at the top of the list are Sen. J.D. Vance of Ohio and North Dakota Gov. Doug Burgum.\n\nRubio ran against Trump in 2016 in a bitter primary, where the eventual winner dubbed Rubio as \"Little Marco\" and the two argued about the size of Trump's hands (and other body parts). But they later worked together during Trump's first term on policy toward Latin America, doubling the child tax credit and small business loans during the pandemic.\n\nTrump's rally, at his private golf club, was a reemergence of sorts. The former president has been uncharacteristically quiet since his debate with Biden, who is facing pressure from some members of his party and political pundits to drop out of the race after a disastrous performance. Trump last held a campaign rally in Virginia, the day after the June 27 presidential debate.\n\nDuring his speech, Trump mocked Biden over the debate and reports that have detailed how his aides shield him from public scrutiny about his age and mental acuity. He challenged Biden to debate him again this week and to play him at golf.\n\n\"Donald Trump hasn't been seen in public for 12 days, now he's inviting fictional serial killers to dinner, teasing lil' Marco Rubio, praising Project 2025 architect Tom Homan, and challenging the President of the United States to golf,\" Biden spokesperson James Singer said in a statement. \"Joe Biden doesn't have time for Donald Trump's weird antics -- he's busy leading America and defending the free world.\"\n\nBut Trump mainly focused the event on showing his dominance in Florida, the state where he switched his residency to during his time in the White House. Trump name-dropped Rubio, using his first name, throughout his speech.\n\nTrump sarcastically called Biden's selection of Vice President Kamala Harris the \"smartest decision he has ever made,\" sharing the nickname \"Laffin' Kamala\" and spelling it out for the crowd.\n\n\"It was the best insurance policy I have ever seen, Marco,\" Trump said, alluding to how certain Democratic operatives have expressed that they didn't think Harris could carry the ticket.\n\nRubio received the loudest applause from the audience of any members of the speaker lineup aside from Trump. He took the stage and oscillated between English and Spanish, providing audience members a preview of what it might look like for him to join Trump on the ticket and campaign alongside him. \"Can I say something in Spanglish?\" he asked at one point.\n\nRubio also provided insight into how he might go after Harris if he is picked as Trump's running mate, calling her a \"verified left winger\" and mocking her laugh. Should Rubio be picked as running mate, he and Harris could face off in a debate. However, both campaigns have ditched the Commission on Presidential Debates, and several media outlets have proposed vice presidential faceoffs.\n\n\"Of all the crazy, left-wing policies they wanted for our country -- she has supported every one of them,\" Rubio said, citing her support for reducing transit emissions and banning plastic straws (though she said the paper ones break too easily).\n\nRubio also drew support from fellow Floridian Sen. Rick Scott, who spoke before him onstage and praised him for doing \"an unbelievable job.\"\n\n\"And by the way -- he'd be a great vice presidential pick,\" Scott added.\n\nBut Rubio faces some opposition from within the former president's orbit. Donald Trump Jr., the president's son, said on his show \"Triggered\" that Rubio wouldn't be the best pick.\n\nTrump Jr. said he had a good relationship with Rubio, but agreed with a commentator who said the Floridian in the vice presidency would lead to another Trump impeachment. \"There is some truth about having someone that's a little bit more establishment in there,\" he said. \"Wouldn't the Senate RINOs, wouldn't they love that?\"\n\nThe younger Trump acknowledged that he was pulling for Vance, and said he \"has no inside information, obviously, but if I did I probably wouldn't tell you anyway.\"\n\nDuring a press conference earlier in the day, Florida Democratic Party Chair Nikki Fried promised the party would be on the \"front lines\" to oppose Rubio and would \"have stories to tell.\"\n\n\"We are the ones who've had to deal with Marco Rubio for the last few decades here in our state ... If he is going to decide to run for vice president of the United States, the No. 1 issue is he will once again have abandoned the people of this state,\" Fried said. She was alluding to how Rubio frequently missed hearings and votes in the Senate -- an issue he came under attack for when he ran for president in 2016 and during his 2022 reelection campaign, though that year he easily kept his seat.\n\nFried also criticized Rubio for comparing Trump's trial in Manhattan to those in communist Cuba.\n\n\"He is more concerned about kissing the ring than understanding where he came from,\" she said.\n\nHouse members from the Florida delegation who spoke at the rally didn't mention Rubio, instead focusing on praising Trump and ridiculing Biden's debate performance. They did, however, make overtures the Hispanic community, a crucial voting bloc in Florida -- especially in Miami-Dade, which is home to many voters of Cuban descent and where Trump's golf course is located.\n\n\"I would like to send a message to the Hispanic community across the country,\" said Rep. Maria Elvira Salazar (R-Fla.). \"You are welcomed in the Republican Party.\"", "source": {"uri": "yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kamala_Harris", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Kamala Harris"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Biden", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marco_Rubio", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Marco Rubio"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vice_President_of_the_United_States", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Vice President of the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Running_mate", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Running mate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Senate", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "United States Senate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golf", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Golf"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Florida", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Florida"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Florida"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2016_United_States_presidential_election", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "2016 United States presidential election"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doug_Burgum", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Doug Burgum"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republican_Party_of_Florida", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Republican Party of Florida"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coattail_effect", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Coattail effect"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/J._D._Vance", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "J.

Some Democrats have started calling for Biden to step down as their presumptive nominee following his dismal debate performance last month.\n\nTrump, speaking from the 10th hole of his course, challenged Biden to another debate or even a \u201cgolf-off\u201d reviving an offbeat argument from their debate. But mostly, he rubbed in how their meetup left Biden\u2019s campaign facing a grim prognosis.\n\n\u201cOur victory was so absolute that Joe\u2019s own party now wants him to throw in the towel and surrender the presidency after a single 90-minute performance,\u201d Trump said Tuesday night. \u201cThey want \u2018Crooked Joe\u2019 out of the race. It\u2019s a shame the way they\u2019re treating him. But don\u2019t feel sorry for him. He\u2019s a very bad guy.\u201d\n\nJames Singer, a spokesperson for Biden\u2019s campaign, responded to Trump with a series of challenges, saying in a statement that: \u201cWe\u2019d challenge Donald Trump to create jobs, but he lost 3 million. We\u2019d challenge Donald Trump to stand up to Putin, but he bent the knee to him. We\u2019d challenge Donald Trump to follow the law, but he breaks it\u201d.\n\nSinger also said: \u201cJoe Biden doesn\u2019t have time for Donald Trump\u2019s weird antics \u2013 he\u2019s busy leading America and defending the free world\u201d.\n\nTrump laced into Harris with more specifics than usual. She has become a focus of the former president and his allies as speculation has mounted that she would replace Biden as the Democratic nominee.\n\nTrump called her \u201cLaughing Kamala\u201d and referred to the \u201cBiden-Harris administration\u201d, rather than just pinning actions on Biden as he had for months, and blamed Harris for the White House\u2019s immigration policies.\n\n\u201cDespite all the Democrat panic this week, the truth is, it doesn\u2019t matter who they nominate because we are going to beat any one of them in thundering landslides and this November\u2019s going to be amazing,\u201d he said.\n\nTrump, ever the showman, repeatedly played into the speculation that he might elevate Rubio to his ticket.\n\nRubio, a Miami native and one of the contenders for the vice-presidential post, was among the Florida politicians who spoke at the event.\n\nAt one point, Trump marvelled at the number of reporters in attendance and said: \u201cI think they probably think I\u2019m going to be announcing that Marco is going to be vice-president\u201d.\n\nLater, when he talked about his pledge to make tips tax-free, he remarked that Rubio \u201cmay or may not be there to vote for it\u201d.\n\nRubio, the son of Cuban immigrants, is seen as a potential running mate who could help Trump as he tries to secure support from Hispanic Americans, a point the senator emphasised in his remarks as he switched several times in his remarks to Spanish.\n\nThe senator did not openly acknowledge any of the speculation about him joining Trump as a running mate. He instead skewered not only Biden, whom he called \u201cthe figurehead of a left-wing government, shadow government,\u201d but Harris, whom he would need to debate head-on if he\u2019s chosen for Trump\u2019s ticket.\n\nRubio referred to Harris not by name at first but called her Biden\u2019s \u201creplacement\u201d and \u201ca real-life, verified left-winger\u201d. At another point in his remarks, he mocked the way Harris laughs.\n\nTrump has said Rubio is on his shortlist, also mentioning Senators JD Vance of Ohio and Tim Scott of South Carolina, as well as North Dakota Governor Doug Burgum as under consideration, in response to a question from Fox News host Sean Hannity during an interview aired Monday.\n\nAdditional reporting by Bloomberg", "source":

But I have some ideas as to where we're going,\" Trump said in an interview with Fox News Channel's Sean Hannity that aired Monday night.\n\nThe decision will come at an unprecedented time of upheaval in the presidential race. President Joe Biden and the Democratic Party continue to grapple with his dismal debate performance and the intensifying calls for the 81-year-old president to step aside in favor of a younger candidate.\n\nThe Democrats' crisis has given Trump little incentive to change the subject with a VP announcement that would be sure to draw a flurry of attention and focus.\n\nTrump has also been waiting to see how things shake out with Biden.\n\n\"A little bit, you know, we wanted to see what they're doing, to be honest. Because, you know, it might make a difference,\" he told Hannity.\n\nBut Trump will have plenty of opportunities this week to ratchet up the speculation about a process that his team has kept extraordinarily close to the vest.\n\n\"It could happen anytime this week,\" Trump senior adviser Jason Miller said in an appearance on Fox News.\n\nTrump has two rallies planned. The first is scheduled for Tuesday evening at his golf club in Doral, Florida, near Miami. The primetime scheduling and location would seem to provide an ideal opportunity to unveil his pick if it is Florida Sen. Marco Rubio, a Miami native who is one of his top contenders.\n\nRubio will be in attendance at the event, according to an adviser familiar with the senator's plans, who, like others, spoke on condition of anonymity about the selection process.\n\nOn Saturday Trump will travel to the critical battleground state of Pennsylvania for an afternoon rally at the Butler Farm Show. The venue, outside of Pittsburgh, is not far from the border of Ohio, which is home to Sen. JD Vance, another potential pick.\n\nAlso said to be on Trump's short list is North Dakota Gov. Doug Burgum, who has grown close to the former president since he dropped his own bid for the nomination before voting began.\n\nTrump doesn't need a rally to unveil his pick. He could simply announce the news on his Truth Social platform at any moment between now and the Republican National Convention, which kicks off in Milwaukee on July 15. Or he could wait until the convention opens to make a grand, on-stage curtain reveal reminiscent of his days as the host of the \"The Apprentice\" reality TV show.\n\nHe said Monday the announcement will come \"probably a little before the convention, but not much. It could even be during the convention that we'd do it. I'd love to do it during the convention. ... It would make it even more exciting.\"\n\nTrump has repeatedly said he intends to unveil his pick just before or during the convention. But he has been coy about his choice.\n\nLate last month, before the debate, Trump told NBC News at a campaign stop in Philadelphia that he'd already made a decision.\n\n\"In my mind, yeah,\" he said.\n\nBut less than a week later, he told a local Virginia television station that his decision was still in flux.\n\n\"Well I have people in mind. I have so many good people. We have such a deep bench,\" he said. \"But we'll be making a decision sometime early convention or before convention.\"\n\n\"As President Trump has said himself, the top criteria in selecting a Vice President is a strong leader who could make a great President,\" Trump adviser Brian Hughes said in a statement he has issued repeatedly. \"But anyone telling you they know who or when President Trump will choose his VP is lying unless that person is named Donald J. Trump.\"\n\nThat includes the front-runners for the job.\n\nOn CNN's \"State of the Union\" on Sunday, Rubio said he remained in the dark.\n\n\"Look, I've heard nothing, I know nothing, and you probably know more than I do about it,\" he said. \"Donald Trump has a decision to make. He'll make it when he needs to make it. He'll make a good decision. I know for certain that I will be out there over the next three or four months, working on behalf of his campaign in some capacity.\"\n\nHe also dismissed questions about whether he has discussed changing his residence from Florida if he's chosen as \"presumptuous.\" The Constitution bars the president and vice president from hailing from the same state.\n\n\"We'll confront those issues when they come,\" he said. \"But we're not there yet. But we will be soon, one way or the other.\"\n\nOn NBC's \"Meet the Press,\" Vance, too, said he has not received news one way or the other: \"I have not gotten the call.\"\n\n\"But most importantly,\" he went on, \"we're just trying to work to elect Donald Trump. Whoever his vice president is -- he's got a lot of good people he could choose from -- it's the policies that worked and the leadership style that worked for the American people. I think we have to bring that back to the White House, and I'm fighting to try to do that.\"\n\nCompanies donating the most money to Donald Trump\n\nCompanies donating the most money to Donald Trump\n\n#22.

Stand up. Look at him! ... You're pretty popular. He may be more popular than Don and Eric.\n\n\"We gotta talk about this. Hey, Don, we've gotta talk about this huh?\".\n\nThe presumptive Republican nominee in November's presidential election said \"welcome to the scene, Barron,\" saying his youngest son \"had such a nice, easy life - now it's a little bit changed\" to raucous cheers.\n\nHe attacked Joe Biden in his speech over the president's poor performance in their presidential debate on June 27 - that has led to calls within the Democrats for Mr Biden to be replaced as their candidate.\n\n\"Our victory was so absolute that Joe's own party now wants him to throw in the towel and surrender the presidency after a single 90-minute performance,\" Trump said Tuesday night. \"They want 'Crooked Joe' out of the race. It's a shame the way they're treating him. But don't feel sorry for him. He's a very bad guy.\"\n\nTrump also attacked vice president Kamala Harris with more specifics than usual. She has become a focus of the former president and his allies as speculation has mounted that she would replace Biden as the Democratic nominee. Trump called her \"Laughing Kamala,\" and referred to the \"Biden-Harris administration,\" rather than just pinning actions on Biden as he had for months, and blamed Harris for the White House's immigration policies.\n\n\"Despite all the Democrat panic this week, the truth is, it doesn't matter who they nominate because we are going to beat any one of them in thundering landslides and this November's going to be amazing,\" he said.\n\nTrump also teased the expected announcement of his Republican running mate with one of the top contenders, Florida Senator Marco Rubio, in attendance.\n\nRubio, a Miami native and one of the contenders for the vice presidential post, was among the Florida politicians who spoke at the event.\n\nAt one point, Trump marveled at the number of reporters in attendance and said, \"I think they probably think I'm going to be announcing that Marco is going to be vice president.\"\n\nLater, when he talked about his pledge to make tips tax-free, he remarked that Rubio \"may or may not be there to vote for it.\"\n\nRubio, the son of Cuban immigrants, is seen as a potential running mate who could help Trump as he tries to secure support from Hispanic Americans, a point the senator emphasized in his remarks as he switched several times in his remarks to Spanish.\n\nThe senator did not openly acknowledge any of the speculation about him joining Trump as a running mate. He instead attacked not only Biden, whom he called \"the figurehead of a left-wing government, shadow government,\" but Harris, whom he would need to debate head-on if he's chosen for Trump's ticket.\n\nRubio referred to Harris not by name at first but called her Biden's \"replacement\" and \"a real-life, verified left-winger.\" At another point in his remarks, he mocked the way Harris laughs.\n\nHe notably seemed to insert himself into Trump's signature \"Make America Great Again\" slogan by saying: \"Together, we're not just going to make it great again. We elect this man as president, we will make together America greater than it has ever been.\"\n\nJames Singer, a spokesperson for Biden's campaign, responded to Trump with a series of challenges, saying in a statement: \"We'd challenge Donald Trump to create jobs, but he lost 3 million. We'd challenge Donald Trump to stand up to Putin, but he bent the knee to him. We'd challenge Donald Trump to follow the law, but he breaks it.\"", "source": {"uri": "ca.news.yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kamala_Harris", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Kamala Harris"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Biden", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marco_Rubio", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Marco Rubio"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Democratic Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2016_United_States_presidential_election", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "2016 United States presidential election"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vice_President_of_the_United_States", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Vice President of the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republican_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Republican Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doral,_Florida", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Doral, Florida"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Doral, Florida"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Presidency_of_Joe_Biden", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Presidency of Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Florida_Senate", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Florida Senate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Senate", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United States Senate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Running_mate", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Running mate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_House", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "White House"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immigration", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Immigration"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miami", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Miami"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Miami"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Biden_2020_presidential_campaign", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Joe Biden 2020 presidential campaign"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Make_America_Great_Again", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Make America Great Again"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hispanic_and_Latino_Americans", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Hispanic and Latino Americans"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spanish_language", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Spanish language"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vladimir_Putin", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Vladimir Putin"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Left-wing_politics", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Left-wing politics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Florida", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Florida"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Florida"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cuba", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Cuba"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Cuba"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Death/In_Memoriam", "label": "dmoz/Society/Death/In Memoriam", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 96}], "image": "https://media.zenfs.com/en/evening_standard_239/38fc7afdd7db2dbd725124b9159c4c4a", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9717617", "eventUri": "eng-9717617", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-06-27", "textStart": 864, "textEnd": 871}], "sentiment": 0.2078431372549019, "wgt": 167, "relevance": 1}

Trump teased potential VP picks, praised a Supreme Court ruling in his favor, and challenged Biden to a debate and golf match, stirring controversy and media attention.\n\nRepublican candidate Donald Trump ramped up his offensive against Vice President Kamala Harris at a Miami rally, questioning her competence and President Joe Biden's mental fitness. Speaking at his Doral golf club, Trump repeatedly mentioned Florida Senator Marco Rubio, fueling speculation about his running mate choice.\n\nOn a sweltering night, Trump criticized 81-year-old Biden's June 27 debate performance, heightening concerns about Biden's mental acuity. Despite these attacks, Biden reiterated his commitment to stay in the race, dismissing calls for his withdrawal.\n\nMockingly, Trump labeled Harris as Biden's 'insurance policy,' claiming her inefficacy shields Biden from replacement. He accused Harris of masking Biden's alleged cognitive decline, while the Biden campaign accused Trump of fabricating stories to divert attention from the controversial Project 2025.\n\nTrump further challenged Biden to a no-holds-barred debate and 18-hole golf match, predicting it to be a major spectacle. He hailed a Supreme Court ruling that precludes prosecution for presidential acts, while Biden warned it sets a dangerous precedent.\n\nProjected as politically motivated, Trump expressed respect for the conservative justices' decision. Looking ahead, Trump plans a Pennsylvania rally, with VP candidate speculation focusing on Rubio, J.D. Vance, and Doug Burgum.

It is, in a way, classic Trump: trying to drum up drama for the sake of attention, while demanding fealty from those who hope to advance their political careers on his coattails.\n\nRubio is reportedly on the vice presidential short list, one of the last big decisions that Trump has to announce before being officially designated as the party's nominee at the Republican National Convention in Milwaukee next week. Also thought to be at the top of the list are Sen. J.D. Vance of Ohio and North Dakota Gov. Doug Burgum.\n\nRubio ran against Trump in 2016 in a bitter primary, where the eventual winner dubbed Rubio as \"Little Marco\" and the two argued about the size of Trump's hands (and other body parts). But they later worked together during Trump's first term on policy toward Latin America, doubling the child tax credit and small business loans during the pandemic.\n\nTrump's rally, at his private golf club, was a reemergence of sorts. The former president has been uncharacteristically quiet since his debate with Biden, who is facing pressure from some members of his party and political pundits to drop out of the race after a disastrous performance. Trump last held a campaign rally in Virginia, the day after the June 27 presidential debate.\n\nDuring his speech, Trump mocked Biden over the debate and reports that have detailed how his aides shield him from public scrutiny about his age and mental acuity. He challenged Biden to debate him again this week and to play him at golf.\n\n\"Donald Trump hasn't been seen in public for 12 days, now he's inviting fictional serial killers to dinner, teasing lil' Marco Rubio, praising Project 2025 architect Tom Homan, and challenging the President of the United States to golf,\" Biden spokesperson James Singer said in a statement. \"Joe Biden doesn't have time for Donald Trump's weird antics -- he's busy leading America and defending the free world.\"\n\nBut Trump mainly focused the event on showing his dominance in Florida, the state where he switched his residency to during his time in the White House. Trump name-dropped Rubio, using his first name, throughout his speech.\n\nTrump sarcastically called Biden's selection of Vice President Kamala Harris the \"smartest decision he has ever made,\" sharing the nickname \"Laffin' Kamala\" and spelling it out for the crowd.\n\n\"It was the best insurance policy I have ever seen, Marco,\" Trump said, alluding to how certain Democratic operatives have expressed that they didn't think Harris could carry the ticket.\n\nRubio received the loudest applause from the audience of any members of the speaker lineup aside from Trump. He took the stage and oscillated between English and Spanish, providing audience members a preview of what it might look like for him to join Trump on the ticket and campaign alongside him. \"Can I say something in Spanglish?\" he asked at one point.\n\nRubio also provided insight into how he might go after Harris if he is picked as Trump's running mate, calling her a \"verified left winger\" and mocking her laugh. Should Rubio be picked as running mate, he and Harris could face off in a debate. However, both campaigns have ditched the Commission on Presidential Debates, and several media outlets have proposed vice presidential faceoffs.\n\n\"Of all the crazy, left-wing policies they wanted for our country -- she has supported every one of them,\" Rubio said, citing her support for reducing transit emissions and banning plastic straws (though she said the paper ones break too easily).\n\nRubio also drew support from fellow Floridian Sen. Rick Scott, who spoke before him onstage and praised him for doing \"an unbelievable job.\"\n\n\"And by the way -- he'd be a great vice presidential pick,\" Scott added.\n\nBut Rubio faces some opposition from within the former president's orbit. Donald Trump Jr., the president's son, said on his show \"Triggered\" that Rubio wouldn't be the best pick.\n\nTrump Jr. said he had a good relationship with Rubio, but agreed with a commentator who said the Floridian in the vice presidency would lead to another Trump impeachment. \"There is some truth about having someone that's a little bit more establishment in there,\" he said. \"Wouldn't the Senate RINOs, wouldn't they love that?\"\n\nThe younger Trump acknowledged that he was pulling for Vance, and said he \"has no inside information, obviously, but if I did I probably wouldn't tell you anyway.\"\n\nDuring a press conference earlier in the day, Florida Democratic Party Chair Nikki Fried promised the party would be on the \"front lines\" to oppose Rubio and would \"have stories to tell.\"\n\n\"We are the ones who've had to deal with Marco Rubio for the last few decades here in our state ... If he is going to decide to run for vice president of the United States, the No. 1 issue is he will once again have abandoned the people of this state,\" Fried said. She was alluding to how Rubio frequently missed hearings and votes in the Senate -- an issue he came under attack for when he ran for president in 2016 and during his 2022 reelection campaign, though that year he easily kept his seat.\n\nFried also criticized Rubio for comparing Trump's trial in Manhattan to those in communist Cuba.\n\n\"He is more concerned about kissing the ring than understanding where he came from,\" she said.\n\nHouse members from the Florida delegation who spoke at the rally didn't mention Rubio, instead focusing on praising Trump and ridiculing Biden's debate performance. They did, however, make overtures the Hispanic community, a crucial voting bloc in Florida -- especially in Miami-Dade, which is home to many voters of Cuban descent and where Trump's golf course is located.\n\n\"I would like to send a message to the Hispanic community across the country,\" said Rep.

At one point, Trump, 79, said that Biden has spent nearly 50% of his presidency on vacation -- though, according to a Washington Post analysis from last year, both presidents spent roughly the same amount of time away from the White House.\n\nAnd, since this night's rally was held on the 10th hole of Trump National Doral Golf Course, began with a handful of golf riffs -- including challenging Biden to a round of golf, a callback to a golf-centric spat the two got into on the debate stage. Biden campaign spokesperson James Singer panned the golf challenge, saying in a statement: \"Donald Trump is a liar, a convict, and a fraud only out for himself - par for the course.\"\n\n\"We'd challenge Donald Trump to create jobs, but he lost 3 million,\" Singer said. \"We'd challenge Donald Trump to stand up to Putin, but he bent the knee to him. We'd challenge Donald Trump to follow the law, but he breaks it ... Joe Biden doesn't have time for Donald Trump's weird antics -- he's busy leading America and defending the free world.\"\n\nTrump reveled in the Democratic panic in the days since the debate.\n\n\"Our victory was so absolute that Joe's own party now wants him to throw in the towel and surrender the presidency after a single 90-minute performance,\" Trump said. \"They want 'Crooked Joe' out of the race. It's a shame the way they're treating him. But don't feel sorry for him. He's a very bad guy.\"\n\nThough Tuesday's rally was much like any other Trump rally -- including repeated jokes at Biden's expense, continuous attacks on immigrants, racist dogwhistles about Black and Hispanic jobs, knocks on NATO, which is holding a summit in Washington this week, and assertions that Biden will allow a third world war to happen on his watch -- two significant things set it apart.\n\nFirst, he took time to insult Vice President Kamala Harris, introducing (and spelling out) a new nickname, a common move for people he's going to relentlessly attack: \"Laffin' Kamala,\" who he said is an incompetent, responsible for both the immigration \"invasion\" at the border and the Russian invasion of Ukraine. Harris, as Biden's vice president, is the person most expected to be his successor in the race for the White House should Biden step aside.\n\nSecond, Trump hinted at the possibility of naming his vice presidential nominee, even suggesting as such on his personal social media platform, Truth Social. Two hopefuls were in attendance on Tuesday: Sen. Marco Rubio and Rep. Byron Donalds, both representing Florida. And though he name-dropped both repeatedly (and, during a riff on the price of food, asked Donalds to stand up, saying \"Byron loves bacon!\") Trump left the stage without naming a running mate.\n\nAt one point, Trump pointed out the media attention surrounding Tuesday's event and quipped, \"I think they probably think I'm going to be announcing that Marco is going to be vice president.\"\n\nHe made another reference to Rubio when he talked about his proposal to eliminate taxes on tips, saying of the Florida lawmaker: \"Marco you're going to vote for it, I hope. Well, you may or may not be there to vote for it. But you'll be involved.\"\n\nHours before the call, first lady Jill Biden and the Biden-Harris campaign took to head off Trump's attacks, attacking the former president both on his alleged ties to the Project 2025 presidential transition agenda and on deeply conservative actions on abortion.\n\n\"Donald Trump is trying to tell women he's a moderate on reproductive rights. Does he think we forgot that his Supreme Court justices killed Roe v. Wade and that he brags about it? Does he think we don't know that he wants to roll back access to contraception and he could jeopardize IVF treatments? Does he think he can pivot away from a career of diminishing and denigrating women?\" the first lady told reporters on Tuesday. \"Well, women haven't forgotten, and we can't be fooled. Donald Trump has spent years telling us exactly who he is, and we believe him.\"\n\nThe Project 2025 agenda, which has been slowly and steadily growing in the public consciousness in recent weeks, is a presidential transition roadmap for conservative governance under a second Trump presidency -- and it's spearheaded by the Heritage Foundation, a conservative organization which has hugely influenced every Republican presidency since Reagan. Among its many objectives, Project 2025 seeks to replace tens of thousands of federal civil service employees as political appointees, so as to pack the government with party loyalists; it also seeks to center conservative Christian values.\n\nWithin the first six pages of its 900 page \"2025 Mandate for Leadership\" -- the \"first pillar\" of the project -- it pledges to remove terms like \"sexual orientation,\" \"gender identity,\" \"diversity,\" \"equity,\" \"inclusion,\" \"abortion\" and \"every other term used to deprive Americans of their First Amendment rights\" from federal rules, grants, regulations and legislation; it also seeks to ban pornography, bend school boards to serve their purpose or lose federal funding, attacks technology firms, and pledges that the decision that overturned Roe v. Wade \"is just the beginning\" in the fight against abortion.\n\n(Trump has denied his endorsement of Project 2025 and recently attempted to distance himself from it, though many of the authors of the project's first volume are alumni of his administration.)\n\n\"MAGA politicians, with the blessing of Donald J. Trump, have inserte themselves into women's deeply personal health care decisions,\" said Rep. Veronica Escobar, D-Texas. \"They are threatening doctors with prison time and in the process, they are endangering women's health and lives.\"\n\nAna Navarro, a conservative strategist, commentator and self-proclaimed NeverTrumper, joined the call as well -- and when asked about Marco Rubio's status as a hopeful for Trump's vice president, she scoffed.\n\n\"He was a very different Marco Rubio in 2016 when he was criticizing Donald Trump and attacking Donald Trump than he is today. Today, he could probably win an Olympic medal for sucking up and for turning into a completely different person,\" Navarro said. \"I've witnessed his metamorphosis.

Some Democrats have started calling for Biden to step down as their presumptive nominee following his dismal debate performance last month.\n\nBoth Biden, 81, and Trump, 78, are at least two decades older than most American presidents have been, according to the Pew Research Center, which said the median age for all U.S. presidents on their first inauguration is 55 years old. But that has not stopped Trump from arguing he is stronger than Biden, who repeatedly stumbled, paused and could not complete sentences at times during the June 27 debate. Trump was criticized by Democrats for making false statements during the debate about the Jan. 6, 2021, riot at the U.S. Capitol and suggesting immigrants entering the U.S. illegally were taking so-called \"Black jobs\" and \"Hispanic jobs.\"\n\nIn an interview Monday with Fox News Channel's Sean Hannity, Trump said he thought Biden \"might very well stay in\" the race. \"Nobody to wants to give that up that way,\" Trump added. \"He is going to feel badly about himself for a long time. It's hard to give it up that way, the way where they're trying to force him out.\"\n\nIn the Miami suburb of Doral, Trump will underscore his strong support in a former battleground state that has now shifted toward the GOP. U.S. Sen. Marco Rubio, a Miami native and one of the contenders for the vice presidential post, will be attending the rally along with other Florida politicians.\n\nKevin Cabrera, a Miami-Dade County commissioner who was Florida state director for Trump's 2020 reelection campaign and is set to speak at the rally, said to expect an \"overwhelming show of unity.\"\n\n\"The rally will display our unified front, showcasing a stark contrast to the Democrats, who are lost and fighting with each other over Biden's health and ability to continue,\" Cabrera said.\n\nThe presumptive GOP nominee will also touch on Biden's handling of immigration and the economy, highlighting the rise in home prices and goods. Trump will also talk about how Florida is affected by the increasing arrivals of immigrants as the final destination for many people illegally crossing the U.S.-Mexico border.\n\nThe leadership crisis among Democrats has perhaps given Trump a reason to wait for his VP announcement so as to not draw attention away from Biden's woes. Senior advisers and key allies say they still don't know whom Trump will choose as his running mate, and many believe the choice is still in flux.", "source": {"uri": "washingtontimes.com",

On Doral's Blue Monster considered one of the greatest tournament golf courses anywhere in the world,' Trump said. 'It will be among the most-watched sporting events in history.'\n\nVia a spokesperson, Biden put out an immediate response to the missive from Trump shortly after.\n\nHe refused to take him up on a debate - perhaps considering his disastrous performance last time around - but instead offered up a few challenges of his own.\n\n'We'd challenge Donald Trump to create jobs, but he lost 3 million,' the statement read.\n\n'We'd challenge Donald Trump to stand up to Putin, but he bent the knee to him.'\n\n'We'd challenge Donald Trump to follow the law, but he breaks it.'\n\n'We'd challenge Donald Trump to not destroy our country, but that's all his Project 2025 aims to do.'\n\nThe statement finished: 'Joe Biden doesn't have time for Donald Trump's weird antics - he's busy leading America and defending the free world.'\n\nThe ex-president first said he wanted to debate Biden again - 'next week' - which would coincide with the Republican National Convention. Biden is due to debate Trump a second time already, but on September 10.\n\nThen, Trump issued Biden to a challenge at his favorite sport after the two argued about it at the first debate.\n\n'I will even give Joe Biden 10 strokes aside, 10 strokes, that's a lot. That means 20 strokes in case you don't play golf,' he continued.\n\n'And if he wins I will give the charity of his choice - any charity that he wants - 10 million dollars,' the ex-president added. 'And I bet he doesn't take the offer.'\n\nBoth men are keen golfers and Trump used his hobby to push back on questions about how he would fare at the end of a second presidential term, when he would be 82 years old.\n\n'I just won two club championships -- not even senior, two regular club championships,' he boasted.\n\n'To do that, you have to be quite smart, and you have to be able to hit the ball a long way. And I do it. He doesn't do it.

He did not confirm who he would choose, but Senators JD Vance, Marco Rubio, Tim Scott, and Governor Doug Burgum are among the options. In a television interview, the former president said that he has not made up his mind, but these people are under consideration. He also said in the first interview after the first presidential debate that he may wait until it is clear whether Joe Biden will be the Democrat nominee or not.\n\nThe incumbent president was severely criticized for his poor performance in the June 27 presidential debate. But Donald Trump said that this debate may or may not affect the selection of a vice presidential candidate. He also said that he would choose someone who can help him win. Just before Trump's interview, AP reported that the choice was still up in the air and the closest aide to the Republican contender and longtime allies do not know who will be chosen to join him in the polls.\n\nAlso Read: Kamala Harris unlikely to save the Democrats even if she replaces Biden, says a professor who accurately predicted 9 of the last 10 elections\n\nTalking to NBC earlier in June, Trump said that he knew who he would pick.

He will be traveling to Pennsylvania, a critical battleground state, for an afternoon rally at the Butler Farm Show on Saturday. The time and place of the second rally is important and Trump can use this opportunity to unveil his pick if it is Florida Senator Marco Rubio, a Miami native who plans to attend. The rally will be held outside of Pittsburgh, not far from the border of Ohio, which is the state JD Vance represents and this place may be another possible announcement.\n\nAlso Read: U.S Presidential Election 2024: Democrats running out of time, more representatives want Joe Biden out\n\nWho may be the running mate of Donald Trump in the 2024 US Presidential Election?\n\nDonald Trump has said that he may announce the name of his running mate in two weeks and Senators JD Vance, Marco Rubio, Tim Scott, and Governor Doug Burgum are among the options.

There's no reason to insert yourself in that conversation.\"\n\nIn Florida on Tuesday night, before a loyal crowd at the Doral golf club he owns, and in the first of two rallies he is staging this week, the presumptive Republican nominee is expected to revert to his usually voluble self - at least if messaging from inside his campaign is a guide.\n\nTrump's media office did not respond to a question from the Guardian seeking confirmation that the campaign was deliberately avoiding talking much about Biden's shaky debate performance. But in a statement, Trump acolytes attacked the president's \"flailing candidacy\" and urged him to stay in the race.\n\n\"Please keep doing these interviews,\" said Jake Schneider, rapid response director for the Republican National Committee (RNC), referring to Biden calling into MSNBC's Morning Joe on Monday and insisting \"I am not going anywhere.\"\n\nOnly in Biden's mind, the statement said, \"is his defiance helping his case as a steady drip of Democrats call for a change at the top of their ticket\".\n\nSome senior Democrats also have thoughts on the former president's silence, including David Axelrod, a senior adviser for the Obama White House, whose relationship with Biden has been fractious.\n\n\"Trump's not talking much about Biden's bad debate. Trump's campaign is not blitzing ads about it. And Lara Trump [RNC co-chair and Trump's daughter-in-law] said last week it would be an affront to democracy if Biden were not the nominee,\" he wrote Monday on X.\n\n\"Why do you think they are uncharacteristically holding fire?\"\n\nIt is also possible that Trump is more concerned about advancing his own campaign, notably who to choose as his running mate one week before the Republican national convention in Milwaukee will confirm his third run at the White House as a Republican candidate.\n\nAmong those who will attend Tuesday's rally is Marco Rubio, a senior Florida US senator, believed to be one of the leading contenders for Trump's vice-presidential pick. A failed challenger to Trump for the Republican presidential nomination in 2016, when Mike Pence emerged as Trump's running mate, Rubio said on CNN on Sunday that he had \"heard nothing\".\n\n\"Donald Trump has a decision to make. He'll make it when he needs to make it. He'll make a good decision,\" he said.\n\nSpeculation has grown that the Doral event will provide Trump the perfect opportunity to unveil Rubio, particularly as Jason Miller, a senior Trump adviser, told Fox News on Monday that a decision was imminent.\n\nTrump will also rally Saturday at Pittsburgh's Butler Farm Show, close to Pennsylvania's border with Ohio, where JD Vance - another understood to be on the shortlist - is a senator.\n\nVance, on NBC's Meet the Press on Sunday, also attempted to dampen expectations. \"I have not gotten the call,\" he said.\n\n\"Whoever his vice-president is, he's got a lot of good people he could choose from, it's the policies that worked and the leadership style that worked for the American people.\"\n\nMiller's comments, meanwhile, hinted that Trump might also choose to wait to see if Biden drops out before declaring his hand.\n\n\"I look ahead as a campaign strategist to what does that vice-presidential debate look like,\" he said, citing the hypothesis that Kamala Harris, Biden's vice-president, would replace him at the top of the ticket.\n\n\"We don't know if that's going to be Kamala, or maybe they swap her out for someone who's even more liberal, more extreme, although that might be tough to do.\"\n\nThe Trump campaign's announcement of the Doral rally, meanwhile, gave little indication of what he will talk about, other than how the Biden administration was \"having catastrophic consequences on Floridians\", economically and in terms of immigration.\n\n\"Florida is a place near and dear to president Trump's heart as his home state,\" it said, referring to his Mar-a-Lago mansion in Palm Beach.\n\nTrump holds a solid 10-point advantage over Biden in Florida, according to fivethirtyeight.com's average of polls.", "source":

Just name the place, anytime, anywhere,\" Trump added.\n\nBiden, the Democratic nominee, performed poorly at the June 27 presidential debate in Atlanta, after which even his own party colleagues are asking him to drop from the race. Biden has rejected such calls.\n\nAt the same rally, Trump then challenged Biden to an 18-hole golf match.\n\n\"I'm also officially challenging Joe to an 18-hole golf match right here,\" he said.\n\n\"If he wins, I will give the charity of his choice, any charity that he wants, USD 1 million. And I'll bet you he doesn't take the offer. ...What that match will do is prove that Joe is, in fact, all talk and no action,\" Trump said.\n\nThe Biden Campaign has rejected both the challenges.\n\n\"Joe Biden doesn't have time for Donald Trump's weird antics - he's busy leading America and defending the free world. Donald Trump is a liar, a convict, and a fraud only out for himself - par for the course,\" Biden-Harris 2024 Spokesperson James Singer said.\n\n\"Donald Trump hasn't been seen in public for 12 days; now he's inviting fictional serial killers to dinner, teasing lil' Marco Rubio, praising Project 2025 architect Tom Homan, and challenging the President of the United States to golf. We'd challenge Donald Trump to create jobs, but he lost 3 million,\" he said.

Trump walked up to the line to name his choice to be the Republican vice-presidential nominee, even teasing the crowd with the name of the state's own Sen. Marco Rubio to the thousands gathered at the 10th hole of the Trump National Doral Miami golf course for his Tuesday evening rally.\n\nThe tease came as the president was extolling his employment numbers compared to employment under President Joseph R. Biden Jr.\n\n\"Joe Biden's sharp numbers are fake. They're fake numbers, and the fake media -- notice they don't look at all of them,\" Trump said before looking out at the media riser and the number of reporters and cameras.\n\nTurning his head, he made an aside to Rubio: \"Oh, that's a lot, Marco. That's a lot, Marco.\"\n\nThen, to the crowd, he said: \"I think they probably think I'm going to be announcing that Marco's going to be vice president.\"\n\nLater, when the president was introducing the special guests attending, he explained to the crowd that he and Rubio had become friends despite their nasty exchanges during the 2016 primaries.\n\n\"We're thrilled to be joined tonight by many fantastic Florida patriots, including a man who's become really a friend of mine,\" Trump said.\n\n\"We had a vicious campaign for a while, and he was tough, and he was smart, and I got to really know him well over the years, and he was a fantastic guy: Senator Marco Rubio,\" he said.\n\nIn addition to the politicians in the audience, Barron Trump attended what his father said was his first rally, and when the crowd reacted so enthusiastically, the president joked to his other sons, Donald Jr. and Eric, that Barron might be more popular than them.\n\nRubio spoke to the crowd before the president came out, and he made some of his most pointed criticisms of his former senatorial colleague.\n\nThe senator said that as he watched the June 27 debate between Trump and President Biden, he grew anxious over the national security threat Biden's condition posed to the country. \"My gawd, that's the president of the United States -- who is running our country right now?\"\n\nRubio said he then realized that the debate was being watched by our adversaries in Beijing, Moscow, Havana, and North Korea.\n\n\"They're watching it in Iran, and they're saying: 'That guy's the president? We're going to invade tomorrow.' That's what I would do,\" he said.\n\nRubio said his second outrage from the debate was his realization that everyone close to Biden for the last three-and-a-half years was lying about his condition.\n\n\"If you had said anything about Joe Biden 20 minutes before the debate, they would have said: 'That's a lie. It's a conspiracy,'\" he said.\n\n\"The only conspiracy here are the people in the shadow government that are protecting and hiding from the American people the condition of our current president -- and it puts our country in danger.\"\n\nIf this appearance by Rubio was his final audition to be Trump's running mate, the senator made the most of it.\n\nHis ease with the crowd was endearing, and he broke up his serious policy talk with quips off the top of his head. At one point, he said that Vice President Kamala Harris was so leftist that she wanted to ban plastic straws.\n\nRubio waited for a beat and exclaimed: \"Those paper straws suck.\"\n\nMy RedState colleague Levon Satamian also covered the Trump rally and the president's charge that Biden chose Harris, as a protection against being deposed in his piece: \"WATCH: Trump Comes Out Swinging, Torches Kamala Harris.\"\n\nLater, Rubio apologized for wanting to make some remarks in Spanish, but then when he was done, he explained to those who did not speak Spanish: \"I said: 'I saved a lot of money with GEICO.\"\n\nIn an incredible example of message discipline, Trump has remained mostly quiet as Biden and the leaders of the Democratic Party struggle to resolve what to do after Biden's poor debate performance.\n\nBefore the debate, Trump would ridicule Biden for getting lost on stage or not being able to find the stairs -- sometimes even walking around as if in a stupor.\n\nThis time, Trump held fire or rather held fire as best could be expected.\n\nAt one point, Trump was making fun of Biden's constant talk of protecting democracy when he stopped, pointed to his head, and said, \"This guy,\" inferring that something was wrong with Biden's head.\n\nTrump refrained from attacking Biden for being old, choosing instead to focus on Biden's reputation for stupidity.\n\nRELATED: BREAKING: Trump Challenges Biden to a Debate 'This Week'\n\nand to 18 Holes of Golf\n\nIn a classic Trumpian aside, the president brought up a conversation he had with Sen. Edward M. \"Teddy\" Kennedy Sr. about Biden.\n\nTrump said he became friendly with Kennedy because the senator used to spend time at the family's Palm Beach compound.\n\nThe story came up as Trump was criticizing work ethic and making the point that Biden may seem mentally diminished now, but he was never considered bright.\n\n\"Kennedy was actually in front of a neighbor of mine,\" Trump said.\n\n\"I did him a favor, and he liked me,\" he said.\n\nTrump said one time, he asked Kennedy who was the smartest senator. \"He gave me a name, but I won't say it because I can't stand the guy,\" then looking at Rubio: \"I'll tell you later, Marco, it wasn't you because you weren't there yet.\"\n\nThen, Trump said he asked Kennedy who was the dumbest senator.\n\n\"He goes: 'Probably Joe.' This is like 20 years ago, I said: 'Who's Joe? He said, Joe Biden.\"", "source": {"uri": "redstate.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Redstate"}, "authors": [{"uri": "neil_w_mccabe@redstate.com", "name": "Neil W.

But he appears in no rush as much of the attention is still centered on questions about Biden's ability to govern for another four-year term. Some Democrats have started calling for Biden to step down as their presumptive nominee following his dismal debate performance last month.\n\n\"Our victory was so absolute that Joe's own party now wants him to throw in the towel and surrender the presidency after a single 90-minute performance,\" Trump said Tuesday night. \"They want 'Crooked Joe' out of the race. It's a shame the way they're treating him. But don't feel sorry for him. He's a very bad guy.\"\n\nTrump also laced into Vice President Kamala Harris, who has become a focus of the former president and his allies as speculation has mounted that she would replace Biden as the Democratic nominee. Trump called her \"Laughing Kamala,\" and referred to the \"Biden-Harris administration,\" rather than just pinning actions on Biden, as he had for months, as he criticized their immigration policies.\n\n\"Despite all the Democrat panic this week, the truth is, it doesn't matter who they nominate -- because we are going to beat any one of them in a thundering landslides and this November's going to be amazing,\" he said.\n\nBoth Biden, 81, and Trump, 78, are at least two decades older than most American presidents have been, according to the Pew Research Center, which said the median age for all U.S. presidents on their first inauguration is 55 years old. But that has not stopped Trump from arguing he is stronger than Biden, who repeatedly stumbled, paused and could not complete sentences at times during the June 27 debate. Trump was criticized by Democrats for making false statements during the debate about the Jan. 6, 2021, riot at the U.S. Capitol and suggesting immigrants entering the U.S. illegally were taking so-called \"Black jobs\" and \"Hispanic jobs.\"\n\nIn an interview Monday with Fox News Channel's Sean Hannity, Trump said he thought Biden \"might very well stay in\" the race. \"Nobody to wants to give that up that way,\" Trump added. \"He is going to feel badly about himself for a long time. It's hard to give it up that way, the way where they're trying to force him out.\"\n\nIn the Miami suburb of Doral, Trump underscored his strong support in a former battleground state that has now shifted toward the GOP. U.S. Sen. Marco Rubio, a Miami native and one of the contenders for the vice presidential post, was among the Florida politicians who spoke at the event.\n\nRubio, the son of Cuban immigrants, is seen as a potential running mate who could help Trump as he tries to secure support from Hispanic Americans, a point the senator emphasized in his remarks as he switched several times in his remarks to Spanish.\n\nThe senator did not openly acknowledge any of the speculation about him joining Trump as a running mate. He instead skewered not only Biden, whom he called \"the figurehead of a left-wing government, shadow government,\" but Harris, whom he would need to debate head-on if he's chosen for Trump's ticket.\n\nRubio referred to Harris not by name at first but called her Biden's \"replacement\" and \"a real-life, verified left-winger.\" At another point in his remarks, he mocked the way Harris laughs.\n\nHe notably seemed to insert himself into Trump's signature \"Make America Great Again\" slogan by saying: \"Together, we're not just going to make it great again. We elect this man as president, we will make together America greater than it has ever been.\"\n\nToday's Top Headlines\n\nStory continues below\n\nSC restaurateurs charged with bilking federal pandemic loan programs out of $591K A good neighbor's bad decision.

The answer is more complicated than you might think.\n\nThousands of people turned out in the humid summer evening for the rally. Attendees were fanning themselves and holding signs featuring Trump's mug shot, along with others that said, \"You're fired!\" -- Trump's signature phrase on his former reality show, \"The Apprentice.\"\n\nOne man, 28-year-old Austin Stiglin, said he traveled from northern Florida to participate in his first Trump rally. He was wearing a star-patterned navy blue jacket and red pants and said he was \"tired of the left telling him to vote left just because I am gay.\"\n\n\"I have a lot more to say than just my sexual orientation,\" Stiglin said. \"I would like to vote for policies that support the United States.\"\n\nNicole Farrell, a 57-year-old immigrant from Trinidad, said she voted for Trump in 2020, \"but I was not a strong supporter like now. I just preferred him over Biden.\"\n\nFarrell said she specifically likes Trump's hardline immigration policies, which include plans for mass raids and the largest deportation operation in U.S. history.\n\n\"I am an immigrant but I came here legally. They need to come here legally,\" Farrell said of migrants coming to the U.S.\n\nThe presumptive GOP nominee is expected in his remarks to touch on Biden's handling of immigration and the economy, highlighting the rise in home prices and goods. Trump will also talk about how Florida is affected by the increasing arrivals of immigrants as the final destination for many people illegally crossing the U.S.-Mexico border.\n\nThe leadership crisis among Democrats has perhaps given Trump a reason to wait for his VP announcement so as to not draw attention away from Biden's woes. Senior advisers and key allies say they still don't know whom Trump will choose as his running mate, and many believe the choice is still in flux.\n\nSpeaking on MSNBC Monday, Biden criticized Trump for not having held events since the debate and suggested he had been \"riding around in his golf cart.\"\n\nPrice reported from New York.", "source": {"uri": "postandcourier.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Post and Courier"}, "authors": [{"uri": "associated_press@postandcourier.com", "name": "Associated Press", "type": "author", "isAgency": true}, {"uri": "michelle_l_price@postandcourier.com", "name": "Michelle L.

Biden, he insisted, had raised the price of bacon four-fold.\n\n\"We don't eat bacon anymore,\" Trump said.\n\nElectric cars, he said, \"cheated\" the US public because drivers had to stop for three hours to recharge their vehicles after every 45 minutes of driving. And, in an echo of one of the more bizarre debate exchanges with Biden over who was the better golfer, he challenged his White House successor to 18 holes over the Doral course while granting a 10-stroke concession.\n\n\"It will be among the most watched sporting events in history, maybe bigger than the Ryder Cup or even the Masters,\" Trump said, pledging $1m to a charity of Biden's choosing if he lost.\n\nReturning to politics, Trump assailed Democrats for tax rises he said they wanted to impose; criticized Biden for the US military's chaotic 2021 withdrawal from Afghanistan; and promised to build an \"iron dome\" missile defense system for the US, if he was elected in November.\n\nPerhaps worn down by the energy-sapping humidity, the crowd appeared mostly subdued, including yawns in the bleachers behind him as Trump drew to a close with slow music playing, and others tapping disinterestedly on their phones.\n\nHis campaign had touted the possibility of Trump announcing a vice-presidential pick on Tuesday, but in the end his only reference to the post was suggesting that Rubio might or might not still be in the Senate to vote to allow Nevada waitresses to keep their tips untaxed.\n\nThere was no mention of Ohio senator JD Vance, or North Dakota governor Doug Burgum, other Republicans said to be on the shortlist. Trump will rally again on Saturday in Pennsylvania, close to the Ohio border, with Vance expected to be a speaker.\n\nEarlier on Tuesday, Democrats, on a Biden campaign call featuring first lady Jill Biden, and previewing Trump's Doral rally, mocked him for his low-key approach since the debate.\n\n\"I hope he hasn't exhausted himself with all the golf that he's been playing,\" Texas congresswoman Veronica Escobar said.\n\nRelated: What is Project 2025 and what is Trump's involvement?\n\n\"Speaking of staying off the campaign trail, Trump has been hiding a lot recently, not just from voters and from the press, but from Project 2025.\n\n\"Donald Trump tried to pretend that he had nothing to do with Project 2025 despite the fact that it was written for him by the people who know him best. And yesterday, his campaign preview of the RNC platform, was just as unhinged and extreme as Trump himself. They left out some of the most unpopular specifics that we know they support.\n\n\"As usual, they're trying to hide the ball from the American public.\"\n\nTrump, in his speech Tuesday, avoided mention of Project 2025 or his policy on abortion.", "source": {"uri": "aol.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo News"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

Just name the place, anytime, anywhere.\"\n\nThe offer is not a practical one given Biden is in Washington, D.C., this week attending the NATO summit with other world leaders before heading to Detroit on Friday to campaign. The two men are scheduled to hold a second debate in September, which Biden's campaign has said he plans to attend.\n\nTrump also referenced an exchange during the June debate in which he and Biden squabbled over their golf handicaps, and Biden challenged Trump to play golf \"if you carry your own bag,\" suggesting Trump couldn't handle it physically.\n\n\"That's why this evening I am also...officially challenging crooked Joe to an 18-hole golf match,\" Trump said, suggesting it be held on his golf course in Doral and be televised.\n\nThe former president offered to give Biden a 20-stroke advantage and donate $1 million to a charity of Biden's choice if the president prevailed. The Washington Post reported at length in 2016 that Trump did not follow through on some of his claims of charitable giving.\n\nBiden's stumbling debate performance, in which he struggled to complete his train of thought and stood with his mouth agape as Trump spoke, has set off a debate within the Democratic Party over whether he should remain the nominee.\n\nSeven House Democrats have publicly urged Biden to stand down as the nominee. Several Democrats in the House and Senate have said Biden must do more to show he can aggressively campaign and make the case for a second term.\n\nBut the overwhelming majority of Democratic lawmakers have rallied behind Biden as the president has made clear he has no plans to step aside.

Biden, he insisted, had raised the price of bacon four-fold.\n\n\"We don't eat bacon anymore,\" Trump said.\n\nElectric cars, he said, \"cheated\" the US public because drivers had to stop for three hours to recharge their vehicles after every 45 minutes of driving. And, in an echo of one of the more bizarre debate exchanges with Biden over who was the better golfer, he challenged his White House successor to 18 holes over the Doral course while granting a 10-stroke concession.\n\n\"It will be among the most watched sporting events in history, maybe bigger than the Ryder Cup or even the Masters,\" Trump said, pledging $1m to a charity of Biden's choosing if he lost.\n\nReturning to politics, Trump assailed Democrats for tax rises he said they wanted to impose; criticized Biden for the US military's chaotic 2021 withdrawal from Afghanistan; and promised to build an \"iron dome\" missile defense system for the US, if he was elected in November.\n\nPerhaps worn down by the energy-sapping humidity, the crowd appeared mostly subdued, including yawns in the bleachers behind him as Trump drew to a close with slow music playing, and others tapping disinterestedly on their phones.\n\nHis campaign had touted the possibility of Trump announcing a vice-presidential pick on Tuesday, but in the end his only reference to the post was suggesting that Rubio might or might not still be in the Senate to vote to allow Nevada waitresses to keep their tips untaxed.\n\nThere was no mention of Ohio senator JD Vance, or North Dakota governor Doug Burgum, other Republicans said to be on the shortlist. Trump will rally again on Saturday in Pennsylvania, close to the Ohio border, with Vance expected to be a speaker.\n\nEarlier on Tuesday, Democrats, on a Biden campaign call featuring first lady Jill Biden, and previewing Trump's Doral rally, mocked him for his low-key approach since the debate.\n\n\"I hope he hasn't exhausted himself with all the golf that he's been playing,\" Texas congresswoman Veronica Escobar said.\n\n\"Speaking of staying off the campaign trail, Trump has been hiding a lot recently, not just from voters and from the press, but from Project 2025.\n\n\"Donald Trump tried to pretend that he had nothing to do with Project 2025 despite the fact that it was written for him by the people who know him best. And yesterday, his campaign preview of the RNC platform, was just as unhinged and extreme as Trump himself. They left out some of the most unpopular specifics that we know they support.\n\n\"As usual, they're trying to hide the ball from the American public.\"\n\nTrump, in his speech Tuesday, avoided mention of Project 2025 or his policy on abortion.", "source": {"uri": "theguardian.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Guardian"}, "authors": [{"uri": "richard_luscombe@theguardian.com", "name":

Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D-N.Y., and fellow members of the House's progressive \"Squad\" caucus Reps. Ilhan Omar, D-Minn., and Ayanna Pressley, D-Mass.\n\nIn the upper chamber, Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer on Tuesday repeatedly stated, \"I'm with Joe,\" when pressed by reporters about efforts to pressure Biden, Politico reported.\n\nBiden now appears to also have the support of the Congressional Hispanic Caucus and the Congressional Black Caucus.\n\nAll eyes turn to Trump\n\nAs changes to the Democratic ticket appear increasingly unlikely, the remaining issue before the general election takes shape is that of the Republican ticket.\n\nTrump, who was elected president in 2016 and lost reelection in 2020, has essentially remained mum since the debate, preferring instead to allow Democrats to attack Biden and push for his ouster from the ticket. But with that media cycle seemingly poised to end, he is likely to reenter the spotlight amid speculation over his choice of vice president.\n\nDuring an appearance this week on Fox News, Trump told host Sean Hannity that he had been playing his cards close to the vest because \"we wanted to see what they're doing, to be honest. Because, you know, it might make a difference,\" according to the Associated Press.\n\nTrump has not yet announced his choice of running mate and Trump campaign senior adviser Jason Miller on Monday appeared to indicate that Trump had not made the decision, likening the abundance of viable options to an \"embarrassment of riches\" during an appearance on Fox News.\n\nEven the timing of Trump's announcement itself remains somewhat unclear, though Miller indicated that \"[b]y this time next Monday, we will know who President Trump has selected as his running mate for the 2024 election.\"\n\n\"It could happen any time this week. Could happen literally right up until the first day of the convention,\" he also said.\n\nThe Republican National Convention is slated for July 15-18. Each day will feature a different theme derived from Trump's \"Make America Great Again\" slogan.\n\nThe short list\n\nAmong the candidates most discussed as potential running mates to Trump are Ohio Sen. J.D. Vance, Florida Sen. Marco Rubio, and North Dakota Gov. Doug Burgum.\n\nVance indicated on Sunday during an appearance on NBC News's \"Meet the Press\" that he had not received a call from Trump asking him to be his running mate.\n\n\"We'll let the media know if I ever get that call. But most importantly, we're just trying to work to elect Donald Trump,\" he said. \"Whoever his vice president is, he's got a lot of good people he could choose from.\"\n\nAlso, on Sunday, Rubio told CNN that \"I've heard nothing, I know nothing, and you probably know more than I do about it. ... Donald Trump has a decision to make.\n\n\"He'll make it when he needs to make it. He'll make a good decision. I know for certain that I will be out there over the next three or four months, working on behalf of his campaign in some capacity.\"\n\nBurgum has emerged as an unlikely candidate to run with Trump and the pair have exchanged fond words for one another, even after he challenged Trump in the primary.\n\nTrump's announcement could come at any time, either at the convention itself, during a media appearance, or even through a post on Truth Social.\n\nBen Whedon is an editor and reporter for Just the News.

Trump said his campaign was waiting to make an announcement to see how the backlash surrounding Biden's debate performance would affect the race.\n\nTrump would be the first nominee since former President George H.W. Bush to announce his vice presidential pick at the convention, rather than before, according to the American Presidency Project at the University of California Santa Barbara. Bush announced former Vice President Dan Quayle on the second-to-last day of the Republican National Convention in August 1988. Trump announced former Vice President Mike Pence as his running mate three days before the convention in 2016.\n\nSeveral early rumored contenders have reportedly been eliminated from the potential shortlist. Arizona Republican Senate candidate Kari Lake is no longer in the running, The Washington Post reported, citing five unnamed sources who said Trump has sought to distance himself from her, concerned that she will lose the Arizona Senate race and he'll be associated with her loss. South Dakota Gov. Kristi Noem, who Trump previously said was a \"solid\" potential pick, is widely viewed to have tanked her VP chances after admitting in her new book that she shot and killed her family's \"untrainable\" and \"dangerous\" 14-month-old puppy, then turned her gun on one of her \"nasty and mean\" goats. Trump denied a May report that his one-time challenger, former South Carolina Gov. Nikki Haley (who has not endorsed Trump since dropping out of the race, but recently said she would vote for him) was in the running, and instead told News 12 Thursday she would likely be \"on our team in some form\" if he's elected again. Trump has also ruled out his former GOP primary challenger, biotech entrepreneur Vivek Ramaswamy, and is instead considering him for a cabinet position, Bloomberg reported in March, citing sources. Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis raised speculation he was in the VP running when he met with Trump in Miami in April, The Washington Post reported, but the meeting was reportedly about enlisting DeSantis' donor network to help Trump and burying the hatchet after their contentious primary battle.\n\nThe 12th Amendment prohibits a state's electors from voting for a presidential and vice presidential candidate who are both from the same state, which could rule out DeSantis and Rubio. Trump changed his official residency from New York to Florida in 2019. But there are potential workarounds. Trump may not need Florida's 30 electors to clinch the 270-vote threshold needed to officially win the presidency if he wins by a wide enough margin, an unlikely scenario, according to polls. Rubio or DeSantis could also change their residency to another state, as former Vice President Dick Cheney did days before former President George W. Bush nominated him as his running mate. Cheney lived in Texas at the time and switched his residency to Wyoming. The switch may be harder for Rubio or DeSantis, however, since they hold elected office in the state, Florida Atlantic University political science professor Ken Wagner noted to the Miami Herald.\n\nSeveral of the candidates have clear downsides. Rubio and DeSantis would draw the same base of home-state voters as Trump, as they're all from Florida, something Rubio mentioned when asked by Fox News in January about the prospect of joining Trump's ticket. Stefanik represents a solidly blue state that Trump almost certainly can't win. And Scott broke with Trump's GOP allies in Congress and voted to certify the results of the 2020 presidential election. Vance was also critical of Trump when he ran in 2016, publicly blasting him for his anti-immigrant and anti-Muslim policies and rhetoric, though Vance has since apologized and earned Trump's endorsement in his 2022 Senate bid. Trump has a thorny history with Pence, who dropped out of the GOP presidential race in October. Pence has publicly criticized Trump for urging him not to certify the results of the 2020 presidential election, which he refused to do, claiming Trump asked him to \"choose between him and the Constitution.\" Trump has countered that Pence is \"delusional.\"\n\nTrump and President Joe Biden clinched their respective parties' nominations on March 12, making the 2024 primary season one of the shortest in decades. The Republican National Committee is set to formalize Trump's nomination at its convention, and the Democratic National Committee will hold its convention in Chicago in August. Trump has made no public indications of who he will select as vice president, but wants someone with experience and a measured demeanor, the New York Times reported, citing sources who said Trump is tight-lipped about who he might be leaning toward behind closed doors. Trump senior adviser Brian Hughes told NBC in early June \"anyone claiming to know who or when President Trump will choose his VP is lying, unless the person is named Donald J. Trump.\"\n\nBiden-Trump Debates: What To Know As CNN Reveals Moderators For Next Month's Faceoff (Forbes)\n\nBiden Vs.

He picked Kamala Harris as his vice president,\" he said. \"If Joe had picked someone even halfway competent. They would have bounced him from office years ago, but they can't because she's got to be their second choice.\"\n\nThe former president painted Harris as a \"socialist,\" going through her record as senator and vice president.\n\nMORE: White House doctor offers explanation for Parkinson's expert's visits\n\nTuesday night's rally was a first for Trump's youngest son, Barron, whom he introduced in the crowd.\n\n\"That's the first time he's done it. That's the first time, right?\" Trump said, after asking Barron Trump to stand up and praising him, saying he \"might be more popular than Don and Eric.\"\n\nMeanwhile, former first lady Melania Trump -- who held a pro-Trump LGBTQ group Log Cabin Republicans' fundraiser in New York last night -- was notably not in attendance. She has yet to attend a Trump campaign political rally this cycle.\n\nAs Trump encouraged early voting, which will kick off in two months, he told his supporters to make sure their votes were counted.\n\n\"Make sure that it gets counted. You can do that. Follow that vote because these people cheat like nobody's ever cheated before. Frankly, they're no good at policy, but they're good at cheating,\" Trump said.\n\nTrump capitalizes on Biden campaign struggles and proposes another debate, attacks VP Harris originally appeared on abcnews.go.com", "source": {"uri": "aol.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Aol"}, "authors": [{"uri": "soo_rin_kim@aol.com", "name": "Soo Rin Kim", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}, {"uri": "lalee_ibssa@aol.com", "name": "Lalee Ibssa", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}, {"uri": "kelsey_walsh@aol.com", "name": "Kelsey Walsh", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kamala_Harris", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Kamala Harris"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Biden", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vice_President_of_the_United_States", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Vice President of the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golf", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Golf"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Biden_2020_presidential_campaign", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Joe Biden 2020 presidential campaign"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Democratic Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Master_of_Arts", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Master of Arts"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Florida", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Florida"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Florida"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Navy", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United States Navy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump_2016_presidential_campaign", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump 2016 presidential campaign"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_(state)", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "New York (state)"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Log_Cabin_Republicans", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Log Cabin Republicans"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First_Lady_of_the_United_States", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "First Lady of the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LGBT", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "LGBT"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Melania_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Melania Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Socialism", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Socialism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Early_voting", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Early voting"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Senate", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "United States Senate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_House", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "White House"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Family_of_Donald_Trump", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Family of Donald Trump"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues", "wgt": 7}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Warfare_and_Conflict", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Warfare and Conflict", "wgt": 9}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics", "wgt": 8}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Campaigns_and_Elections", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Campaigns and Elections", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Fitness/Advice_and_Guides", "label": "dmoz/Health/Fitness/Advice and Guides", "wgt": 8}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 98}], "image": "https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/ST8ls9famX5frjAsaImqbw--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyMDA7aD02NzU-/https://media.zenfs.com/en/aol_abc_news_articles_665/5b030b306e71922afa8fa31840ebc31c", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9717617", "eventUri": "eng-9717617", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "date": "2010-07-", "textStart": 138, "textEnd": 145}], "sentiment": -0.2862745098039216, "wgt": 158, "relevance": 1}

But I have some ideas as to where we're going,\" Trump said in an interview with Fox News Channel's Sean Hannity that aired Monday night.\n\nThe decision will come at an unprecedented time of upheaval in the presidential race. President Joe Biden and the Democratic Party continue to grapple with his dismal debate performance and the intensifying calls for the 81-year-old president to step aside in favor of a younger candidate.\n\nPeople are also reading...

Because, you know, it might make a difference,\" he told Hannity.\n\nBut Trump will have plenty of opportunities this week to ratchet up the speculation about a process that his team has kept extraordinarily close to the vest.\n\n\"It could happen anytime this week,\" Trump senior adviser Jason Miller said in an appearance on Fox News.\n\nTrump has two rallies planned. The first is scheduled for Tuesday evening at his golf club in Doral, Florida, near Miami. The primetime scheduling and location would seem to provide an ideal opportunity to unveil his pick if it is Florida Sen. Marco Rubio, a Miami native who is one of his top contenders.\n\nRubio will be in attendance at the event, according to an adviser familiar with the senator's plans, who, like others, spoke on condition of anonymity about the selection process.\n\nOn Saturday Trump will travel to the critical battleground state of Pennsylvania for an afternoon rally at the Butler Farm Show. The venue, outside of Pittsburgh, is not far from the border of Ohio, which is home to Sen. JD Vance, another potential pick.\n\nListen now and subscribe: Apple Podcasts | Google Podcasts | Spotify | RSS Feed | SoundStack | All Of Our Podcasts\n\nAlso said to be on Trump's short list is North Dakota Gov. Doug Burgum, who has grown close to the former president since he dropped his own bid for the nomination before voting began.\n\nTrump doesn't need a rally to unveil his pick. He could simply announce the news on his Truth Social platform at any moment between now and the Republican National Convention, which kicks off in Milwaukee on July 15. Or he could wait until the convention opens to make a grand, on-stage curtain reveal reminiscent of his days as the host of the \"The Apprentice\" reality TV show.\n\nHe said Monday the announcement will come \"probably a little before the convention, but not much. It could even be during the convention that we'd do it. I'd love to do it during the convention. ... It would make it even more exciting.\"\n\nTrump has repeatedly said he intends to unveil his pick just before or during the convention. But he has been coy about his choice.\n\nLate last month, before the debate, Trump told NBC News at a campaign stop in Philadelphia that he'd already made a decision.\n\n\"In my mind, yeah,\" he said.\n\nBut less than a week later, he told a local Virginia television station that his decision was still in flux.\n\n\"Well I have people in mind. I have so many good people. We have such a deep bench,\" he said. \"But we'll be making a decision sometime early convention or before convention.\"\n\n\"As President Trump has said himself, the top criteria in selecting a Vice President is a strong leader who could make a great President,\" Trump adviser Brian Hughes said in a statement he has issued repeatedly. \"But anyone telling you they know who or when President Trump will choose his VP is lying unless that person is named Donald J. Trump.\"\n\nThat includes the front-runners for the job.\n\nOn CNN's \"State of the Union\" on Sunday, Rubio said he remained in the dark.\n\n\"Look, I've heard nothing, I know nothing, and you probably know more than I do about it,\" he said. \"Donald Trump has a decision to make. He'll make it when he needs to make it. He'll make a good decision. I know for certain that I will be out there over the next three or four months, working on behalf of his campaign in some capacity.\"\n\nHe also dismissed questions about whether he has discussed changing his residence from Florida if he's chosen as \"presumptuous.\" The Constitution bars the president and vice president from hailing from the same state.\n\n\"We'll confront those issues when they come,\" he said. \"But we're not there yet. But we will be soon, one way or the other.\"\n\nOn NBC's \"Meet the Press,\" Vance, too, said he has not received news one way or the other: \"I have not gotten the call.\"\n\n\"But most importantly,\" he went on, \"we're just trying to work to elect Donald Trump. Whoever his vice president is -- he's got a lot of good people he could choose from -- it's the policies that worked and the leadership style that worked for the American people. I think we have to bring that back to the White House, and I'm fighting to try to do that.\"\n\nCompanies donating the most money to Donald Trump Companies donating the most money to Donald Trump #22.

But he appears in no rush as much of the attention is still centered on questions about Biden's ability to govern for another four-year term. Some Democrats have started calling for Biden to step down as their presumptive nominee following his dismal debate performance last month.\n\n\u00d7\n\nAlready a Subscriber?

But that has not stopped Trump from arguing he is stronger than Biden, who repeatedly stumbled, paused and could not complete sentences at times during the June 27 debate. Trump was criticized by Democrats for making false statements during the debate about the Jan. 6, 2021, riot at the U.S. Capitol and suggesting immigrants entering the U.S. illegally were taking so-called \"Black jobs\" and \"Hispanic jobs.\"\n\nARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW\n\nIn an interview Monday with Fox News Channel's Sean Hannity, Trump said he thought Biden \"might very well stay in\" the race. \"Nobody to wants to give that up that way,\" Trump added. \"He is going to feel badly about himself for a long time. It's hard to give it up that way, the way where they're trying to force him out.\"\n\nIn the Miami suburb of Doral, Trump is expected to underscore his strong support in a former battleground state that has now shifted toward the GOP. U.S. Sen. Marco Rubio, a Miami native and one of the contenders for the vice presidential post, was among the Florida politicians who spoke at the event.\n\nRubio, the son of Cuban immigrants, is seen as a potential running mate who could help Trump as he tries to secure support from Hispanic Americans, a point the senator emphasized in his remarks as he switched several times in his remarks to Spanish.\n\nThe senator did not openly acknowledge any of the speculation about him joining Trump as a running mate. He instead skewered not only Biden, whom he called \"the figurehead of a left-wing government, shadow government,\" but Vice President Kamala Harris, whom he would need to debate head-on if he's chosen for Trump's ticket.\n\nRubio referred to Harris not by name at first but called her Biden's \"replacement\" and \"a real-life, verified left-winger.\" At another point in his remarks, he mocked the way Harris laughs.\n\nARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW ARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW\n\nHe notably seemed to insert himself into Trump's signature \"Make America Great Again\" slogan by saying: \"Together, we're not just going to make it great again. We elect this man as president, we will make together America greater than it has ever been.\"\n\nKevin Cabrera, a Miami-Dade County commissioner who was Florida state director for Trump's 2020 reelection campaign, spoke at the rally, saying ahead of the event that it would be an \"overwhelming show of unity.\"\n\n\"The rally will display our unified front, showcasing a stark contrast to the Democrats, who are lost and fighting with each other over Biden's health and ability to continue,\" Cabrera said.\n\nThousands of people turned out in the humid summer evening for the rally. Attendees were fanning themselves and holding signs featuring Trump's mug shot, along with others that said, \"You're fired!\" -- Trump's signature phrase on his former reality show, \"The Apprentice.\"\n\nOne man, 28-year-old Austin Stiglin, said he traveled from northern Florida to participate in his first Trump rally. He was wearing a star-patterned navy blue jacket and red pants and said he was \"tired of the left telling him to vote left just because I am gay.\"\n\nARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW ARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW\n\n\"I have a lot more to say than just my sexual orientation,\" Stiglin said. \"I would like to vote for policies that support the United States.\"\n\nNicole Farrell, a 57-year-old immigrant from Trinidad, said she voted for Trump in 2020, \"but I was not a strong supporter like now. I just preferred him over Biden.\"\n\nFarrell said she specifically likes Trump's hardline immigration policies, which include plans for mass raids and the largest deportation operation in U.S. history.\n\n\"I am an immigrant but I came here legally. They need to come here legally,\" Farrell said of migrants coming to the U.S.\n\nThe presumptive GOP nominee is expected in his remarks to touch on Biden's handling of immigration and the economy, highlighting the rise in home prices and goods. Trump will also talk about how Florida is affected by the increasing arrivals of immigrants as the final destination for many people illegally crossing the U.S.-Mexico border.\n\nARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW ARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW\n\nThe leadership crisis among Democrats has perhaps given Trump a reason to wait for his VP announcement so as to not draw attention away from Biden's woes. Senior advisers and key allies say they still don't know whom Trump will choose as his running mate, and many believe the choice is still in flux.\n\nSpeaking on MSNBC Monday, Biden criticized Trump for not having held events since the debate and suggested he had been \"riding around in his golf cart.\"\n\n___\n\nPrice reported from New York.\n\nRead more on the U.S. Election at thestar.com",

He singled out Harris for her involvement in the administration's response to the surge of migrants at the southern border and to Russian aggression in Ukraine. He consistently mispronounced Harris's first name and used a nickname mocking the way she laughs.\n\nTrump's advisers have privately said they hope Biden will stay in the race because they view him as a weak opponent, though they have also expressed confidence about their chances against Harris. The hedging in Trump's speech on Tuesdayreflected how the fallout from Biden's faltering debate performance and swirling questions about his ability to serve another four years have upended and redefined the campaign.\n\n\"Despite all of the Democrat panic this week, the truth is it doesn't matter who they nominate because we are going to beat any one of them in thundering landslides,\" Trump said. \"Joe, Kamala and the entire Democrat establishment have been caught red-handedin the thick of the biggest scandal and the biggest coverup.\"\n\nTrump attacked Harris by misrepresenting her record. He falsely accused her of never visiting the U.S.-Mexico border; she did so in June 2021. He falsely said she was sent to Europe to deter Russia from invading Ukraine, when her trip was to warn Ukraine and rally allies. And he misleadingly accused her of wanting to ban gas vehicles. The Biden administration has implemented new emissions limits to cut greenhouse gases and encourage investments in electric cars.\n\nBiden has insisted that he is staying in the race. Harris kicked off a three-day campaign swing in Las Vegas, defending Biden and assailing Trump's agenda. Campaign spokesman Ammar Moussa said, \"Trump's bizarre and unhinged rants won't stop Vice President Harris from defending the Biden-Harris record and prosecuting the case against Donald Trump's extreme record.\"\n\nTrump spoke at his golf club near Miami, his first campaign stop since a rally in Virginia on June 28, the day after the debate with Biden. He was joined by Sen. Marco Rubio (R-Fla.), who is a finalist to be Trump's running mate, alongside Sen. J.D. Vance (R-Ohio). With his formal nomination coming next week at the Republican National Convention in Milwaukee, Trump alluded to the suspense of his vice-presidential search by saying the press was probably expecting Trump to announce that he was picking Rubio at Tuesday's rally. But he did not.\n\nAt one point, he teased that Rubio \"may or may not\" be in the Senate.\n\nMonique Podsada, 43, drove four hours from Tampa to Doral, Fla., with her husband, Richard, 42, hoping they would hear Trump announce his vice-presidential pick. Monique said she thought the news was imminent as Trump mentioned Rubio, especially when he referenced him as he spoke about Harris. She said she worried that a Democratic nominee other than Biden could hinder Trump's aim to win big.\n\n\"She's mentally cognitive, I'll give her that,\" Richard said.\n\nTrump adopted the emerging Republican criticism of any Democratic attempt to replace Biden as violating the will of primary voters. He also challenged the president to a golf match, to which the Biden campaign responded by saying that Biden \"doesn't have time for Donald Trump's weird antics.\"\n\nSen. Rick Scott (R-Fla.) also attended the rally. Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis, who challenged Trump for the Republican presidential nomination, did not.", "source": {"uri": "detroitnews.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Detroit News"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kamala_Harris", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Kamala Harris"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Biden", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Democratic Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russian_invasion_of_Ukraine", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Russian invasion of Ukraine"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marco_Rubio", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Marco Rubio"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Presidency_of_Joe_Biden", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Presidency of Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mexico\u2013United_States_border", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Mexico\u2013United States border"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greenhouse_gas", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Greenhouse gas"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Europe", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Europe"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Las_Vegas", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Las Vegas"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Las Vegas"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ukraine", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Ukraine"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Ukraine"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russia", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Russia"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Russia"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Biden_2020_presidential_campaign", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Joe Biden 2020 presidential campaign"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2016_United_States_presidential_election", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "2016 United States presidential election"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ron_DeSantis", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Ron DeSantis"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/J._D._Vance", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "J.

Rubio has been floated as a potential choice for months, and speculation grew when Trump announced Tuesday's rally in his state.\n\n\"I think they probably think I'm going to be announcing that Marco is going to be vice president, because that's a lot of press,\" Trump said at the event.\n\nNewsweek contacted a representative for Trump for comment by email.\n\nThough rumors that Trump might choose Rubio have grown, a notable concern for the potential ticket is that they both reside in Florida, and the Constitution makes it difficult for a president and vice president to live in the same state. So Trump or Rubio would have to change where he is registered to vote if they want to appear on the same ticket.\n\nAfter the presidential debate on June 27, which saw President Joe Biden receive criticism that has arguably damaged his reelection hopes, CNN asked Rubio if he would be willing to move if selected as Trump's running mate.\n\n\"That would be presumptuous of me to talk about that,\" he said. \"The job has not been offered to me. I am not the vice presidential choice. No one is right now. And we'll cross bridges when we get to them.\"\n\nOther high-profile figures who have been touted as potential choices include Senators Tim Scott of South Carolina, J.D. Vance of Ohio and Tom Cotton of Arkansas; North Dakota Governor Doug Burgum; New York Representative Elise Stefanik; and former presidential candidate Vivek Ramaswamy.\n\nPresidential candidates typically announce their choice of running mate in the days and weeks leading up to their party's convention. The Republican National Convention is set to take place in Milwaukee from July 15 to 18.\n\nElsewhere in the rally, Trump said his supporters who were jailed in connection with the January 6 Capitol riot should be released soon in the wake of a recent Supreme Court ruling.\n\n\"We are a nation that allows radical left terrorists to violently attack our cities, leaving behind massive destruction and death. And nothing happens to the criminals that do these terrible things, there is no punishment,\" Trump said.\n\nHe continued: \"But when people who love our country protest on January 6 in Washington, they become hostages unfairly imprisoned for long periods of time.

When asked about his VP shortlist, Trump confirmed that Vance, Rubio, Burgum, and South Carolina Senator Tim Scott are all strong candidates.\n\nTrump plans to use the Doral rally to criticize Biden on issues like inflation and immigration, emphasizing criminal acts by illegal migrants.

Once on stage, he wasted little time in bringing up his rival's disastrous debate as he offered an opportunity at redemption for the doddering Democrat, both on stage and on the golf course.\n\n\"So, tonight, I'm officially offering Joe the chance to redeem himself in front of the entire world,\" asserted Trump after insisting rally-goers not \"feel sorry\" that the incumbent's own party was weighing dropping their presumptive nominee.\n\n\"Let's do another debate this week so that Sleepy Joe Biden can prove to everyone all over the world that he has what it takes to be president,\" continued the onetime commander-in-chief as he stipulated, \"But this time it will be man-to-man, no moderators, no-holds-barred. Just name the place anytime, anywhere.\"\n\nIt was then that Trump added another challenge referencing one of the more viral moments from the debate as he invited Biden to a round of golf, \"And in the debate, Sleepy Joe also declared that he wanted to test his skills and stamina against mine on the golf course. Can you believe this? Did you ever see him swing?\"\n\n\"I'm also officially challenging Crooked Joe to an 18-hole golf match right here on Doral's Blue Monster, considered one of the greatest tournament golf courses anywhere in the world,\" boasted the businessman turned party leader. \"One of the great courses in the world. It will be among the most-watched sporting events in history. Maybe bigger than the Ryder Cup or even the Masters.\"\n\nOffering to front Biden 20 strokes in the matchup, Trump sweetened the deal by promising, \"And if he wins, I will give the charity of his choice -- any charity he wants -- $1 million. And I'll bet you he doesn't take the offer.\"\n\nResponding on behalf of the resident-in-chief, a statement was released that avoided the debate challenge entirely and instead focused on advancing the left's narrative against Trump while turning down the golf invitation.\n\n\"Donald Trump hasn't been seen in public for 12 days, now he's inviting fictional serial killers to dinner, teasing lil' [Florida Sen.] Marco Rubio, praising Project 2025 architect Tom Homan and challenging the President of the United States to golf,\" the statement began raising a reference made at the rally to Hannibal Lecter.\n\nThe statement proceeded with debunked claims and said, \"We'd challenge Donald Trump to create jobs, but he lost 3 million. We'd challenge Donald Trump to stand up to [Russian President Vladimir] Putin, but he bent the knee to him. We'd challenge Donald Trump to follow the law, but he breaks it. We'd challenge Donald Trump to destroy our country, but that's all his Project 2025 aims to do.\"\n\n\"Joe Biden doesn't have time for Donald Trump's weird antics -- he's busy leading America and defending the free world,\" it concluded. \"Donald Trump is a liar, a convict, and a fraud only out for himself -- par for the course.\"\n\nAs had been reported, included within Biden's busy schedule was a widely-panned phone-in to MSNBC's \"Morning Joe\" where he'd targeted his fellow \"elites\" for questioning his candidacy and the announcement of a \"big boy\" press conference Thursday that gave the appearance that even the Democratic leader's team was abandoning pretense on his mental faculties.\n\nThe double decline from Biden left the door open to ridiculing the president for an apparent fear of facing Trump as well as an alleged aversion to charity.\n\nWe have no tolerance for comments containing violence, racism, profanity, vulgarity, doxing, or discourteous behavior.

Trump's list of contenders has narrowed in recent weeks. It includes U.S. senators, governors and other Trump allies. They are almost all men. Sources say the deliberations are fluid, and the former president could still choose someone who isn't on most people's radar. Trump is also monitoring the fallout from Biden's disastrous debate performance last month and said it could make a difference in who he picks.\n\nHere is a look at some potential Trump running mates:\n\nDOUG BURGUM\n\nBurgum, a multi-millionaire former software executive who now serves as North Dakota's governor, has risen up the list of possible Trump running mates. Burgum gained some national name recognition when he announced his own presidential bid as a Trump rival in 2023. Burgum's White House run was relatively short-lived, and after dropping out of the primary race he was quick to endorse Trump and become a loyal defender. Trump likes the 67-year-old Burgum's background as a successful business executive and views him as a safe pair of hands, people familiar with Trump's thinking say. Burgum is still a relative unknown, however, and he does not bring any geographical help to the ticket, as North Dakota is a safe Republican state. Burgum also signed one of the strictest anti-abortion laws in the country in 2023, a potential problem for Trump, who has not taken such an extreme stance on abortion.\n\nMARCO RUBIO\n\nThe Miami-born Rubio, 53, has emerged as a leading contender for the vice presidential nod, sources familiar with the matter said. Rubio, a longtime U.S. senator from Florida and son of Cuban immigrants, ran unsuccessfully in 2016 for the Republican presidential nomination eventually won by Trump. Rubio endorsed Trump for the 2024 nomination in January. Aides to Trump say Rubio could help the former president peel away Hispanic voters from Biden in battleground states. As the top Republican on the Senate Intelligence Committee, Rubio would also bring foreign policy chops. The U.S. Constitution poses a problem, however, since it bans the electors who formally select the president and vice president from voting for both from their home state - and both Trump and Rubio call Florida home.\n\nJ.D. VANCE\n\nVance, 39, who is serving his first term as a U.S. senator for Ohio, is another top contender for Trump's running mate, according to sources. It is quite a U-turn for Vance, who rose to fame in 2016 with his memoir \"Hillbilly Elegy\" about growing up poor in Appalachia. That year Vance was a fierce critic of Trump, at one point calling him \"cultural heroin.\" Since 2018, however, Vance has embraced Trump, who endorsed him when he ran for Senate in 2022. Vance is seen as young, smart and a skilled defender of Trump.\n\nTIM SCOTT Scott, a U.S. senator from South Carolina who is Black, has become a fiercely loyal Trump ally since he ended his own presidential bid in November. Aides have been urging Trump to pick a woman or a Black man to add diversity to the ticket and attract more moderate voters. Trump has publicly praised the 58-year-old lawmaker, calling him a \"great advocate.\" It remains to be seen whether the mild-mannered Scott would be well-suited for the traditional \"attack dog\" role of a running mate. Scott is also a formidable fundraiser, and money is something Trump will need to take on Biden's campaign war chest, as well as to pay his mounting legal bills.\n\nELISE STEFANIK\n\nStefanik, a U.S. representative from New York, is another fiercely loyal Trump ally and a rising star in the Republican Party as the House's highest-ranking woman. She gained national prominence in December after embarrassing the heads of three top universities about antisemitism on their campuses during a congressional hearing. Two of them later resigned, including the president of Stefanik's alma mater, Harvard University. Stefanik was one of the 147 members of Congress who voted not to certify Biden's 2020 election win on Jan. 6, 2021, the day Trump supporters rioted at the U.S. Capitol. There are concerns among some Republicans that Stefanik, 40, may be too inexperienced for the presidential ticket.\n\nTOM COTTON\n\nThe second-term U.S. senator from Arkansas has unexpectedly emerged as a contender for Trump's running mate in recent weeks. Cotton, 47, is a U.S. Army veteran who served in Iraq and Afghanistan, and a Harvard-educated attorney. A Trump loyalist, Cotton is a frequent guest on cable news shows, something Trump likes. He may reflect Trump's desire to have a steady operator on the presidential ticket who will not stir up controversy.\n\nGLENN YOUNGKIN\n\nYoungkin, serving his first term as Virginia's governor, has emerged recently as another vice presidential contender. The 57-year-old is seen by some Trump allies as having the ability to appeal to more moderate voters, beyond Trump's fiercely loyal base. Democrats have won Virginia in recent presidential election cycles, but Trump's team believe it could be in play this year. If Youngkin could help move the state back into the Republican column it would be a great electoral prize for Trump.\n\nBYRON DONALDS Donalds, 45, is a Black U.S. representative from Florida. A conservative who belonged to the far-right Tea Party movement, he voted not to certify Biden's 2020 election win on Jan. 6, 2021. After Trump told Fox News in February that Donalds was on his short list, Donalds told Reuters the prospect was \"pretty cool\" and confirmed he wanted to be Trump's running mate. Donalds in June was criticized for controversial remarks when he appeared to express nostalgia for the Jim Crow era, named after a series of U.S. laws that defined the height of racial segregation. Democrats called his comments outrageous and ignorant; Donalds said his comments were taken out of context.

Marco Rubio, who was in attendance, as his vice presidential pick six days before the Republican National Convention (RNC) in Milwaukee.\n\nInstead, Trump delivered a rambling 75-minute speech that included a succession of attacks on Biden and his faltering debate performance, raising questions among Democrats about whether the 81-year-old president was robust enough for a second term.\n\nHe took advantage of the turbulence that followed the debate, which prompted some leading Democrats to call for Biden's resignation and the nomination of Kamala Harris.\n\nThe radical left Democratic Party is divided into chaos and experiencing full-scale collapse, all because it cannot decide which of its candidates is more unfit to be president, the sleepy, twisted Joe Biden or the laughing Kamala, he said, repeating previous derogatory terms for both.\n\nFor all the Democrats' panic this week, the truth is that it doesn't matter who they nominate, because we're going to beat any one of them in a landslide.\n\nTrump kept a lower profile than usual in the days after the debate, a strategy described by one aide as designed to allow Democrats to tear each other apart after Biden's dismal debate performance.\n\nHis remarks Tuesday were marked by the addition of the vice president's name to numerous attacks on Biden's policies, and by mentions of Rubio and Byron Donalds, a Republican congressman from Florida who is also reportedly on Trump's short list for vice president.\n\nOtherwise, it was a standard Trump campaign speech, filled with evidence-free claims that his 2020 election defeat was fraudulent; baseless accusations that foreign countries were sending most of their prisoners to the United States; and a laughable claim that a rally of supporters numbering in the hundreds was actually a crowd of 45,000.\n\nHe also touched on surrealism. Biden, he insisted, quadrupled the price of bacon.\n\nWe don't eat bacon anymore, Trump said.\n\nHe said electric cars had deceived the American public, as drivers had to stop for three hours to recharge their vehicles for every 45 minutes of driving. And, echoing one of the more bizarre exchanges with Biden over who was the better golfer, he challenged his White House successor to 18 holes at Doral while conceding 10 shots.\n\nIt will be one of the most-watched sporting events in history, perhaps bigger than the Ryder Cup or even the Masters, Trump said, pledging $1 million to a charity of Biden's choice if he loses.\n\nBack in politics, Trump lambasted Democrats for pushing for tax hikes, criticized Biden for the chaotic 2021 withdrawal of the U.S. military from Afghanistan and promised to build an Iron Dome-style missile defense system for the United States if elected in November.\n\nPerhaps exhausted by the humidity that sapped their energy, the crowd seemed mostly quiet, including some yawning in the stands behind him as Trump neared the end with slow music and others tapping disinterestedly on their phones.\n\nThe Guardian guides you through the chaos of a presidential election with far-reaching consequences\n\nPrivacy Notice: Newsletters may contain information about charities, online advertising, and content funded by third parties.

J.D. Vance or North Dakota Gov. Doug Burgum were not mentioned, with other Republicans on the shortlist. Trump will hold another rally Saturday in Pennsylvania, near the Ohio border, and Vance is expected to be one of the speakers.\n\nEarlier Tuesday, Democrats, during a Biden campaign call with first lady Jill Biden and previewing Trump's rally at Doral, mocked him for his low-key approach since the debate.\n\nI hope he didn't wear himself out from all the golf he's been playing, Texas Congresswoman Veronica Escobar said.\n\nSpeaking of staying off the campaign trail, Trump has been hiding a lot lately, not only from voters and the press, but also from Project 2025.\n\nDonald Trump tried to pretend he had nothing to do with Project 2025, when it was written for him by the people who know him best. And yesterday, his campaign preview of the RNC platform was every bit as deranged and extreme as Trump himself. They left out some of the most unpopular details that we know they support.\n\nAs usual, they are trying to hide the ball from the American public.\n\nIn his speech Tuesday, Trump avoided mentioning Project 2025 or his abortion policy.\n\nWhat Are The Main Benefits Of Comparing Car Insurance Quotes Online\n\nLOS ANGELES, CA / ACCESSWIRE / June 24, 2020, / Compare-autoinsurance.Org has launched a new blog post that presents the main benefits of comparing multiple car insurance quotes.

However, Trump is scheduled to travel to South Florida on Tuesday for a campaign rally at his Doral golf resort in Miami.\n\nOn Monday, a Miami Herald editorial board article claimed that the Doral rally would be \"not a triumph for Trump\" following the former president's \"debate lies.\" The paper said Trump had gotten \"lucky\" in the debate and would have to do \"the bare minimum\" as media attention shifted to Biden's performance.\n\nFormer President Donald Trump is pictured at a rally in Chesapeake, Virginia, on June 28.

Former President Donald Trump is pictured at a rally in Chesapeake, Virginia, on June 28. The Miami Herald editorial board argued Monday that Trump got \"lucky\" during his June 27 debate with President Joe Biden. More Anna Moneymaker\n\n\"He is fortunate that the focus has not been on his shameless spread of misinformation, but on Democrats' panic and attempt to replace President Joe Biden after his disastrous performance raised reasonable questions about his mental acuity,\" the board wrote.\n\n\"When Trump takes the stage at Trump National Doral in Miami on Tuesday night, the bar will be set very low for him,\" the council added. \"Trump will have to do the bare minimum: looking vigorous and sounding vigorous will likely suffice, as the news cycle turns to 24/7 coverage of the number of Democrats calling for the president to pass the torch to a younger candidate.\"\n\nIn an email to Newsweek Monday night, Trump campaign spokesman Steven Cheung said of the Miami Herald op-ed: \"Trump Derangement Syndrome is a condition that requires immediate attention or it rots the brain. Unfortunately, many members of the media refuse treatment.\"\n\nThe Miami Herald editorial board went on to detail several false statements Trump made during the debate, including claims that Democrats support abortions performed \"after birth,\" that Biden had allowed \"millions of people\" to cross the U.S.-Mexico border \"from prisons, detention centers and mental institutions,\" and that Biden had called Black people \"super predators\" -- a term he has generally rejected.\n\nThe editorial concludes by claiming that Trump would \"glory\" about his debate performance while his own alleged \"cognitive decline\" would be ignored due to the focus on Biden.\n\n\"It's a safe bet that Trump will use his Doral speech to gloat over his supposed debate triumph and Biden's apparent cognitive decline while ignoring his own,\" the committee wrote. \"Meanwhile, America will be too busy worrying about Biden's fitness for office. Trump couldn't ask for a bigger distraction.\"\n\nSpeculation is rife that Trump could use the Doral rally to announce Florida Sen. Marco Rubio as his running mate, though Rubio is just one of several names reportedly on Trump's short list.\n\nUncommon knowledge\n\nNewsweek is committed to challenging conventional wisdom and

Because, you know, it might make a difference,\" he told Hannity.\n\nBut Trump will have plenty of opportunities this week to ratchet up the speculation about a process that his team has kept extraordinarily close to the vest.\n\n\"It could happen anytime this week,\" Trump senior adviser Jason Miller said in an appearance on Fox News.\n\nTrump has two rallies planned. The first is scheduled for Tuesday evening at his golf club in Doral, Florida, near Miami. The primetime scheduling and location would seem to provide an ideal opportunity to unveil his pick if it is Florida Sen. Marco Rubio, a Miami native who is one of his top contenders.\n\nRubio will be in attendance at the event, according to an adviser familiar with the senator's plans, who, like others, spoke on condition of anonymity about the selection process.\n\nOn Saturday Trump will travel to the critical battleground state of Pennsylvania for an afternoon rally at the Butler Farm Show. The venue, outside of Pittsburgh, is not far from the border of Ohio, which is home to Sen. JD Vance, another potential pick.\n\nAlso said to be on Trump's short list is North Dakota Gov. Doug Burgum, who has grown close to the former president since he dropped his own bid for the nomination before voting began.\n\nTrump doesn't need a rally to unveil his pick. He could simply announce the news on his Truth Social platform at any moment between now and the Republican National Convention, which kicks off in Milwaukee on July 15. Or he could wait until the convention opens to make a grand, on-stage curtain reveal reminiscent of his days as the host of the \"The Apprentice\" reality TV show.\n\nHe said Monday the announcement will come \"probably a little before the convention, but not much. It could even be during the convention that we'd do it. I'd love to do it during the convention. ... It would make it even more exciting.\"\n\nTrump has repeatedly said he intends to unveil his pick just before or during the convention. But he has been coy about his choice.\n\nLate last month, before the debate, Trump told NBC News at a campaign stop in Philadelphia that he'd already made a decision.\n\n\"In my mind, yeah,\" he said.\n\nBut less than a week later, he told a local Virginia television station that his decision was still in flux.\n\n\"Well I have people in mind. I have so many good people. We have such a deep bench,\" he said. \"But we'll be making a decision sometime early convention or before convention.\"\n\n\"As President Trump has said himself, the top criteria in selecting a Vice President is a strong leader who could make a great President,\" Trump adviser Brian Hughes said in a statement he has issued repeatedly. \"But anyone telling you they know who or when President Trump will choose his VP is lying unless that person is named Donald J. Trump.\"\n\nThat includes the front-runners for the job.\n\nOn CNN's \"State of the Union\" on Sunday, Rubio said he remained in the dark.\n\n\"Look, I've heard nothing, I know nothing, and you probably know more than I do about it,\" he said. \"Donald Trump has a decision to make. He'll make it when he needs to make it. He'll make a good decision. I know for certain that I will be out there over the next three or four months, working on behalf of his campaign in some capacity.\"\n\nHe also dismissed questions about whether he has discussed changing his residence from Florida if he's chosen as \"presumptuous.\" The Constitution bars the president and vice president from hailing from the same state.\n\n\"We'll confront those issues when they come,\" he said. \"But we're not there yet. But we will be soon, one way or the other.\"\n\nOn NBC's \"Meet the Press,\" Vance, too, said he has not received news one way or the other: \"I have not gotten the call.\"\n\n\"But most importantly,\" he went on, \"we're just trying to work to elect Donald Trump. Whoever his vice president is -- he's got a lot of good people he could choose from -- it's the policies that worked and the leadership style that worked for the American people. I think we have to bring that back to the White House, and I'm fighting to try to do that.\"\n\nCompanies donating the most money to Donald Trump Companies donating the most money to Donald Trump #22.

But I have some ideas as to where we're going,\" Trump said in an interview with Fox News Channel's Sean Hannity that aired Monday night.\n\nThe decision will come at an unprecedented time of upheaval in the presidential race. President Joe Biden and the Democratic Party continue to grapple with his dismal debate performance and the intensifying calls for the 81-year-old president to step aside in favor of a younger candidate.\n\nPeople are also reading...

Because, you know, it might make a difference,\" he told Hannity.\n\nBut Trump will have plenty of opportunities this week to ratchet up the speculation about a process that his team has kept extraordinarily close to the vest.\n\n\"It could happen anytime this week,\" Trump senior adviser Jason Miller said in an appearance on Fox News.\n\nTrump has two rallies planned. The first is scheduled for Tuesday evening at his golf club in Doral, Florida, near Miami. The primetime scheduling and location would seem to provide an ideal opportunity to unveil his pick if it is Florida Sen. Marco Rubio, a Miami native who is one of his top contenders.\n\nRubio will be in attendance at the event, according to an adviser familiar with the senator's plans, who, like others, spoke on condition of anonymity about the selection process.\n\nOn Saturday Trump will travel to the critical battleground state of Pennsylvania for an afternoon rally at the Butler Farm Show. The venue, outside of Pittsburgh, is not far from the border of Ohio, which is home to Sen. JD Vance, another potential pick.\n\nListen now and subscribe: Apple Podcasts | Google Podcasts | Spotify | RSS Feed | SoundStack | All Of Our Podcasts\n\nAlso said to be on Trump's short list is North Dakota Gov. Doug Burgum, who has grown close to the former president since he dropped his own bid for the nomination before voting began.\n\nTrump doesn't need a rally to unveil his pick. He could simply announce the news on his Truth Social platform at any moment between now and the Republican National Convention, which kicks off in Milwaukee on July 15. Or he could wait until the convention opens to make a grand, on-stage curtain reveal reminiscent of his days as the host of the \"The Apprentice\" reality TV show.\n\nHe said Monday the announcement will come \"probably a little before the convention, but not much. It could even be during the convention that we'd do it. I'd love to do it during the convention. ... It would make it even more exciting.\"\n\nTrump has repeatedly said he intends to unveil his pick just before or during the convention. But he has been coy about his choice.\n\nLate last month, before the debate, Trump told NBC News at a campaign stop in Philadelphia that he'd already made a decision.\n\n\"In my mind, yeah,\" he said.\n\nBut less than a week later, he told a local Virginia television station that his decision was still in flux.\n\n\"Well I have people in mind. I have so many good people. We have such a deep bench,\" he said. \"But we'll be making a decision sometime early convention or before convention.\"\n\n\"As President Trump has said himself, the top criteria in selecting a Vice President is a strong leader who could make a great President,\" Trump adviser Brian Hughes said in a statement he has issued repeatedly. \"But anyone telling you they know who or when President Trump will choose his VP is lying unless that person is named Donald J. Trump.\"\n\nThat includes the front-runners for the job.\n\nOn CNN's \"State of the Union\" on Sunday, Rubio said he remained in the dark.\n\n\"Look, I've heard nothing, I know nothing, and you probably know more than I do about it,\" he said. \"Donald Trump has a decision to make. He'll make it when he needs to make it. He'll make a good decision. I know for certain that I will be out there over the next three or four months, working on behalf of his campaign in some capacity.\"\n\nHe also dismissed questions about whether he has discussed changing his residence from Florida if he's chosen as \"presumptuous.\" The Constitution bars the president and vice president from hailing from the same state.\n\n\"We'll confront those issues when they come,\" he said. \"But we're not there yet. But we will be soon, one way or the other.\"\n\nOn NBC's \"Meet the Press,\" Vance, too, said he has not received news one way or the other: \"I have not gotten the call.\"\n\n\"But most importantly,\" he went on, \"we're just trying to work to elect Donald Trump. Whoever his vice president is -- he's got a lot of good people he could choose from -- it's the policies that worked and the leadership style that worked for the American people. I think we have to bring that back to the White House, and I'm fighting to try to do that.\"\n\nCompanies donating the most money to Donald Trump Companies donating the most money to Donald Trump #22.

President Joe Biden and the Democratic Party continue to grapple with his dismal debate performance and the intensifying calls for the 81-year-old president to step aside in favor of a younger candidate.\n\nPeople are also reading...

Because, you know, it might make a difference,\" he told Hannity.\n\nBut Trump will have plenty of opportunities this week to ratchet up the speculation about a process that his team has kept extraordinarily close to the vest.\n\n\"It could happen anytime this week,\" Trump senior adviser Jason Miller said in an appearance on Fox News.\n\nTrump has two rallies planned. The first is scheduled for Tuesday evening at his golf club in Doral, Florida, near Miami. The primetime scheduling and location would seem to provide an ideal opportunity to unveil his pick if it is Florida Sen. Marco Rubio, a Miami native who is one of his top contenders.\n\nRubio will be in attendance at the event, according to an adviser familiar with the senator's plans, who, like others, spoke on condition of anonymity about the selection process.\n\nOn Saturday Trump will travel to the critical battleground state of Pennsylvania for an afternoon rally at the Butler Farm Show. The venue, outside of Pittsburgh, is not far from the border of Ohio, which is home to Sen. JD Vance, another potential pick.\n\nAlso said to be on Trump's short list is North Dakota Gov. Doug Burgum, who has grown close to the former president since he dropped his own bid for the nomination before voting began.\n\nTrump doesn't need a rally to unveil his pick. He could simply announce the news on his Truth Social platform at any moment between now and the Republican National Convention, which kicks off in Milwaukee on July 15. Or he could wait until the convention opens to make a grand, on-stage curtain reveal reminiscent of his days as the host of the \"The Apprentice\" reality TV show.\n\nHe said Monday the announcement will come \"probably a little before the convention, but not much. It could even be during the convention that we'd do it. I'd love to do it during the convention. ... It would make it even more exciting.\"\n\nTrump has repeatedly said he intends to unveil his pick just before or during the convention. But he has been coy about his choice.\n\nLate last month, before the debate, Trump told NBC News at a campaign stop in Philadelphia that he'd already made a decision.\n\n\"In my mind, yeah,\" he said.\n\nBut less than a week later, he told a local Virginia television station that his decision was still in flux.\n\n\"Well I have people in mind. I have so many good people. We have such a deep bench,\" he said. \"But we'll be making a decision sometime early convention or before convention.\"\n\n\"As President Trump has said himself, the top criteria in selecting a Vice President is a strong leader who could make a great President,\" Trump adviser Brian Hughes said in a statement he has issued repeatedly. \"But anyone telling you they know who or when President Trump will choose his VP is lying unless that person is named Donald J. Trump.\"\n\nThat includes the front-runners for the job.\n\nOn CNN's \"State of the Union\" on Sunday, Rubio said he remained in the dark.\n\n\"Look, I've heard nothing, I know nothing, and you probably know more than I do about it,\" he said. \"Donald Trump has a decision to make. He'll make it when he needs to make it. He'll make a good decision. I know for certain that I will be out there over the next three or four months, working on behalf of his campaign in some capacity.\"\n\nHe also dismissed questions about whether he has discussed changing his residence from Florida if he's chosen as \"presumptuous.\" The Constitution bars the president and vice president from hailing from the same state.\n\n\"We'll confront those issues when they come,\" he said. \"But we're not there yet. But we will be soon, one way or the other.\"\n\nOn NBC's \"Meet the Press,\" Vance, too, said he has not received news one way or the other: \"I have not gotten the call.\"\n\n\"But most importantly,\" he went on, \"we're just trying to work to elect Donald Trump. Whoever his vice president is -- he's got a lot of good people he could choose from -- it's the policies that worked and the leadership style that worked for the American people. I think we have to bring that back to the White House, and I'm fighting to try to do that.\"\n\nLove 0 Funny 0 Wow 0 Sad 0 Angry 0\n\nBe the first to know\n\nGet local news delivered to your

Marco Rubio during an interview with a Miami TV station and name-checked him as a possible vice presidential pick during his speech at a rally in Doral, Florida, at the Trump National Doral Golf Club, after Rubio gave a speech to the crowd.\n\nIndeed, team Trump had the media in a tizzy over the possible pick thanks to emails and texts like these, reposted on social media:\n\nThe former president did not announce his choice, although big hints were there.\n\n\"I think they probably think I'm going to be announcing that Marco is going to be vice president, because that's a lot of press,\" Trump told the crowd.\n\nAnd he told Miami's WTVJ-TV in an interview before the event Rubio would \"certainly\" play a role in his campaign.\n\n\"He's a fantastic guy, and he's a friend of mine,\" Trump said. \"And he's one of the top people. Let's see how we do over the next week.\"\n\nWhile the presumptive GOP nominee said he had already made his mind up on his running mate pick several weeks ago, he indicated to Fox News' Sean Hannity during a phone interview Monday that he was mulling over alternatives in part due to the uncertainty over who he might be facing on the Democrat side after Biden's disastrous June 27 debate performance.\n\n\"I haven't made a final decision, but I have some ideas as to where we're going,\" Trump said.\n\n\"And a little bit, you know, we wanted to see what they're doing, to be honest,\" he said. \"Because, you know, it might make a difference. I don't know. I'm not sure that it would, but there are those who say Trump's waiting until he finds out what's going to happen with crooked Joe Biden, and we'll see what happens with Biden.\"\n\nIndeed, the South Florida event wasn't just notable for teasing vice presidential possibilities, although it was notable for that. (And that doesn't just apply to Rubio, mind you; as NBC News noted, even though he's the governor of North Dakota, top veepstakes candidate Doug Burgum has most of his donor base in Miami.)\n\nTrump, NBC News said, \"noticeably aimed sharper insults at Vice President Kamala Harris, who could be his general election opponent if Biden steps aside.\"\n\nIn his pre-event interview with WTVJ, the former president also talked more about Biden's debate performance, something Trump has been unusually quiet about over the past two weeks. (And, in all fairness, when your opponent can't get out of his own way, best to not say anything at all.)\n\n\"It wasn't the greatest performance I've ever seen ... I thought he looked very pale,\" Trump said.\n\n\"After a couple of minutes, I was saying, what's going here? .... It was amazing as an event, but it was a little bit strange,\" he said.\n\nWell, yes, you don't say. Whatever the case, the possibility of nominee Harris -- or someone else completely -- could upend what states are in play and what the priorities are.\n\nThat being said, it sounds self-evident that Rubio is, at the very least, near the top of the running, along with Burgum, Ohio Sen. J.D. Vance and Virginia Gov. Glenn Youngkin.\n\nAnd if he doesn't announce which one it is this week, it could give the Republican National Convention a bit of added juice by withholding, all while the president continues to implode.", "source": {"uri": "westernjournal.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Western Journal"}, "authors": [{"uri": "c_douglas_golden@westernjournal.com", "name": "C.

But the clock is ticking, and Trump has said he is still weighing his options.\n\n\"I haven't made (a) final decision. But I have some ideas as to where we're going,\" Trump said in an interview with Fox News' Sean Hannity that aired Monday night. The former president also said that the speculation about whether Biden will drop out is a factor he is considering before announcing a choice.\n\nCampaign officials and advisers have said they don't know who Trump will choose and even possible selections have insisted they haven't been asked and don't have much information on the process.\n\n\"It's almost an embarrassment of riches that there are so many good people,\" Trump campaign senior adviser Jason Miller said on \"Fox & Friends\" Monday. \"And what President Trump has said is that whoever he does pick needs to be able to step in and do the job on day one.\"\n\nThe leading candidates to be Trump's running mate:\n\nJD VANCE\n\nThe Ohio senator has been one of Trump's most forceful allies in the Senate since winning his seat in the 2022 midterms. Vance rose to national prominence through the success of his memoir, \"Hillbilly Elegy\" and was initially highly skeptical of Trump and his agenda but has completed a complete turnaround and been vocal about his support for Trump's foreign policy, trade and immigration policies.\n\nVance has been a frequent presence at Trump's campaign stops, rallies and attended his trial in New York where he was convicted of 34 felonies for falsifying business records. If he were to be added to the ticket, he would also bring youth to a race that features the two oldest presidents in American history as he has not yet turned 40.\n\nVance was among the frontrunners who said he has not been asked to be Trump's running mate yet in an appearance on \"Meet the Press\" on Sunday.\n\n\"I have not gotten the call, Kristen, and I'll certainly -- you know, maybe not the first person that I let know if that happened, but we'll let the media know if I ever get that call,\" Vance said. \"But most importantly, Kristen, we're just trying to work to elect Donald Trump.\"\n\nMARCO RUBIO\n\nThe Florida senator is another former Trump foe turned ally in the Senate who also holds sway and influence over the more establishment-oriented parts of the party. As the top Republican on the Senate intelligence committee, he is also an influential voice on matters of national security and foreign policy.\n\nHe is scheduled to appear with Trump at a rally on Tuesday near Miami, the former president's first public appearance since the debate.\n\nA potential hiccup for a Trump-Rubio ticket is that both men reside in Florida and one of them would need to move out of the state. Rubio is reportedly willing to change his residence to another state but would then be representing Florida without living there while running for the White House with Trump.\n\nHe told CNN on Sunday's \"State of the Union\" that he hasn't heard anything about vice presidential conversations.\n\n\"All I care about at this point and what I care about the most is that we can't afford another four years like the last four, and I'm willing to help in any way I can,\" Rubio said. \"But as far as making an announcement, that's up to him and their campaign.\"\n\nDOUG BURGUM\n\nA two-term North Dakota governor went from a relative unknown to one of the leading choices to be Trump's VP pick after his longshot primary challenge ended and he pivoted to being an active supporter of Trump.\n\nBurgum has attended many fundraisers and events to stump for Trump and also attended his criminal trial in New York. He is also a wealthy businessman who is seen as having connections to other rich people that could help finance what is likely to be the most expensive presidential contest yet.\n\nAlong with financial connections, Burgum is also seen as having experience governing and could step in and be an effective president. However, there are questions about what he would add to the ticket as a relatively unknown governor of a small state who does not expand the potential electorate.\n\nTIM SCOTT\n\nScott has long been considered a rising figure in national Republican politics and a frontrunner in Trump's vice president search, frequently campaigning for Trump and receiving praise for his ability to act as a campaign surrogate.\n\nThe South Carolina senator challenged Trump for the 2024 nomination but generally stayed away from criticizing him and quickly endorsed him upon dropping out of the race. Scott also almost immediately went out on the campaign trail during primary season to advocate for Trump.\n\nHe is the only Black Republican in the Senate and would add diversity to the ticket along with a different approach. Scott frequently leans on his religious beliefs in political speeches and takes an optimistic outlook toward many of the issues facing the country.\n\nSeveral GOP senators threw support behind Scott's primary campaign and have continued to support him as a potential vice presidential selection.\n\nELISE STEFANIK\n\nTrump's campaign has appeared to move toward a male running mate in the closing stretch of the search but Stefanik has been among the women most mentioned as a potential choice. Stefanik, the No. 3 House Republican, rose to prominence defending Trump during his impeachment hearings and more recently for her excruciating grilling of university presidents over antisemitism on campus that resulted in several resignations.\n\nStefanik is one of his most vigorous allies in the House, announcing her endorsement of him before he had even officially announced he would run in 2024. She has said in various interviews that she would be honored to help in any way but has not been as publicly facing as some of the other contenders on the short list.\n\nAlong with the fierce loyalty to Trump and his agenda, Stefanik could be someone to help him sort out his weakness among suburban women, who have gravitated away from him in the last two cycles.", "source": {"uri": "turnto10.com",

But don't feel sorry for him. He's a very bad guy.\"\n\nThe former president returned to the campaign trail for the event amid ongoing turmoil in the Democratic Party over Biden's reelection bid.

And I bet you he doesn't take the offer.\"\n\nThe pair had previously sparred over who had a better long game during the debate, and the Biden campaign's response to the latest challenge came in the form of a golf pun.\n\n\"Joe Biden doesn't have time for Donald Trump's weird antics -- he's busy leading America and defending the free world,\" it said.\n\n\"Donald Trump is a liar, a convict, and a fraud only out for himself par for the course.\"\n\nFlorida Senator Marco Rubio is a frontrunner in the contest to be named Trump's running mate at next week's Republican nominating convention in Milwaukee, and he was in the front row to cheer on Trump and deliver brief remarks of his own.\n\nNearby, a digital billboard underscored the evolution that the Republican Party has undergone under Trump, playing 2016 footage of Rubio eviscerating the man he is hoping to work with for the next four years.\n\n\"You all have friends that are thinking about voting for Donald Trump,\" the now

But three names continue to come up - Burgum, Vance and Rubio.\n\nRubio will team up with Trump on Tuesday evening at a campaign rally at Trump's Doral golf club near Miami, Florida.\n\nOn Saturday the former president will hold a rally near Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, not far from the Ohio border. But there's no word at this time if Vance will join Trump at the campaign event.\n\nTrump's campaign continues to push back on the rampant speculation.\n\n\"Anyone claiming to know who or when President Trump will choose his VP is lying, unless the person is named Donald J.

President Joe Biden and the Democratic Party continue to grapple with his dismal debate performance and the intensifying calls for the 81-year-old president to step aside in favor of a younger candidate.\n\nThe Democrats' crisis has given Trump little incentive to change the subject with a VP announcement that would be sure to draw a flurry of attention and focus.\n\nTrump has also been waiting to see how things shake out with Biden.\n\n\"A little bit, you know, we wanted to see what they're doing, to be honest. Because, you know, it might make a difference,\" he told Hannity.\n\nBut Trump will have plenty of opportunities this week to ratchet up the speculation about a process that his team has kept extraordinarily close to the vest.\n\n\"It could happen anytime this week,\" Trump senior adviser Jason Miller said in an appearance on Fox News.\n\nTrump has two rallies planned. The first is scheduled for Tuesday evening at his golf club in Doral, Florida, near Miami. The primetime scheduling and location would seem to provide an ideal opportunity to unveil his pick if it is Florida Sen. Marco Rubio, a Miami native who is one of his top contenders.\n\nRubio will be in attendance at the event, according to an adviser familiar with the senator's plans, who, like others, spoke on condition of anonymity about the selection process.\n\nOn Saturday Trump will travel to the critical battleground state of Pennsylvania for an afternoon rally at the Butler Farm Show. The venue, outside of Pittsburgh, is not far from the border of Ohio, which is home to Sen. JD Vance, another potential pick.\n\nListen now and subscribe: Apple Podcasts | Google Podcasts | Spotify | RSS Feed | SoundStack | All Of Our Podcasts\n\nAlso said to be on Trump's short list is North Dakota Gov. Doug Burgum, who has grown close to the former president since he dropped his own bid for the nomination before voting began.\n\nTrump doesn't need a rally to unveil his pick. He could simply announce the news on his Truth Social platform at any moment between now and the Republican National Convention, which kicks off in Milwaukee on July 15. Or he could wait until the convention opens to make a grand, on-stage curtain reveal reminiscent of his days as the host of the \"The Apprentice\" reality TV show.\n\nHe said Monday the announcement will come \"probably a little before the convention, but not much. It could even be during the convention that we'd do it. I'd love to do it during the convention. ... It would make it even more exciting.\"\n\nTrump has repeatedly said he intends to unveil his pick just before or during the convention. But he has been coy about his choice.\n\nLate last month, before the debate, Trump told NBC News at a campaign stop in Philadelphia that he'd already made a decision.\n\n\"In my mind, yeah,\" he said.\n\nBut less than a week later, he told a local Virginia television station that his decision was still in flux.\n\n\"Well I have people in mind. I have so many good people. We have such a deep bench,\" he said. \"But we'll be making a decision sometime early convention or before convention.\"\n\n\"As President Trump has said himself, the top criteria in selecting a Vice President is a strong leader who could make a great President,\" Trump adviser Brian Hughes said in a statement he has issued repeatedly. \"But anyone telling you they know who or when President Trump will choose his VP is lying unless that person is named Donald J. Trump.\"\n\nThat includes the front-runners for the job.\n\nOn CNN's \"State of the Union\" on Sunday, Rubio said he remained in the dark.\n\n\"Look, I've heard nothing, I know nothing, and you probably know more than I do about it,\" he said. \"Donald Trump has a decision to make. He'll make it when he needs to make it. He'll make a good decision. I know for certain that I will be out there over the next three or four months, working on behalf of his campaign in some capacity.\"\n\nHe also dismissed questions about whether he has discussed changing his residence from Florida if he's chosen as \"presumptuous.\" The Constitution bars the president and vice president from hailing from the same state.\n\n\"We'll confront those issues when they come,\" he said. \"But we're not there yet. But we will be soon, one way or the other.\"\n\nOn NBC's \"Meet the Press,\" Vance, too, said he has not received news one way or the other: \"I have not gotten the call.\"\n\n\"But most importantly,\" he went on, \"we're just trying to work to elect Donald Trump. Whoever his vice president is -- he's got a lot of good people he could choose from -- it's the policies that worked and the leadership style that worked for the American people. I think we have to bring that back to the White House, and I'm fighting to try to do that.\"\n\nCompanies donating the most money to Donald Trump Companies donating the most money to Donald Trump #22.

President Joe Biden and the Democratic Party continue to grapple with his dismal debate performance and the intensifying calls for the 81-year-old president to step aside in favor of a younger candidate.\n\nPeople are also reading...\n\nAn early look at Davenport's plans for Main Street Landing Chicago company buys apartment buildings in Davenport, Moline Quad-Cities business openings, closings: Shelly's Sweet Sensations, Crawford Brew Works and more Agriculture expert: Deere prepares for future losses due to declining ag economy Driver of vehicle in LeClaire crash identified John Deere closes on land for 1.2 million-square-foot warehouse in Indiana Moline woman gave report of missing mail to postal worker accused of stealing mail Police identify woman killed by crash Monday afternoon northwest of Davenport Matt Moody managed the Village Theater and touched many lives Review: Lainey Wilson sings in the rain Sunday at the John Deere Classic 7 Quad Cities restaurants that opened in June Review: Counting Crows at the John Deere Classic 'Concerts on the Course' Brazilian bomber Bolkema excelling Davenport North Registered sex offender accused of inappropriately touching girl Sarah Goodwin says her husband's life was 'swirling out of control' before he was killed\n\nThe Democrats' crisis has given Trump little incentive to change the subject with a VP announcement that would be sure to draw a flurry of attention and focus.\n\nTrump has also been waiting to see how things shake out with Biden.\n\n\"A little bit, you know, we wanted to see what they're doing, to be honest. Because, you know, it might make a difference,\" he told Hannity.\n\nBut Trump will have plenty of opportunities this week to ratchet up the speculation about a process that his team has kept extraordinarily close to the vest.\n\n\"It could happen anytime this week,\" Trump senior adviser Jason Miller said in an appearance on Fox News.\n\nTrump has two rallies planned. The first is scheduled for Tuesday evening at his golf club in Doral, Florida, near Miami. The primetime scheduling and location would seem to provide an ideal opportunity to unveil his pick if it is Florida Sen. Marco Rubio, a Miami native who is one of his top contenders.\n\nRubio will be in attendance at the event, according to an adviser familiar with the senator's plans, who, like others, spoke on condition of anonymity about the selection process.\n\nOn Saturday Trump will travel to the critical battleground state of Pennsylvania for an afternoon rally at the Butler Farm Show. The venue, outside of Pittsburgh, is not far from the border of Ohio, which is home to Sen. JD Vance, another potential pick.\n\nListen now and subscribe: Apple Podcasts | Google Podcasts | Spotify | RSS Feed | SoundStack | All Of Our Podcasts\n\nAlso said to be on Trump's short list is North Dakota Gov. Doug Burgum, who has grown close to the former president since he dropped his own bid for the nomination before voting began.\n\nTrump doesn't need a rally to unveil his pick. He could simply announce the news on his Truth Social platform at any moment between now and the Republican National Convention, which kicks off in Milwaukee on July 15. Or he could wait until the convention opens to make a grand, on-stage curtain reveal reminiscent of his days as the host of the \"The Apprentice\" reality TV show.\n\nHe said Monday the announcement will come \"probably a little before the convention, but not much. It could even be during the convention that we'd do it. I'd love to do it during the convention. ... It would make it even more exciting.\"\n\nTrump has repeatedly said he intends to unveil his pick just before or during the convention. But he has been coy about his choice.\n\nLate last month, before the debate, Trump told NBC News at a campaign stop in Philadelphia that he'd already made a decision.\n\n\"In my mind, yeah,\" he said.\n\nBut less than a week later, he told a local Virginia television station that his decision was still in flux.\n\n\"Well I have people in mind. I have so many good people. We have such a deep bench,\" he said. \"But we'll be making a decision sometime early convention or before convention.\"\n\n\"As President Trump has said himself, the top criteria in selecting a Vice President is a strong leader who could make a great President,\" Trump adviser Brian Hughes said in a statement he has issued repeatedly. \"But anyone telling you they know who or when President Trump will choose his VP is lying unless that person is named Donald J. Trump.\"\n\nThat includes the front-runners for the job.\n\nOn CNN's \"State of the Union\" on Sunday, Rubio said he remained in the dark.\n\n\"Look, I've heard nothing, I know nothing, and you probably know more than I do about it,\" he said. \"Donald Trump has a decision to make. He'll make it when he needs to make it. He'll make a good decision. I know for certain that I will be out there over the next three or four months, working on behalf of his campaign in some capacity.\"\n\nHe also dismissed questions about whether he has discussed changing his residence from Florida if he's chosen as \"presumptuous.\" The Constitution bars the president and vice president from hailing from the same state.\n\n\"We'll confront those issues when they come,\" he said. \"But we're not there yet. But we will be soon, one way or the other.\"\n\nOn NBC's \"Meet the Press,\" Vance, too, said he has not received news one way or the other: \"I have not gotten the call.\"\n\n\"But most importantly,\" he went on, \"we're just trying to work to elect Donald Trump. Whoever his vice president is -- he's got a lot of good people he could choose from -- it's the policies that worked and the leadership style that worked for the American people. I think we have to bring that back to the White House, and I'm fighting to try to do that.\"\n\nCompanies donating the most money to Donald Trump\n\nCompanies donating the most money to Donald Trump\n\n#21.

Decision expected on Monday", "body": "Former US president and Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump gestures as he speaks during a rally in Doral, Florida, on July 9, 2024. -- AFP\n\nWith the pomp and pageantry of his official nomination just days away, Donald Trump's search for a running mate on the Republican presidential ticket is in the home stretch, with a trio of frontrunners jockeying to be first across the finish line.\n\nThe former US president is seeking a number two who can walk the delicate line between helping mobilize Trump's right-wing base and staying in lane as a sidekick who won't hog the limelight or, worse, prove more popular than the boss.\n\nTrump is expected to make his choice public during next week's Republican National Convention in Milwaukee, with an announcement anticipated as early as the opening day on Monday.\n\nThe billionaire appears to have zeroed in on two US senators, J.D. Vance of Ohio and Marco Rubio of Florida, as well as North Dakota Governor Doug Burgum, who initially ran against Trump for the nomination before falling in line.\n\nThe calculus might yet change, as Trump told Fox News on Monday that he was weighing a \"great bench\" of prospects and had not made a decision.\n\n\"It's going to be a great vice president, meaning a person that can do a fantastic job as president, because you always have to think of that first,\" he said.\n\n\"And then, second, somebody that helps you get elected. And there's nothing wrong with that.\"\n\nEver the consummate showman, Trump has been ramping up the intrigue, sending out a \"long list\" of contenders early on and offering conflicting accounts of how far along he was in the selection process.\n\nThere was speculation that he might use his first public appearance in 11 days to announce Rubio as he addressed supporters at his Doral golf club, on the outskirts of Miami.\n\nHe namechecked the senator, who was in the front row, several times but was silent on his thinking for the veepstakes.\n\nTrump could have dropped his big reveal at any point in the days before Milwaukee, except that the news would have interrupted arguably one of the worst weeks in the career of his 81-year-old rival Joe Biden.\n\nThe veteran Democrat is facing calls to drop out of the race after a widely-panned debate performance against Trump raised questions about the mental capacity of America's oldest-ever president.\n\n\"The big danger right now is because all the attention is focused on Biden, that if you announce anything, it will get lost,\" Republican strategist Rob Burgess, who worked on the Trump 2016 and 2020 campaigns, told AFP.\n\nOne of the biggest factors for Trump will be his running mate's fund-raising prowess, and the contenders have all been under pressure to showcase their connections with wealthy mega-donors.\n\nMeanwhile, the campaign has ensured that they are booked regularly for cable news interviews -- a kind of casting call that allows Trump to assess how they look in front of the cameras, a priority for the former reality TV star.\n\n\"Although the vice president's role has grown, ultimately it depends upon the president's personality and his or her leadership style.\"", "source": {"uri": "khaleejtimes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Khaleej times"}, "authors": [{"uri": "agence_france_presse@khaleejtimes.com", "name": "Agence France-Presse", "type": "author", "isAgency": true}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republican_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Republican Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doral,_Florida", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Doral, Florida"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Doral, Florida"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Right-wing_politics", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Right-wing politics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marco_Rubio", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Marco Rubio"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Senate", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States Senate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Running_mate", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Running mate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republican_National_Convention", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Republican National Convention"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Milwaukee", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Milwaukee"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Milwaukee"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fox_News", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Fox News"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doug_Burgum", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Doug Burgum"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/J._D._Vance", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "J.

Vance of Ohio and Marco Rubio of Florida, as well as North Dakota Governor Doug Burgum, who initially ran against Trump for the nomination before falling in line.\n\nThe calculus might yet change, as Trump told Fox News on Monday that he was weighing a \"great bench\" of prospects and had not made a decision.\n\nUS Senator J.D. Vance is seen as popular among white working class men\n\n\"It's going to be a great vice president, meaning a person that can do a fantastic job as president, because you always have to think of that first,\" he said.\n\n\"And then, second, somebody that helps you get elected. And there's nothing wrong with that.\"\n\nEver the consummate showman, Trump has been ramping up the intrigue, sending out a \"long list\" of contenders early on and offering conflicting accounts of how far along he was in the selection process.\n\nThere was speculation that he might use his first public appearance in 11 days to announce Rubio as he addressed supporters at his Doral golf club, on the outskirts of Miami.\n\nHe namechecked the senator, who was in the front row, several times but was silent on his thinking for the veepstakes.\n\n- Casting call -\n\nTrump could have dropped his big reveal at any point in the days before Milwaukee, except that the news would have interrupted arguably one of the worst weeks in the career of his 81-year-old rival Joe Biden.\n\nThe veteran Democrat is facing calls to drop out of the race after a widely-panned debate performance against Trump raised questions about the mental capacity of America's oldest-ever president.\n\nDonald Trump has zeroed in on Doug Burgum as a frontrunner in the veepstakes\n\n\"The big danger right now is because all the attention is focused on Biden, that if you announce anything, it will get lost,\" Republican strategist Rob Burgess, who worked on the Trump 2016 and 2020 campaigns, told AFP.\n\nOne of the biggest factors for Trump will be his running mate's fund-raising prowess, and the contenders have all been under pressure to showcase their connections with wealthy mega-donors.\n\nMeanwhile, the campaign has ensured that they are booked regularly for cable news interviews -- a kind of casting call that allows Trump to assess how they look in front of the cameras, a priority for the former reality TV star.\n\nTrump said before the June 27 debate that he already knew who his running mate would be, noting that his pick would likely be attending that night.\n\nThe three frontrunners were all bused to the CNN studio in Atlanta along with some less-favored hopefuls to watch from a volleyball court before being sent in to pitch for Trump on the press line.\n\n- Big role? -\n\nPolitical analyst Donald Nieman said he expected Vance to get the nod as an articulate messenger for Trumpism who is seen as a draw for working class white men in the crucial swing states of Pennsylvania, Michigan and Wisconsin.\n\nSenator Marco Rubio of Florida is seen as the least likely of the Republican vice-presidential frontrunners to get the nod\n\nBut he added that a less \"thin-skinned\" Trump might have been persuaded to go with Nikki Haley, a one-time UN ambassador who was his last-standing rival in the nominating contest.\n\n\"She would bring Republican defectors and suburban women to Trump -- something he needs,\" Nieman, a history professor at Binghamton University in New York state, told AFP.\n\n\"But he won't because she hasn't signaled abject loyalty and a willingness to submerge her own identity.\"\n\nHaley, who says she is supporting Trump, has not been invited to the convention, according to Politico.\n\nIt remains to be seen in any case whether the successful candidate has what it takes to succeed where Mike Pence failed, and use the job as a springboard to the presidency.\n\n\"I'm not at all convinced that whoever Trump's vice president is, that he or she will have as significant a role as many of their predecessors,\" said constitutional expert Joel Goldstein, of Saint Louis University in Missouri.\n\n\"Although the vice president's role has grown, ultimately it depends upon the president's personality and his or her leadership style.\"", "source": {"uri": "dailymail.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "Daily Mail Online"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Senate", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "United States Senate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republican_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Republican Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/J._D._Vance", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "J.

But I have some ideas as to where we're going,\" Trump said in an interview with Fox News Channel's Sean Hannity that aired Monday night.\n\nThe decision will come at an unprecedented time of upheaval in the presidential race.

Because, you know, it might make a difference,\" he told Hannity.\n\nBut Trump will have plenty of opportunities this week to ratchet up the speculation about a process that his team has kept extraordinarily close to the vest.\n\n\"It could happen anytime this week,\" Trump senior adviser Jason Miller said in an appearance on Fox News.\n\nTrump has two rallies planned. The first is scheduled for Tuesday evening at his golf club in Doral, Florida, near Miami. The primetime scheduling and location would seem to provide an ideal opportunity to unveil his pick if it is Florida Sen. Marco Rubio, a Miami native who is one of his top contenders.\n\nRubio will be in attendance at the event, according to an adviser familiar with the senator's plans, who, like others, spoke on condition of anonymity about the selection process.\n\nOn Saturday Trump will travel to the critical battleground state of Pennsylvania for an afternoon rally at the Butler Farm Show. The venue, outside of Pittsburgh, is not far from the border of Ohio, which is home to Sen. JD Vance, another potential pick.\n\nListen now and subscribe: Apple Podcasts | Google Podcasts | Spotify | RSS Feed | SoundStack | All Of Our Podcasts\n\nAlso said to be on Trump's short list is North Dakota Gov. Doug Burgum, who has grown close to the former president since he dropped his own bid for the nomination before voting began.\n\nTrump doesn't need a rally to unveil his pick. He could simply announce the news on his Truth Social platform at any moment between now and the Republican National Convention, which kicks off in Milwaukee on July 15. Or he could wait until the convention opens to make a grand, on-stage curtain reveal reminiscent of his days as the host of the \"The Apprentice\" reality TV show.\n\nHe said Monday the announcement will come \"probably a little before the convention, but not much. It could even be during the convention that we'd do it. I'd love to do it during the convention. ... It would make it even more exciting.\"\n\nTrump has repeatedly said he intends to unveil his pick just before or during the convention. But he has been coy about his choice.\n\nLate last month, before the debate, Trump told NBC News at a campaign stop in Philadelphia that he'd already made a decision.\n\n\"In my mind, yeah,\" he said.\n\nBut less than a week later, he told a local Virginia television station that his decision was still in flux.\n\n\"Well I have people in mind. I have so many good people. We have such a deep bench,\" he said. \"But we'll be making a decision sometime early convention or before convention.\"\n\n\"As President Trump has said himself, the top criteria in selecting a Vice President is a strong leader who could make a great President,\" Trump adviser Brian Hughes said in a statement he has issued repeatedly. \"But anyone telling you they know who or when President Trump will choose his VP is lying unless that person is named Donald J. Trump.\"\n\nThat includes the front-runners for the job.\n\nOn CNN's \"State of the Union\" on Sunday, Rubio said he remained in the dark.\n\n\"Look, I've heard nothing, I know nothing, and you probably know more than I do about it,\" he said. \"Donald Trump has a decision to make. He'll make it when he needs to make it. He'll make a good decision. I know for certain that I will be out there over the next three or four months, working on behalf of his campaign in some capacity.\"\n\nHe also dismissed questions about whether he has discussed changing his residence from Florida if he's chosen as \"presumptuous.\" The Constitution bars the president and vice president from hailing from the same state.\n\n\"We'll confront those issues when they come,\" he said. \"But we're not there yet. But we will be soon, one way or the other.\"\n\nOn NBC's \"Meet the Press,\" Vance, too, said he has not received news one way or the other: \"I have not gotten the call.\"\n\n\"But most importantly,\" he went on, \"we're just trying to work to elect Donald Trump. Whoever his vice president is -- he's got a lot of good people he could choose from -- it's the policies that worked and the leadership style that worked for the American people. I think we have to bring that back to the White House, and I'm fighting to try to do that.\"\n\nCompanies donating the most money to Donald Trump Companies donating the most money to Donald Trump #22.

Biden needs that from Democrats.", "body": "As concern grows among some lawmakers and voters after the June 27 presidential debate, some are asking if Biden can be replaced as the nominee.\n\nThe dueling campaign emails that landed in my inbox back to back Monday afternoon captured the whipsaw essence of this ridiculous race.\n\n\"Joe Biden is dropping out of the race!\" the email from former President Donald Trump's campaign declared. \"You know it. I know it. Everybody knows it. It can happen at any moment.\"\n\nPresident Joe Biden's campaign offered this counter-declaration from him in an email nine minutes later:\n\n\"Let me be clear: I'm running. I'm the Democratic Party's nominee. No one is pushing me out. I'm not leaving.\"\n\nBoth asked for donations that they said they need to beat the other guy. But Biden is also asking for something else from his supporters - the kind of pass Republicans give Trump and his troubled bid for a second term.\n\nWill Democrats give Biden the same pass Republicans give Trump?\n\nThat's a tall order. I'm not so sure Biden catches that kind of a break from Democrats seriously freaked out by his disastrous debate performance, followed by days of limited, scripted appearances and then a 22-minute ABC News interview that did nothing to reset his campaign.\n\nThere's a reason for that, which probably seems unfair to many Democrats hoping Biden stays in the race. The Democratic Party these days holds its candidates far more accountable than the Republican Party does. Sorry, but politics has never been an endeavor rooted in a foundation of fair play.\n\nYou know who can change that approach to candidates? Democrats.\n\nBiden fails in critical moment: Biden's attempt to save his campaign and presidency was too underwhelming for the moment\n\nThey're the only people with the power to give Biden the sort of pass that Republicans give Trump, an immensely popular candidate who in the past year has become a convicted felon, was held liable in a civil case for sexual assault and faces fines of $454 million for running a business rife with fraud.\n\nBut here's the catch: A crucial Democratic argument for giving Biden a second term plays into the understandable trepidation that a second Trump term invokes. Biden has been previously cast as competent and stable, the opposite of Trump's autocratic irascibility.\n\nBut if Democrats treat Biden the way Republicans treat Trump, looking past the president's very evident physical and mental issues, then drawing distinctions between the two candidates goes all fuzzy.\n\nRemember when Hillary Clinton had pneumonia?\n\nThere's nothing new about this. Former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton tried to keep quiet about the pneumonia she was suffering from in September 2016 while battling Trump for the White House. That went sideways when she was spotted nearly collapsing in public.\n\nClinton took all kinds of heat as Trump reveled in her brief medical crisis, claiming she lacked the stamina to be president and required \"naps\" on the campaign trail. His supporters ate that up.\n\nDid they care eight years later when Trump had a hard time keeping his eyes open through his own criminal trial? They did not.\n\nThe closest Trump ever came to accountability was in October 2016, when the infamous Access Hollywood videotape leaked and voters heard the would-be president boasting about getting away with groping women. Some Republicans briefly suggested that Trump should drop his bid for the presidency. He flatly refused.\n\nSound familiar?\n\nAnd why? Because Trump had already - correctly - claimed that there was a significant portion of the Republican Party that would never dare to hold him accountable for anything.\n\nSCOTUS immunity ruling helps Biden: The Supreme Court just did Biden a huge favor by giving Trump immunity\n\nConsider one of Trump's most memorable boasts in the 2016 election: \"I could stand in the middle of Fifth Avenue and shoot somebody, and I wouldn't lose any voters,\" Trump told supporters in Iowa that January.\n\nTrump supporters have been consistent in their forgiveness\n\nTrump isn't just forgiven for demolishing norms and standards in American politics. A big chunk of his supporters celebrate it. This very vocal minority of Americans revel in Trump's distaste for civility and disregard for anyone in pursuit of his ambition.\n\nTrump showed up for the first debate in 2020 - in the middle of A pandemic - after a positive COVID-19 test but didn't share that publicly.\n\nWhile hospitalized for COVID-19 treatment, Trump forced Secret Service agents to pile into the presidential limousine so they could drive around the block, letting him wave to assembled supporters.\n\nOn Jan. 6, 2021, Trump sat sullenly in the White House, watching his supporters attack police officers during the riot at the U.S. Capitol. He spent hours shrugging off pleas from allies to intervene and stem the chaos.\n\nAsk Trump supporters about all that, and they'll flip the accountability on anyone but Trump. They'll pivot to complain about efforts to contain the coronavirus and suggest the Capitol riot was some sort of setup.\n\nDemocrats will soon have to rally behind Biden, like it or not\n\nAnd Democrats? Members of the U.S. House and Senate spent this week arguing in private and staking out positions in public. They all want to defeat Trump. Not all of them think Biden is up to that.\n\nBiden has rejected calls to step aside, and Vice President Kamala Harris has shown no inkling - or political leverage - to push him off the ticket. The Democrats don't want a convention fight in Chicago next month, so they're stuck with Biden unless he upstages his debate debacle with another public calamity.\n\nBiden has nearly 40 days until the Democratic Party makes the presidential nomination official and nearly four months until November's election. In a normal election year, that would look like plenty of time to right the ship.\n\nNothing about this election year is normal. The presumptive Republican nominee is a criminal campaigning on a promise of \"retribution.\" The presumptive Democratic nominee is an incumbent fighting some in his own party for political survival.\n\nNow we wait to see if Democrats can move like Republicans here. If Biden makes it to the convention and then to November's ballot, Democrats might have to load the gun, take him to Fifth Avenue, choose a target and hope his aim is true.\n\nFollow USA TODAY

Fox host Sean Hannity questioned the former president on Trump's \"short list\" as top Republican names such as Ohio Sen. J.D. Vance, North Dakota Gov. Doug Burgum, South Carolina Sen. Tim Scott and Florida Sen. Marco Rubio has all been floated as his running mate option. (RELATED: Poll Reveals Which Vice President Pick Helps Trump With Voters The Most)\n\n\"Well you know we started off with a lot of people, we have a lot of good people. We have a great bench in the Republican Party. The names that you mentioned are absolutely under consideration and I haven't made a final decision, but I have some ideas as to where we're going. And little bit, we wanted to see what they're doing to be honest, because it might make a difference, I don't know I'm not sure that it would. But there are those that say, 'Trump's waiting until he finds out what happens with crooked Joe Biden and we will see what happens with Biden,'\" Trump said.\n\n\"But I think that probably within the next week, week and a half. Probably sometime -- I'd love to do it during the convention, my people say that's a little complicated. You know in the old days they would announce a vice president during the convention. Today, with modern-day technology you can't do things you could've done 50 years ago very easily. But probably a little before the convention but not much. It could even be during convention that we do it. I'd love to do it during the convention, I think it would be a very interesting to build up and important for the convention, would make it even more exciting. It's going to be amazing, in Milwaukee.\"\n\n\"We'll be announcing soon and I think everybody's going to be very happy, the choice will be very, very good. It's going to be a great vice president -- meaning a person that can do a fantastic job as president because you always have to think of that first and then second somebody that helps you get elected, and there's nothing wrong with that,\" Trump continued.\n\nThe 2024 Republican National Convention is set to begin July 15 in Milwaukee, Wisconsin and end on July 18, which is where Trump is expected to take the stage as he accepts the GOP nomination for the presidential race. As Trump has previously teased about his options and choice for vice president, the long-awaited announcement has yet to have a concrete date.\n\nAccording to a Harvard-Harris poll from May, the survey found 25% of voters supporting Trump to largely be in support of Scott on the 2024 ticket, with 23% going for businessman Vivek Ramaswamy and 22% in support of Rubio as the option.", "source": {"uri": "dailycaller.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Daily Caller"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Biden", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marco_Rubio", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Marco Rubio"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vice_President_of_the_United_States", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Vice President of the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Running_mate", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Running mate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republican_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Republican Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fox_News", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Fox News"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doug_Burgum", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Doug Burgum"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/J._D._Vance", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "J.

(Justin Sullivan/Getty Images)\n\nFormer President Donald Trump on Monday indicated that he has not finalized who he will select as his vice presidential candidate, just days before the Republican nominating convention.\n\nDuring an interview with Fox News' Sean Hannity, the former president was asked about possible choices including Sens. J.D. Vance (R-Ohio), Marco Rubio (R-Fla.), and Tim Scott (R-S.C.), along with North Dakota Gov. Doug Burgum.\n\n\"The names that you mentioned, absolutely they're under consideration,\" the former president told the host. However, the former president said he hasn't \"made a final decision, but I have some ideas as to where we're going.\"\n\nFormer President Trump said he would \"love\" to announce his vice presidential pick during the Republican National Convention, which will be held in Milwaukee starting July 15. But he indicated that such a move might be \"a little complicated.\"\n\n\"Probably a little before the convention, but not much. It could even be during the convention that we'd do it,\" he said.\n\nWhile he did not make any indications on who he might choose on Monday, the former president provided more details on the type of person he wants as his No. 2. His running mate, he said, would have to be \"a person that can do a fantastic job as president,\" and \"somebody that helps you get elected.\"\n\nIn a separate interview, Trump campaign adviser Jason Miller said in a Monday interview with Fox News that the announcement \"could happen anytime this week\" or \"could happen literally right up until the first day of the convention.\"\n\nMr. Rubio, who ran against then-candidate Trump in 2016, will make an appearance at the former president's campaign rally at a Trump Doral golf club in Florida on Tuesday evening. On Saturday, the former president will hold a rally in a city located in western Pennsylvania, considered a battleground state, near the border with Ohio.\n\nOn July 7, the Florida senator mounted a defense of former President Trump during a CNN interview, pushing back on claims that the former president has close ties with the Heritage Foundation think tank's Project 2025. The former president late last week wrote on Truth Social that he has \"nothing to do with\" the project, which includes several former Trump administration officials.\n\nMr. Rubio also said he is fine with the former president's platform around abortion, which is more focused on states' rights.\n\n\"Our platform has to reflect our nominee, and our nominee's position happens to be one grounded in reality,\" Mr. Rubio told CNN, adding that \"voters at individual states who will get to decide how and to what level they want to restrict abortion, if at all.\"\n\nLater in the interview, he characterized the former president as the \"only one pro-life candidate in this race\" in response to questions about removing a federal abortion ban from the Republican Party's platform. \"You can't pass a federal law now even if we wanted to,\" he said.\n\nEarlier this week, Mr. Vance, a freshman senator with a finance background, told NBC News that he hasn't \"gotten the call\" from the Trump campaign about being the former president's vice presidential pick.\n\n\"We'll let the media know if I ever get that call,\" he said. \"But most importantly, we're just trying to work to elect Donald Trump. Whoever his vice president is, he's got a lot of good people he could choose from.\"\n\nMr. Burgum was asked last week by a Fox News anchor about whether he would want to be selected as vice president. \"I think the key thing for Kathryn and I has always been impact. We want to be in the spot where it can have the biggest impact,\" he replied, referring to his wife.\n\nThe Epoch Times contacted the Trump campaign for comment on Tuesday.", "source": {"uri": "ntd.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "NTD"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CNN", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "CNN"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republican_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Republican Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fox_News", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Fox News"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marco_Rubio", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Marco Rubio"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vice_President_of_the_United_States", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Vice President of the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doug_Burgum", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Doug Burgum"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/J._D._Vance", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "J.

President Joe Biden and the Democratic Party continue to grapple with his dismal debate performance and the intensifying calls for the 81-year-old president to step aside in favor of a younger candidate.\n\nPeople are also reading... 3 dead in plane crash near McDowell, Rutherford county line Plane crashes in McDowell; emergency crews ask people to avoid Brackett Town Road Marion man meets McDowell paramedic who saved his life 24 years ago Toddler killed by truck at Steel Creek campground north of Morganton Golden Hour Charcuterie opens in Marion's Depot District 3 from South Carolina die in Nebo plane crash; national safety board investigating Body found Sunday was Marion man; cause of death pending toxicology report Nebo woman charged with break-in McDowell Little League crowns two champions; league to host a baseball state tournament Burkemont Mountain in Morganton ablaze with 30-acre wildfire When are the 4th of July fireworks, parades in McDowell County?

Because, you know, it might make a difference,\" he told Hannity.\n\nBut Trump will have plenty of opportunities this week to ratchet up the speculation about a process that his team has kept extraordinarily close to the vest.\n\n\"It could happen anytime this week,\" Trump senior adviser Jason Miller said in an appearance on Fox News.\n\nTrump has two rallies planned. The first is scheduled for Tuesday evening at his golf club in Doral, Florida, near Miami. The primetime scheduling and location would seem to provide an ideal opportunity to unveil his pick if it is Florida Sen. Marco Rubio, a Miami native who is one of his top contenders.\n\nRubio will be in attendance at the event, according to an adviser familiar with the senator's plans, who, like others, spoke on condition of anonymity about the selection process.\n\nOn Saturday Trump will travel to the critical battleground state of Pennsylvania for an afternoon rally at the Butler Farm Show. The venue, outside of Pittsburgh, is not far from the border of Ohio, which is home to Sen. JD Vance, another potential pick.\n\nListen now and subscribe: Apple Podcasts | Google Podcasts | Spotify | RSS Feed | SoundStack | All Of Our Podcasts\n\nAlso said to be on Trump's short list is North Dakota Gov. Doug Burgum, who has grown close to the former president since he dropped his own bid for the nomination before voting began.\n\nTrump doesn't need a rally to unveil his pick. He could simply announce the news on his Truth Social platform at any moment between now and the Republican National Convention, which kicks off in Milwaukee on July 15. Or he could wait until the convention opens to make a grand, on-stage curtain reveal reminiscent of his days as the host of the \"The Apprentice\" reality TV show.\n\nHe said Monday the announcement will come \"probably a little before the convention, but not much. It could even be during the convention that we'd do it. I'd love to do it during the convention. ... It would make it even more exciting.\"\n\nTrump has repeatedly said he intends to unveil his pick just before or during the convention. But he has been coy about his choice.\n\nLate last month, before the debate, Trump told NBC News at a campaign stop in Philadelphia that he'd already made a decision.\n\n\"In my mind, yeah,\" he said.\n\nBut less than a week later, he told a local Virginia television station that his decision was still in flux.\n\n\"Well I have people in mind. I have so many good people. We have such a deep bench,\" he said. \"But we'll be making a decision sometime early convention or before convention.\"\n\n\"As President Trump has said himself, the top criteria in selecting a Vice President is a strong leader who could make a great President,\" Trump adviser Brian Hughes said in a statement he has issued repeatedly. \"But anyone telling you they know who or when President Trump will choose his VP is lying unless that person is named Donald J. Trump.\"\n\nThat includes the front-runners for the job.\n\nOn CNN's \"State of the Union\" on Sunday, Rubio said he remained in the dark.\n\n\"Look, I've heard nothing, I know nothing, and you probably know more than I do about it,\" he said. \"Donald Trump has a decision to make. He'll make it when he needs to make it. He'll make a good decision. I know for certain that I will be out there over the next three or four months, working on behalf of his campaign in some capacity.\"\n\nHe also dismissed questions about whether he has discussed changing his residence from Florida if he's chosen as \"presumptuous.\" The Constitution bars the president and vice president from hailing from the same state.\n\n\"We'll confront those issues when they come,\" he said. \"But we're not there yet. But we will be soon, one way or the other.\"\n\nOn NBC's \"Meet the Press,\" Vance, too, said he has not received news one way or the other: \"I have not gotten the call.\"\n\n\"But most importantly,\" he went on, \"we're just trying to work to elect Donald Trump. Whoever his vice president is -- he's got a lot of good people he could choose from -- it's the policies that worked and the leadership style that worked for the American people. I think we have to bring that back to the White House, and I'm fighting to try to do that.\"\n\nCompanies donating the most money to Donald Trump Companies donating the most money to Donald Trump #22.

But I have some ideas as to where we're going,\" Trump said in an interview with Fox News Channel's Sean Hannity that aired Monday night.\n\nThe decision will come at an unprecedented time of upheaval in the presidential race. President Joe Biden and the Democratic Party continue to grapple with his dismal debate performance and the intensifying calls for the 81-year-old president to step aside in favor of a younger candidate.\n\nPeople are also reading...\n\nCrete, Nebraska: 7 shot in 'welcoming community' by neighbor who 'hated everybody' Lincoln-based Valentino's closes A Street pizza shop Matt Rhule's 'right-hand man' leaves Nebraska football's coaching staff 'Grateful and excited': Megan Conway finds a landing anchor chair at 10/11 in Lincoln Big Chicken restaurant, founded by NBA star Shaquille O'Neal, is coming to Omaha Social media influencer Cam Wilder draws more than 1,000 to Lincoln park Lincoln man shot and killed Friday night in business parking lot Soft-serve survivors: How Zesto endured in Nebraska after its ice-cream empire melted Lincoln police identify victim, provide details from Friday night shooting Body of missing 17-year-old who jumped into Platte River to save girl found, authorities say Nebraska lawmakers 'bewildered' as Gov.

Jim Pillen vows tax plan will 'get the votes' despite shaky support\n\nThe Democrats' crisis has given Trump little incentive to change the subject with a VP announcement that would be sure to draw a flurry of attention and focus.\n\nTrump has also been waiting to see how things shake out with Biden.\n\n\"A little bit, you know, we wanted to see what they're doing, to be honest. Because, you know, it might make a difference,\" he told Hannity.\n\nBut Trump will have plenty of opportunities this week to ratchet up the speculation about a process that his team has kept extraordinarily close to the vest.\n\n\"It could happen anytime this week,\" Trump senior adviser Jason Miller said in an appearance on Fox News.\n\nTrump has two rallies planned. The first is scheduled for Tuesday evening at his golf club in Doral, Florida, near Miami. The primetime scheduling and location would seem to provide an ideal opportunity to unveil his pick if it is Florida Sen. Marco Rubio, a Miami native who is one of his top contenders.\n\nRubio will be in attendance at the event, according to an adviser familiar with the senator's plans, who, like others, spoke on condition of anonymity about the selection process.\n\nOn Saturday Trump will travel to the critical battleground state of Pennsylvania for an afternoon rally at the Butler Farm Show. The venue, outside of Pittsburgh, is not far from the border of Ohio, which is home to Sen. JD Vance, another potential pick.\n\nListen now and subscribe: Apple Podcasts | Google Podcasts | Spotify | RSS Feed | SoundStack | All Of Our Podcasts\n\nAlso said to be on Trump's short list is North Dakota Gov. Doug Burgum, who has grown close to the former president since he dropped his own bid for the nomination before voting began.\n\nTrump doesn't need a rally to unveil his pick. He could simply announce the news on his Truth Social platform at any moment between now and the Republican National Convention, which kicks off in Milwaukee on July 15. Or he could wait until the convention opens to make a grand, on-stage curtain reveal reminiscent of his days as the host of the \"The Apprentice\" reality TV show.\n\nHe said Monday the announcement will come \"probably a little before the convention, but not much. It could even be during the convention that we'd do it. I'd love to do it during the convention. ... It would make it even more exciting.\"\n\nTrump has repeatedly said he intends to unveil his pick just before or during the convention. But he has been coy about his choice.\n\nLate last month, before the debate, Trump told NBC News at a campaign stop in Philadelphia that he'd already made a decision.\n\n\"In my mind, yeah,\" he said.\n\nBut less than a week later, he told a local Virginia television station that his decision was still in flux.\n\n\"Well I have people in mind. I have so many good people. We have such a deep bench,\" he said. \"But we'll be making a decision sometime early convention or before convention.\"\n\n\"As President Trump has said himself, the top criteria in selecting a Vice President is a strong leader who could make a great President,\" Trump adviser Brian Hughes said in a statement he has issued repeatedly. \"But anyone telling you they know who or when President Trump will choose his VP is lying unless that person is named Donald J. Trump.\"\n\nThat includes the front-runners for the job.\n\nOn CNN's \"State of the Union\" on Sunday, Rubio said he remained in the dark.\n\n\"Look, I've heard nothing, I know nothing, and you probably know more than I do about it,\" he said. \"Donald Trump has a decision to make. He'll make it when he needs to make it. He'll make a good decision. I know for certain that I will be out there over the next three or four months, working on behalf of his campaign in some capacity.\"\n\nHe also dismissed questions about whether he has discussed changing his residence from Florida if he's chosen as \"presumptuous.\" The Constitution bars the president and vice president from hailing from the same state.\n\n\"We'll confront those issues when they come,\" he said. \"But we're not there yet. But we will be soon, one way or the other.\"\n\nOn NBC's \"Meet the Press,\" Vance, too, said he has not received news one way or the other: \"I have not gotten the call.\"\n\n\"But most importantly,\" he went on, \"we're just trying to work to elect Donald Trump. Whoever his vice president is -- he's got a lot of good people he could choose from -- it's the policies that worked and the leadership style that worked for the American people. I think we have to bring that back to the White House, and I'm fighting to try to do that.\"\n\nCompanies donating the most money to Donald Trump\n\nCompanies donating the most money to Donald Trump\n\n#22.

J.D. Vance (R-Ohio), Marco Rubio (R-Fla.), and Tim Scott (R-S.C.), along with North Dakota Gov. Doug Burgum.\n\n\"The names that you mentioned, absolutely they're under consideration,\" the former president told the host. However, the former president said he hasn't \"made a final decision, but I have some ideas as to where we're going.\"\n\nFormer President Trump said he would \"love\" to announce his vice presidential pick during the Republican National Convention, which will be held in Milwaukee starting July 15. But he indicated that such a move might be \"a little complicated.\"\n\n\"Probably a little before the convention, but not much. It could even be during the convention that we'd do it,\" he said.\n\nWhile he did not make any indications on who he might choose on Monday, the former president provided more details on the type of person he wants as his No. 2. His running mate, he said, would have to be \"a person that can do a fantastic job as president,\" and \"somebody that helps you get elected.\"\n\nIn a separate interview, Trump campaign adviser Jason Miller said in a Monday interview with Fox News that the announcement \"could happen anytime this week\" or \"could happen literally right up until the first day of the convention.\"\n\nMr. Rubio, who ran against then-candidate Trump in 2016, will make an appearance at the former president's campaign rally at a Trump Doral golf club in Florida on Tuesday evening. On Saturday, the former president will hold a rally in a city located in western Pennsylvania, considered a battleground state, near the border with Ohio.\n\nOn July 7, the Florida senator mounted a defense of former President Trump during a CNN interview, pushing back on claims that the former president has close ties with the Heritage Foundation think tank's Project 2025. The former president late last week wrote on Truth Social that he has \"nothing to do with\" the project, which includes several former Trump administration officials.\n\nMr. Rubio also said he is fine with the former president's platform around abortion, which is more focused on states' rights.\n\n\"Our platform has to reflect our nominee, and our nominee's position happens to be one grounded in reality,\" Mr. Rubio told CNN, adding that \"voters at individual states who will get to decide how and to what level they want to restrict abortion, if at all.\"\n\nLater in the interview, he characterized the former president as the \"only one pro-life candidate in this race\" in response to questions about removing a federal abortion ban from the Republican Party's platform. \"You can't pass a federal law now even if we wanted to,\" he said.\n\n\"We'll let the media know if I ever get that call,\" he said. \"But most importantly, we're just trying to work to elect Donald Trump. Whoever his vice president is, he's got a lot of good people he could choose from.\"\n\nThe Epoch Times contacted the Trump campaign for comment on Tuesday.", "source": {"uri": "theepochtimes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "www.theepochtimes.com"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fox_News", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Fox News"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marco_Rubio", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Marco Rubio"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vice_President_of_the_United_States", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Vice President of the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doug_Burgum", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Doug Burgum"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/J._D._Vance", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "J.

He didn't hold back.\n\nSpeaking to thousands of supporters at Trump National Doral Miami, Trump piled on Biden, Vice President Kamala Harris and the entirety of the Democratic Party. He mocked Biden's performance at last month's presidential debate, and at one point, he challenged Biden to another debate -- and then an \"18-hole golf match.\"\n\n\"The radical left Democrat Party is divided, in chaos and having a full-scale breakdown because they can't decide which of their candidates is more unfit to be president. Sleepy Joe Biden or Laughing Kamala,\" Trump said to loud cheers.\n\nBiden, who beat Trump nearly four years ago, has spent the last 10 days trying to rehabilitate his image -- and his party's confidence in him -- following a floundering performance in the first presidential debate that intensified concerns about his age and fitness for office.\n\nSince then, Biden has faced growing calls from some in his own party -- including donors, lawmakers and voters -- to withdraw from the presidential race and make room for a new candidate to step in and challenge Trump, who vowed Tuesday to defeat any Democrat who runs against him.\n\n\"It doesn't matter who they nominate because we're going to beat any one of them,\" he said.\n\nWhile Biden has insisted that he will continue to seek a second term, some Republicans at Tuesday's rally saw the debate flub as a chance to bury Biden's campaign months before voters begin casting their ballots.\n\n\"We wanted to give the Democrats a little bit of time to self-destruct, and that's exactly what's happened over the past week and a half,\" said Kevin Cabrera, a Miami-Dade County Commissioner and a surrogate for the Trump campaign. \"They don't even know who their nominee is going to be right now, and we're here to rally around our candidate.\"\n\nIn the leadup to Trump's remarks, the rally more closely resembled a Fourth of July picnic rather than a political hypefest. Thousands of supporters sprawled out across the lawn of Trump's Doral golf course, while hundreds more crowded in a line for water bottles, hoping for some relief from near-triple-digit temperatures.\n\nSome attendees wafted themselves with American-flag-emblazoned paper fans. Taking the stage as the heat began to let up on Tuesday evening, U.S. Sen.

This time, however, he said it would be \"man-to-man\" and \"no holds barred\" with no moderators.\n\nThen Trump upped the ante by also challenging Biden to an 18-hole contest on his Trump National Doral golf course, the famed \"Blue Monster.\"\n\n\"It will be among the most watched sporting events in history,\" Trump said, adding that if Biden won Trump would write a $1 million check to the charity of the president's choice.\n\nBut the 45th president said he doubted his successor would accept.\n\n\"I bet you he doesn't take the offer, because he is all talk,\" he said.", "source": {"uri": "golfweek.usatoday.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Golfweek"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Biden", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump_2024_presidential_campaign", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump 2024 presidential campaign"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republican_National_Convention", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Republican National Convention"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golf", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Golf"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miami", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Miami"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Miami"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doral,_Florida", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Doral, Florida"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Doral, Florida"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tax_cut", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Tax cut"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deportation", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Deportation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republican_National_Committee", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Republican National Committee"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trump_National_Doral_Miami", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Trump National Doral Miami"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Health/Fitness/Advice_and_Guides", "label": "dmoz/Health/Fitness/Advice and Guides", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Niche/Politics", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Niche/Politics", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Work/Company_Loyalty", "label": "dmoz/Society/Work/Company Loyalty", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 92}], "image": "https://golfweek.usatoday.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/87/2024/04/USATSI_22964185.jpg?w=640", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9717617", "eventUri": "eng-9717617", "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Doral, Florida"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-06-27", "textStart": 878, "textEnd": 885}], "sentiment": -0.02745098039215688, "wgt": 147, "relevance": 1}

'Where is Barron? Stand up. Look at him! ... You're pretty popular. He may be more popular than Don and Eric. We gotta talk about this. Hey, Don, we've gotta talk about this huh?'\n\nThe 78-year-old ex-president said 'welcome to the scene, Barron,' and cracked that his youngest son 'had such a nice, easy life - now it's a little bit changed.'\n\nBut Trump led the rally with a new challenge for former President Joe Biden, whose reelection campaign has been imperiled by his poor debate performance late last month.\n\nThe ex-president first said he wanted to debate Biden again - 'next week' - which would coincide with the Republican National Convention.\n\nHe also said he wanted to play Biden in a game of golf - and staked $1 million on the deal.\n\nBarron Trump stands and pumps his first as the crowd cheers at Tuesday night's Trump rally in Doral, Florida.

Trump offered to donate $1 million to a charity of Biden's choice if he were to lose the match.\n\nDuring a rally at the Blue Monster course in Doral, considered one of the world's greatest tournament golf courses, Trump said, \"I'm also officially challenging crooked Joe to an 18-hole golf match right here on Doral's Blue Monster, considered one of the greatest tournament golf courses anywhere in the world, one of the great courses of the world.It will be among the most-watched sporting events in history. Maybe bigger than the Ryder Cup or even the Masters.\"\n\nTrump even offered to give Biden a 10-stroke advantage per side, which equates to a total of 20 strokes. He added, \"And if he wins, I will give the charity of his choice, any charity of his choice, $1 million. And I'll bet you he doesn't take the offer.\"\n\nIn response, Biden's spokesperson, James Singer, criticised Trump's recent actions and statements, including his absence from the public eye, inviting fictional serial killers to dinner, praising Project 2025 architect Tom Homan, and challenging the President to a golf match. Singer emphasised that Biden is focused on leading the country and defending the free world, rather than engaging in Trump's antics.\n\n\"Donald Trump hasn't been seen in public for 12 days, now he's inviting fictional serial killers to dinner, teasing lil' Marco Rubio, praising Project 2025 architect Tom Homan, and challenging the President of the United States to golf,\" he said.\n\n\"We'd challenge Donald Trump to create jobs, but he lost 3 million. We'd challenge Donald Trump to stand up to Putin, but he bent the knee to him. We'd challenge Donald Trump to follow the law, but he breaks it. We'd challenge Donald Trump to not destroy our country, but that's all his Project 2025 aims to do,\" Singer added.\n\nSinger also asserted that \"Joe Biden doesn't have time for Donald Trump's weird antics - he's busy leading America and defending the free world. Donald Trump is a liar, a convict, and a fraud only out for himself - par for the course.\"\n\nThe golf handicap debate originated during the June 27 debate in Atlanta when Trump claimed to have won two club championships and questioned Biden's ability to drive a ball 50 yards. Biden initially said that he had a six handicap as vice president but later corrected it to an eight. Trump expressed disbelief, calling it \"the biggest lie.\"\n\nReigning US Open champion Bryson DeChambeau offered to host the golf match on his YouTube channel to help settle the handicap debate.\n\nAt TOI World Desk, our dedicated team of seasoned journalists and passionate writers tirelessly sifts through the vast tapestry of global events to bring you the latest news and diverse perspectives round the clock.

Vance of Ohio and Marco Rubio of Florida, as well as North Dakota Governor Doug Burgum, who initially ran against Trump for the nomination before falling in line.\n\nThe calculus might yet change, as Trump told Fox News on Monday that he was weighing a \"great bench\" of prospects and had not made a decision.\n\n\"It's going to be a great vice president, meaning a person that can do a fantastic job as president, because you always have to think of that first,\" he said.\n\n\"And then, second, somebody that helps you get elected. And there's nothing wrong with that.\"\n\nEver the consummate showman, Trump has been ramping up the intrigue, sending out a \"long list\" of contenders early on and offering conflicting accounts of how far along he was in the selection process.\n\nThere was speculation that he might use his first public appearance in 11 days to announce Rubio as he addressed supporters at his Doral golf club, on the outskirts of Miami.\n\nHe namechecked the senator, who was in the front row, several times but was silent on his thinking for the veepstakes.\n\nTrump could have dropped his big reveal at any point in the days before Milwaukee, except that the news would have interrupted arguably one of the worst weeks in the career of his 81-year-old rival Joe Biden.\n\nThe veteran Democrat is facing calls to drop out of the race after a widely-panned debate performance against Trump raised questions about the mental capacity of America's oldest-ever president.\n\n\"The big danger right now is because all the attention is focused on Biden, that if you announce anything, it will get lost,\" Republican strategist Rob Burgess, who worked on the Trump 2016 and 2020 campaigns, told AFP.\n\nOne of the biggest factors for Trump will be his running mate's fund-raising prowess, and the contenders have all been under pressure to showcase their connections with wealthy mega-donors.\n\nMeanwhile, the campaign has ensured that they are booked regularly for cable news interviews -- a kind of casting call that allows Trump to assess how they look in front of the cameras, a priority for the former reality TV star.\n\nTrump said before the June 27 debate that he already knew who his running mate would be, noting that his pick would likely be attending that night.\n\nThe three frontrunners were all bused to the CNN studio in Atlanta along with some less-favored hopefuls to watch from a volleyball court before being sent in to pitch for Trump on the press line.\n\nPolitical analyst Donald Nieman said he expected Vance to get the nod as an articulate messenger for Trumpism who is seen as a draw for working class white men in the crucial swing states of Pennsylvania, Michigan and Wisconsin.\n\nBut he added that a less \"thin-skinned\" Trump might have been persuaded to go with Nikki Haley, a one-time UN ambassador who was his last-standing rival in the nominating contest.\n\n\"She would bring Republican defectors and suburban women to Trump -- something he needs,\" Nieman, a history professor at Binghamton University in New York state, told AFP.\n\n\"But he won't because she hasn't signaled abject loyalty and a willingness to submerge her own identity.\"\n\nHaley, who says she is supporting Trump, has not been invited to the convention, according to Politico.\n\nIt remains to be seen in any case whether the successful candidate has what it takes to succeed where Mike Pence failed, and use the job as a springboard to the presidency.\n\n\"I'm not at all convinced that whoever Trump's vice president is, that he or she will have as significant a role as many of their predecessors,\" said constitutional expert Joel Goldstein, of Saint Louis University in Missouri.\n\n\"Although the vice president's role has grown, ultimately it depends upon the president's personality and his or her leadership style.\"", "source": {"uri": "ibtimes.com.au", "dataType": "news", "title": "International Business Times AU"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marco_Rubio", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Marco Rubio"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Senate", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "United States Senate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republican_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Republican Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Milwaukee", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Milwaukee"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Milwaukee"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fox_News", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Fox News"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doug_Burgum", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Doug Burgum"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/J._D._Vance", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "J.

Biden's performance was so poor, some Democratic Party insiders called for him to drop his reelection bid. The president has remained defiant, however, and insists he is staying in the race.\n\n\"So, tonight, I'm officially offering Joe the chance to redeem himself in front of the entire world,\" Trump told rally-goers. \"Let's do another debate this week so that Sleepy Joe Biden can prove to everyone all over the world that he has what it takes to be president. But this time it will be man-to-man, no moderators, no-holds-barred. Just name the place anytime, anywhere.\"\n\nTrump then pivoted to an exchange he had with Biden regarding their respective golf games.\n\n\"And in the debate, Sleepy Joe also declared that he wanted to test his skills and stamina against mine on the golf course,\" he went on. \"Can you believe this? Did you ever see him swing?\"\n\nThe former president then mocked Biden by making a half-assed swinging motion.\n\n\"I'm also officially challenging Crooked Joe to an 18-hole golf match right here on Doral's Blue Monster [Trump National golf course], considered one of the greatest tournament golf courses anywhere in the world. One of the great courses in the world. It will be among the most-watched sporting events in history. Maybe bigger than the Ryder Cup or even the Masters.\"\n\nTrump added that he would spot Biden a 20-stroke lead.\n\n\"And if he wins, I will give the charity of his choice - any charity that he wants - $1 million,\" he continued. \"And I'll bet you he doesn't take the offer.\"", "source": {"uri": "mediaite.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Mediaite"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Biden", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golf", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Golf"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Democratic Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doral,_Florida", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Doral, Florida"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Doral, Florida"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golf_course", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Golf course"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swing_(politics)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Swing (politics)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ryder_Cup", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Ryder Cup"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Golf", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Golf", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Golf/Rules_and_Etiquette", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Golf/Rules and Etiquette", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Golf/Humor", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Golf/Humor", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 57}], "image": "https://www.mediaite.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Screen-Shot-2024-07-09-at-5.23.06-PM.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9717617", "eventUri": "eng-9717617", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.01960784313725494, "wgt": 145, "relevance": 1}

Marco Rubio (R-Fla.) and JD Vance (R-Ohio) and North Dakota Gov. Doug Burgum (R) as his top potential running mates, though Rubio and Vance have reportedly been at the center of discussions.\n\n\"If I were President Trump, I would make sure I pick somebody that could add value in 2024. Expand the map, take -- prosecute the case against the liberals,\" Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.), a Trump ally, said Sunday on \"Face the Nation.\"\n\nTrump is expected to make his choice public ahead of the Republican National Convention, which kicks off next Monday. One source close to the campaign said the former president could make the announcement at a Florida campaign rally on Tuesday, a Pennsylvania rally scheduled for Saturday, or, perhaps most likely, in a post on Truth Social.\n\n\"It could happen anytime this week. Could happen literally right up until the first day of the convention,\" senior Trump campaign adviser Jason Miller said Monday on Fox News.\n\nHowever, news of Trump's running mate announcement could potentially interrupt arguably one of the most negative news cycles of President Biden's administration.\n\n\"Outside of Election Day 2016, this has been the best two-week stretch of Donald Trump's political career,\" said Ford O'Connell, a Republican strategist. \"He's leading in national polls, he's leading in state polls, he's leading in cash on hand, and Democrats are talking about ejecting his opponent from the ticket. No way is he going to enter the fray.\"\n\nBoth Vance and Rubio said Sunday they had not heard one way or the other about whether they were the pick to join Trump on the ticket.\n\nAll three men -- Vance, Rubio and Burgum -- have their backers and detractors lobbying for or against them.\n\nThe Wall Street Journal pegged Burgum as the \"best man\" for the job, citing his ability to govern and his business background, while critics have questioned whether the red-state governor would do much to expand Trump's appeal.\n\nRep. Jim Banks (R-Ind.) and some other lawmakers have advocated for Vance, praising him as the face of the America First movement in Congress and a capable messenger for the ticket. But skeptics have questioned if Vance, who is a first-term senator, has the experience needed to serve as vice president alongside Trump, who is 78 and limited to one more term.\n\nRubio's allies have argued the senator could help expand Trump's appeal to minority voters, which could chip away at President Biden's coalition and potentially flip swing states in Trump's favor. Rubio and Trump were bitter rivals in the 2016 presidential race, though, and the senator would need to move outside of Florida in order to join the ticket.\n\n\"There's been no indication when it will be or who it will be. President Trump and his team have done an epic job building suspense,\" said one Republican strategist familiar with the process.\n\nThe Trump campaign has for weeks been tight-lipped about any developments in the search for a running mate, saying only the former president knows whom he will ultimately pick.\n\n\"As President Trump has said himself, the top criteria in selecting a vice president is a strong leader who could make a great President,\" senior campaign adviser Brian Hughes said in a statement. \"But anyone telling you they know who or when President Trump will choose his VP is lying unless that person is named Donald J. Trump.\"\n\nThe Trump campaign last month sent vetting materials to several candidates. In addition to the finalists, the campaign was in touch with Rep. Elise Stefanik (R-N.Y.), Rep. Byron Donalds (R-Fla.), Sen. Tom Cotton (R-Ark.), Sen. Tim Scott (R-S.C.) and former Secretary of Housing and Urban Development Ben Carson.\n\nWhile Trump zeroes in on his choice, some Republicans have pushed for the former president to consider a running mate with broad appeal to more moderate voters who could bolster his standing in swing states.\n\nSome Republicans have suggested that Trump should consider choosing Virginia Gov. Glenn Youngkin (R) as his running mate, citing Youngkin's appeal outside of Trump circles. The chatter around the governor comes as Republicans feel increasingly optimistic about Virginia, a state that hasn't gone for the party since 2004.\n\n\"Somebody's not being talked about, that should be in my view, is Youngkin from Virginia. If we win Virginia, we win. It is over,\" Graham said in the same interview on \"Face the Nation.\"\n\nTrump said last month at his postdebate rally in Virginia that he is \"considering\" Youngkin as an option. Youngkin, in turn, has responded to the speculation, saying he is \"humbled\" but focused on his current job.\n\nWhen asked about the running mate speculation surrounding Youngkin, Trump donor Dan Eberhart said \"maybe, but he isn't MAGA.\"", "source": {"uri": "thehill.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Hill"}, "authors": [{"uri": "brett_samuels@thehill.com", "name": "Brett Samuels",

But I have some ideas as to where we're going,\" Trump said in an interview with Fox News Channel's Sean Hannity that aired Monday night.\n\nPi Pizzeria closing last remaining location, in St. Louis' Central West End McClellan: Downtown St. Louis is a casualty of the do-gooder war Tropical Storm Beryl could hit St. Louis area with 4 inches of rain or more Hulk Hogan starts selling his new Real American Beer in Missouri, competing with Bud Light BenFred: Why Jordan Walker's name will provide hot-stove fodder as Cardinals near trade deadline Wentzville schools investigated board members for alleged retaliation, ethics violations Parades, fireworks and parties: Your guide to July 4th in St. Louis Several St. Louis-area cities move fireworks shows to Friday.

President Joe Biden and the Democratic Party continue to grapple with his dismal debate performance and the intensifying calls for the 81-year-old president to step aside in favor of a younger candidate.\n\nThe Democrats' crisis has given Trump little incentive to change the subject with a VP announcement that would be sure to draw a flurry of attention and focus.\n\nTrump has also been waiting to see how things shake out with Biden.\n\n\"A little bit, you know, we wanted to see what they're doing, to be honest. Because, you know, it might make a difference,\" he told Hannity.\n\nBut Trump will have plenty of opportunities this week to ratchet up the speculation about a process that his team has kept extraordinarily close to the vest.\n\n\"It could happen anytime this week,\" Trump senior adviser Jason Miller said in an appearance on Fox News.\n\nTrump has two rallies planned. The first is scheduled for Tuesday evening at his golf club in Doral, Florida, near Miami. The primetime scheduling and location would seem to provide an ideal opportunity to unveil his pick if it is Florida Sen. Marco Rubio, a Miami native who is one of his top contenders.\n\nRubio will be in attendance at the event, according to an adviser familiar with the senator's plans, who, like others, spoke on condition of anonymity about the selection process.\n\nOn Saturday Trump will travel to the critical battleground state of Pennsylvania for an afternoon rally at the Butler Farm Show. The venue, outside of Pittsburgh, is not far from the border of Ohio, which is home to Sen. JD Vance, another potential pick.\n\nAlso said to be on Trump's short list is North Dakota Gov. Doug Burgum, who has grown close to the former president since he dropped his own bid for the nomination before voting began.\n\nTrump doesn't need a rally to unveil his pick. He could simply announce the news on his Truth Social platform at any moment between now and the Republican National Convention, which kicks off in Milwaukee on July 15. Or he could wait until the convention opens to make a grand, on-stage curtain reveal reminiscent of his days as the host of the \"The Apprentice\" reality TV show.\n\nHe said Monday the announcement will come \"probably a little before the convention, but not much. It could even be during the convention that we'd do it. I'd love to do it during the convention. ... It would make it even more exciting.\"\n\nTrump has repeatedly said he intends to unveil his pick just before or during the convention. But he has been coy about his choice.\n\nLate last month, before the debate, Trump told NBC News at a campaign stop in Philadelphia that he'd already made a decision.\n\n\"In my mind, yeah,\" he said.\n\nBut less than a week later, he told a local Virginia television station that his decision was still in flux.\n\n\"Well I have people in mind. I have so many good people. We have such a deep bench,\" he said. \"But we'll be making a decision sometime early convention or before convention.\"\n\n\"As President Trump has said himself, the top criteria in selecting a Vice President is a strong leader who could make a great President,\" Trump adviser Brian Hughes said in a statement he has issued repeatedly. \"But anyone telling you they know who or when President Trump will choose his VP is lying unless that person is named Donald J. Trump.\"\n\nThat includes the front-runners for the job.\n\nOn CNN's \"State of the Union\" on Sunday, Rubio said he remained in the dark.\n\n\"Look, I've heard nothing, I know nothing, and you probably know more than I do about it,\" he said. \"Donald Trump has a decision to make. He'll make it when he needs to make it. He'll make a good decision. I know for certain that I will be out there over the next three or four months, working on behalf of his campaign in some capacity.\"\n\nHe also dismissed questions about whether he has discussed changing his residence from Florida if he's chosen as \"presumptuous.\" The Constitution bars the president and vice president from hailing from the same state.\n\n\"We'll confront those issues when they come,\" he said. \"But we're not there yet. But we will be soon, one way or the other.\"\n\nOn NBC's \"Meet the Press,\" Vance, too, said he has not received news one way or the other: \"I have not gotten the call.\"\n\n\"But most importantly,\" he went on, \"we're just trying to work to elect Donald Trump. Whoever his vice president is -- he's got a lot of good people he could choose from -- it's the policies that worked and the leadership style that worked for the American people. I think we have to bring that back to the White House, and I'm fighting to try to do that.\"\n\n0 Comments", "source": {"uri": "stltoday.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "St. Louis Post-Dispatch"},

Vance of Ohio and Marco Rubio of Florida, as well as North Dakota Governor Doug Burgum, who initially ran against Trump for the nomination before falling in line.\n\nThe calculus might yet change, as Trump told Fox News on Monday that he was weighing a \"great bench\" of prospects and had not made a decision.\n\n\"It's going to be a great vice president, meaning a person that can do a fantastic job as president, because you always have to think of that first,\" he said.\n\n\"And then, second, somebody that helps you get elected. And there's nothing wrong with that.\"\n\nEver the consummate showman, Trump has been ramping up the intrigue, sending out a \"long list\" of contenders early on and offering conflicting accounts of how far along he was in the selection process.\n\nThere was speculation that he might use his first public appearance in 11 days to announce Rubio as he addressed supporters at his Doral golf club, on the outskirts of Miami.\n\nHe namechecked the senator, who was in the front row, several times but was silent on his thinking for the veepstakes.\n\n- Casting call -\n\nTrump could have dropped his big reveal at any point in the days before Milwaukee, except that the news would have interrupted arguably one of the worst weeks in the career of his 81-year-old rival Joe Biden.\n\nThe veteran Democrat is facing calls to drop out of the race after a widely-panned debate performance against Trump raised questions about the mental capacity of America's oldest-ever president.\n\n\"The big danger right now is because all the attention is focused on Biden, that if you announce anything, it will get lost,\" Republican strategist Rob Burgess, who worked on the Trump 2016 and 2020 campaigns, told AFP.\n\nOne of the biggest factors for Trump will be his running mate's fund-raising prowess, and the contenders have all been under pressure to showcase their connections with wealthy mega-donors.\n\nMeanwhile, the campaign has ensured that they are booked regularly for cable news interviews -- a kind of casting call that allows Trump to assess how they look in front of the cameras, a priority for the former reality TV star.\n\nTrump said before the June 27 debate that he already knew who his running mate would be, noting that his pick would likely be attending that night.\n\nThe three frontrunners were all bused to the CNN studio in Atlanta along with some less-favored hopefuls to watch from a volleyball court before being sent in to pitch for Trump on the press line.\n\n- Big role? -\n\nPolitical analyst Donald Nieman said he expected Vance to get the nod as an articulate messenger for Trumpism who is seen as a draw for working class white men in the crucial swing states of Pennsylvania, Michigan and Wisconsin.\n\nBut he added that a less \"thin-skinned\" Trump might have been persuaded to go with Nikki Haley, a one-time UN ambassador who was his last-standing rival in the nominating contest.\n\n\"She would bring Republican defectors and suburban women to Trump -- something he needs,\" Nieman, a history professor at Binghamton University in New York state, told AFP.\n\n\"But he won't because she hasn't signaled abject loyalty and a willingness to submerge her own identity.\"\n\nHaley, who says she is supporting Trump, has not been invited to the convention, according to Politico.\n\nIt remains to be seen in any case whether the successful candidate has what it takes to succeed where Mike Pence failed, and use the job as a springboard to the presidency.\n\n\"I'm not at all convinced that whoever Trump's vice president is, that he or she will have as significant a role as many of their predecessors,\" said constitutional expert Joel Goldstein, of Saint Louis University in Missouri.\n\n\"Although the vice president's role has grown, ultimately it depends upon the president's personality and his or her leadership style.\"", "source": {"uri": "yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo"}, "authors": [{"uri": "frankie_taggart@yahoo.com", "name": "Frankie Taggart", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marco_Rubio", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Marco Rubio"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Senate", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "United States Senate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republican_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Republican Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Milwaukee", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Milwaukee"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Milwaukee"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fox_News", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Fox News"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doug_Burgum", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Doug Burgum"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/J._D._Vance", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "J.

But I have some ideas as to where we're going,\" Trump said in an interview with Fox News Channel's Sean Hannity that aired Monday night.\n\nThe decision will come at an unprecedented time of upheaval in the presidential race. President Joe Biden and the Democratic Party continue to grapple with his dismal debate performance and the intensifying calls for the 81-year-old president to step aside in favor of a younger candidate.\n\nPeople are also reading...

Because, you know, it might make a difference,\" he told Hannity.\n\nBut Trump will have plenty of opportunities this week to ratchet up the speculation about a process that his team has kept extraordinarily close to the vest.\n\n\"It could happen anytime this week,\" Trump senior adviser Jason Miller said in an appearance on Fox News.\n\nTrump has two rallies planned. The first is scheduled for Tuesday evening at his golf club in Doral, Florida, near Miami. The primetime scheduling and location would seem to provide an ideal opportunity to unveil his pick if it is Florida Sen. Marco Rubio, a Miami native who is one of his top contenders.\n\nRubio will be in attendance at the event, according to an adviser familiar with the senator's plans, who, like others, spoke on condition of anonymity about the selection process.\n\nOn Saturday Trump will travel to the critical battleground state of Pennsylvania for an afternoon rally at the Butler Farm Show. The venue, outside of Pittsburgh, is not far from the border of Ohio, which is home to Sen. JD Vance, another potential pick.\n\nListen now and subscribe: Apple Podcasts | Google Podcasts | Spotify | RSS Feed | SoundStack | All Of Our Podcasts\n\nAlso said to be on Trump's short list is North Dakota Gov. Doug Burgum, who has grown close to the former president since he dropped his own bid for the nomination before voting began.\n\nTrump doesn't need a rally to unveil his pick. He could simply announce the news on his Truth Social platform at any moment between now and the Republican National Convention, which kicks off in Milwaukee on July 15. Or he could wait until the convention opens to make a grand, on-stage curtain reveal reminiscent of his days as the host of the \"The Apprentice\" reality TV show.\n\nHe said Monday the announcement will come \"probably a little before the convention, but not much. It could even be during the convention that we'd do it. I'd love to do it during the convention. ... It would make it even more exciting.\"\n\nTrump has repeatedly said he intends to unveil his pick just before or during the convention. But he has been coy about his choice.\n\nLate last month, before the debate, Trump told NBC News at a campaign stop in Philadelphia that he'd already made a decision.\n\n\"In my mind, yeah,\" he said.\n\nBut less than a week later, he told a local Virginia television station that his decision was still in flux.\n\n\"Well I have people in mind. I have so many good people. We have such a deep bench,\" he said. \"But we'll be making a decision sometime early convention or before convention.\"\n\n\"As President Trump has said himself, the top criteria in selecting a Vice President is a strong leader who could make a great President,\" Trump adviser Brian Hughes said in a statement he has issued repeatedly. \"But anyone telling you they know who or when President Trump will choose his VP is lying unless that person is named Donald J. Trump.\"\n\nThat includes the front-runners for the job.\n\nOn CNN's \"State of the Union\" on Sunday, Rubio said he remained in the dark.\n\n\"Look, I've heard nothing, I know nothing, and you probably know more than I do about it,\" he said. \"Donald Trump has a decision to make. He'll make it when he needs to make it. He'll make a good decision. I know for certain that I will be out there over the next three or four months, working on behalf of his campaign in some capacity.\"\n\nHe also dismissed questions about whether he has discussed changing his residence from Florida if he's chosen as \"presumptuous.\" The Constitution bars the president and vice president from hailing from the same state.\n\n\"We'll confront those issues when they come,\" he said. \"But we're not there yet. But we will be soon, one way or the other.\"\n\nOn NBC's \"Meet the Press,\" Vance, too, said he has not received news one way or the other: \"I have not gotten the call.\"\n\n\"But most importantly,\" he went on, \"we're just trying to work to elect Donald Trump. Whoever his vice president is -- he's got a lot of good people he could choose from -- it's the policies that worked and the leadership style that worked for the American people. I think we have to bring that back to the White House, and I'm fighting to try to do that.\"\n\nCompanies donating the most money to Donald Trump Companies donating the most money to Donald Trump #22.

And I bet you he doesn't take the offer.\"\n\nThe pair had previously sparred over who had a better long game during the debate, and the Biden campaign's response to the latest challenge came in the form of a golf pun.\n\n\"Joe Biden doesn't have time for Donald Trump's weird antics -- he's busy leading America and defending the free world,\" it said.\n\n\"Donald Trump is a liar, a convict, and a fraud only out for himself par for the course.\"\n\nFlorida Senator Marco Rubio is a frontrunner in the contest to be named Trump's running mate at next week's Republican nominating convention in Milwaukee, and he was in the front row to cheer on Trump and deliver brief remarks of his own.\n\nNearby, a digital billboard underscored the evolution that the Republican Party has undergone under Trump, playing 2016 footage of Rubio eviscerating the man he is hoping to work with for the next four years.\n\n\"You all have friends that are thinking about voting for Donald Trump,\" the now staunchly loyal Rubio was seen telling a crowd in Texas. \"Friends do not let friends vote for con artists.\"\n\nbur-ft/des\n\nMore from this section\n\nInformative Research Adds Brandon Hall as New

Vance of Ohio and Marco Rubio of Florida, as well as North Dakota Governor Doug Burgum, who initially ran against Trump for the nomination before falling in line.\n\nThe calculus might yet change, as Trump told Fox News on Monday that he was weighing a \"great bench\" of prospects and had not made a decision.\n\n\"It's going to be a great vice president, meaning a person that can do a fantastic job as president, because you always have to think of that first,\" he said.\n\n\"And then, second, somebody that helps you get elected. And there's nothing wrong with that.\"\n\nEver the consummate showman, Trump has been ramping up the intrigue, sending out a \"long list\" of contenders early on and offering conflicting accounts of how far along he was in the selection process.\n\nThere was speculation that he might use his first public appearance in 11 days to announce Rubio as he addressed supporters at his Doral golf club, on the outskirts of Miami.\n\nHe namechecked the senator, who was in the front row, several times but was silent on his thinking for the veepstakes.\n\n- Casting call -\n\nTrump could have dropped his big reveal at any point in the days before Milwaukee, except that the news would have interrupted arguably one of the worst weeks in the career of his 81-year-old rival Joe Biden.\n\nThe veteran Democrat is facing calls to drop out of the race after a widely-panned debate performance against Trump raised questions about the mental capacity of America's oldest-ever president.\n\n\"The big danger right now is because all the attention is focused on Biden, that if you announce anything, it will get lost,\" Republican strategist Rob Burgess, who worked on the Trump 2016 and 2020 campaigns, told AFP.\n\nOne of the biggest factors for Trump will be his running mate's fund-raising prowess, and the contenders have all been under pressure to showcase their connections with wealthy mega-donors.\n\nMeanwhile, the campaign has ensured that they are booked regularly for cable news interviews -- a kind of casting call that allows Trump to assess how they look in front of the cameras, a priority for the former reality TV star.\n\nTrump said before the June 27 debate that he already knew who his running mate would be, noting that his pick would likely be attending that night.\n\nThe three frontrunners were all bused to the CNN studio in Atlanta along with some less-favored hopefuls to watch from a volleyball court before being sent in to pitch for Trump on the press line.\n\n- Big role? -\n\nPolitical analyst Donald Nieman said he expected Vance to get the nod as an articulate messenger for Trumpism who is seen as a draw for working class white men in the crucial swing states of Pennsylvania, Michigan and Wisconsin.\n\nBut he added that a less \"thin-skinned\" Trump might have been persuaded to go with Nikki Haley, a one-time UN ambassador who was his last-standing rival in the nominating contest.\n\n\"She would bring Republican defectors and suburban women to Trump -- something he needs,\" Nieman, a history professor at Binghamton University in New York state, told AFP.\n\n\"But he won't because she hasn't signaled abject loyalty and a willingness to submerge her own identity.\"\n\nHaley, who says she is supporting Trump, has not been invited to the convention, according to Politico.\n\nIt remains to be seen in any case whether the successful candidate has what it takes to succeed where Mike Pence failed, and use the job as a springboard to the presidency.\n\n\"I'm not at all convinced that whoever Trump's vice president is, that he or she will have as significant a role as many of their predecessors,\" said constitutional expert Joel Goldstein, of Saint Louis University in Missouri.\n\n\"Although the vice president's role has grown, ultimately it depends upon the president's personality and his or her leadership style.\"", "source": {"uri": "bssnews.net", "dataType": "news", "title": "Bangladesh Sangbad Sangstha (BSS)"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marco_Rubio", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Marco Rubio"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Senate", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "United States Senate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republican_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Republican Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Milwaukee", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Milwaukee"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Milwaukee"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fox_News", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Fox News"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doug_Burgum", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Doug Burgum"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/J._D._Vance", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "J.

Marco Rubio's remarks at a Doral Trump rally.\n\nThe former President thinks one complication could be the 12th Amendment to the U.S. Constitution, which blocks electors from voting for a President and Vice President from the same state, a rule that Trump says presents wrinkles.\n\n\"You do that and it makes it more complicated. There are other people that don't have that complication,\" Trump told Brian Kilmeade on Fox News Radio.\n\n\"Now, it's fairly easily fixed, but you have to do something with delegates or there has to be a resignation, you know, et cetera, et cetera. So it's not like picking some people where it's very easy, where there is none of that.\"\n\nTrump noted that the 12th Amendment means that if his ticket wants Florida votes in the Electoral College, \"two people (from the state) can't be running on the same ticket.\"\n\n\"They take delegates and taking delegates is, you know, a very risky thing to do, right?\"\n\nAt least in theory, Rubio could resign from his Senate seat and move somewhere else. But Trump didn't float that in Wednesday's interview.\n\nBeyond that logistical concern, Trump lauded Rubio's performance in Doral.\n\n\"Well, he's very good and we have some great people that we're looking at. We have, as they say, a deep bench, but Marco was great last night. Very popular. And he's certainly one of the people that we're looking at, you know, over the next week or so.\"\n\nTrump still has a few days to mull over his decision, saying he'd \"love to do it\" during the Republican National Convention, but adding that in any case, the announcement will come \"pretty soon.\"\n\nRubio's performance seems to have inspired investor confidence. His \"yes\" shares are priced on prediction market aggregator Polymarket at 16 cents at this writing, making him competitive with J.D. Vance (18 cents). But the most popular \"yes\" share is \"Other Man\" at 43 cents, which would encompass options like North Dakota Gov. Doug Burgum and his counterpart from Virginia, Glenn Youngkin.\n\nIn roughly nine minutes of remarks Tuesday in Doral, the South Florida-based Senator seemed cognizant of being in the final stage of auditioning to be Trump's running mate, or perhaps for another important role in the White House. He hewed closely to Trump's talking points and offered some humor all his own as he spoke of being Trump's surrogate in the spin room after last month's debate between Trump and President Joe Biden.\n\nAlthough the rousing speech did not lead to a firm commitment from Trump to make Rubio his running mate, Rubio supporters still have reason for optimism based on the former President's own performance in Doral.\n\nTrump offered what could be considered a tease of a potential Rubio pick to a mixed reaction from the Senator's hometown crowd, pointing out the media covering the rally.\n\n\"I think they probably think I'm going to be announcing that Marco's going to be Vice President because that's a lot of press. That's a lot of press,\" Trump said.\n\nTrump offered another aside to Rubio when discussing his \"no taxes for tips\" proposal, saying, \"Marco, you're going to vote for it, I hope.\" Trump added that Rubio \"may or may not be there to vote for it\" but promised the Florida Senator would be \"involved.\"", "source": {"uri": "floridapolitics.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Florida Politics - Campaigns & Elections.

Some Democrats have started calling for Biden to step down as their presumptive nominee following his dismal debate performance last month.\n\nBoth Biden, 81, and Trump, 78, are at least two decades older than most American presidents have been, according to the Pew Research Center, which said the median age for all US presidents on their first inauguration is 55 years old. But that has not stopped Trump from arguing he is stronger than Biden, who repeatedly stumbled, paused and could not complete sentences at times during the June 27 debate. Trump was criticised by Democrats for making false statements during the debate about the January 6, 2021, riot at the US Capitol and suggesting immigrants entering the US illegally were taking so-called \u201cBlack jobs\u201d and \u201cHispanic jobs.\u201d\n\nJust a few weeks ago, this was projected to be one of the worst periods of the campaign for Trump. He had been scheduled to face sentencing by a New York judge on Thursday for his conviction in a hush-money case. But a favourable US Supreme Court ruling on presidential immunity delayed that court reckoning, and much of his other legal problems, pushing chatter about coming trials and possible prison time off many voters\u2019 radars.\n\nInstead, it\u2019s Biden who continues to face an onslaught of negative coverage stemming from stumbles during the presidential debate.\n\nIn an interview Monday with Fox News Channel\u2019s Sean Hannity, Trump said he thought Biden \u201cmight very well stay in\u201d the race. \u201cNobody to wants to give that up that way,\u201d Trump added. \u201cHe is going to feel badly about himself for a long time. It\u2019s hard to give it up that way, the way where they\u2019re trying to force him out.\u201d\n\nIn the Miami suburb of Doral, Trump will underscore his strong support in a former battleground state that has now shifted toward the Republican Party. US Senator Marco Rubio, a Miami native and one of the contenders for the vice presidential post, will be attending the rally along with other Florida politicians.\n\nKevin Cabrera, a Miami-Dade County commissioner who was Florida state director for Trump\u2019s 2020 re-election campaign and is set to speak at the rally, said to expect an \u201coverwhelming show of unity.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe rally will display our unified front, showcasing a stark contrast to the Democrats, who are lost and fighting with each other over Biden\u2019s health and ability to continue,\u201d Cabrera said.\n\nThe presumptive Republican Party nominee will also touch on Biden\u2019s handling of immigration and the economy, highlighting the rise in home prices and goods. Trump will also talk about how Florida is affected by the increasing arrivals of immigrants as the final destination for many people illegally crossing the US-Mexico border.\n\nThe leadership crisis among Democrats has perhaps given Trump a reason to wait for his VP announcement to not draw attention away from Biden\u2019s woes. Senior advisers and key allies say they still don\u2019t know whom Trump will choose as his running mate, and many believe the choice is still in flux.\n\nSpeaking on MSNBC Monday, Biden criticised Trump for not having held events since the debate and suggested he had been \u201criding around in his golf cart.\u201d\n\nAdditional reporting by Bloomberg", "source": {"uri": "scmp.com", "dataType":

Justin Lane-Pool/Getty Images\n\nFormer President Donald Trump is down to a few finalists in his search for a vice presidential running mate for 2024. But once upon a time, most of these shortlisters opposed Trump -- and weren't shy about it.\n\nThe Washington Post on Tuesday profiled just a few of the things said about him by his running mate contenders before he took office for his term.\n\nSen. J.D. Vance (R-OH), for instance, once said in an interview: \"There is definitely an element of Donald Trump's support that has its basis in racism or xenophobia.\"\n\nThe comment came during the 2016 campaign, and at one point Vance even said he sometimes feared Trump could be \"America's Hitler.\"\n\nSen. Marco Rubio (R-FL), who ran against Trump unsuccessfully in the 2016 presidential primary, blasted him as a \"con artist\" and said: \"He would be the oldest president ever elected. And it's like an eight-year term, so you start to worry\" -- notable as Trump is now eight years older.\n\nRead also: 'Trump's got his quirks': Trump VP hopeful may lose out due to facial hair\n\nMeanwhile, Gov. Doug Burgum (R-ND), who briefly challenged Trump in this year's primary, said Trump wouldn't make a very good business partner and that \"it's important that you're judged by the company you keep.\"\n\nTrump's ideological and at times even spiritual capture of the Republican Party has been the subject of many analyses. Evangelical voters, for example, completely reversed their polling position on whether it was important for a president to be moral when Trump took over the GOP, and now some of them practically worship him.\n\nThe Trump campaign has acknowledged the about-face of these candidates, the Post noted, but has shrugged it off. Spokesperson Jason Miller compared them \"to a heated moment between President Biden and Vice President Harris, when they were both vying for the Democratic nomination in 2020. In the second debate, Harris pointed out that Biden had spoken fondly of his relationships with segregationist senators and opposed aspects of mandatory busing to end school desegregation\" -- even though, the report noted, Harris qualified that criticism from the start by saying she didn't believe Biden was racist.", "source": {"uri": "rawstory.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Raw Story"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marco_Rubio", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Marco Rubio"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vice_President_of_the_United_States", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Vice President of the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Running_mate", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Running mate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_(state)", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "New York (state)"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/J._D._Vance", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "J.

Biden needs that from Democrats.", "body": "The dueling campaign emails that landed in my inbox back to back Monday afternoon captured the whipsaw essence of this ridiculous race.\n\n\"Joe Biden is dropping out of the race!\" the email from former President Donald Trump's campaign declared. \"You know it. I know it. Everybody knows it. It can happen at any moment.\"\n\nPresident Joe Biden's campaign offered this counter-declaration from him in an email nine minutes later:\n\n\"Let me be clear: I'm running. I'm the Democratic Party's nominee. No one is pushing me out. I'm not leaving.\"\n\nBoth asked for donations that they said they need to beat the other guy. But Biden is also asking for something else from his supporters - the kind of pass Republicans give Trump and his troubled bid for a second term.\n\nThat's a tall order. I'm not so sure Biden catches that kind of a break from Democrats seriously freaked out by his disastrous debate performance, followed by days of limited, scripted appearances and then a 22-minute ABC News interview that did nothing to reset his campaign.\n\nThere's a reason for that, which probably seems unfair to many Democrats hoping Biden stays in the race. The Democratic Party these days holds its candidates far more accountable than the Republican Party does. Sorry, but politics has never been an endeavor rooted in a foundation of fair play.\n\nYou know who can change that approach to candidates? Democrats.\n\nBiden fails in critical moment: Biden's attempt to save his campaign and presidency was too underwhelming for the moment\n\nThey're the only people with the power to give Biden the sort of pass that Republicans give Trump, an immensely popular candidate who in the past year has become a convicted felon, was held liable in a civil case for sexual assault and faces fines of $454 million for running a business rife with fraud.\n\nBut here's the catch: A crucial Democratic argument for giving Biden a second term plays into the understandable trepidation that a second Trump term invokes. Biden has been previously cast as competent and stable, the opposite of Trump's autocratic irascibility.\n\nBut if Democrats treat Biden the way Republicans treat Trump, looking past the president's very evident physical and mental issues, then drawing distinctions between the two candidates goes all fuzzy.\n\nThere's nothing new about this. Former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton tried to keep quiet about the pneumonia she was suffering from in September 2016 while battling Trump for the White House. That went sideways when she was spotted nearly collapsing in public.\n\nClinton took all kinds of heat as Trump reveled in her brief medical crisis, claiming she lacked the stamina to be president and required \"naps\" on the campaign trail. His supporters ate that up.\n\nDid they care eight years later when Trump had a hard time keeping his eyes open through his own criminal trial? They did not.\n\nThe closest Trump ever came to accountability was in October 2016, when the infamous Access Hollywood videotape leaked and voters heard the would-be president boasting about getting away with groping women. Some Republicans briefly suggested that Trump should drop his bid for the presidency. He flatly refused.\n\nSound familiar?\n\nAnd why? Because Trump had already - correctly - claimed that there was a significant portion of the Republican Party that would never dare to hold him accountable for anything.\n\nSCOTUS immunity ruling helps Biden: The Supreme Court just did Biden a huge favor by giving Trump immunity\n\nConsider one of Trump's most memorable boasts in the 2016 election: \"I could stand in the middle of Fifth Avenue and shoot somebody, and I wouldn't lose any voters,\" Trump told supporters in Iowa that January.\n\nTrump isn't just forgiven for demolishing norms and standards in American politics. A big chunk of his supporters celebrate it. This very vocal minority of Americans revel in Trump's distaste for civility and disregard for anyone in pursuit of his ambition.\n\nTrump showed up for the first debate in 2020 - in the middle of A pandemic - after a positive COVID-19 test but didn't share that publicly.\n\nWhile hospitalized for COVID-19 treatment, Trump forced Secret Service agents to pile into the presidential limousine so they could drive around the block, letting him wave to assembled supporters.\n\nOpinion alerts: Get columns from your favorite columnists + expert analysis on top issues, delivered straight to your device through the USA TODAY app. Don't have the app? Download it for free from your app store.\n\nOn Jan. 6, 2021, Trump sat sullenly in the White House, watching his supporters attack police officers during the riot at the U.S. Capitol. He spent hours shrugging off pleas from allies to intervene and stem the chaos.\n\nAsk Trump supporters about all that, and they'll flip the accountability on anyone but Trump. They'll pivot to complain about efforts to contain the coronavirus and suggest the Capitol riot was some sort of setup.\n\nAnd Democrats? Members of the U.S. House and Senate spent this week arguing in private and staking out positions in public. They all want to defeat Trump. Not all of them think Biden is up to that.\n\nBiden has rejected calls to step aside, and Vice President Kamala Harris has shown no inkling - or political leverage - to push him off the ticket. The Democrats don't want a convention fight in Chicago next month, so they're stuck with Biden unless he upstages his debate debacle with another public calamity.\n\nBiden has nearly 40 days until the Democratic Party makes the presidential nomination official and nearly four months until November's election. In a normal election year, that would look like plenty of time to right the ship.\n\nNothing about this election year is normal. The presumptive Republican nominee is a criminal campaigning on a promise of \"retribution.\" The presumptive Democratic nominee is an incumbent fighting some in his own party for political survival.\n\nNow we wait to see if Democrats can move like Republicans here. If Biden makes it to the convention and then to November's ballot, Democrats might have to load the gun, take him to Fifth Avenue, choose a target and hope his aim is true.\n\nFollow USA TODAY

Vance of Ohio and Marco Rubio of Florida, as well as North Dakota Governor Doug Burgum, who initially ran against Trump for the nomination before falling in line.\n\nThe calculus might yet change, as Trump told Fox News on Monday that he was weighing a \"great bench\" of prospects and had not made a decision.\n\n\"It's going to be a great vice president, meaning a person that can do a fantastic job as president, because you always have to think of that first,\" he said.\n\n\"And then, second, somebody that helps you get elected. And there's nothing wrong with that.\"\n\nEver the consummate showman, Trump has been ramping up the intrigue, sending out a \"long list\" of contenders early on and offering conflicting accounts of how far along he was in the selection process.\n\nThere was speculation that he might use his first public appearance in 11 days to announce Rubio as he addressed supporters at his Doral golf club, on the outskirts of Miami.\n\nHe namechecked the senator, who was in the front row, several times but was silent on his thinking for the veepstakes.\n\n- Casting call -\n\nTrump could have dropped his big reveal at any point in the days before Milwaukee, except that the news would have interrupted arguably one of the worst weeks in the career of his 81-year-old rival Joe Biden.\n\nThe veteran Democrat is facing calls to drop out of the race after a widely-panned debate performance against Trump raised questions about the mental capacity of America's oldest-ever president.\n\n\"The big danger right now is because all the attention is focused on Biden, that if you announce anything, it will get lost,\" Republican strategist Rob Burgess, who worked on the Trump 2016 and 2020 campaigns, told AFP.\n\nOne of the biggest factors for Trump will be his running mate's fund-raising prowess, and the contenders have all been under pressure to showcase their connections with wealthy mega-donors.\n\nMeanwhile, the campaign has ensured that they are booked regularly for cable news interviews -- a kind of casting call that allows Trump to assess how they look in front of the cameras, a priority for the former reality TV star.\n\nTrump said before the June 27 debate that he already knew who his running mate would be, noting that his pick would likely be attending that night.\n\nThe three frontrunners were all bused to the CNN studio in Atlanta along with some less-favored hopefuls to watch from a volleyball court before being sent in to pitch for Trump on the press line.\n\n- Big role? -\n\nPolitical analyst Donald Nieman said he expected Vance to get the nod as an articulate messenger for Trumpism who is seen as a draw for working class white men in the crucial swing states of Pennsylvania, Michigan and Wisconsin.\n\nBut he added that a less \"thin-skinned\" Trump might have been persuaded to go with Nikki Haley, a one-time UN ambassador who was his last-standing rival in the nominating contest.\n\n\"She would bring Republican defectors and suburban women to Trump -- something he needs,\" Nieman, a history professor at Binghamton University in New York state, told AFP.\n\n\"But he won't because she hasn't signaled abject loyalty and a willingness to submerge her own identity.\"\n\nHaley, who says she is supporting Trump, has not been invited to the convention, according to Politico.\n\nIt remains to be seen in any case whether the successful candidate has what it takes to succeed where Mike Pence failed, and use the job as a springboard to the presidency.\n\n\"I'm not at all convinced that whoever Trump's vice president is, that he or she will have as significant a role as many of their predecessors,\" said constitutional expert Joel Goldstein, of Saint Louis University in Missouri.\n\n\"Although the vice president's role has grown, ultimately it depends upon the president's personality and his or her leadership style.\"\n\nft/des\n\nMore from this section\n\nInformative Research Adds Brandon Hall as New EVP of Operations\n\nUnited Filmmakers Announces an Exciting Financing Opportunity for Independent Filmmakers\n\nProNotary Announces Exciting New Partner Program", "source": {"uri": "kulr8.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "KULR-8 Local News"}, "authors": [{"uri": "frankie_taggart@kulr8.com", "name": "Frankie Taggart", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marco_Rubio", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Marco Rubio"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republican_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Republican Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Florida", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Florida"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Florida"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vice_President_of_the_United_States", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Vice President of the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Senate", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "United States Senate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Milwaukee", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Milwaukee"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Milwaukee"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fox_News", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Fox News"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doug_Burgum", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Doug Burgum"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/J._D._Vance", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "J.

Marco Rubio reportedly on Trump's shortlist, and planning to attend, the Miami rally in primetime could present an opportunity for an announcement:\n\nThe primetime scheduling and location would seem to provide an ideal opportunity to unveil his pick if it is Florida Sen. Marco Rubio, a Miami native who is one of his top contenders.\n\nRubio will be in attendance at the event, according to an adviser familiar with the senator's plans, who, like others, spoke on condition of anonymity about the selection process.\n\nWhat seems more likely, however, would be an announcement at the very start or even during the Republican National Convention around July 15. However, with Trump being Trump, he'll announce when he thinks the return on publicity will be the highest and most impactful.\n\nWatch the rally tonight with Trump speaking at 7 pm ET.

He hewed closely to Trump's talking points, and offered some humor all his own as he talked about being Trump's surrogate in the spin room after last month's debate between Trump and President Joe Biden.\n\nThe rousing speech did not lead to anything like a firm commitment from Trump to make Rubio his running mate, but there's still reason for optimism for Rubio supporters.\n\nTrump offered two asides to \"Marco\" when disparaging Vice President Kamala Harris as an \"insurance policy\" early in his remarks, as he ruminated on \"which of their candidates is more unfit to be President -- Sleepy Crooked Joe Biden, or Laughing Kamala,\" before moving on to speculate that people in Doral didn't want Harris' \"California socialism.\"\n\nTrump then offered what could be considered a tease of a potential Rubio pick to a mixed reaction from the Senator's hometown crowd, pointing out the media covering the rally.\n\n\"I think they probably think I'm gonna be announcing that Marco's gonna be Vice President because that's a lot of press. That's a lot of press,\" Trump said.\n\nTrump offered yet another aside to Rubio when discussing his \"no taxes for tips\" proposal, saying \"Marco, you're going to vote for it, I hope\" before adding that he \"may or may not be there to vote for it,\" but promising the Florida Senator would be \"involved.\"\n\nTrump also recounted a potentially apocryphal conversation with former Sen. Ted Kennedy, saying that the Massachusetts Democrat told him who the \"smartest\" person in the Senate was, then adding \"you weren't there yet, Marco.\"\n\n(The dumbest person, according to the anecdote, was Biden).\n\nTrump also recognized \"Florida Patriots,\" including the \"fantastic\" Rubio and Sen. Rick Scott and the members of Congress on hand, as well as state legislators who backed him.\n\nTrump also offered asides to Rep. Byron Donalds, a surrogate who had been said to be in the VP mix. The former President said that bacon was \"too expensive,\" but that the Southwest Florida Congressman \"likes bacon\" despite the price point.\n\nHe then delivered a second aside to Donalds while talking about Biden's wealth. Then a third, saying Donalds was \"not a man (he was) going to get in a fight with anytime soon.\"\n\nMeanwhile, during his remarks, Rubio suggested that if he led one of America's rivals, Biden's performance during the debate was so poor he would invade the country.\n\n\"Not only like they're watching this thing in Beijing, they're watching it in Moscow, they're watching it in Havana. They're watching it in Caracas. They're watching it in Iran. And they're saying that guy's the president, that guy,\" Rubio said. \"We're gonna invade tomorrow. That's what I would do.\"\n\nRubio also suggested that Biden was \"a figurehead for a shadow government of leftists that are propping him up,\" arguing the \"the people in the shadow government that are protecting and hiding from the American people the condition of our current President.\"\n\nAdditionally, the Senator had sharp words for Vice President Kamala Harris.\n\n\"Biden is the figurehead of a left wing government, shadow government, but his replacement is actually a real life verified left winger,\" Rubio argued, contending Harris wanted to \"ban plastic straws\" to back up his argument.\n\nMeanwhile, Rubio did get support from a Senate colleague ahead of Trump's speech.\n\nScott told the crowd Tuesday that Rubio would be a \"great Vice Presidential pick\" and was doing an \"unbelievable job\" in the Senate.", "source": {"uri": "floridapolitics.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Florida Politics - Campaigns & Elections.

But that has not stopped Trump from arguing he is stronger than Biden, who repeatedly stumbled, paused and could not complete sentences at times during the June 27 debate.\n\nTrump was criticized by Democrats for making false statements during the debate about the Jan. 6, 2021, riot at the U.S. Capitol and suggesting immigrants entering the U.S. illegally were taking so-called \"Black jobs\" and \"Hispanic jobs.\"\n\nIn an interview Monday with Fox News Channel's Sean Hannity, Trump said he thought Biden \"might very well stay in\" the race. \"Nobody to wants to give that up that way,\" Trump added. \"He is going to feel badly about himself for a long time. It's hard to give it up that way, the way where they're trying to force him out.\"\n\nIn the Miami suburb of Doral, Trump will underscore his strong support in a former battleground state that has now shifted toward the GOP.

Rubio is the choice there are plenty of donors I'm sure will come along - including Ken Griffin, allegedly,' Trump advisor Corey Lewandowski told DailyMail.com.\n\n'I don't know if that's true. But that's what they say. If Marco's on the ticket, maybe Ken comes off the sidelines,' he said.\n\nGriffin is one of the most successful hedge funders ever, and his Citadel Capital is packed with holdings of 'Magnificent Seven' stocks like \\Nvidia and Amazon, putting his net worth north at $37 billion.\n\nBack in 2022, Griffin called for the party to 'move on' from Trump, a 'three-time loser.'\n\nFlorida Sen. Marco Rubio is on the list of possible Donald Trump running mates. He has a network of Florida backers who could help Trump's TV air war against Joe Biden and the Democrats\n\nIn May he linked his potential support for Trump to his running mate selection. 'I'm going to wait to see who he picks as his VP candidate,' he told Bloomberg.\n\nBut he hasn't ruled out getting behind him, as the Trump camp makes outreach to former South Carolina Gov. Nikki Haley and tries to unify the party following President Joe Biden's debate stumble. Griffin also appeared at a fundraiser with Sen. Tim Scott, another VP contender.\n\nA source told DailyMail.com that 'nothing has changed since Ken last made public comments on this in mid-May' - an indication he isn't going to give up his leverage.\n\nRubio and his wife Jeanette Christina Dousdebes Rubio were set to attend Trump's rally in Doral, Florida Tuesday, in the latest sign of their bond.\n\nThe billionaire's blessing is just one reason Trump might consider naming Rubio, a telegenic lawmaker who knows the Sunday talk show circuit and is steeped in foreign policy issues that could be flashpoints in a vice presidential debate against Kamala Harris.\n\nRubio raised $52 million for his failed 2016 run, but outside groups kicked in another $220 billion, according to the Center for Responsive Politics.\n\nRubio, 53, is decades younger than Trump, 78, and could reassure parts of the establishment through his support of Ukraine and more traditional views on U.S. alliances.\n\nTrump ridiculed Rubio mercilessly during the 2016 campaign, and Rubio eventually fired back\n\nCitidel CEO billionaire Ken Griffin has been staying on the sidelines but could start writing big checks if Trump picks Rubio\n\nRubio memorably went on the attack against Trump in 2016, calling him a 'con man' and trying to get under his skin by mocking the size of his hands, in a bit of pushback for Trump's 'little Marco' monicker.\n\nHe mockingly said Trump had a 'spray tan' and would 'make American orange,' then asked, 'Have you seen the size of his hands?'\n\nRead More Tim Scott's fianc\u00e9e Mindy Noce opens up on their 'heaven-sent' love story\n\nBut Rubio has become a loyal supporter in the Senate, even while fellow establishment republicans like Sen. Mitt Romney (R-Utah) have condemned him.\n\nHe has more experience than South Carolina Sen. Tim Scott, North Dakota Gov. Doug Burgum, and other contenders when it comes to doing political battle on the airwaves.\n\nHis top competition includes Burgum, whose own estimated $100 million wealth allows him to cut a check to the campaing and gives him access to the donor class, and Sen. J.D. Vance, who has been demonstrating his fundraising chops on the trail.\n\nVance is backed by megadonor Peter Thiel.\n\nAs the remains on the short list with just days to go before the start of the GOP convention, Rubio's chief liability remains a legal one. Like Trump, he resides in the state of Florida, and a provision of the 12th Amendment prevents the president and the vice president from residing in the same state. That could put Florida's electors at risk. The odd language states that one of the candidates 'shall not be an inhabitant of the same state with themselves.'\n\n'I don't have a definitive answer. My guess is if Sen. Rubio is picked and decides to continue to be a resident of Florida, then some legal scholar has already vetted this,' said Lewandowski. But he does know which Florida resident won't be moving if the problem persists.\n\n'I don't think Trump moves for anybody. So if somebody's going to be moving, it's not the president,' he said.\n\nParty leaders solved a similar problem in 2000 when George W. Bush put Dick Cheney on the ticket, by designating Cheney a Wyoming resident.\n\nBut Rubio, 53, might be able to sit tight.\n\n'If I were advising Rubio, I would tell him not to change his residency until after the election,' Bob Jarvis, a constitutional law professor at Nova Southeastern University, told NBC Miami.", "source": {"uri": "dailymail.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "Daily Mail Online"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kenneth_C._Griffin", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Kenneth C.

But Mr. Biden's fumbling performance left Mr. Trump in the aftermath with little choice but to further linger over his decision, according to two people familiar with the former president's thinking. Naming a running mate now would risk stepping on the controversy swirling around his opponent, which has included calls from within the Democratic Party and from liberal news media figures for Mr. Biden to step aside.\n\nThe \"Biden's Wins\" Twitter/X account, which bills itself as \"The largest online community of President Biden's supporters,\" also appears to be trying to goad Trump to come out and play:\n\nDNC strategist Simon Rosenberg also took up the talking point:\n\nTrump is of course not missing and has not gone into hiding. He's been active on his social media platform, Truth Social, since the debate, and on Monday called in to Fox News for an interview with Sean Hannity. And as I write this, he's preparing for a campaign event set to take place at his Doral, Florida golf resort Tuesday night.\n\nWhile the presumptive 2024 GOP presidential nominee has taken a few (mostly) light jabs at Biden's debate performance and the fallout that erupted from it, sources with his campaign have confirmed that their strategy of grabbing the popcorn and watching the Democrats implode has been deliberate:\n\nThe Trump campaign doesn't want to \"get in the way\" of Democrats \"shooting at each other\" over President Biden's re-election chances, with a source telling Fox News Digital that the former president prefers to focus on campaigning and the upcoming Republican National Convention instead of on his rival's implosion.\n\nOther than challenging Biden to a second debate - one that he proposes occur without any moderators - former President Trump has been measured in his attacks on Biden. When asked about the strategy, a Trump campaign source said Trump is, instead, focused on his campaign and winning.\n\n\"Democrats are in disarray,\" the Trump campaign source told Fox News Digital. \"Why get in the way of them shooting at each other?\"\n\nI've got to admit, I didn't see it coming, but it's been pretty impressive so far.

Two well-known figures - Joe Biden, representing the Democratic Party, and Donald Trump, representing the Republican Party - will face each other in this crucial election. Interestingly, Biden is 81 years old, while Trump is 78. Beyond the typical campaign rhetoric from both sides, the two candidates also face personal challenges.\n\nDemocrats appear more concerned than Republicans about their candidate Joe Biden's age. His recent performance during the nationally televised 90-minute presidential debate drew mixed reviews. Some observers noted instances where Biden struggled to complete sentences and pointed to a moment where he mistakenly said he \"beat Medicare,\" the US government healthcare program for senior citizens. Biden may have intended to say he \"beat Covid-19\". This is not the first time Biden's mental acuity has been publicly questioned. Last month, at the G7 summit in Italy, he briefly walked away from the designated area while other leaders were gathering for a photo session. These incidents have been widely circulated on social media, with some questioning Biden's fitness to serve another term.\n\nSome analysts speculate that concerns about Biden's age and cognitive abilities could lead some independent voters to reconsider supporting the Democratic Party. This, they argue, could potentially impact the Democratic Party's vote share in the upcoming election and make it easier for Trump to win a second term.\n\nA recent CBS News/YouGov poll (conducted in June) found that 72 per cent of Americans believe that Biden lacks the mental and cognitive health to serve as president. This figure was 7 percentage points lower than a similar poll conducted by the same organisations just three weeks earlier, on June 9. Following the first national presidential debate, a USA Today/Suffolk University poll conducted in late June showed Trump leading Biden by 41 per cent to 38 per cent. This marked a noteworthy shift from a statistical tie of 37 per cent to 37 per cent recorded by the same poll in May.\n\nSome prominent Democrats are calling for Biden to step aside and allow a new generation to lead the party. However, the Democratic Party will officially select its candidate at its convention, scheduled for August 19-22, 2024, in Chicago. Even if Democrats nominate a younger candidate, challenging Trump would be an uphill battle.\n\nMeanwhile, Donald Trump is seeking another term despite facing legal challenges. In June, Trump became the first former US president to be convicted of felony crimes. New York Judge Juan Merchan oversaw the case. Trump appealed the verdict to the Supreme Court of the United States (SCOTUS), which is the nation's highest court. On Monday, the highest court affirmed broad criminal immunity for presidents regarding their official acts. Following the SCOTUS ruling, Trump's legal team requested that Judge Merchan postpone the sentencing, originally scheduled for July 11. The judge granted the request, delaying sentencing until at least September.\n\nThe Republican Party National Convention is scheduled for July 15-18, 2024. Trump is likely to be formally nominated as the Republican Party's presidential candidate during the convention. However, even if he secures the nomination, the fate of his election could hinge on the September sentencing in his criminal case.\n\nThe US presidential race is being closely watched not only by Americans but also by experts worldwide, who are analysing its potential global impact. Foreign policy always features prominently in US presidential campaigns, and Biden and Trump offer starkly different approaches to global issues and foreign relations.\n\nIn the wake of the October 7, 2023, attacks on Israel, the Biden administration stood firmly with Israel against Hamas, providing weapons and military support. However, while Biden continues to back Israel, he has also urged the nation to \"get it over with,\" arguing that its image is suffering. However, some polls suggest that a majority of Jewish Israelis believe Trump would be more favourable to Israel than Biden, expressing disappointment with Biden's handling of the conflict.\n\nUS support in the form of financial aid and weapons has been crucial to Ukraine's ability to withstand the Russian invasion. Trump, during his election campaign, claimed that he could end the war in a day if elected. A recent report revealed that Trump has a peace deal that would allow Putin to retain control over Crimea and parts of the Donbas region, potentially pressuring Ukraine to accept the deal by threatening to withhold further US military assistance.\n\nThis election, foreign policy extends far beyond Ukraine, Israel, and Gaza, encompassing crucial relationships with Moscow, Beijing, and New Delhi. Both Biden and Trump view China's rise as a potential threat to US interests, particularly as China is projected to become the world's largest economy within the coming decade. Both candidates have expressed concerns about China's growing global influence and agree on the need to take a \"tough\" stance. While their specific approaches may differ in some areas, both have indicated a willingness to use economic measures, including raising tariffs on Chinese goods, to counter China's economic practices.\n\nThe US views India as a crucial geopolitical counterbalance to China in the Indo-Pacific region, especially as India is poised to become the world's third-largest economy. Prime Minister Modi's recent re-election for a third term is significant in this context. From an Indian perspective, relations with the US are likely to remain consistent regardless of who wins the upcoming election.\n\nModi has already established a working relationship with Biden over the past four years, which would likely continue if Biden is re-elected. Similarly, Modi worked closely with Trump during his presidency from 2016 to 2020, with Trump even visiting Gujarat and praising Modi for his cooperation with the US. Some experts believe that Trump, by nature a businessman, might prioritise transactional diplomacy, focusing on securing what he perceives as the best deal in all situations, over traditional diplomatic approaches.", "source": {"uri": "news18.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "News18"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Biden", "type": "person",

It was a fundraising pitch signed by Biden and sent out by his presidential campaign, presumably to people who might vote for Democrats in November. In this letter Biden laid out his case to voters for supporting his re-election bid. In paragraph after paragraph over the course of two pages, he sounded the alarms about former President Donald Trump. He warned of Trump's campaign of revenge. He detailed the threats that Trump poses to democracy and the rights and social services that Americans currently enjoy. He called for help in debunking \"MAGA lies.\"\n\nBiden's case against Trump was sound. But something was missing: Joe Biden's case for himself. He allocated just one sentence at the bottom of the first page to discussing his legislative accomplishments. As for his future aims, buried on the second page were three bullet points explaining a handful of things he planned to do if he wins a second term: ban assault weapons; cap insulin costs; and increase taxes on billionaires. The rest of the note returned to talking about the fight against Trump and the importance of mobilizing for November.\n\nBiden's fundraising letter typifies a broader trend. His campaign relentlessly issues warnings about Trump -- and there is much to warn about -- but it's thin on what he would do with his own time in office. His inaugural re-election campaign video opened with footage of Jan. 6 and focused overwhelmingly on the menace of Trumpism. His campaign's leading social media account on X is laser focused on dunking on Trump or talking about how dangerous he is. A central theme of his and Vice President Kamala Harris' public commentary is protecting abortion rights from further erosion under Trump. Even though Biden announced his re-election bid over a year ago, up until a few weeks ago, his campaign website didn't even have a policy section (unlike Trump's). The site's headline argument was the need to support Biden \"to keep Trump out of the Oval Office.\" In recent weeks, Biden's website has added an \"issues\" section, but it remains anemic. (More on that later.)\n\nAgain, preventing another Trump presidency is an essential part of the case for Biden's re-election. But framing the case almost purely in those terms neglects an essential task of any political candidate: clearly communicating an agenda and building a mandate for that agenda. What should Americans expect -- and get excited about -- when casting their ballot for Biden other than \"this guy is not Trump\"?\n\nBanking on dread of Trump isn't working as an election strategy. The president has trailed Trump in national polls and in polls of swing states since last year, after Trump promised to be \"dictator for a day,\" after his Hitlerian rhetoric about immigrants and even after he was convicted of 34 felony counts. Polling indicates that for less politically engaged voters, who outnumber highly engaged voters and who lean toward Trump, economic concerns outweigh concerns about democracy.\n\nSince the 2020 Democratic primaries, Biden's central value proposition has been that he serves as the most practical bulwark against Trump and an American slide toward autocracy. But the president's evidence for that premise has become far less clear since he has taken a huge hit in his approval ratings over the course of his tenure. And even before his disastrous debate performance, a majority of voters felt he was too old for the office. If Biden is not a reliable defender against Trump, then what exactly is it that will get voters to see the point of sticking with him?\n\nThis is all the more frustrating because Biden has many accomplishments as president to be proud of and which should, theoretically, shape the public's understanding of him. His first term was surprisingly productive given the narrowness of Democrats' congressional majorities. His aggressive intervention in the economy with the American Rescue Plan was bold and successful, and he passed major bills securing, among other things, badly needed infrastructure, advanced manufacturing jobs at home, major clean energy investment, and lower prescription drug prices for seniors.\n\nBut voters have famously short memories. Polling shows that huge swaths of Americans are unaware of Biden's signature policy achievements, and some even credit Trump for passing Biden's infrastructure policy. A New York Times / Siena College poll taken earlier this year showed that more than twice as many voters think Trump's policies helped them personally compared with Biden's. Dispiriting as this may be, it means that Biden cannot rest on his laurels -- he needs to set up more big swings and give people positive reasons to vote for him that speaks to their current concerns.\n\nWhile Biden's execution of his agenda was remarkable, a lot of his motivation to take it on in the first place was due to circumstances that don't exist anymore. Biden's 2020 policy vision was beefed up by that year's primaries, which generated Democrats' most progressive policy debate in decades. Biden presented himself as among the most centrist of the candidates in the race, but after the primaries he adopted more progressive policies in a coordinated show of party unity with former rival Sen. Bernie Sanders. This year the primaries were mostly a formality and Biden was not challenged to show policy ambition. Additionally, Biden took office during the pandemic, and his advisers counseled him to spend aggressively to avoid the mistakes of former President Barack Obama's response to the 2008 financial crisis. He not only had a political imperative to go after big policies, but an economic one -- neither of which he had coming into this campaign.\n\nBiden will from time to time discuss policies he favors, but they generally take the form of vague and technocratic incrementalism, rather than a discernible and coherent vision. Americans can intuit that there are threats to their freedom beyond Trump, embedded in the way our political and economic systems operate. Given how badly inflation battered how ordinary Americans experienced and perceived the economy during his term, it is political malpractice not to propose headline-generating and coalition-building policies that will help Americans' feel optimistic about the economy. What happened to Biden's support for a public option, which has the potential to set in motion a revolution in reforming our barbaric and exorbitant health care system? Better yet, why not shoot straight for Medicare for All? What about aggressively lobbying for a higher minimum wage? What universal policy ideas does Biden have on issues like the cost of housing and higher education that can speak to the electorate's desire for sweeping change? If Biden wants to do the right thing, excite progressives and show bold foreign policy vision, he should chart an independent course from Israel and stop subsidizing its brutal military operation in Gaza. What about tapping into widespread disenchantment with an increasingly radical Supreme Court by promising Supreme Court reform?\n\nBiden's struggles in communicating clearly are only exacerbating his agenda problem. At the debate, Biden brought up a great policy -- an enhanced child tax credit -- multiple times. But he spoke in rushed, incomplete sentences and was often barely audible. He did not explain how it works in simple, clear and attractive language. He did not sell this idea as part of a package of exciting proposals tied to economic freedom, but instead jammed it into a rushed list of policies that are hard for nonpolicy wonks to follow as he scrambled to play defense against Trump.\n\nOne can't help but feel that the Biden campaign is sleepwalking. Just as Biden is out of touch with voters' widespread doubts about his ability to serve another term, he is also out of touch with how to renew their faith in him as someone who can deliver a better future. A future worth organizing for, funding and mobilizing to make into a reality. If Biden does not step aside -- and he's adamant that he won't -- then becoming assertive and ambitious on policy is maybe the only thing he can do to re-engage with a public that's dangerously cool on him. It may not be enough to save him. But Americans deserve a better campaign than, \"Hey, at least I'm not a fascist.\"", "source": {"uri": "msnbc.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "MSNBC.com"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

He said his choice is Sen. J.D. Vance (R-Ohio).\n\n\"If we're talking the VP stakes, what are you guys thinking right now?\" he asked. \"You know, everyone knows, I've sort of been for J.D.

Marco Rubio (R).\n\nTrump Jr. discounted former Housing and Urban Development secretary Ben Carson because he was \"too nice to deal with the sociopaths that we'd be dealing with.\"\n\nThe former president's son said Burgum is a \"smart guy,\" but thinks he would fit better as his father's Energy Secretary.\n\n\"North Dakota. He understands that,\" Trump Jr. said. \"He built a really good business in tech. I think, you know, that's someone that could actually make some money for America, for a change, rather than us just giving all our money away.\"\n\nTrump Jr. also argued that Rubio may not be his father's best choice.\n\n\"I have a good relationship with Marco, but there is some truth about, like, you know, having someone that's a little bit more establishment in there,\" he said, warning of a potential impeachment.\n\n\"And so, there is something about having someone from outside of the establishment to sort of further protect you from that establishment,\" Trump Jr. said.\n\nTrump says he has already made his pick and will announce his running mate at the Republican National Convention, which begins July 15.\n\nOne source close to the campaign said Trump could make the announcement as soon as Wednesday at a rally near Rubio's home city in Florida.\n\nTrump Jr. said he plans to host live shows at the convention, even potentially with the VP pick.\n\n\"I have no inside information, obviously,\" he said. \"If I did, I probably wouldn't tell you anyway.\"\n\nCopyright 2024 Nexstar Media, Inc.

It's a shame the way they're treating him. But don't feel sorry for him. He's a very bad guy.\"\n\nBut James Singer, a spokesperson for Biden's campaign, responded to Trump with a series of challenges, saying in a statement: \"We'd challenge Donald Trump to create jobs, but he lost 3 million.\n\n\"We'd challenge Donald Trump to stand up to Putin, but he bent the knee to him.\n\n\"We'd challenge Donald Trump to follow the law, but he breaks it.\"\n\nTrump was found guilty in May on all counts in an historic New York trial, becoming the first former or sitting president to be convicted of a crime.\n\nHe was unanimously convicted on 34 counts of falsifying business records.\n\nA six-week trial heard from 22 witnesses, including former porn star Stormy Daniels, whose alleged sexual encounter with the former president was at the centre of the case.\n\nThe prospect of Trump being returned to the White House in November's election is a cause for concern in Nato given his past criticisms of the alliance and his threats to reduce aid to Ukraine.\n\nEuropean Nato states face shouldering a greater burden as part of a drive to \"Trump proof\" the alliance should the Republican candidate return to office and weaken US commitment to the 32-nation bloc.", "source": {"uri": "yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Biden", "type": "person", "score": 5,

Will she be pretty, will he be a Democrat, or will Trump clone himself? With a rally scheduled in the Sunshine State today (July 9), some believe it might be a public pronouncement that Sen. Marco Rubio (R-FL) will join the ticket.\n\nThe highly anticipated announcement comes at the most inopportune time: Presumptive Democratic nominee Joe Biden is under attack from friend and foe to step aside after a debate performance that exposed a leader with serious cognitive issues. No political operative would upset that apple cart. However, the nominating convention is just days away, and in light of Trump's grand entrances to his events, he likely wants his plane to have his running mate emblazoned on the fuselage before landing in Milwaukee for the convention. That would give the decal guys a few days to work on the aircraft currently sequestered from public view.\n\nSay what you will, but Trump is a brand. But there is a sticking point to this GOP ticket: the US Constitution.\n\nHaving Rubio on the ticket presents a problem: The Constitution bars the president and vice president from residing in the same state. Article II, paragraph 3, states: \"The electors ... shall vote for two persons, of whom one at least shall not be an inhabitant of the same state with themselves.\" The 12th Amendment was enacted in 1804 to clarify how the election process now works.\n\nIn the olden days, electors would cast a ballot for two people. The top vote count determined who was president, and the man finishing second was the new vice president. The reasoning behind the provision was sound: force electors out of their political circles and prevent the largest states from creating a monopoly on power.\n\nFor the most part, today's ticket process doesn't fall under the 12th Amendment - but it has happened and was handled easily. It was in 2000, when George W. Bush from Texas picked Dick Cheney, also living in Texas, to be his running mate. Just days before the announcement was made, Cheney changed his residency to his Wyoming home from where he had served in Congress. To be fair, Cheney did have deep ties to Wyoming, where he maintained a ranch. Of course, it was challenged in lawsuits, but at the time, it wasn't something the courts wanted to decide.\n\nIn Trump's case, someone would likely add it to the list of the man's crimes against nature, and his poll numbers would likely go up overnight.\n\n\"It could happen anytime this week,\" senior adviser Jason Miller told Fox News. \"But anyone telling you they know who or when President Trump will choose his VP is lying unless that person is named Donald J. Trump.\"\n\nRubio appeared on the CNN program State of the Union and didn't allow even a hint.\n\n\"Look, I've heard nothing, I know nothing, and you probably know more than I do about it. Donald Trump has a decision to make. He'll make it when he needs to make it. He'll make a good decision. I know for certain that I will be out there over the next three or four months, working on behalf of his campaign in some capacity.\"\n\nTrump is heading to Pennsylvania for an afternoon rally at the Butler Farm Show on Saturday -- a short hop for another possible VP pick, Ohio Sen. JD Vance. It's doubtful anyone will know until Trump pulls off a big reveal in the style of his old TV show, The Apprentice, with millions of viewers watching. It's more his way than a rally environment. But again, it's Trump, and no one really knows what the guy is up to behind the scenes.\n\n\"Well, I have people in mind. I have so many good people. We have such a deep bench,\" Trump told reporters. \"But we'll be making a decision sometime early convention or before convention.\"\n\nNow would be the time to decide if the gold-appointed plane wants that paint job before landing in Milwaukee.", "source": {"uri": "libertynation.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Liberty Nation"}, "authors": [{"uri": "sarah_cowgill@libertynation.com", "name": "Sarah Cowgill", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vice_President_of_the_United_States", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Vice President of the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Democratic Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constitution_of_the_United_States", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Constitution of the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marco_Rubio", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Marco Rubio"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twelfth_Amendment_to_the_United_States_Constitution", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Twelfth Amendment to the United States Constitution"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dick_Cheney", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Dick Cheney"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Biden", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Running_mate", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Running mate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Florida", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Florida"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Florida"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Article_Two_of_the_United_States_Constitution", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Article Two of the United States Constitution"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_W._Bush", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "George W.

In this case, that means Florida's electors would not be able to vote for both Rubio and Trump -- who changed his residency to Florida from New York in 2019.\n\nIn May, Fox News host Shannon Bream asked Rubio if he would move out of Florida if he was asked to be Trump's vice president.\n\n\"First of all, the vice presidential choice with Donald Trump is going to be made by one person, and that's Donald Trump, and all this other stuff is just speculation.

Tom Harkin was among those suggesting Biden should release his delegates and step aside ahead of the Democratic National Convention in August.\n\nBut so far, other Democratic leaders in Iowa have stopped short of calling on Biden to end his candidacy.\n\nSenate Minority Leader Pam Jochum, D-Dubuque, endorsed Biden ahead of the 2020 Iowa Democratic caucuses. She said Americans should judge the president on his policies and what he's done in office, rather than by a single debate performance.\n\n\"It really is up to Joe Biden. The ball is in his court to make that final decision,\" Jochum said, adding that the Democratic Party needs to come together and refocus its attention on contrasting Biden's accomplishments with Trump's record.\n\nState Auditor Rob Sand, the only Iowa Democrat in statewide office, did not return a request for comment.\n\nIn a statement, Iowa Democratic Party Chair Rita Hart acknowledged the concerns about Biden's performance but said \"the real threat is from Donald Trump.\"\n\n\"President Biden understands the concerns and is taking the steps to address them,\" she said. \"He's reminding everyone about his three and a half years of accomplishments -- capping the price of insulin at $35, creating 15 million new jobs, and rebuilding our nation's infrastructure. We know how real the threat is from Donald Trump and those behind Project 2025 -- who want to ban abortion, take away freedoms, cut social security and roll back Medicare. We have to win this year and Joe Biden has already defeated Donald Trump once.\"\n\n\"Project 2025\" is a far-reaching effort created by The Heritage Foundation, a right-wing think tank, which provides a 180-day transition plan for Trump's presidency. Among other things, the agenda calls for the repeal of portions of the Affordable Care Act, urges the Food and Drug Administration to reverse the approval of abortion pills, and further empowers Immigration and Customs Enforcement to deport undocumented immigrants.\n\nOn his social media site, Truth Social, Trump has denied knowing anything about Project 2025 and said he has \"nothing to do with them.\"\n\nOther Iowa Democrats who are set to attend the Democratic National Convention in Chicago next month were also supportive of Biden.\n\nState Rep. Adam Zabner, D-Iowa City, is a delegate to the convention and said that while \"the debate was certainly not (Biden's) best moment,\" he is \"running on three and a half years of a really successful presidency.\"\n\n\"I'm the youngest member of the Legislature. I represent the youngest district,\" Zabner said. \"And I think it's pretty clear that we have two old men running for president. I think the difference is that while Donald Trump is focused on his own past, his legal troubles, things like that, Joe Biden is a future-oriented president, and he's been making the largest investment in the history of the world in climate change, making investments in our country's infrastructure, and he's performed really well.\"\n\nTrump has been convicted of 34 felony counts of falsifying business records for paying hush money to a porn star, and he is the first former president to be convicted of a crime. Republicans are set to nominate him for president at their own convention in Milwaukee next week.\n\nMary McAdams, an Ankeny Democrat, will serve as an alternate delegate at the Democratic convention. She said the debate \"wasn't what I expected,\" and she believes Biden \"over-prepared.\"\n\nStill, she says, he has the \"moral compass that I'm seeking.\"\n\n\"I strongly support President Biden,\" she said. \"... I know Biden's heart, and I know who he is, and he's a strong, good leader, and he's got good people around him. And Trump is a felon. He's been (found liable) for sexual assault. And that's not who we want. That's not who I want. That's not who I will support at all.\"\n\nA civil jury in 2023 found Trump liable for sexually abusing and defaming advice columnist E. Jean Carroll. A federal judge denied Trump's request for a new trial earlier this year, and he has been ordered to pay Carroll $83.3 million.\n\nState Rep. Ako Abdul-Samad, D-Des Moines, will also head to the convention as a delegate and previously told the Des Moines Register he doesn't believe Biden should withdraw his candidacy.\n\n\"I don't think it was his best performance, but I still prefer him over the alternative without a doubt,\" he said. \"This is where we're at, and right now, we're in a crisis.\"\n\nUSA TODAY contributed to this report.\n\nBrianne Pfannenstiel is the chief politics reporter for the Des Moines Register.

There was a possibility that he could announce his running mate pick. There were points where it seemed like he could, pointing to Sen. Marco Rubio ((R-FL) multiple times. No such announcement was made, though it's coming soon.\n\nTrump discussed the damage Biden has done to the country, the inane mandates on electric cars, and the total loss of operational control on the southern border, which has devolved into a national security crisis. Trump vowed to find the Islamic terrorists who have escaped capture, along with the rest of the illegal aliens Joe Biden allowed in, and deport them from our shores forever. He also spoke at length about the illegal alien crime that's happening all over our country, thanks to Biden's broken border policies.\n\nThe former president also criticized Biden for his abysmal debate performance but gave him a chance to redeem himself by holding another debate next week. He also challenged Biden to an 18-hole golf game, in which he'd give the president 10 strokes a side and, if he wins, donate $1 million to any charity of Joe's choosing.\n\nTrump then ripped into the current administration for being part of a massive cover-up regarding the declining health of Joe Biden. His nickname for Harris -- \"Laffin' Kamala -- shows he's back on his game. The rally, which soared past an hour, outlined a massive renovation for the country, where law and order will be restored and our cities rebuilt.

Several -- though not all -- polls have shown Trump's edge widening in the aftermath.\n\nA number of Democratic senators have expressed concern about Biden's prospects. Rep. Mikie Sherrill (D-N.J.) on Tuesday became the seventh Democratic House member to call for him to stand aside as the nominee.\n\nNotably, Biden has argued strongly that the party's public agonizing over his future only weakens his chances of defeating Trump in November.\n\nHis letter to his party colleagues in Congress concluded with the message that \"any weakening of resolve or lack of clarity about the task ahead only helps Trump and hurts us. It is time to come together, move forward as a unified party, and defeat Donald Trump.\"\n\nA four-day GOP convention revolving around Trump, blanketed in media coverage, could help Biden underscore that contrast.\n\nIt's not that Democrats expect the Republican National Convention, of all events, to solve Biden's problems. But they do think it could be useful in moving the news agenda on, and in providing some level of scrutiny for Trump's plans.\n\nThe president \"has got to solve his problems and the party has to solve their challenges. They have to come behind him in a very strong way or there are going to be problems going into the election,\" said Devine.\n\nBut he and other Democrats also insist the GOP has its vulnerabilities on a number of issues, including reproductive rights, taxation, health care -- and commitment to democracy itself.\n\nDemocrats have had a political tailwind on abortion since the Supreme Court struck down Roe v. Wade in June 2022.\n\nThe GOP sought to create some leeway for itself on that topic Monday, when the newly-released party platform notably failed to call for a national abortion ban -- the first time in 40 years such a promise has been omitted.\n\nBut Democrats believe there can also reap dividends by counterpunching against Republicans on other issues and by casting the GOP as the party of the rich.\n\nThey also say the presence of the deeply divisive Trump at center stage could help them, reminding voters of everything from the Capitol riot of Jan. 6, 2021, to the former president's May conviction on 34 felony counts of falsifying business records.\n\nRepublicans vigorously contest all of this.\n\nThey point to polling that suggests widespread voter disapproval of Biden's performance, as well as his age. They say voters are crying out for a course correction.\n\nFollowing the release of the party platform Monday, the Trump campaign issued a statement with comments from the former president's top advisers, Chris LaCivita and Susie Wiles.\n\n\"While Joe Biden and Democrats argue about who will be at the top of their ticket and have implemented policies that have raised prices on everyday families, opened the floodgates to migrant crime via wide-open borders, shackled American energy with red tape forced by Washington bureaucrats, and sewn chaos across the world through weak foreign policy, President Trump will Make America Great Again through these America First principles,\" the duo said.\n\nAmong Republicans more broadly, there is contentment -- and perhaps an element of pleasant surprise -- with how Trump has stayed comparatively silent while the Democratic infighting over Biden has played out.\n\nTrump has occasionally hit out at Biden and Vice President Harris. But the former president has by and large been careful not to do anything that takes the focus off the Biden crisis.\n\n\"He has pretty much stood down and let the Democrats beat up on their own nominee,\" said GOP strategist Brad Blakeman. \"And the Democrats have done a great job on that.\"\n\nBlakeman argued that the GOP did not need to further emphasize the questions of Biden's age and acuity at the convention.\n\nInstead, he contended, persuadable members of the electorate have formed their opinions on that score, leaving the field open for Trump and the Republicans to make a more positive case for a second term.\n\n\"The American people know what they heard and know what they saw at the debate,\" Blakeman argued. \"Joe Biden might get a respite, but the convention needs to be about what [Republicans] are going to do for Americans.\"", "source": {"uri": "thehill.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Hill"}, "authors": [{"uri": "niall_stanage@thehill.com", "name": "Niall

Doug Burgum.\n\n\"It would be a great loss of integrity for any of those people if they said 'yes' to both those questions,\" Bolton said.\n\nTrump is expected to name his VP pick next week, with Burgum, 67, and Vance, 39, as the front runners while Rubio, 53, still has an outside chance, sources told The Post on Monday.\n\nHowever, Bolton doesn't believe Trump selected his running mate and is waiting for the Democrats and Joe Biden to decide on the future of the octogenarian president's reelection bid.\n\n\"I think what we have to remember with Trump is, it's never final till it's final and then sometimes it's still not final,\" Bolton remarked.\n\nBolton doesn't think Trump should announce his running mate during next week's Republican National Convention, which is being held in Milwaukee, Wisc. from July 15-18.\n\n\"There's no news that is gonna come out of the Republican National Convention, other than the vice presidential nomination, why waste it in a week when the Democrats may still be talking about whether Joe Biden is competent to be president.\"\n\nCalls for Biden, 81, to drop out have ramped up following his disastrous debate performance against Trump and then several gaffes committed by the President in the days following the political clash.\n\nBolton recalled l how Pence was loyal to Trump, but was also the final voice of reasoning for the 45th president and got him to do the \"right thing even when the rest of failed.\"\n\n\"I don't know whether these three are capable of doing that, honestly,\" Bolton said, making a slight jab at the VP hopefuls.\n\nEarlier in the show, Sen. Michael Bennet (D-Colo.) said he believes Trump could be victorious in the Nov. general election.\n\n\"Donald Trump is on track, I think, to win this election, and maybe win it by a landslide,\" the Colorado senator said during an appearance on CNN.\n\n\"This race is on a trajectory that is very worrisome if you care about the future of this country,\" Bennet said, stopping short of calling on

In this case, that means Florida's electors would not be able to vote for both Rubio and Trump -- who changed his residency to Florida from New York in 2019.\n\nIn May, Fox News host Shannon Bream asked Rubio if he would move out of Florida if he was asked to be Trump's vice president.\n\n\"First of all, the vice presidential choice with Donald Trump is going to be made by one person, and that's Donald Trump, and all this other stuff is just speculation.

The event is also serving as a fundraiser, where $25,000 gets donors a photo with Trump, prime seating, a Trump 47 hat and expedited entry, per a flier obtained by Playbook.\n\nAfter a period of golfing in Bedminster, New Jersey, Trump is returning to his adopted home state amid a winning streak where he's ahead in the polls and able to further delay court cases against him following Supreme Court rulings in his favor. It also comes just weeks after Biden's top campaign official denied Florida was a battleground.\n\nOne of the biggest questions that's left -- one that could whiplash the news cycle back to Trump -- is who he might select as running mate. Veep shortlister Sen. Marco Rubio is set to speak at the Doral rally, and the buzz on the ground is sure to be all about him given that Trump has said he'll announce his choice near or during the Republican National Convention, which starts in Milwaukee next week. Rubio had to cancel a planned speech tonight at the National Conservatism Conference in Washington to be able to attend the Doral rally.\n\nIn an interview with Fox News' Sean Hannity last night, Trump raised the Democratic turmoil in describing how he was thinking about his running mate. \"We wanted to see what they're doing, to be honest, because it might make a difference,\" he said, alluding to how changes in the Democratic ticket might shake up the race. He added that what he was looking for in making his selection was a \"person that can do a fantastic job as president\" and \"somebody that helps you get elected.\"\n\nThough Trump had a rally in Virginia after the debate and has been taking to Truth Social to rant about journalists and taunt Biden to stay in the race, he was otherwise (relatively) quiet in the last week. That's uncharacteristic for the former president, but his allies said it made sense lest he shift the news cycle (and the Biden campaign's attention) away from Democrats' internal turmoil.\n\n\"Everything's just falling apart on the Democratic side ... Why would you want to stop the destruction? Let them self-destruct,\" Miami Commissioner Kevin Cabrera, who was Trump's 2020 Florida director, told Playbook -- despite admitting he very much wanted Trump to pick Rubio and to announce it at the rally tonight.\n\nThe outdoor event is going to be a scorcher. The doors open at 2 p.m. but Trump isn't scheduled to take the stage until 7 p.m. Temperatures are expected to be in the low 90s, though the \"feels like\" weather will be in the triple digits due to the humidity. And -- because it's South Florida in the summer -- there's always the chance of a heavy downpour at any time. The event is free to the public but requires phone verification.\n\n\"Florida is still his home,\" Cabrera, who's expected to speak tonight, said of why he thought Trump picked Doral for his latest stop. \"It's important to the president as he marches toward the convention. It's important you don't forget your home state -- and the Hispanic vote, which is huge. The question is really: Why not?\"\n\nA PEEK AT THE GUEST LIST ... Besides Rubio, other confirmed RSVPs for the Doral rally include Sen. Rick Scott, Rep. Carlos Gim\u00e9nez and Carlos Trujillo, a lobbyist who was ambassador to the Organization of American States under Trump.\n\nOther attendees include state elected officials who supported Trump in the primary over Gov. Ron DeSantis -- those who called themselves \"superheroes\" on a text chain viewed by Playbook. They are state Reps. Randy Fine, Juan Carlos Porras, Alina Garcia and Kevin Steele. Florida Speaker designate Danny Perez, who backed DeSantis in the primary, is also slated to attend.\n\nCOMING UP: Playbook will be on the ground at the Republican National Convention in Milwaukee.

The Financial Impact Estimating Conference ended its second meeting on Monday with two major issues unaddressed and the lingering potential of giving up by simply agreeing to disagree.\"\n\nAMENDMENT 4 -- \"DeSantis, Florida House pay outsiders to influence financial statement on abortion measure,\" reports Ana Gon\u0303i-Lessan of USA Today Network -- Florida. \"State officials are collectively paying anti-abortion advocates hundreds of dollars an hour to represent their interests on an obscure government panel in the battle over November's abortion ballot measure. It's another loud-and-clear move that Gov. Ron DeSantis and Florida House of Representatives leadership are serious about defeating Amendment 4, the constitutional amendment aimed at ensuring abortion access in the state.\"\n\nSETTLEMENT -- \"Groups reach deal in fertilizer waste site cleanup,\" reports POLITICO's Bruce Ritchie. \"Environmental groups have reached an agreement with state officials to settle a federal lawsuit filed in 2021 following polluted discharges from a fertilizer plant waste site along Tampa Bay. The Center for Biological Diversity and other groups on Monday filed the settlement agreement in U.S. District Court in Tampa. The groups agreed to dismiss their lawsuit after the state issues a cleanup permit to Herb Donica, an attorney appointed by the court to oversee the site. The settlement also requires the Florida Department of Environmental Protection to pay the Tampa Bay Estuary Program $75,000 to monitor water quality around the Piney Point waste site.\"\n\n-- \"Duke Energy, Public Counsel say they've settled rate hike dispute,\" reports POLITICO's Bruce Ritchie.\n\nPOLICY SIDE EFFECTS -- \"Florida records drop in doctor residency applicants post-Roe v. Wade,\" reports the Tampa Bay Times' Sam Ogozalek. \"In the two residency application cycles following the U.S. Supreme Court's overturning of Roe v. Wade in 2022, states with near-total abortion bans saw larger year-over-year declines in residency applicants compared to states where the procedure is legal -- and states with gestational limits, such as Florida, saw a greater decrease in applicants compared to legal states during the second cycle but not the first, according to an analysis by researchers at the nonprofit Association of American Medical Colleges.\"\n\nENCOURAGING SIGNS -- \"Last year's heat was deadly for Florida corals. Scientists hope this year will be different,\" by the Miami Herald's Claire Grunewald. \"Last year's historic marine heat wave turned Florida's coral reefs into bleached boneyards. And with temperatures rising this summer, scientists worried 2024 could be a repeat disaster for the fragile underwater ecosystems. But the latest data show that lower-than-expected temperatures and recent storms may give Florida's reefs a fighting chance this summer.\"\n\n-- \"Sex? Grandstanding?

Comas. \"When SunRail trains first started rolling down tracks just over a decade ago, it was agreed the state would pay the bills for several years -- but local governments along the route would eventually pick up the tab. Four counties and three cities -- Osceola, Orange, Seminole, Volusia, Orlando, Winter Park and Maitland -- are now preparing to take over operating and maintaining the 61-mile commuter rail line from the Florida Department of Transportation. And some local officials are experiencing sticker shock as bills come due in January.\"\n\nMEDIA RIGHTS -- \"Leon County judge orders ACC to give Florida State University confidential ESPN agreements,\" reports Liam Rooney of the Tallahassee Democrat. \"The Atlantic Coast Conference has been ordered to give Florida State University's legal team a copy of the highly confidential ESPN agreements as the battle between the conference and the school continues in Leon County. In a July 2 court order by Leon Circuit Judge John C. Cooper, the ACC must hand over a redacted version of the sought-after ESPN agreement to FSU within seven days of the order.\"\n\nCOUNTER PROGRAMMING -- Florida Democrats are holding a press conference this morning about Trump's Doral rally.\n\nBIDEN BACKING? -- Debbie Mucarsel-Powell, the former Democratic member of Congress challenging Sen. Rick Scott this year, did not give a definitive answer Monday on whether Biden should drop his re-election bid following his disastrous debate late last month.\n\nSome Florida Democrats such as Rep. Frederica Wilson have come out strongly in defense of Biden as he forcefully pushes back against any talk of him leaving the race.\n\nFollowing a Tallahassee campaign event to discuss reproductive rights, Mucarsel-Powell said: \"We all saw what we saw on that debate stage. And it really raised concerns for a lot of people. But it's up to the president to make the case for the American people that he can lead in the next four years. And he's doing that currently, and I'm watching as him and his campaign make that case.\"\n\nWhen asked if that was a yes or no, Mucarsel-Powell said: \"I think that we still have four months ... and I'm watching to see what happens. It's really important for us to make sure that we win this election in November because so much is at stake. And a lot of what I've been doing is completely separate from the top of the ticket.\"\n\nScott, who is seeking a second term in the Senate, has been a persistent critic of Biden who has called on him repeatedly to resign. He posted on social media last week that Biden should be removed from office under the terms of the 25th Amendment, which sets out a process that allows for the vice president to succeed the president if the president is unable to perform the duties of the office.\n\n-- Gary Fineout\n\nENDORSEMENT -- The Libertarian Party of Florida just endorsed Amendment 3 to support the legalization of recreational cannabis, saying it affirmed its \"commitment to personal liberty and the right to make decisions free from government interference.\"\n\n\"We are proud to have support from all sides, transcending partisan politics -- all affirming that our campaign to create a safer Florida is universally the best path forward for all Floridians,\" said Morgan Hill, spokesperson for Smart & Safe Florida.\n\n-- \"In Tampa, Jill Biden says Joe Biden's 'all in' to continue his candidacy, so she is too,\" by Mitch Perry of the Florida Phoenix.\n\nMAR-A-LAGO DOCS CASE -- \"Judge declines to throw out charges against Trump valet in classified documents case,\" reports The Associated Press. \"The federal judge presiding over the classified documents case against Donald Trump refused Saturday to throw out charges against a co-defendant of the former president. Lawyers for Walt Nauta, Trump's personal valet, had asked U.S. District Judge Aileen Cannon to dismiss the indictment against their client. They argued, among other things, that Nauta was charged because of insufficient cooperation with prosecutors' investigation and because of a personal animus that they say prosecutors harbored against one of Nauta's attorneys.\"\n\nDEADLINE AHEAD -- \"Florida officials urged not to pass up millions in food assistance again,\" reports the Orlando Sentinel's Jeffrey Schweers. \"While it's too late for Florida to change course in time to affect kids this summer [and accept millions of dollars in new federal food assistance money], 185 groups that seek to end hunger recently sent a letter to Gov. Ron DeSantis and other state leaders urging Florida to apply for the money by the Aug. 15 deadline for 2025.\"\n\n-- \"Ashley Moody agitated over Joe Biden 'weaseling' his way into washing machine regs,\" by Florida Politics A.G.

Tom Harkin was among those suggesting Biden should release his delegates and step aside ahead of the Democratic National Convention in August.\n\nBut so far, other Democratic leaders in Iowa have stopped short of calling on Biden to end his candidacy.\n\nSenate Minority Leader Pam Jochum, D-Dubuque, endorsed Biden ahead of the 2020 Iowa Democratic caucuses. She said Americans should judge the president on his policies and what he's done in office, rather than by a single debate performance.\n\n\"It really is up to Joe Biden. The ball is in his court to make that final decision,\" Jochum said, adding that the Democratic Party needs to come together and refocus its attention on contrasting Biden's accomplishments with Trump's record.\n\nState Auditor Rob Sand, the only Iowa Democrat in statewide office, did not return a request for comment.\n\nIn a statement, Iowa Democratic Party Chair Rita Hart acknowledged the concerns about Biden's performance but said \"the real threat is from Donald Trump.\"\n\n\"President Biden understands the concerns and is taking the steps to address them,\" she said. \"He's reminding everyone about his three and a half years of accomplishments -- capping the price of insulin at $35, creating 15 million new jobs, and rebuilding our nation's infrastructure. We know how real the threat is from Donald Trump and those behind Project 2025 -- who want to ban abortion, take away freedoms, cut social security and roll back Medicare. We have to win this year and Joe Biden has already defeated Donald Trump once.\"\n\n\"Project 2025\" is a far-reaching effort created by The Heritage Foundation, a right-wing think tank, which provides a 180-day transition plan for Trump's presidency. Among other things, the agenda calls for the repeal of portions of the Affordable Care Act, urges the Food and Drug Administration to reverse the approval of abortion pills, and further empowers Immigration and Customs Enforcement to deport undocumented immigrants.\n\nOn his social media site, Truth Social, Trump has denied knowing anything about Project 2025 and said he has \"nothing to do with them.\"\n\nOther Iowa Democrats who are set to attend the Democratic National Convention in Chicago next month were also supportive of Biden.\n\nState Rep. Adam Zabner, D-Iowa City, is a delegate to the convention and said that while \"the debate was certainly not (Biden's) best moment,\" he is \"running on three and a half years of a really successful presidency.\"\n\n\"I'm the youngest member of the Legislature. I represent the youngest district,\" Zabner said. \"And I think it's pretty clear that we have two old men running for president. I think the difference is that while Donald Trump is focused on his own past, his legal troubles, things like that, Joe Biden is a future-oriented president, and he's been making the largest investment in the history of the world in climate change, making investments in our country's infrastructure, and he's performed really well.\"\n\nTrump has been convicted of 34 felony counts of falsifying business records for paying hush money to a porn star, and he is the first former president to be convicted of a crime. Republicans are set to nominate him for president at their own convention in Milwaukee next week.\n\nMary McAdams, an Ankeny Democrat, will serve as an alternate delegate at the Democratic convention. She said the debate \"wasn't what I expected,\" and she believes Biden \"over-prepared.\"\n\nStill, she says, he has the \"moral compass that I'm seeking.\"\n\n\"I strongly support President Biden,\" she said. \"... I know Biden's heart, and I know who he is, and he's a strong, good leader, and he's got good people around him. And Trump is a felon. He's been (found liable) for sexual assault. And that's not who we want. That's not who I want. That's not who I will support at all.\"\n\nA civil jury in 2023 found Trump liable for sexually abusing and defaming advice columnist E. Jean Carroll. A federal judge denied Trump's request for a new trial earlier this year, and he has been ordered to pay Carroll $83.3 million.\n\nState Rep. Ako Abdul-Samad, D-Des Moines, will also head to the convention as a delegate and previously told the Des Moines Register he doesn't believe Biden should withdraw his candidacy.\n\n\"I don't think it was his best performance, but I still prefer him over the alternative without a doubt,\" he said. \"This is where we're at, and right now, we're in a crisis.\"\n\nUSA TODAY contributed to this report.\n\nBrianne Pfannenstiel is the chief politics reporter for the Des Moines Register.

They believe their party's presidential nominee is fatally compromised. But few of them are willing to speak out. Those that do, say they hope the candidate will change and start acting differently. But most realize there is little that can be done to force the nominee out, so they stay silent and hope for the best.\n\nOn the surface, the similarities between the Democratic Party's situation with President Joe Biden and the Republican Party's situation with former President Donald Trump seem quite similar. Party elites are unhappy with their presidential candidate, but they have little power to force a change, and by using what little power they have, they would almost certainly end up hurting their party's chances of winning in the fall.\n\nBut that is where the similarities end. Drilling just a little bit deeper, we see the differences between the Republican Trump dilemma in 2016 and the Democratic Biden dilemma in 2024 are fundamental.\n\nIn 2016, Republican elites thought Trump was a buffoon, far too vulgar and unrefined for the highest office. And they were right in the sense that Trump was far different than most Republicans in Washington, D.C.\n\nBut Trump never tried to hide these qualities from Republican primary voters. Quite the opposite, he reveled in them. And Republican primary voters, not all of them -- but enough to win the nomination, loved Trump for it. They liked that Trump made the lives of other elected Republicans miserable.\n\nBiden's case is the reverse. Democratic primary voters have been telling pollsters for years that they thought Biden was too old to be president. So Biden, his aides, elected Democrats, and their allies in the media tried to cover it up. When Biden would slip or fall, or talk to dead people, or freeze, or forget the names of his own Cabinet, Democrats and the media would not only ignore it, they would bully and attack anyone who dared to say the emperor had no clothes.\n\nNow, all of a sudden, after the first debate, the lie that Biden, his aides, elected Democrats, and their media allies have been telling for years has been exposed. And the voters are not happy.\n\nCLICK HERE TO READ MORE FROM THE WASHINGTON EXAMINER\n\nThat is what makes Trump 2016 and Biden 2024 so fundamentally different. Republican elites were freaking out because Trump was exactly who he said he was. Democratic elites are freaking out because Biden's lie has been revealed.\n\nMaybe Biden, unlike Trump, will suddenly change and become younger. But just like Trump is still the cad he always was, I wouldn't bet on it.", "source": {"uri": "washingtonexaminer.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Washington Examiner"}, "authors": [{"uri": "conn_carroll@washingtonexaminer.com", "name": "Conn Carroll", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Biden", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Democratic Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republican_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Republican Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Senate", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States Senate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Washington,_D.C.", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Washington, D.C."}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Washington, D.C."}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cabinet_(government)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Cabinet (government)"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Campaigns_and_Elections", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Campaigns and Elections", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Activism/Strategies", "label": "dmoz/Society/Activism/Strategies", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Niche/Politics", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Niche/Politics", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Gay,_Lesbian,_and_Bisexual/Politics", "label": "dmoz/Society/Gay, Lesbian, and Bisexual/Politics", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Democracy", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Democracy", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 88}], "image": "https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Trump-Biden-Stock-Photo-early-2024-scaled.webp", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9717617", "eventUri": "eng-9717617", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.05098039215686279, "wgt": 118, "relevance": 1}

The more that Trump argues that Biden is toast, the more he may stiffen the president's resolve not to be pressured out of the race. Not even by the New York Times, which yesterday ran a second editorial: \"He has come to regard himself as indispensable. He does not seem to understand that he is now the problem -- and that the best hope for Democrats to retain the White House is for him to step aside.\"\n\nBIDEN CALLS 'MORNING JOE,' DENOUNCES MEDIA AND POLITICAL ELITES AS DEMOCRATS WARN OF TRUMP VICTORY\n\nTrump is so certain of a big victory after Biden's debate meltdown that it may well affect his VP choice, which I'm certain will be unveiled at week's end. He had been talking about an announcement the first day of next week's Milwaukee convention, which would blow out coverage of the first couple of days, but has switched saying before the convention. And it has probably given a big boost to J.D. Vance.\n\nIn a phone interview last night with Sean Hannity, Trump was asked if he wanted to run against Biden.\n\n\"Well, we prepared for him, but I don't think it's going to matter,\" Trump said, adding that the president is \"only semi-running things\" while the people that surround the Oval Office are really in charge.\n\nWhat about the talk that if Biden steps aside, it would be Kamala Harris?\n\n\"Well, I think that it will be her,\" said Trump. \"I think they are very concerned about the vote if it's not her. They are very, very- I mean, they're gun-shy, they don't want to do it any other way. I've actually come to believe that's what they're going to do.\"\n\nHe concluded, \"I think she's an ineffective person, she was in charge of the border, she's never been there, she didn't do a good job, and she hasn't done a job on a lot of other things, but it would seem to me from a political standpoint that's who they're going with.\"\n\nTrump had called her \"pathetic\" in those golf cart comments taped by an aide.\n\nThe subject lines of two recent fundraising emails: \"Biden is dropping out!\" and \"President Kamala Harris?\" .\n\nBIDEN DIGS IN WHILE DEMOCRATS LAUNCH BLAME GAME AS MUCH OF THE PARTY WISHES HE'D BOW OUT\n\nBiden insists he's doing nothing of the sort, but he's had an awful couple of weeks. He has lost Stephen Colbert and Jon Stewart, two anti-Trumpers, especially Colbert, who held a softball session with the president just three months ago.\n\nMore important, the White House has been caught in another coverup. The New York Post first reported that the White House physician, Kevin O'Connor, brought in a Parkinson's specialist who visited the building 10 times between 2022 and last March.\n\nThis neurologist, Kevin Cannard, examined the president three times, but it was buried in a report as if it were a routine part of Biden's annual physical. What many are missing is that Cannard met with a liaison in the medical unit and was undoubtedly providing Parkinson's guidance to Biden's longtime doctor.\n\nKarine Jean-Pierre was absolutely hammered at Monday's briefing, with CBS's Ed O'Keefe accusing her of misleading the press. O'Connor released a BS letter confirming Cannard's role that was basically a non-denial denial.\n\nGetting information out of this White House is like pulling teeth.\n\nWhat's more, Politico reports that O'Connor was basically in business with Biden's brother Jim, introducing him to hospital officials in an effort to drum up business.\n\nThe leak of Biden's comments to Democratic governors that he won't do events after 8 p.m., so he can get more sleep, brought plenty of mockery.\n\nThe Wall Street Journal, which drew so much condemnation from the MSM a month ago for its piece \"Biden Seems to be Slipping,\" was back yesterday with devastating new reporting.\n\n\"The White House has limited Biden's daily itinerary and shielded him from impromptu exchanges...and sought to make sure meetings with donors stuck to scripted pleasantries.\n\nTHE VEEPSTAKES GOES 'APPRENTICE': WILL TRUMP REALLY PICK RUBIO, VANCE OR BURGUM?\n\n\"Senior aides dismissed travel suggestions over worries the president didn't have the stamina for them...including an idea for Biden to make weekly cross-country trips in 2022 to tout the benefits of his infrastructure law.\"\n\nAnita Dunn, who oversees communications strategy, and such longtime loyalists as Steve Richetti and Mike Donilon, are getting some of the blame.\n\nAll of this unfolded as Biden's slips became increasingly obvious, and his top advisers were assuring everyone the president was fine.\n\nRegarding Biden and Dunn's shared disdain for the media, a spokesman said, \"The president and Anita only feel that way about some of the press.\"\n\nAnother telling anecdote: German officials, knowing of the fatigue issue, planned a 2022 event for Biden in the early evening. But Biden didn't show, and Tony Blinken filled in, saying the president had gone to bed. The secretary of State denies saying this.\n\nHaving fumbled the Stephanopoulos sitdown, when he could have been doing five interviews, Biden faces one more test: A solo press conference tomorrow at the NATO summit in Washington. It's his chance to show he's quick enough to deal with aggressive questioning. And a supposed revolt by congressional Democrats hasn't materialized.\n\nAfter lying low, Trump will seize the spotlight again with his veep announcement. And his expectation that he'll win easily has given a boost to Vance, who is backed by Don Jr.\n\nThe Ohio senator, despite being in office less than two years, has become perhaps the most forceful advocate of a populist version of the MAGA agenda, one that favors tariffs and America First isolationism over traditional Republicanism. Although the \"Hillbilly Elegy\" author opposed Trump in 2016, even likening him to Hitler, they have long since mended fences. And Vance is a veteran who served in Iraq.\n\nIf Trump sees himself coasting to victory, it's easier to go with Vance.\n\nThe other alternative appears to be Marco Rubio, who spoke at a Trump rally in Florida last night. Rubio is a nationally known figure and foreign policy expert who guided Trump on Latin American affairs. He would energize at least part of the Hispanic community and is a plausible president who could take over if necessary.\n\nSUBSCRIBE TO HOWIE'S MEDIA BUZZMETER PODCAST, A RIFF ON THE DAY'S HOTTEST STORIES\n\nThe downside is that Rubio would start running for the 2028 nomination on day one, which could draw coverage from a boss who likes to be the center of attention.\n\nVance is the ideological pick; Rubio is the governing pick.\n\nTrump told me in our interview that it doesn't matter who he selects, that people vote for the top of the ticket. And he's right about that.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nBut after insisting in several interviews that his only retribution would be success, he was back to making threats yesterday, seeming to target Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg:\n\n\"We will pursue Election Fraudsters at levels never seen before, and they will be sent to prison for long periods of time.

I also don't know how former President Trump's health, or that of any other living creature, will progress over time.\n\nI do know that Biden, like Trump, and you, dear reader, won't get any younger. But anyone who tells us they know how that will affect his ability to serve as president is simply making it up.\n\nI don't know whether substituting a different Democratic candidate at this point will damage or enhance the prospects of defeating Trump.\n\nSince there is no clear process to get us from here to there, no historical experience on which to rely and since no one can predict exactly how such a maneuver would unfold, or how a substitute candidate would react under the unique pressures of a presidential campaign, anybody who says they know a different candidate will be stronger or weaker is also making it up.\n\nAnd since we cannot run a controlled experiment with one randomly selected group of our fellow citizens going through the next five months with Biden as the nominee and another group living in a world with another nominee, no one will ever know which candidate would prove stronger.\n\nThe certainty with which people express opinions on this topic has zero correlation with their ability to predict a future they cannot possibly foresee.\n\nHere is what I think I know:\n\nA president's ability to provide unscripted answers to journalists' inquiries, whether in a debate or press conference, bears little relationship to the skills required to be an effective president.\n\nIt is, for example, far more important for a president to be able to ask probing questions than it is for him to prove adept at answering reporters' questions.\n\nNo one has suggested that Biden has stopped asking the right questions. Quite the contrary.\n\nI think I know that while the president's debate performance increased the number of voters with concerns about his mental health, the debate had no meaningful impact on the horse race.\n\nSeven pollsters produced surveys before and just after the debate (starting no earlier than June 28 and ending their interviewing no later than June 30).\n\nThe best for Biden showed the margin moving 3 points in his direction, the worst, 4 points in Trump's direction.\n\nOn average, these seven surveys showed less than 1 point of movement toward Trump.\n\nLater polls suggest a larger movement of 2.8 points in Trump's direction.\n\nWhy the difference?\n\nBecause when media focuses relentlessly on Biden's performance, ignoring Trump's by comparison, and when Democrats speak out directly, or through veiled quotes, expressing disaffection and dissatisfaction with Biden, it hurts.\n\n\"If his own people are turning on him ...\"\n\nThis is not voters watching the debate and drawing their own conclusions. Rather it's others shaping public impressions.\n\nFor the media, this is not some mechanical or ineluctable process, it results from conscious human decisions. Producers and editors decided that an aging and inarticulate Biden deserves vastly more attention than a dishonest Trump who is dangerously detached from reality.\n\nIn fairness, few Republicans jumped to critique Trump, while Democrats were much more willing to provide media with the fodder needed to give the story legs.\n\nDemocratic officials did not intend to hurt Biden, but the net effect of their actions did more damage to the president than he did to himself.\n\nI also think I know that this has as much to do with the fact that Biden isn't winning than it has to do with the impact of his debate performance.\n\nAs I've noted here, this race has been poised on the knife's edge for a year or more. But in the past year Biden has been consistently behind, while four years ago it was also close but the president was consistently ahead of Trump nationally and in swing states.\n\nIn short, it was not voters' reaction to the debate that set off Democratic leaders, rather it was their perception of his failings, combined with the fact that the president was losing, and the debate was not turning it around as they'd hoped.\n\nThe other key factor are the stakes, which with Trump atop the GOP ticket are immense. As in Paul Revere's time \"the fate of the nation\" will be riding that November night.\n\nOne last thing I think I know: There is much better than a 66 percent chance that Biden will be our nominee and undercutting him in any way helps Trump and his GOP sycophants.\n\nSome elected Democrats fantasize about replicating the famous meeting between Barry Goldwater et. al., and Richard Nixon.\n\nHere's something I know for certain: The Goldwater delegation had leverage no Democrat has today. The Republican House and Senate leaders told President Nixon he was leaving office one way or the other. Either he could resign or they would vote to impeach, convict and remove him from office.\n\nRepublicans could have saved the country considerable anguish by doing the same with Trump.

Average Americans are not surprised by Biden's obvious cognitive decline, but everyone is surprised some of the Democrat Media Complex is actually admitting it and even scrutinizing the Biden administration for hiding it. Even more stunning is the usually in-lockstep Democrat Party is breaking ranks with growing numbers of celebrities, donors, and elected officials calling on Biden to step down.\n\nBiden is (or at least Jill and Hunter are) steadfast that he's NOT stepping down, but the speculation on who will replace him and when has gone viral. It remains to be seen how panicked Democrats sort this out, but they are apoplectic that the media focus is on Biden's inability to continue and the discordant disarray in the Democrat Party. Democrats know they have a problem with Biden, but their bigger problem is they cannot withstand the continuous public scrutiny that is steadily exposing Biden's incapacitation, his failed record, and the shameless duplicity of the Democrat Media Complex for lying to the American people about all of it! Under the microscope, Democrats lose!\n\nWhile Democrats are at each other's throats, most still realize they must get the spotlight back on the orange bogeyman as soon as possible. They know Biden or Harris cannot win on their own, so their sole strategy is to scare Americans that Trump is so bad that as MSNBC's Joy Reid put it \"voting for Biden in a coma is still better than Trump.\"\n\nSince Biden's cognitive decline is inescapable, the first hilarious attempt to deflect from Biden's dementia is to accuse Trump of the same. Biden can barely do one event a day or string two sentences together, but a few Democrats, like Pelosi and Schiff, comically claim Trump has dementia too when Trump runs circles around Biden with a grueling schedule and can give lengthy interviews without a teleprompter.\n\nWith accusing Trump of having dementia not working, the main and really only argument Democrats have is that Trump lied about everything. They admit Biden had a bad night, has lost a step or two, and may have some problems, but Biden tells the truth and will protect democracy from the ginger tyrant. They insist Biden may have stumbled (but truthfully) while Trump just lied. Democrats contend that Trump has NO redeeming qualities or worthy ideas, so he must be conning his supporters.\n\nAs usual, there is no substance to Democrat allegations. Republicans also claim Biden lied, but they offer examples. Biden asserted he inherited 9% inflation, which he didn't. He also awkwardly tried to recycle the now roundly debunked lies that Trump called veterans \"suckers and losers,\" or that he called white supremacists \"fine people\" during the Charlottesville demonstrations, or that he told people to inject themselves with bleach. All demonstrable lies Biden told AGAIN during the debate - they're evidence of Biden's dishonesty.\n\nOn the other hand, Democrats simply scream Trump lied about everything during the debate, but Democrats offer NO examples. While Republicans provide specifics, no where are Democrats citing any actual lies, just a mendacious broad brush. Let's examine the debate script for any blatant lies. Trump cited many problems. Democrats can subjectively disagree with his descriptions, but objectively the problems he named indeed exist.\n\nTrump harped on Biden's open border. Democrats can dispute the definition of \"open\" but they cannot deny record numbers of millions of illegal immigrants under Biden. He said other nations are emptying their asylums and prisons and sending them to America; Venezuela admitted as much. He stated illegal immigrants are getting Social Security which will bankrupt it. That particular statement can be viewed as inaccurate. There is no clear evidence that any illegal immigrants are receiving Social Security, but non-citizens are eligible for Supplemental Security Income, and many are being provided with food, housing, and medical care. That may not be specifically Social Security or MEDICAID, but all those programs are largely funded from the general fund. So, any diversion of funds to care for illegal immigrants will decrease available funds for Americans. Democrats can assert Trump lied specifically, but the problem he addressed indeed exists.\n\nDemocrats can quibble about Trump's characterization of his economic success and Biden's economic failures, but Americans know they thrived under Trump and suffered under Biden. Trump described Biden's catastrophic retreat from Afghanistan as America's greatest embarrassment. Democrats can dispute the description, but the 13 American lives lost and ensuing wars in Ukraine and the Middle East are still fact. Democrats can accuse Trump of exaggeration or hyperbole, but those are disagreements on semantics, not lies.\n\nAgain, Democrats provide no substance just baseless accusations that Trump lied, but Americans know what they experienced under each administration. Democrats are realizing maligning Trump's character is not working, so now they are maligning voters with cynical memes like \"we know Trump's character, so what about the character of his supporters?\"\n\nContrary to Democrats insistence, Trump has not conned anyone, but he has simply offered clear eyed reality and viable solutions - Americans are listening. In fact, Trump is the only politician sacrificing his wealth and risking his liberty to serve the American people and save the country.\n\nBiden has conned the people about his health and mental capacity, and he also conned Americans about being a moderate. He has governed as a left-wing radical. However, Biden was abetted by the Democrat Media Complex who conned the people by hiding his severe cognitive limitations and lying about his manifest graft and myriad failures. There are plenty of con men in Washington, but Trump has proven he is not one of them.\n\n\"While evil people and impostors will go on from bad to worse, deceiving and being deceived\" (2 Timothy

Only 16 percent thought the Democratic candidate would win.\n\nEven Democrats are not much convinced of their candidate's chances over 18 holes. A third say he would win, while 26 percent thought he would lose.\n\nWith so much at stake in November's election, including democracy according to Biden, it is possible that the other 41 percent of Democrats who said 'don't know' may just have thought that the question was stupid.\n\nBut it reflects a central question facing voters after Biden's halting debate performance: Is he up to the strains of the job?\n\nBoth men are keen golfers and Trump used his hobby to push back on questions about how he would fare at the end of a second presidential term, when he would be 82 years old.\n\n'I just won two club championships -- not even senior, two regular club championships,' he boasted.\n\n'To do that, you have to be quite smart, and you have to be able to hit the ball a long way. And I do it. He doesn't do it. He can't hit a ball 50 yards.'\n\nBiden took a swing back saying he would be happy to take on Trump in a 'driving contest.'\n\n'I got my handicap, when I was vice president, down to a six,' he said, before jabbing at Trump, who is frequently pictured on his own courses in a golf cart with a caddy never far away.\n\n'And by the way, I told you before, I'm happy to play golf if you carry your own bag. Think you can do it?'\n\nTrump scoffed at Biden's handicap.\n\n'That's the biggest lie -- that he's a six-handicap -- of all,' he said.\n\nAs if none of that were childish enough, when Trump added: 'Let's not act like children,' Biden responded: 'You are a child.'\n\nTrump's love of golf is well-known. He frequently played during his winter weekends at Mar-a-Lago in Florida or summer breaks to Bedminster, his course in New Jersey.\n\nSome of his most animated appearances at the White House included visits by golfing great Tiger Woods, and in 2018 he played at his West Palm Beach course with legend Jack Nicklaus.\n\nBiden plays less frequently, but is a member at the Fieldstone Golf Club near his Delaware home.\n\nTo test what voters thought of the pair's skills, J.L. Partners polled 1,000 likely voters online. The results carry a margin of error of plus or minus 3.1 points.", "source": {"uri": "internewscast.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Internewscast Journal"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2020_United_States_presidential_debates", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "2020 United States presidential debates"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Biden", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Democratic Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Country_club", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Country club"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golf_course", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Golf course"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disability", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Disability"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golf", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Golf"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democracy", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Democracy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mar-a-Lago", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Mar-a-Lago"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jack_Nicklaus", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Jack Nicklaus"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golf_cart", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Golf cart"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vice_President_of_the_United_States", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Vice President of the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tiger_Woods", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Tiger Woods"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_House", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "White House"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Jersey", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "New Jersey"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "New Jersey"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bedminster,_New_Jersey", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Bedminster, New Jersey"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/West_Palm_Beach,_Florida", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "West Palm Beach, Florida"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "West Palm Beach, Florida"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Florida", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Florida"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Florida"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Delaware", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Delaware"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Delaware"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Golf", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Golf", "wgt": 21}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Golf", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Golf", "wgt": 21}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Golf/Software", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Golf/Software", "wgt": 19}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Golf/Women", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Golf/Women", "wgt": 19}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Golf/Community_and_Clubs", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Golf/Community and Clubs", "wgt": 21}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 99}], "image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2024/07/02/10/86684085-13578809-President_Joe_Biden_and_former_President_Donald_Trump_traded_ins-a-9_1719913563688.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9717617", "eventUri": "eng-9717617", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.09019607843137245, "wgt": 110, "relevance": 1}

Veronica Escobar, a co-chair of the Biden-Harris campaign.\n\n\"The American public needs to understand what is at stake in this election, and this election is not about one debate night. This election is about everything that is going to be ripped away from the American people if Donald Trump and his cronies get in the White House.\"\n\nAmong some of the plans included in Project 2025 are to downsize or dismantle federal agencies such as the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration and Department of Homeland Security.\n\nOn education, the plan proposes a complete restructuring of governance at the federal level and the eventual elimination of Title I, which provides grants to schools with large populations of low-income students, according to Education Week.\n\nOn abortion, the plan calls for the Food and Drug Administration to reverse its 24-year-old approval of mifepristone, also known as the \"abortion pill,\" according to CBS News. It recommends that the U.S. Justice Department enforce the 1873 Comstock Act against providers and distributors of abortion pills. That law prohibits drugs, medicines, or instruments used in abortions from being sent through the mail.\n\n\"Sarah Parshall Perry from the Heritage Foundation has said that states can use police power to restrict or prohibit abortion, including particular methods of abortion such as by a pill,\" said Escobar. \"That's what we need to be talking about every single day, because that puts women's lives at risk, that puts our country at risk, that puts our future at risk that's my focus.\"\n\nKevin Roberts, president of Heritage, received blowback last week after he said that Americans were in the process of carrying out a \"Second American Revolution to take back power from elites and despotic bureaucrats,\" and warned that \"the Left may not allow a peaceful transfer of power.\" The comment led to Trump claiming that he knew nothing about Project 2025.\n\nThe Republican National Committee on Monday released a draft of its party platform for the coming Republican National Convention that softens the GOP's stance on abortion, no longer calling for any federal limits on the procedure. The platform calls on states, rather than Congress, to deal with abortion.\n\nThat prompted Jill Biden to say on the call that Trump is trying to pose as a \"moderate on reproductive rights.\"\n\n\"Does he think we forgot that his Supreme Court justices killed Roe v. Wade and that he brags about it?\" she said. \"Does he think we don't know that he wants to roll back access to contraception and he could jeopardize IVF treatments? Does he think that he can pivot away from a career of diminishing and denigrating women? Well, women haven't forgotten, and we can't be fooled.\"\n\nThe first lady went on to say that \"women put Joe Biden in the White House and women are going to keep him there.\"\n\nAlso participating on the call was Ana Navarro, a former GOP strategist based in Miami who has gone on to become a nationally known political commentator and is supporting Joe Biden for president. She was asked about the possibility that Trump could select Florida GOP U.S. Sen. Marco Rubio as his running mate.\n\nNavarro played down the notion, saying that Rubio \"could probably win an Olympic medal for sucking up and for turning into a completely different person,\" a reference to how Rubio challenged Trump for president in 2016 but, like many other Republicans who previously criticized him, is now strongly backing his candidacy in 2024.\n\n\"I don't think Donald Trump is going to appoint Marco,\" she said, adding that loyalty is important to Trump, \"and if you think Marco Rubio is capable of loyalty, just go ask Jeb Bush. He'll tell you about it.\"\n\nRubio and former Gov. Bush, both from the Miami area, were considered allies before Rubio decided to run for president in 2015-2016 against Bush, engendering \"a sense of betrayal\" among Bush supporters, as reported by POLITICO. Both men ended up falling short to Trump that election cycle.", "source": {"uri": "floridaphoenix.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Florida Phoenix"}, "authors": [{"uri":

Marco Rubio (R-FL) could be a tantalizing pick for former President Donald Trump's running mate: GOP megadonor Ken Griffin.\n\nAccording to The Daily Mail, longtime Trump adviser Corey Lewandowski says that \"If Sen. Rubio is the choice there are plenty of donors I'm sure will come along - including Ken Griffin, allegedly.\"\n\nGriffin, a hedge fund tycoon estimated to be worth $37 billion, backed Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis over Trump in the primary, who went on to flame out with a botched campaign. He was outspoken against Trump in 2022, calling him a \"three-time loser\" and saying the GOP should \"move on\" from him.\n\nRubio being on the ticket, however, could reportedly sway Griffin, who moved his company, Citadel, from Chicago to Miami in recent years, unlocking a deep source of campaign funding for GOP PACs.\n\nRubio, who first rose to prominence in the early 2010s Tea Party movement, ran against Trump for president in 2016, sharply attacking his character and morals, but became a loyal supporter of the former president while he was in office.\n\nRead also: 'Ideological lunacy': CNN's Bash puts scrambling Marco Rubio on the spot over Project 2025'\n\nIf Rubio is the choice, there is a potential legal complication: it would mean both people on the Republican ticket are from Florida, which would run afoul of the 12th Amendment's prohibition on electors voting for both a president and a vice president from their own state -- meaning that if Florida's remains in Trump's camp and its 30 electoral votes are decisive in his margin, Rubio would not have the votes to be confirmed vice president.\n\nTrump could potentially get around this, however, by relocating his state of residence back to New York, where he still maintains a penthouse in Trump Tower; a similar conundrum faced the George W. Bush presidential ticket in 2000, which was resolved when running mate Dick Cheney relocated his residence from Texas to Wyoming.", "source": {"uri": "rawstory.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Raw Story"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kenneth_C._Griffin", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Kenneth C.

He has since received calls from within his party to end his reelection bid and allow Democrats to install a new candidate for the general election. Biden's odds of victory against Trump have also slumped with bookmakers.\n\nNevertheless, in Georgia, he has increased his share of the vote by 0.9 percent since the debate, though the Republican Party is still ahead by 3.5 percent.\n\nIn Michigan, he has increased his vote share by 0.8 percent making him ahead of Trump by 0.4 percent, and in North Carolina he has also increased his vote share by 0.8 percent, though the Republicans are still ahead by 4 percent.\n\nNewsweek contacted Biden and Trump's campaigns by email to comment on this story.\n\nSurveys like these are significant due to the Electoral College system, which awards each state a certain number of votes based on population.\n\nBiden flipped Georgia from Donald Trump by 11,779 votes, or 0.24 percent of the 5 million ballots cast, making Trump the first Republican to lose the state in decades.\n\nNorth Carolina has voted for the Republican candidate in 10 of the last 11 elections, with former President Barack Obama winning the state in 2008. But Trump only won there by 1.3 percent of the vote in 2020 -- his narrowest state win -- and North Carolina often elects Democratic governors. Seven of its last eight gubernatorial contests have gone blue.\n\nIn 2016, Trump took Michigan, but Biden flipped it back to blue in 2020. Democrats have won the state in seven of the last eight presidential contests.\n\nA presidential candidate must secure 270 electoral votes for victory, and winning the national popular vote does not guarantee success.\n\nHowever, with some four months to go until the election, it is still too early to call it, and other polls have suggested that the two candidates are tied or that Trump is in the lead.\n\nA second presidential debate between the 2024 candidates is scheduled for September 10.

Trump, ever the confident golfer, boasted a handicap of 2.5, while Biden countered with claims of once having a 6 handicap. The 45th president of the United States, never one to back down, dubbed Biden's claim \"the biggest lie,\" and the golf banter was on!\n\nAmidst this playful bickering, two-time U.S. Open champion Bryson DeChambeau stepped in with a brilliant idea: why not settle the score on the green? He offered to host a match between the two on his YouTube channel.\n\nFast forward a few days, and two golf enthusiasts, Anon and Meth, have brought this hypothetical showdown to life in a hilarious cosplay video. Their recreation, shared by The Tour Golf on X (formerly Twitter), captures Donald Trump mocking Biden's handicap claim and even throws in some cheeky allegations of the 78-year-old cheating. Fans are loving it, calling it \"good stuff\" and getting excited about this playful take on presidential golf drama!\n\nAlthough the fans wanted an 18-hole stroke play game between the two presidential candidates to bury the handicap arguments, it might never become a reality. However, seeing the parody version of it made them equally elated about the whole fiasco.\n\nFrom John Daly endorsing Donald Trump as a good golfer to Jack Nicklaus calling him the best golfer among all the presidents, many golfers from the golf world have praised the 45th president's golfing skills. However, Trump still fails to charm the golf fans with it.\n\nFrom the past year to this day, the 78-year-old has been ridiculed for his out-of-the-ordinary swing, which some have called \"horrible and ugly.\" In the video, the cosplayers mimicked Trump's swing to perfection and impressed this fan. They, enjoying the parody, said, \"The accuracy of the trump swing is crazy!\"\n\nIt has been a very well-known rumor in the golf world that Donald Trump might have cheated in many of the events he has played. Moreover, an author and sports writer, Rick Reilly, explained in his book, Commander in Cheat, that Trump used to take many mulligans and used to move ahead of other golfers to move his ball.\n\nThus, even in the video, Donald Trump's cheating allegations were made fun of, and this fan laughed, reiterating them, and said, \"That's lie fraud\ud83d\ude02.\" It could also be hinted at by the recent indictment of the 45th president.\n\nTrump does have a unique characteristic that fans love about him; from his swing to the different faces he makes after it, golf fans notice everything about the former POTUS. This time too, they noticed the parody of Trump made by Meth, and they called it the \"Best part!\" of the whole video.\n\nAnother user was impressed with how not only Donald Trump but also Joe Biden were accurately represented in the post. The 46th POTUS's habit of walking and talking slowly was correctly captured, making this fan say, \"Funny! Good stuff, guys!\"\n\nHowever, not everyone was pleased with the parody match between Trump and Biden. Many found the video not as hilarious as everyone in the golf community was attributing it to. DeChambeau's video of a match between the candidates could have impressed the fans, but not this one. This user frustratingly said, \"Easily the least funny thing I've seen this week.\"\n\nDonald Trump and Joe Biden will next meet on September 5 for another debate at ABC News. Will the two amateurs bring up the golf handicap debate once again? If they do, it will surely be an entertaining day for the golf world.", "source": {"uri": "essentiallysports.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "EssentiallySports"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Handicap_(golf)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Handicap (golf)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Biden", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golf", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Golf"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bryson_DeChambeau", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Bryson DeChambeau"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infidelity", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Infidelity"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cosplay", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Cosplay"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parody", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Parody"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/U.S._Open_(golf)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "U.S. Open (golf)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/YouTube", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "YouTube"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twitter", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Twitter"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Daly_(golfer)", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "John Daly (golfer)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jack_Nicklaus", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Jack Nicklaus"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stroke_play", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Stroke play"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rick_Reilly", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Rick Reilly"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sports_journalism", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Sports journalism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ABC_News", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "ABC News"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fraud", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Fraud"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Golf", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Golf", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Golf/Rules_and_Etiquette", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Golf/Rules and Etiquette", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Golf/Humor", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Golf/Humor", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 64}], "image": "https://www.essentiallysports.com/api/og/Z29sZiU3Qy0lN0NTaGFyZSUyMFlvdXIlMjBUaG91Z2h0cyUzQSUyMFdobyUyMGRvJTIweW91JTIwdGhpbmslMjBCcnlzb24lMjBEZUNoYW1iZWF1J3MlMjBjb3NwbGF5JTIwd2FzJTIwbW9yZSUyMHNwb3Qtb24lM0YlN0MtJTdDaHR0cHMlM0ElMkYlMkZpbWFnZS1jZG4uZXNzZW50aWFsbHlzcG9ydHMuY29tJTJGd3AtY29udGVudCUyRnVwbG9hZHMlMkZEb25hbGQtVHJ1bXAtQnJ5c29uLURlQ2hhbWJlYXUtSm9lLUJpZGVuLnBuZyUzRndpZHRoJTNEMTIwMA==", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9717617", "eventUri": "eng-9717617", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-09-05", "textStart": 3413, "textEnd": 3424}], "sentiment": 0.2941176470588236, "wgt": 107, "relevance": 1}

(You could flip the first two, but the campaign puts Pennsylvania first because it's the biggest swing state, and because Biden desperately needs it.)\n\nBehind the scenes: Trump wants and assumes Biden is his opponent. He tells friends Biden's debate performance and age are gifts from the political gods. No longer is he seen as the old, selfish guy in it for his own vainglory and personal power, friends joke.\n\nThe timing of Trump's effort to distance himself from the Heritage Foundation's Project 2025, with 922 pages of hard-right policy prescriptions, was no coincidence.\n\nWhat we're watching: Trump wants the platform to set the stage for the Republican National Convention, which opens Monday in Milwaukee. Reality TV star Amber Rose will have a slot. Early plans had 50 Cent among prime-time surprises, to portray Trump as connected to popular culture (think mixed martial arts).\n\nBetween the lines: Trump didn't get the post-debate polling bounce some advisers hoped for. Yes, his numbers inched up nationally. But he's still neck-and-neck with Biden, despite overwhelming Democratic fears about his age.\n\nThe bottom line: Trump sees hypermasculine appeal as an edge.

The last half of 2024 is shaping up to be one of the most politically insane in a century and the sparks are already flying. The biggest moment of absurdity so far might be the first presidential debate between Donald Trump and Joe Biden, in which it was made abundantly clear for all the world to see that Biden is on the fast track to crazy town. We've been saying for four years that the guy is gone, a dementia case propped up and protected by the DNC and the media. Now, it's undeniable:\n\nThere's a vegetable sitting in the Oval Office and the nation is in a panic.\n\nLeftists are panicking because they're now realizing their candidate is a farce, the emperor has no clothes and they bet all their cash on one very retarded race horse. Conservatives are celebrating, but also panicking because they think Biden in his senility might launch nukes at any moment.\n\nThere are even people calling for a 25 Amendment intervention to remove Biden because they actually think he makes decisions. He doesn't. Biden is a proxy for more powerful interests and always has been. Getting rid of Biden early doesn't solve the greater problem, nor would it prevent a nuclear Apocalypse (if that was ever the plan to begin with). Other people are making his decisions for him.\n\nIn the meantime, there are a host of surprises that could take place before November. As I noted in my article 'The Juggling Act: Is 2024 A Pivotal Year For The Globalists?' published in January, the election of 2024 is developing into its own Black Swan event. I stated that:\n\n\"...There is the potential for shock events, such as Biden stepping down at the last minute. Trump being arrested but winning anyway. Or, a major geopolitical crisis which is used by the Democrats as an excuse to \"postpone\" the election...\"\n\nIt's looking more and more like at least one of these scenarios is about to play out (Biden stepping down or being pushed out by the DNC). It's also becoming increasingly more likely that Donald Trump will be returning to the White House regardless. For now it appears that Biden wants to cling to his position, but even if he is replaced there's not a Democrat candidate yet that has the numbers to prevail in November. And if you think election fraud will be a factor, don't forget that the votes have to be close in order to rig the outcome.\n\nThe question is, what will this mean for conservatives and patriots going forward? Is this cause for elation, or should Americans be getting ready for the rug to be pulled out from underneath them?\n\nAfter Trump's win in 2016 (which I predicted a year ahead of the elections) I suggested that Trump might be set up as the next Herbert Hoover; the scapegoat for a host of economic and social calamities caused by obscure and shadowy interests. I also questioned whether or not Trump would be a willing participant in this theater.\n\nKeep in mind, his cabinet picks in 2016 were a nightmare - Packed with a swarm of banking elites, a member of the Rothschild cartel (Wilber Ross), CFR members and other bad actors. He truly had some of the worst people standing over his shoulder at the time (like Anthony Fauci, for example...). Even if Trump had good intentions, his advisers certainly did not.\n\nWith the combination of BLM riots, Federal Reserve interest rate hikes, the pandemic hysteria, covid stimulus triggering stagflation, the January 6 \"insurrection\", Trump was turned into a pariah (for the most part unjustly). Conservatives in 2020 and beyond were labeled the ultimate villains; the \"destroyers of democracy.\" Trump was, in many ways, pigeonholed as another Hoover.\n\nBut something happened during this process that I believe the globalists did not intend; the pandemic agenda failed. The vaccine passports failed. The mandates failed. The average infection fatality rate was a tiny 0.23% and the public was not sufficiently terrified. Too many patriots were refusing to comply. The CDC numbers on vaccinations were clearly inflated to make it look like more people were taking the jab. Almost no one took the boosters.\n\nIt was perhaps one of the biggest blunders the globalists have ever faced. The WEF's Klaus Schwab, Dr. Evil himself, has faded into the background and retired as executive chairman. The big play for medical tyranny bombed. Now what to do?\n\nIs it a mistake that the establishment has continued to stick with Biden despite his delirium? Or, did they send Biden into that first debate knowing exactly how bad it was going to go? Is this a ploy designed to complete the Herbert Hoover scenario? This year, Trump hinted in an interview with Fox Business that he \"does not want to become the next Herbert Hoover\" inheriting a time bomb economy from Biden. Biden argued in response that Trump was ALREADY like Herbert Hoover because of the jobs lost during covid.\n\nThis is, of course, a false claim. But the narrative is everywhere: \"Trump will oversee a crash in America similar to 1929.\"\n\nConsider for a moment how many different elements of the US economy today are misrepresented by rigged stats. Biden has suppressed inflation stats like CPI by dumping strategic oil reserves onto the market. His employment stats are a complete circus with almost every job \"created\" going to illegal immigrants, artificially pumping up BLS numbers. Biden has created false growth in American manufacturing by subsidizing green energy companies with tax dollars. The media seems intent to ignore the national debt issue, with interest payments amassing over $1 trillion every three months. Finally, the border surge continues unabated (except for a 74% decrease in Texas where they are putting up actual walls and barbed wire).\n\nAnd how about that Ukraine situation? The one which is quickly escalating into wider conflict? My readers know my predictions on this but think about it from Trump's perspective: Biden is leaving behind all the volatile elements of a world war in the making. Trump will be inheriting a cauldron of nitroglycerine.\n\nWhat happens when Biden walks away? All of that economic rigging disappears, and then the real data comes out while Trump is in office. Maybe WWIII kicks off, too. And guess who will be blamed? The fingers will point at Trump, but they will also point at YOU.\n\nThe agenda will be to put conservative and liberty movement principles on trial and paint them as ideals of calamity. Meritocracy, individualism, independence, personal liberty, responsibility and discipline, free markets, private property, everything that makes up the foundations of western civilization is going to be put on the pyre. Giving Trump an easy win against a cognitive deficient like Biden (or any other weak candidate) might be a setup; letting conservatives gain a moment of power only to find they're sitting on the throne of a crumbling castle.\n\nAm I saying don't to vote for Trump? No. At the very least, the act of voting for Trump sends a message that the American people want what Trump is supposed to represent, and they reject what Biden is supposed to represent. The candidates are far less important than the ideals they are meant to embody. What I'm saying is, this election might be extra weird for a reason - the fact that Trump is being elevated as the clear choice is suspicious.\n\nAt the very least there will be organized leftist riots in major cities across the US. As we witnessed in France, the political left has no intention of giving up power and they will do anything to keep it, including burn down the neighborhood. More reserved liberals will join forces with the most extreme socialist activist groups in order to win at any cost. Trump's presence in the Oval Office would be the perfect trigger for an endless parade of DEI clowns and Antifa freaks creating as much pandemonium as possible.\n\nI'm not talking about the false left/right paradigm. The false left/right paradigm is irrelevant when it comes to the root problem, which is the preponderance of patriot action or apathy. If the American people in large numbers stood up tomorrow and all at once decided we were going to shut down the leftists, boot out the globalists and take the government back, we would succeed and there's nothing anyone could do to stop us. We're the largest armed population in the world and by extension the largest army in the world by far.\n\nIt's up to us, not Trump, to determine the course of our nation's future. And if he (or any other political leader) fails to live up to our standards, then at that point we'll have to do the ugly thing that everyone knows is necessary but no one wants to be responsible for. Just remember that we're going to be painted as bad guys, not freedom fighters, when we take that step.", "source": {"uri": "noqreport.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "NOQ Report - News, Opinions, and Questions for Conservatives and Christians"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Herbert_Hoover", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Herbert Hoover"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dementia", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Dementia"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Biden", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conservative_Party_(UK)", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Conservative Party (UK)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_National_Committee", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Democratic National Committee"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Democratic Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proxy_war", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Proxy war"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Globalism", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Globalism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oval_Office", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Oval Office"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geopolitics", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Geopolitics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Horse_racing", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Horse racing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patriotism", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Patriotism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emperor_of_Japan", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Emperor of Japan"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conservatism", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Conservatism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electoral_fraud", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Electoral fraud"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_House", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "White House"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Left-wing_politics", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Left-wing politics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vaccine_passports_during_the_COVID-19_pandemic", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Vaccine passports during the COVID-19 pandemic"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fox_Business", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Fox Business"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Reserve", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Federal Reserve"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anthony_S._Fauci", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Anthony S.

Vance of Ohio, and Tom Cotton of Arkansas, as well as North Dakota Governor Doug Burgum, New York Representative Elise Stefanik and former presidential candidate Vivek Ramaswamy.\n\nTrump told Fox News' Sean Hannity on Monday that his choice \"will be very, very good,\" and that two criteria he will be looking for would be whether they \"can do a fantastic job as president\" and whether they would be someone that \"helps to get re-elected.\"", "source": {"uri": "sacbee.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Sacramento Bee"}, "authors": [{"uri": "flynn_nicholls@sacbee.com", "name": "Flynn Nicholls", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republican_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Republican Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Florida_Senate", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Florida Senate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Senate", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "United States Senate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump_Jr.", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump Jr."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newsweek", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Newsweek"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marco_Rubio", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Marco Rubio"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vice_President_of_the_United_States", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Vice President of the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Impeachment", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Impeachment"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2024_United_States_presidential_election", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "2024 United States presidential election"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Second_impeachment_of_Donald_Trump", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Second impeachment of Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Make_America_Great_Again", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Make America Great Again"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_(state)", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "New York (state)"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fiscal_conservatism", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Fiscal conservatism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tea_Party_movement", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Tea Party movement"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vivek_Ramaswamy", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Vivek Ramaswamy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fox_News", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Fox News"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elise_Stefanik", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Elise Stefanik"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doug_Burgum", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Doug Burgum"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/J._D._Vance", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "J.

All the media attention is going to Biden's flagging mental acuity following his abysmal debate performance.\n\nAlthough we may not learn who Trump's VP will be for certain until the convention, his son, Donald Trump Jr., made clear who he wants to see as Trump's running mate in a recent episode of his podcast \"Triggered.\"\n\nIf we're talking the VP stakes, what are you guys thinking right now?

That will definitely spark conversation about the VP stakes.\n\nJr. added:\n\nI have no inside information, obviously. If I did, I probably wouldn't tell you anyway.\n\nIt doesn't sound as much like Jr. was dropping a hint as to who will be Trump's VP, but rather who he personally thinks would be the best person for the job.\n\nAs I wrote previously, of the current options being named, I personally believe Vance would be the ideal VP for the reasons I listed in the previous piece.\n\nIt's unclear whether Trump will pick a senator or steer clear of doing that; however, each of the candidates named has their pros and cons.

This development has led many to speculate that Carson, a qualified pediatric neurosurgeon and former presidential candidate, could be Trump's pick for the number two spot on the ticket.\n\nWhile some Trump supporters have expressed skepticism about Carson's potential as a running mate, others have warmed up to the idea, citing his conservative credentials and appeal to minority voters. As a Black Christian from Detroit, Carson may be able to attract support from communities of color, a demographic that Trump has been working hard to win over.\n\nHowever, there are those who believe that other options, such as J.D. Vance or Tim Scott, might add more to the ticket electorally. Despite this, many Trump supporters have made it clear that they will respect the president's decision, regardless of who he ultimately chooses.\n\nIt's worth noting that Carson has faced controversy in the past for comments he made during his 2016 presidential campaign. He once said that Obamacare was the \"worst thing that has happened in this nation since slavery,\" and that he would not agree with a Muslim person being elected as president.\n\nDespite these comments, Carson has remained a loyal supporter of President Trump, and his inclusion on the VP shortlist is a testament to his dedication to the MAGA movement. As a member of Trump's cabinet, Carson was known for his work on housing and urban development, and his experience in the medical field could be a valuable asset in addressing the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nAs the 2024 election approaches, the vice-presidential pick will be a crucial decision for the Trump campaign. With the Democratic ticket likely to be led by President Joe Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris, the Republican nominee will need a strong running mate to counter their appeal.\n\nWhether or not Carson ultimately becomes Trump's VP pick, one thing is clear: the president is keeping his options open and considering a wide range of candidates. As the rumors continue to swirl, Trump supporters can rest assured that the president will make the best decision for the future of the country.\n\nIn the end, the choice of a running mate is a deeply personal one for any presidential candidate. It requires a careful balancing act between political considerations, personal chemistry, and the need to appeal to a broad swath of the electorate. As Trump weighs his options, he will undoubtedly be looking for someone who can help him secure a second term in the White House.", "source": {"uri": "thebeltwayreport.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Beltway Report"}, "authors": [{"uri": "jack_crane@thebeltwayreport.com", "name": "Jack Crane", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ben_Carson", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Ben Carson"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vice_President_of_the_United_States", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Vice President of the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Truth_Social", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Truth Social"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Department_of_Housing_and_Urban_Development", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States Department of Housing and Urban Development"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Running_mate", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Running mate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_media", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Social media"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Gateway_Pundit", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "The Gateway Pundit"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Affordable_Care_Act", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Affordable Care Act"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump_2016_presidential_campaign", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump 2016 presidential campaign"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muslims", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Muslims"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/J._D._Vance", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "J.

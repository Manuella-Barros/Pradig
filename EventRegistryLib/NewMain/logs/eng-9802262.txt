It exists far beyond Zamzam camp, and it is a direct consequence of the actions of the warring parties.\n\nThe Sudanese Armed Forces are obstructing aid delivery into Darfur, including by shutting the Adre crossing, the most direct route to deliver assistance at scale.\n\nThe Rapid Support Forces' ongoing assault on Darfur has forced thousands to flee and created the conditions for starvation to spread. It does not need to be this way. The warring parties and those with influence can take immediate action to prevent further suffering.\n\nFirst, we call on the warring parties to comply with their obligations under international humanitarian law and allow and facilitate rapid and unimpeded humanitarian access. This includes opening the Adre crossing, lifting bureaucratic obstacles and taking measures to protect aid workers, so they can deliver food to starving communities.\n\nSecond, there is no military solution to this crisis.

Some of the most devastating violence and displacement has been in the country's western provinces of North Darfur and Darfur.\n\nA July report on hunger conditions released by the The Integrated Food Security Phase Classification, or IPC, found it likely that parts of North Darfur -- especially the Zamzam camp -- are experiencing \"the worst form of hunger\" known as IPC Phase 5. The IPC said the famine conditions in Zamzam camp were fueled by the conflict and \"severely restricted humanitarian access.\"\n\nAround 320,000 people are believed to have been displaced in Al Fasher, the capital of North Darfur, since mid-April, according to the IPC, at least 150,000 of whom are believed to have moved to Zamzam camp by May to find the necessities of life. The population in that camp has expanded to more than half a million in a few weeks.\n\n\"The humanitarian needs are reaching epic proportions in the region, as hundreds of thousands of civilians remain in harm's way and famine has recently been confirmed in a displacement site,\" UNHCR said in a brief on the flooding situation.\n\nHeavy seasonal rains have created rising floodwaters in parts of Sudan this week, and forecasts predict more storms in the coming days.\n\nSudanese local media reported on Wednesday that 17 people died in the northern city of Abu Hamad due to the floods, though authorities have yet to release an official death toll for casualties throughout the country.\n\nAn emergency team with the Sudanese Red Crescent concluded that 3,000 homes were destroyed in Abu Hamad.\n\nThe Darfur Network for Human Rights said the city saw steady, heavy rain for more than 10 hours.\n\n\"The situation requires urgent government intervention to provide shelter and food for those affected, and supporting thousands of displaced people who have taken refuge in the city to escape war zones. The situation calls for community solidarity and urgent assistance to confront this disaster,\" the group said on X, formerly Twitter.\n\nSudan's national weather service on Wednesday released a flash flood warning valid until Aug. 13 for heavy rains and thunderstorms in states including Khartoum, Gezeira and North Darfur.\n\nCopyright 2024 The Associated Press.

The international community cannot allow the people of Sudan to be used as a political bargaining chip.\n\nThe UAE calls on the Security Council to utilize all the tools at its disposal to address the catastrophic situation in Sudan. This includes considering, if necessary, authorising UN humanitarian agencies to reach people in need across the country, through both cross-line and cross-border routes.\n\nThe Council's decisive action can be critical in coordinating international efforts to bring in the aid necessary to stop this famine through neighbouring countries.\n\nThe UAE once again reiterates its call on the warring parties to agree to an immediate and permanent ceasefire and to prioritise human life over military objectives, allow for the unhindered, safe, rapid, and sustained passage of humanitarian assistance across the country, and engage in peace talks in good faith towards a civilian-led transition.\n\nTo that end, the UAE appreciates the efforts of the United States in organising the upcoming ceasefire talks in Geneva and those of the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia and Switzerland for co-hosting.\n\nThe UAE will continue to support all ongoing diplomatic efforts to reach a peaceful resolution to this conflict.\n\nThe UAE remains committed as a long-standing humanitarian partner in Sudan.\n\nThe UAE allocated USD 70 million to address the urgent humanitarian needs in Sudan, through UN agencies and humanitarian organisations, and USD 30 million to regional countries to support regional Sudanese refugees in neighbouring countries of Sudan.\n\nSudan has been witnessing deadly clashes between the SAF and the RSF since April 15, 2023, which have killed 15,550 people and displaced 8.8 million others so far, according to the latest estimates by the UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs.\n\nSudan, located at the crossroads of Sub-Saharan Africa and the Middle East, bordering the Red Sea is facing extreme levels of food insecurity with 18 million people -- 37% of the population -- experiencing severe levels of acute food insecurity. Every day, millions of mothers and fathers are having to make impossible choices to feed their families, often going days without any food.\n\nChildren are at particular risk in Sudan.

The western provinces, including North Darfur and Darfur, have witnessed the worst violence and displacement. A July report by the Integrated Food Security Phase Classification (IPC) confirmed that parts of North Darfur, particularly Zamzam camp, are experiencing 'the worst form of hunger' known as IPC Phase 5. The report pointed to conflict and restricted humanitarian access as major contributors. In Al Fasher alone, 320,000 people have been displaced since mid-April, with about 150,000 moving to Zamzam camp, now hosting over half a million people.\n\nThe UNHCR emphasized the growing humanitarian needs, stating that the region's plight has reached epic proportions. Heavy seasonal rains and rising floodwaters continue to devastate parts of Sudan, with more storms forecasted.

Copy may not be in its final form.\n\nAMY GOODMAN: This is Democracy Now!, democracynow.org. I'm Amy Goodman.\n\nWe turn now to Sudan, where senior United Nations officials are calling on the global community to do more to get humanitarian aid into Sudan after a famine was declared in at least one part of the Darfur region following 15 months of war between the Sudanese military and the Rapid Support Forces. Officials say more than a dozen more areas are at risk of famine as fighting impedes aid. Edem Wosornu of the Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs addressed the U.N. Security Council Tuesday.\n\nEDEM WOSORNU: When famine happens, it means we are too late. It means we did not do enough. It means we, the international community, have failed. This is an entirely man-made crisis and a shameful stain on our collective conscience.\n\nAMY GOODMAN: For more, we're joined by Sudanese activist Marine Alneel. She's now in Nairobi, Kenya, usually based in Khartoum, in Sudan.\n\nMarine, thanks for joining us again. Explain how serious the situation is in Sudan right now and what you think needs to happen to address this issue of famine and war.\n\nMARINE ALNEEL: Thank you, Amy.\n\nI think the situation, what we know about it, is that we do not know the gravity of the situation. When Edem was addressing the Security Council, one of the things she mentioned is that 26 million people are facing acute hunger, and compared that to three times the population of New York. And this has been a pattern of what is needed to humanize us as Sudanese again in international media. It's become synonymous with Sudan, words like \"war\" and \"famine.\" And it's been difficult to get the attention of the international community and the media when speaking about these catastrophes in Sudan. So, we are not sure actually how many people are impacted by this famine.\n\nAnd I will take us back to our history. It is not known, in the 70 years of our almost 70 years of our independence, how many famines happened. It's anywhere between five to 17 famines. And this is a continuous pattern in Sudan that catastrophes are always underreported, they're underdocumented.\n\nAnd bear in mind, when we say that 26 million people are facing this famine, we're not counting the refugees who are also starving in camps in neighboring countries. We are not counting the refugees who do not have refugee status but are in different legal status in different places or the internally displaced people who are also not reported as internally displaced because they went from an active conflict zone and now they're staying with family in different areas.\n\nBut everyone in Sudan is strained financially, and even just the means of sustenance that we're used to in areas outside of Khartoum, outside of the capital city, such as just having your own -- growing your own crops, is also endangered by the war and endangered by the climate. We have entered the rainy season. Just last week, we've had torrential rains in the Northern state. It's been reported that it's killed 17 people. But when you speak to people who are still there in the Northern state, you hear that maybe one person has heard of 17 deaths and attended 17 funerals.\n\nSo, we're seeing the pattern of things being underreported when it comes to the hunger that people are facing, when it comes to the displacement that people are facing, when it comes to the conflict-related sexual violence that people are facing -- this is also something that's been reported from Khartoum, that is becoming a dire situation for women and girls there.\n\nAnd some of the reasons why we're not able to address the situation have to do with how it's being addressed. So, for example, the aid that is coming through U.N. agencies and their partners, these agencies are cooperating and listening to the Sudanese Armed Forces, although since the coup of 2021, this is not a legitimate government of Sudan. We've been suspended from the AU after the coup, and the situation has not been rectified. We're still, quote-unquote, \"governed\" by this military government. But somehow, for some reason, the U.N. still insists that if the SAF, the Sudanese Armed Forces, refuses for things to cross from their controlled areas to RSF-controlled areas, then we will not do that.\n\nAnd we've been seeing also that pattern of legitimizing the government happening on the pressures that are also happening on the civil society, where even the civil society that is working cross-RSF- and SAF-controlled areas, that the U.N. agencies and other agencies that are supporting with the aid just lift their hands from the situation, so that they don't get into conflict or are considered biased to the RSF or the SAF. This has been detrimental to the Sudanese people, that we are still waiting for the SAF or the RSF to figure out the situation with each other and figure out the situation of how we're going to solve the issues that the people are facing, whether it's the hunger or the violence that is being faced. And I don't think that will ever happen. If we keep waiting for the RSF and SAF to figure out the situation, then this will be just a catastrophe, a continuing catastrophe, for the Sudanese people.\n\nAMY GOODMAN: And, Marine Alneel, the talks that are scheduled between the two sides in Geneva that the U.S. officials would mediate, set for August 14th, do you hold out hope for this Geneva meeting?\n\nMARINE ALNEEL: I personally do not hold any hope for this meeting. I think it's been a waste of our time and efforts as Sudanese people to keep focusing on RSF and SAF and their leaders. It is not news that the paramilitary forces, the Rapid Support Forces, that were created by the Sudanese government to conduct, commit the genocide of Darfur, that they're continuing to commit that in different regions of the country. That is not news. And it is not news that the SAF, that the army that was established by the colonial forces, continues to be aligned to other forces. It's not even clear right now --\n\nAMY GOODMAN: Marine, we just have 30 seconds. What do you think needs to happen?\n\nMARINE ALNEEL: I think what needs to happen is for the international community to pay attention to the Sudanese people and not the two warring parties. It is important to understand that what matters now is for people to eat, for people to live safely, and that is not going to happen through the work and effort of the same ones who are killing us and causing us to starve.\n\nAMY GOODMAN: Marine Alneel, I want to thank you so much for being with us, Sudanese activist, joining us from Nairobi, Kenya.\n\nThat does it for our show.

A nation already grappling with decades of conflict, political instability, and economic hardship now faces a humanitarian crisis of unprecedented proportions. As the situation worsens, a critical question emerges: is this famine the result of deliberate actions, or is it an unfortunate confluence of circumstances?\n\nThe factors contributing to the famine in Sudan are complex and intertwined. On the one hand, the ongoing conflict between the Sudanese Armed Forces (SAF) and the Rapid Support Forces (RSF) has devastated the country, displacing millions and disrupting essential services. Hospitals, schools, and infrastructure have been reduced to rubble, leaving civilians vulnerable and isolated.\n\nThe United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA) reports that over four million people have been internally displaced, while hundreds of thousands have fled to neighbouring countries. These populations are living in dire conditions, with limited access to food, water, and healthcare.\n\nMoreover, the conflict has severely impacted agricultural production. Farmers have been unable to cultivate their land, leading to a sharp decline in food availability. The World Food Programme (WFP) has warned of an impending food crisis, with millions facing acute hunger.\n\nClimate change has further exacerbated the situation. Sudan is already highly vulnerable to climate shocks, experiencing recurrent droughts and floods. Changing climate patterns have disrupted agricultural livelihoods, reduced crop yields, and driven up food prices.\n\nWhile the combination of conflict, displacement, and climate change has created fertile ground for famine, allegations of deliberate targeting of civilians and obstruction of humanitarian aid have raised concerns about the role of human intent in the crisis.\n\nHuman Rights Watch has documented numerous attacks on civilians, including hospitals, schools, and residential areas. These attacks have resulted in mass casualties and further displacement, worsening the humanitarian crisis.\n\nAdditionally, there have been reports of deliberate obstruction of humanitarian aid convoys. Aid workers have encountered difficulties accessing affected areas, hindering the delivery of life-saving assistance. Such actions could be seen as a deliberate attempt to exacerbate the suffering of the population.\n\nAmgad Fareid Eltayeb, Executive Director of the Khartoum-based Fikra for Studies and Development, stated, \"Sudan is experiencing a deliberate process of starvation by the Rapid Support Forces,\" which he claims are \"intentionally depriving civilians of access to essential sustenance.\"\n\nOn the other hand, some argue that the famine is primarily the result of a complex interplay of factors, with no clear evidence of a deliberate plan to starve the population. They point out that the conflict itself has created a chaotic environment where humanitarian access is extremely challenging, regardless of intent.\n\nIrrespective of the underlying causes, the human cost of the famine is immeasurable. Millions of people are on the brink of starvation, with children being the most vulnerable. Malnutrition rates are soaring, leading to increased mortality and morbidity.\n\nAddressing the famine in Sudan requires a multi-faceted approach. Immediate humanitarian assistance is crucial to save lives and prevent further suffering.\n\nImmediate Relief and Stabilisation\n\nHumanitarian organisations must ensure safe access to those in need, including protection for aid workers and the removal of bureaucratic hurdles. Scaling up food aid distribution, prioritising supplementary feeding programmes for children, pregnant women, and lactating mothers, and expanding access to essential healthcare services such as immunisation and disease prevention are critical. Providing clean water, sanitation facilities, and promoting hygiene are also vital to prevent the spread of waterborne diseases.\n\nEstablishing a durable ceasefire and promoting peace negotiations are crucial for enabling humanitarian aid and recovery efforts. Strengthening governance structures and ensuring accountability will ensure that resources are used transparently. Economic recovery, through job creation, investment, and trade facilitation, will improve livelihoods and food security. Investing in agricultural programmes will boost food production and reduce reliance on aid.\n\nSocial protection programmes, early warning systems for climate hazards, and climate-resilient agriculture, water management, and disaster risk reduction are essential for coping with shocks and building resilience in vulnerable populations. Investing in education and nutrition programmes for children is also crucial for long-term human development and food security.\n\nTo meet Sudan's growing humanitarian needs, it is essential to mobilise additional funding, improve coordination among agencies, governments, and local organisations, and raise awareness about the crisis while advocating for political solutions to ensure sustained support.\n\nThe success of these strategies in Sudan depends on a comprehensive approach that addresses both immediate needs and long-term development challenges. Local communities and organisations are crucial to ensuring relevance and sustainability. The international community must support the Sudanese people by providing financial assistance, deploying peacekeeping forces, and imposing targeted sanctions on those responsible for violence.\n\nUltimately, the responsibility to end the suffering in Sudan lies with the Sudanese people themselves. A peaceful and inclusive political process is essential for rebuilding the country and creating a future where all citizens can live in dignity and prosperity.", "source": {"uri": "africanleadershipmagazine.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "African Leadership Magazine"}, "authors": [{"uri": "blossom_ukoha@africanleadershipmagazine.co.uk", "name": "Blossom Ukoha", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rapid_Support_Forces", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Rapid Support Forces"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sudanese_Armed_Forces", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Sudanese Armed Forces"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Humanitarian_aid", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Humanitarian aid"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Famine", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Famine"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sudan", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Sudan"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Sudan"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Nations_Office_for_the_Coordination_of_Humanitarian_Affairs", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Humanitarian_crisis", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Humanitarian crisis"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Climate_change", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Climate change"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agriculture", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Agriculture"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Forced_displacement", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Forced displacement"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Starvation", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Starvation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internally_displaced_person", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Internally displaced person"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Food_Programme", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "World Food Programme"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hunger", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Hunger"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israeli\u2013Palestinian_conflict", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Israeli\u2013Palestinian conflict"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Failed_state", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Failed state"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health_care", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Health care"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Food_prices", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Food prices"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crop_yield", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Crop yield"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_Rights_Watch", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Human Rights Watch"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drought", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Drought"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flood", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Flood"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Philanthropy", "label": "dmoz/Society/Philanthropy", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Philanthropy/International_Aid_and_Development", "label": "dmoz/Society/Philanthropy/International Aid and Development", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Poverty", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Poverty", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Labor", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Labor", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 89}], "image": "https://www.africanleadershipmagazine.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/Famine-in-Sudan-Spreads-Deliberate-or-Fortuitous.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9802262", "eventUri": "eng-9802262", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.3098039215686275, "wgt": 166, "relevance": 1}

The camp \"requires an urgent humanitarian response as an estimated one child is dying every two hours,\" international organisation warned.\n\nA one-year-and-eight-month-old child died of malnutrition in Delling in South Kordofan on Sunday.\n\nThe death of the infant represents a defeat for the initiative Zero Child Deaths from Malnutrition in Delling, launched in the town two weeks ago, Hayat Osman, a member of the initiative, told Radio Dabanga on Tuesday.\n\n\"We succeeded in the first week to provide meals to children with the help of charitable people, but we failed to collect enough funds for the second week.\"\n\nShe said that more than 130 severely malnourished children children are currently being treated in health centres and hospitals, and appealed to aid organisations and philanthropists to support the initiative's soup kitchen to save the lives of the children in Delling.\n\nThe #StandWithSudan campaign reported in the end of July that mothers are feeding their children tree leaves in the town.\n\nDelling in the north of the Nuba Mountains in South Kordofan is \"under a total siege\", as the army controls the town, the Sudan People's Liberation Movement-North under the leadership of Abdelaziz El Hilu (SPLM-N El Hilu) controls the road between Delling and the state capital Kadugli, and the RSF control areas on the road linking Delling with the North Kordofan capital of El Obeid.\n\nHalf of the population\n\nEdem Wosornu, director of Operations and Advocacy at the UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs, said in her statement to the UN Security Council session on Sudan on Tuesday that \"The humanitarian situation in Sudan remains an absolute catastrophe. A staggering 26 million people are in acute hunger\".\n\nShe said that obstructions to the provision of aid are widespread. \"In just one example, three trucks carrying therapeutic food have been blocked by the Rapid Support Forces for over a month in Kabkabiya, west of El Fasher - depriving malnourished children in Zamzam camp of assistance they desperately need to survive.\n\n'Assistance delayed is assistance denied for the many Sudanese civilians who are literally dying of hunger during the time it takes for clearances to come through, permits to be granted, and floodwaters to subside' - Edem Wosornu\n\n\"The recent escalation in Sennar has further cut off the southern route - which used to be our main crossline route for humanitarian aid from Port Sudan to Kordofan and Darfur.\n\n\"Meanwhile, access via the northern route - through Ed Debba - has been intermittent due to active conflict, insecurity, obstruction and delayed permissions.\n\n\"Life-saving supplies in Port Sudan are ready to be loaded and dispatched to Zamzam, including essential medicines, nutritional supplies, water purification tablets and soap. It is crucial that the approvals and security assurances needed are not delayed.\n\n\"Relief supplies for people in Zamzam are also readily available in eastern Chad. But heavy rains have flooded the El Tina crossing - the only cross-border route that we are currently permitted to use between eastern Chad and Darfur after the Sudanese authorities revoked permission for the use of the Adr\u00e9 crossing in February this year. As a result, we simply cannot move the large volume of supplies required to save lives and fight back famine,\" Wosornu stated.\n\n\"Assistance delayed is assistance denied for the many Sudanese civilians who are literally dying of hunger during the time it takes for clearances to come through, permits to be granted, and floodwaters to subside.\n\n\"Meanwhile, the Sudan humanitarian appeal is just 32 per cent funded - having received $874 million out of the $2.7 billion needed,\" she told the UN Security Council members.\n\n'Access blocked'\n\nWFP Assistant Executive Director Stephen Omollo said in his briefing to the UN Security Council on Tuesday that \"All parties to this conflict are failing to meet their obligations and commitments under the international humanitarian law. We know that humanitarian space is shrinking all the time.\n\n\"Expanded access and new supply lines across borders, and across conflict lines, are vital to enable aid agencies to meet the extraordinary needs that exist today. But the obstacles to securing them are immense.\n\n\"Both parties to the conflict are routinely blocking requests for cross-line clearances. This is severely restricting the amount of aid getting through and preventing us from operating at scale. Restrictions imposed on cross-border routes are another major obstacle, preventing agencies from reaching communities in the Darfurs and Kordofans,\" Omollo lamented.\n\nBoth officials reiterated that the conflict must stop, and a ceasefire remains the only sustainable solution that will prevent the further spread of famine.", "source": {"uri": "dabangasudan.org", "dataType": "news", "title":

But there's another horrific war that's gotten so little coverage you could be excused for not knowing anything about it. What we have in mind is the seemingly never-ending, utterly devastating war in Sudan. Think of it as the missing war. And if we don't start paying a lot more attention to it soon -- as in right now -- it's going to be too late.\n\nAfter 15 months of fighting in that country between the Sudanese Armed Forces (SAF) and the paramilitary Rapid Support Forces (RSF), experts in food insecurity estimate that almost 26 million people (no, that is not a misprint!), or more than half of Sudan's population, could suffer from malnutrition by September. Eight and a half million of those human beings could face acute malnutrition. Worse yet, if the war continues on its present path, millions will die of hunger and disease in just the coming months (and few people in our world may even notice).\n\nBy now, those warring armies have driven Sudan to the brink of all-out famine, partly by displacing more than a fifth of the population from their homes, livelihoods, and farms, while preventing the delivery of food to the places most in need. And you undoubtedly won't be surprised to learn that, with their foreign-policy eyes focused on Gaza and Ukraine, our country's government and others around the world have paid remarkably little attention to the growing crisis in Sudan, making at best only half-hearted (quarter-hearted?) gestures toward helping negotiate a cease-fire between the SAF and RSF, while contributing only a small fraction of the aid Sudan needs to head off a famine of historic magnitude.\n\nIn late June, the U.N.-backed Integrated Food Security Phase Classification (IPC) system, which monitors regions at risk of starvation, reported \"a stark and rapid deterioration of the food security situation\" in Sudan. It noted that the number of people suffering hunger severe enough to qualify, in IPC terms, as Phase 3 (\"Crisis\") or Phase 4 (\"Emergency\") has ballooned 45% since the end of last year. In December 2023, no Sudanese had yet made it to Phase 5 (\"Catastrophe\"), a condition characteristic of famines. Now, more than three-quarters of a million people are in that final phase of starving to death. Indeed, if the conflict continues to escalate, large parts of Sudan may spiral into full-blown famine, a state that exists, according to the IPC, when at least 20% of an area's population is suffering Phase-5 hunger.\n\nUntil recently, the worst conflict and hunger were concentrated in western Sudan and around Khartoum, the country's capital. Now, however, they've spread to the east and south as well. Worse yet, the war in Sudan has by now displaced an astounding 10 million people from their homes, more than four million of them children -- a figure that looks like but isn't a misprint. Many have had to move multiple times and two million Sudanese have taken refuge in neighboring countries. Worse yet, with so many people forced off their land and away from their workplaces, the capacity of farmers to till the soil and other kinds of workers to hold down a paycheck and so buy food for their families has been severely disrupted.\n\nNot surprisingly, 15 months of brutal war have played havoc with crop production. Cereal grain harvests in 2023 were far smaller than in previous years and stocks of grain (which typically supply 80% of Sudanese caloric intake) have already been fully consumed, with months to go before the next harvest, a stretch of time known, even in good years, as the \"lean season.\" And with war raging, anything but a bumper crop is expected this year. Indeed, just as planting season got underway, fierce fighting spilled over into wheat-growing Gezira, one of Sudan's 18 \"states\" and renowned as the nation's breadbasket.\n\nSudan desperately needs food aid and it's simply not getting enough. The U.N. High Commission for Refugees has received less than 20% of the funds necessary to help feed the Sudanese this year and has had to \"drastically cut\" food rations. As Tjada D'Oyen McKenna, head of the aid nonprofit Mercy Corps, told the New York Times, \"World leaders continue to go through the motions, expressing concern over Sudan's crisis. Yet they've failed to rise to the occasion.\"\n\nWorse yet, in the swirling chaos, even the food aid that does make it to Sudan is largely failing to reach starving populations in anything approaching adequate quantities -- and when available, it's usually unaffordable. Famished people are reportedly boiling leaves, as well as eating grass, peanut shells, and even dirt.\n\nFor many families, the one thing keeping starvation at bay may be a local free soup kitchen. In a report published in May, Timmo Gaasbeek of the Netherlands Institute of International Relations noted, \"Sudan has a long tradition of sharing food. After the war broke out and hunger spread, community-level initiatives for sharing food sprang up across the country. These 'soup kitchen' initiatives are often informal but can be very well organized.\"\n\nGaasbeek warned, however, that soup kitchens can fill only so many gaping holes in a system shattered by wartime destruction, displacement, and crop failure. His institute estimates that at current rates of food sharing, 2.5 million people could die of hunger and disease by the time crops are harvested in September. In other words, a shocking 10-20% of the Sudanese in the hardest-hit areas could die -- mortality rates similar to ones suffered during horrendous famines in parts of Nigeria in 1969, Ethiopia in 1984, and Somalia in 1992.", "source": {"uri": "thenation.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Nation"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rapid_Support_Forces",

Some of the most devastating violence and displacement has been in the country's western provinces of North Darfur and Darfur.\n\nA July report on hunger conditions released by the The Integrated Food Security Phase Classification, or IPC, found it likely that parts of North Darfur -- especially the Zamzam camp -- are experiencing \"the worst form of hunger\" known as IPC Phase 5. The IPC said the famine conditions in Zamzam camp were fueled by the conflict and \"severely restricted humanitarian access.\"\n\nAround 320,000 people are believed to have been displaced in Al Fasher, the capital of North Darfur, since mid-April, according to the IPC, at least 150,000 of whom are believed to have moved to Zamzam camp by May to find the necessities of life. The population in that camp has expanded to more than half a million in a few weeks.\n\n\"The humanitarian needs are reaching epic proportions in the region, as hundreds of thousands of civilians remain in harm's way and famine has recently been confirmed in a displacement site,\" UNHCR said in a brief on the flooding situation.\n\nHeavy seasonal rains have created rising floodwaters in parts of Sudan this week, and forecasts predict more storms in the coming days.\n\nSudanese local media reported on Wednesday that 17 people died in the northern city of Abu Hamad due to the floods, though authorities have yet to release an official death toll for casualties throughout the country.\n\nAn emergency team with the Sudanese Red Crescent concluded that 3,000 homes were destroyed in Abu Hamad.\n\nThe Darfur Network for Human Rights said the city saw steady, heavy rain for more than 10 hours.\n\n\"The situation requires urgent government intervention to provide shelter and food for those affected, and supporting thousands of displaced people who have taken refuge in the city to escape war zones. The situation calls for community solidarity and urgent assistance to confront this disaster,\" the group said on the platform X.\n\nSudan's national weather service on Wednesday released a flash flood warning valid until Aug. 13 for heavy rains and thunderstorms in states including Khartoum, Gezeira and North Darfur.", "source": {"uri": "tribtown.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Tribune"}, "authors": [{"uri": "associated_press@tribtown.com", "name": "Associated Press", "type": "author", "isAgency": true}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Famine", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Famine"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Nations", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "United Nations"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_Darfur", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "North Darfur"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "North Darfur"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Sudan"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sudan", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Sudan"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Sudan"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rapid_Support_Forces", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Rapid Support Forces"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internally_displaced_person", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Internally displaced person"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Forced_displacement", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Forced displacement"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Humanitarian_crisis", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Humanitarian crisis"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Humanitarian_aid", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Humanitarian aid"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Associated_Press", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Associated Press"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paramilitary", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Paramilitary"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flood", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Flood"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Refugee", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Refugee"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Integrated_Food_Security_Phase_Classification", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Integrated Food Security Phase Classification"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Province", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Province"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Al-Fashir", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Al-Fashir"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Al-Fashir"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Sudan"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Darfur", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Darfur"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Darfur"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Sudan"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sudanese_Red_Crescent", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Sudanese Red Crescent"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Nations_High_Commissioner_for_Refugees", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flash_flood", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Flash flood"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Khartoum", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Khartoum"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Khartoum"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Sudan"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Camps", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Camps", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Camps/North_America", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Camps/North America", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Territorial_Disputes", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Territorial Disputes", "wgt": 18}, {"uri": "dmoz/Science/Earth_Sciences/Natural_Disasters_and_Hazards", "label": "dmoz/Science/Earth Sciences/Natural Disasters and Hazards", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Philanthropy/Refugees", "label": "dmoz/Society/Philanthropy/Refugees", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 63}], "image": "https://tribtown.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/preview-757.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9802262", "eventUri": "eng-9802262", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-08-13", "textStart": 2657, "textEnd": 2664}], "sentiment": -0.3568627450980392, "wgt": 460919310, "relevance": 2}

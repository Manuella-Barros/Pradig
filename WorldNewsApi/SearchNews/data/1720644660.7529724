Since The Post first reported on the scam earlier this year, they have apparently ramped up their harrowing efforts to get hit, according to Rockaway residents. Dash camera video shared with The Post shows what appears to be a migrant launching himself in front of a moving vehicle traveling in the right lane on Flatbush Avenue South, causing the driver to swerve into the left lane and narrowly avoid hitting him. \u201cAll of the sudden, I see a man in front of my car with eyes wide open, screaming, staring at me in the eye. . . . He was trying to get me to run him over,\u201d said the 37-year-old driver, who only gave the name Christina. \u201cIf I was distracted for one split second, or looking down, or if someone was in the left lane, my life would be over . . . It\u2019s just sickening.\u201d She said the incident occurred on May 6 just before 7:30 a.m. as she drove to work in Bensonhurst. Christina, who lives in Rockaway Beach, suspects the man lived at the emergency migrant shelter at nearby Floyd Bennett Field. At least three other Rockaway Beach residents have almost become victims to the twisted trick, according to posts in an area Facebook group. \u201cIt happened to me . . . in the dark early morning,\u201d another resident wrote in response to Christina\u2019s post. \u201cSomeone did this to me outside the 7/11 on Flatbush about three weeks ago,\u201d another responded. In a separate post on May 6, another woman wrote that \u201ca man jumped in front of my daughter\u2019s car this morning\u201d on Flatbush Avenue. \u201cShe was able to brake in time and didn\u2019t hit him.\u201d In January, John B., a retired NYPD cop from Bergen Beach, told The Post that details of the apparent extortion scheme were discussed by concerned residents and 63rd Precinct cops. \u201cThey\u2019re scaring people saying, \u2018You just hit me, and I\u2019m going to report it if you don\u2019t give me the money,\u2019\u201d he explained. The NYPD said no reports about such incidents have been filed with the department.", "summary": "\u201cAll of the sudden, I see a man in front of my car with eyes wide open, screaming, staring at me ...

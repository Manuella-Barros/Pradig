The team's struggle with indecisiveness and Kohli's subdued performance reflect the larger batting unit's woes. Rohit Sharma's confident approach stands out, while a lineup adjustment may be in order to bolster the spin attack against Sri Lankan bowlers.The onus will be on Indian batters, particularly the talismanic Virat Kohli, to follow the path laid down by skipper Rohit Sharma and tactfully counter the spin challenge in the third and final ODI here on Wednesday to avoid their first series defeat to Sri Lanka in 27 years. It's certainly not the start Gautam Gambhir, a stickler for victories, would want in his first ODI assignment as the team's head coach.\n\nIndia's previous bilateral ODI series defeat against the Islanders came in 1997. The Arjuna Ranatunga-led Lankans then inflicted a 0-3 hammering on Sachin Tendulkar and his men.\n\nSince then, India and Sri Lanka have played 11 bilateral ODI rubbers home and away, with the 'Men in Blue' emerging on the right side of the result in all of them.\n\nIndia will not be able to win the current three-match series after succumbing to the hosts by 32 runs in the second ODI, and conceding a tie in the first game.\n\nThis position of discomfort is brought upon the team by the batsmen, who seemed to have been plagued by indecisiveness on a RPSC pitch that offered plenty of turn to the spinners.\n\nCuriously, none reflected that brittleness more than star batter Kohli. He has made 38 runs in two matches, but more than the volume of runs, the manner of his dismissals evoked greater concern.\n\nKohli looked subdued in the middle, particularly after the fiery starts given by Rohit. Kohli just needed to build on it.\n\nBut the master batter in him remained dormant as he pottered around the leg-spin of Wanindu Hasaranga in the first match and of six-wicket man Jeffrey Vandersay in the next, before eventually getting consumed by them.\n\nHe looked a far cry from the dominant batsman who once cracked four hundreds at this very same venue. Perhaps, Kohli should direct his mind to happier times than allowing it to be fettered by the demons of the present.\n\nA flowing Kohli is imperative for India's healthy run in the middle overs, be it while chasing or setting a target.\n\nBut then his turmoil is a true reflection of the struggle that has gripped the Indian batting unit.\n\nIn Shivam Dube, India have a designated spin-basher, but the left-hander could not even pick a regulation leg-break by Vandersay in the second one-dayer, getting trapped in front of the wicket.\n\nShreyas Iyer and KL Rahul too have lorded over spinners in the past, but here their feet and wrists have been unresponsive against the Lankan slow bowlers.\n\nThey seemed to be going through a temporary memory loss as to how to rotate strike, the most effective weapon to keep spinners in check on tracks such as the ones at the Premadasa.\n\nThey just need to watch the batting of Rohit to find a remedy - not so much in his approach but more in the confidence and planning behind his knocks.\n\nThere is no need to gild the lily while describing Rohit's batting, still his taming of the Lankan bowlers - pace and spin alike - has been exceptional.\n\nOften a 44-ball 64 would contain a few chancy shots, but Rohit's strokes were so well-calculated that they hardly appeared risky. Can his colleagues take a cue?\n\nFrom a combination perspective, the team management might look at the position of Dube, despite a 24-ball 25 in the first match.\n\nUnder the existing conditions, Riyan Parag's spin, either off-spin or leg-spin, might come handier than the honest medium pace of Dube, and the former is an equally good hard-hitter.\n\nFrom their part, the Indian bowlers too should improve their effort in the business end as they failed to apply finishing touches to Lanka after reducing them to 142 for six and 136 for six.", "source": {"uri": "economictimes.indiatimes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Economic Times"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rohit_Sharma", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Rohit Sharma"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spin_bowling", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Spin bowling"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virat_Kohli", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Virat Kohli"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Batting_(cricket)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Batting (cricket)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/One_Day_International", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "One Day International"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sri_Lanka", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Sri Lanka"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Sri Lanka"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/India", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "India"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gautam_Gambhir", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Gautam Gambhir"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Captain_(cricket)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Captain (cricket)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sachin_Tendulkar", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Sachin Tendulkar"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wanindu_Hasaranga", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Wanindu Hasaranga"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jeffrey_Vandersay", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Jeffrey Vandersay"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cricket_pitch", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Cricket pitch"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leg_spin", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Leg spin"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shivam_Dube", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Shivam Dube"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shreyas_Iyer", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Shreyas Iyer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/K._L._Rahul", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "K.

Premadasa Stadium, Colombo. Dube came in at No. 4 on a pitch which was assisting the spinners.\n\nBut the left-handed batter was undone by a brilliant delivery from legspinner Jeffrey Vandersay who pitched the ball outside off-stump and got the ball to spin back and hit Dube's pads in front of his stumps. The umpire had no hesitation in raising the finger as Dube was dismissed for a fourth ball duck.\n\nShivam Dube came in to bat at No. 8 in the first ODI. His batting slot was hugely criticized at that time as experts wanted him to bat higher up the order. Batting at No. 8, Dube had scored 25 off 24 balls and was dismissed on the penultimate ball of the match when India needed just 1 run to win. In the end, the match ended in a thrilling tie.\n\nAlso read: \"Jeffrey Vandersay took 6 wickets\" - Kuldeep Yadav declared inferior to 34-year-old Sri Lankan by ex-India star\n\nWhile speaking on his YouTube channel, Salman Butt reckoned that India needs to re-think its strategy against spin bowling. Butt even suggested that Suryakumar Yadav could have been an option in place of Dube as he was in brilliant form in the T20I series. He also claimed that Suryakumar is a better fielder than Dube and can be more consistent than him.\n\n\"On spinning tracks, India will have to re-think their strategy. Maybe they can have Suryakumar Yadav in the team because I don't think that (Shivam) Dube is better than him in terms of batting and fielding. I don't know how he made it to the ODI side. I am not aware of his domestic stats,\" Butt said\n\n\"Although Suryakumar Yadav's ODI record is not great, but the kind of batting that he is doing, he should have been in the ODI side. He was in form and recently scored runs in Sri Lanka. His captaincy career also started on a brighter note. He is an outstanding fielder as well,\" he added.\n\nThe former Pakistan batter further added that Dube is not a naturally athletic fielder and is quite late off the blocks. He believes that India has some fit and better options than him who are waiting in the queue.\n\n\"Shivam Dube is very late off the blocks in terms of fielding and is not very agile. India has some of the brilliant and fit options in terms of batting. But if someone keeps playing, he will score one or two good innings of 40-50 runs. So, what I've seen of him so far, he has not been very consistent and everyone has seen this. He is somebody who is not on the fitter side and hasn't been consistent,\" Butt claimed.\n\nShivam Dube was a part of India's T20 World Cup 2024-winning team. He played in every match of the tournament, however, he didn't have a great tournament personally. On pace-friendly conditions in the USA, Dube struggled to score runs. As the tournament went to the West Indies, Dube got back his timing and played some crucial innings. His 27 off 16 balls in the final against South Africa proved to be vital in the end.\n\nIn the T20I series against Sri Lanka recently, Dube played just one match and scored 13 runs. With Hardik Pandya not available for the ODI series, Dube was given a chance. Before this series, he had played just one ODI way back in 2019.", "source": {"uri": "cricketaddictor.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "CricketAddictor"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shivam_Dube", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Shivam Dube"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Suryakumar_Yadav", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Suryakumar Yadav"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salman_Butt", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Salman Butt"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spin_bowling", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Spin bowling"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Batting_(cricket)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Batting (cricket)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/One_Day_International", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "One Day International"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/India", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "India"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jeffrey_Vandersay", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Jeffrey Vandersay"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sri_Lanka", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Sri Lanka"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Sri Lanka"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/R._Premadasa_International_Cricket_Stadium", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "R.

Their primary goal is to avert their first series defeat to Sri Lanka in 27 years. This series outcome is particularly crucial for Gautam Gambhir, who is overseeing his first ODI assignment as head coach and is known for his commitment to winning. India's last bilateral ODI series loss to Sri Lanka occurred in 1997, when Arjuna Ranatunga's team inflicted a 0-3 defeat on Sachin Tendulkar's side.\n\nSince that series, India and Sri Lanka have contested 11 bilateral ODI series, with India emerging victorious in each one. However, India's chances of winning the current series are dashed after a 32-run defeat in the second ODI and a tie in the first match.\n\nThe team's current predicament is largely due to the batsmen's inability to handle the spin challenge on the turning R Premadasa pitch. Virat Kohli, in particular, has struggled, managing only 38 runs across two matches. His dismissals, rather than just the runs scored, are more troubling, as they reflect a lack of composure.\n\nKohli appeared subdued, especially after Rohit Sharma's aggressive starts. Instead of building on those foundations, Kohli struggled against the spin of Wanindu Hasaranga in the first match and Jeffrey Vandersay, who took six wickets in the second. Kohli's form stands in stark contrast to his past performances at this venue, where he previously scored four centuries.\n\nFor India to succeed, a fluent Kohli is crucial, whether chasing or setting a target. His struggles are indicative of the broader issues within the Indian batting line-up. Shivam Dube, known for his ability against spin, failed to handle a simple leg-break from Vandersay in the second ODI. Similarly, Shreyas Iyer and KL Rahul, who have historically excelled against spinners, have been ineffective against the Lankan bowlers.\n\nThey need to revisit basic tactics, such as rotating strike, which is essential on such spin-friendly pitches. Observing Rohit Sharma's approach might offer some insights. Rohit's batting, characterised by confidence and meticulous planning, has been exemplary, with his 44-ball 64 in the second ODI being particularly well-executed and calculated, showcasing his ability to neutralise both pace and spin.\n\nIND vs SL Live Streaming Details\n\nAll matches in the India vs Sri Lanka ODI series will be played at the R. Premadasa Stadium in Colombo starting at 2:30 PM (India Time). The matches will be broadcast live on the Sony Sports Network, while live streaming will be available on the Sony LIV website and app.\n\nIND vs SL Pitch Report\n\nThe pitch at the R Premadasa Stadium in Colombo typically favours spinners. In the second ODI, it was particularly evident, as spinners claimed 15 of the 19 wickets. Jeffrey Vandersay delivered a spell of a lifetime, taking 6 wickets and showcasing his exceptional skills.\n\nIND vs SL Weather Report\n\nThird and the last ODI of the series may be disrupted due to rain as the weather on Wednesday is expected to be cloudy and high chances of drizzle during the match hours.\n\nIND vs SL Head to Head\n\nIndia and Sri Lanka have faced each other in 170 One Day Internationals (ODIs). Of these matches, India has secured 99 victories, Sri Lanka has won 58, there has been 2 ties, and 11 matches have concluded without a result.\n\nIND vs SL Probable 11:\n\nWill Riyan Parag get a call for third ODI? Considering team dynamics, the Indian management might reassess Shivam Dube's position despite his 24-ball 25 in the first match. Given the current conditions, Riyan Parag's spin options, whether off-spin or leg-spin, could prove more useful than Dube's medium pace. Additionally, Parag is known for his hard-hitting abilities. Meanwhile, Indian bowlers need to step up their performance in crucial moments, as they failed to finish off the Sri Lankan innings after reducing them to 142 for six and 136 for six.\n\nSri Lanka seems to have struck the right chord against India as they have challenged the T20 World Champions in every aspect of the game. Ending up in a tie in the first ODI and then beating India by 32 runs in the second match must have given them a huge confidence to go for a series win against India.

The 26-year-old leg-spinner dismissed six out of the Indian top seven, finishing his ten-over spell with impressive figures of 6-33.\n\nWith another ODI left to play, India can only level the series now, having played out a tie in the first game. As the Men in Blue look to recover from their recent defeat, a hardly believable stat involving Shivam Dube has emerged on social media.\n\nShivam Dube sets unbelievable record that will take some beating\n\nThe Indian all-rounder, who also featured in the T20 series, was involved in the tied game in the first ODI as he scored 25 runs with the bat while also picking up a wicket from his short but successful four-over spell.\n\nIndia failed to chase down 230, meaning Dube was involved in the fifth tie of his international career so far.\n\nREAD MORE: Ravi Shastri names the Indian player who really shocked him at the T20 World Cup\n\nA stat from X user Kaustub Gudipati confirms that Dube has played out more ties (five) than defeats for India (four), having previously appeared in ties against New Zealand in 2020 (twice), Afghanistan in 2024 and Sri Lanka twice in this series.\n\nThe tweet is from August 3rd and India lost the second ODI yesterday, meaning Dube has lost four games in his international career so far. However, the stat still holds true and is rather unbelievable taking into account how rare ties are in cricket.\n\nHow has Shivam Dube featured in international cricket for India?\n\nDube has played just three ODIs for India, so the sample size is not large enough to deduce a sensible opinion of his exploits.\n\nREAD MORE: Dinesh Karthik thinks India have two 'superstars' in the making who can take over from Virat Kohli\n\nHowever, in the shortest format, the all-rounder has featured 33 times since making his debut in November 2019. Dube's T20I record doesn't really set the world alight, but he has scored 448 runs at a strike rate of just under 134.9, averaging just under 30.\n\nWith the ball, he has 11 wickets to his name which is a decent figure for a part-bowler, although his economy of 9.53 is slightly on the higher side.

It's certainly not the start Gautam Gambhir, a stickler for victories, would want in his first ODI assignment as the team's head coach. India's previous bilateral ODI series defeat against the Islanders came in 1997. The Arjuna Ranatunga-led Lankans then inflicted a 0-3 hammering on Sachin Tendulkar and his men.\n\nSince then, India and Sri Lanka have played 11 bilateral ODI rubbers home and away, with the 'Men in Blue' emerging on the right side of the result in all of them.\n\nIndia will not be able to win the current three-match series after succumbing to the hosts by 32 runs in the second ODI, and conceding a tie in the first game.\n\nThis position of discomfort is brought upon the team by the batsmen, who seemed to have been plagued by indecisiveness on a RPSC pitch that offered plenty of turn to the spinners.\n\nCuriously, none reflected that brittleness more than star batter Kohli. He has made 38 runs in two matches, but more than the volume of runs, the manner of his dismissals evoked greater concern.\n\nKohli looked subdued in the middle, particularly after the fiery starts given by Rohit. Kohli just needed to build on it.\n\nBut the master batter in him remained dormant as he pottered around the leg-spin of Wanindu Hasaranga in the first match and of six-wicket man Jeffrey Vandersay in the next, before eventually getting consumed by them.\n\nHe looked a far cry from the dominant batsman who once cracked four hundreds at this very same venue. Perhaps, Kohli should direct his mind to happier times than allowing it to be fettered by the demons of the present.\n\nA flowing Kohli is imperative for India's healthy run in the middle overs, be it while chasing or setting a target.\n\nBut then his turmoil is a true reflection of the struggle that has gripped the Indian batting unit.\n\nIn Shivam Dube, India have a designated spin-basher, but the left-hander could not even pick a regulation leg-break by Vandersay in the second one-dayer, getting trapped in front of the wicket.\n\nShreyas Iyer and KL Rahul too have lorded over spinners in the past, but here their feet and wrists have been unresponsive against the Lankan slow bowlers.\n\nThey seemed to be going through a temporary memory loss as to how to rotate strike, the most effective weapon to keep spinners in check on tracks such as the ones at the Premadasa.\n\nThey just need to watch the batting of Rohit to find a remedy - not so much in his approach but more in the confidence and planning behind his knocks.\n\nThere is no need to gild the lily while describing Rohit's batting, still his taming of the Lankan bowlers - pace and spin alike - has been exceptional.\n\nOften a 44-ball 64 would contain a few chancy shots, but Rohit's strokes were so well-calculated that they hardly appeared risky.\n\nCan his colleagues take a cue? Parag to get the call?\n\nFrom a combination perspective, the team management might look at the position of Dube, despite a 24-ball 25 in the first match.\n\nUnder the existing conditions, Riyan Parag's spin, either off-spin or leg-spin, might come handier than the honest medium pace of Dube, and the former is an equally good hard-hitter.\n\nFrom their part, the Indian bowlers too should improve their effort in the business end as they failed to apply finishing touches to Lanka after reducing them to 142 for six and 136 for six.", "source": {"uri": "sports.ndtv.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "NDTVSports.com"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spin_bowling", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Spin bowling"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virat_Kohli", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Virat Kohli"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Batting_(cricket)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Batting (cricket)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/One_Day_International", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "One Day International"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sri_Lanka", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Sri Lanka"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Sri Lanka"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/India", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "India"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rohit_Sharma", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Rohit Sharma"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gautam_Gambhir", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Gautam Gambhir"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Captain_(cricket)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Captain (cricket)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sachin_Tendulkar", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Sachin Tendulkar"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colombo", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Colombo"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Colombo"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Sri Lanka"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wanindu_Hasaranga", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Wanindu Hasaranga"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jeffrey_Vandersay", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Jeffrey Vandersay"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cricket_pitch", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Cricket pitch"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leg_spin", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Leg spin"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Over_(cricket)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Over (cricket)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shivam_Dube", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Shivam Dube"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shreyas_Iyer", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Shreyas Iyer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/K._L._Rahul", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "K.

This is not the ideal beginning that Gautam Gambhir, a perfectionist for triumphs, would desire for his initial ODI task as the team's head coach. India's last bilateral ODI series defeat against the Islanders occurred in 1997. The Arjuna Ranatunga-led Lankans then inflicted a 0-3 defeat on Sachin Tendulkar and his squad.\n\nSince then, India and Sri Lanka have engaged in 11 bilateral ODI series both at home and away, with the 'Men in Blue' emerging victorious in all of them.\n\nIndia will not be able to claim victory in the current three-match series after falling to the hosts by 32 runs in the second ODI, and settling for a draw in the first match. The batsmen are to blame for this uncomfortable position, as they seemed to struggle with decision-making on a pitch that provided ample turn for the spinners. Notably, star batsman Kohli demonstrated this fragility more than anyone else. He has scored 38 runs in two matches, but his dismissals were more worrisome than the runs themselves.\n\nKohli appeared subdued on the field, especially after the strong starts provided by Rohit. He needed to capitalize on those starts, but failed to do so against the leg-spin of Wanindu Hasaranga and Jeffrey Vandersay. The Kohli we saw in these matches was a far cry from the dominant batsman who had scored four centuries at the same venue in the past. A fluent Kohli is essential for India's success in the middle overs, whether they are chasing a target or setting one.\n\nHowever, his struggles reflect the overall challenges faced by the Indian batting unit. In Shivam Dube, India has a designated spinner destroyer, but he faltered against Vandersay in the second ODI. Shreyas Iyer and KL Rahul, who have excelled against spinners before, seemed lost against the Sri Lankan slow bowlers this time.\n\nThey need to remember how to rotate strike effectively, a key strategy against spinners on tracks like the one at the Premadasa. Watching Rohit's batting could provide them with a solution, not just in his technique but also in the confidence and planning behind his innings.\n\nThe team management might consider replacing Dube with Riyan Parag, whose spin bowling could be more effective in these conditions. Parag is also a capable hard-hitter. The Indian bowlers, on the other hand, need to step up their game in the final stages of the innings, as they failed to finish off Sri Lanka after reducing them to 142 for six and 136 for six.", "source": {"uri": "pehalnews.in", "dataType": "news", "title": "Pehal News"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spin_bowling", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Spin bowling"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virat_Kohli", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Virat Kohli"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Batting_(cricket)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Batting (cricket)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/One_Day_International", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "One Day International"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/India", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "India"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rohit_Sharma", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Rohit Sharma"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sri_Lanka", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Sri Lanka"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Sri Lanka"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gautam_Gambhir", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Gautam Gambhir"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Captain_(cricket)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Captain (cricket)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sachin_Tendulkar", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Sachin Tendulkar"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colombo", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Colombo"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Colombo"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Sri Lanka"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wanindu_Hasaranga", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Wanindu Hasaranga"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cricket_pitch", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Cricket pitch"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leg_spin", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Leg spin"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shivam_Dube", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Shivam Dube"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shreyas_Iyer", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Shreyas Iyer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/K._L._Rahul", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "K.

Kohli just needed to build on it\n\nColombo: The onus will be on Indian batters, particularly the talismanic Virat Kohli, to follow the path laid down by skipper Rohit Sharma and tactfully counter the spin challenge in the third and final ODI here on Wednesday to avoid their first series defeat to Sri Lanka in 27 years.\n\nIt's certainly not the start Gautam Gambhir, a stickler for victories, would want in his first ODI assignment as the team's head coach. India's previous bilateral ODI series defeat against the Islanders came in 1997. The Arjuna Ranatunga-led Lankans then inflicted a 0-3 hammering on Sachin Tendulkar and his men.\n\nSince then, India and Sri Lanka have played 11 bilateral ODI rubbers home and away, with the 'Men in Blue' emerging on the right side of the result in all of them. India will not be able to win the current three-match series after succumbing to the hosts by 32 runs in the second ODI, and conceding a tie in the first game.\n\nThis position of discomfort is brought upon the team by the batsmen, who seemed to have been plagued by indecisiveness on a RPSC pitch that offered plenty of turn to the spinners. Curiously, none reflected that brittleness more than star batter Kohli. He has made 38 runs in two matches, but more than the volume of runs, the manner of his dismissals evoked greater concern.\n\nKohli looked subdued in the middle, particularly after the fiery starts given by Rohit. Kohli just needed to build on it. But the master batter in him remained dormant as he pottered around the leg-spin of Wanindu Hasaranga in the first match and of six-wicket man Jeffrey Vandersay in the next, before eventually getting consumed by them.\n\nHe looked a far cry from the dominant batsman who once cracked four hundreds at this very same venue. Perhaps, Kohli should direct his mind to happier times than allowing it to be fettered by the demons of the present.\n\nA flowing Kohli is imperative for India's healthy run in the middle overs, be it while chasing or setting a target. But then his turmoil is a true reflection of the struggle that has gripped the Indian batting unit. In Shivam Dube, India have a designated spin-basher, but the left-hander could not even pick a regulation leg-break by Vandersay in the second one-dayer, getting trapped in front of the wicket.\n\nShreyas Iyer and KL Rahul too have lorded over spinners in the past, but here their feet and wrists have been unresponsive against the Lankan slow bowlers. They seemed to be going through a temporary memory loss as to how to rotate strike, the most effective weapon to keep spinners in check on tracks such as the ones at the Premadasa.\n\nThey just need to watch the batting of Rohit to find a remedy - not so much in his approach but more in the confidence and planning behind his knocks. There is no need to gild the lily while describing Rohit's batting, still his taming of the Lankan bowlers - pace and spin alike - has been exceptional.\n\nOften a 44-ball 64 would contain a few chancy shots, but Rohit's strokes were so well-calculated that they hardly appeared risky. Can his colleagues take a cue?\n\nParag to get the call?\n\nFrom a combination perspective, the team management might look at the position of Dube, despite a 24-ball 25 in the first match. Under the existing conditions, Riyan Parag's spin, either off-spin or leg-spin, might come handier than the honest medium pace of Dube, and the former is an equally good hard-hitter. From their part, the Indian bowlers too should improve their effort in the business end as they failed to apply finishing touches to Lanka after reducing them to 142 for six and 136 for six.\n\nTeams:\n\nIndia: Rohit Sharma (C), ?hubman Gill (VC), Virat Kohli, KL Rahul (WK), Rishabh Pant (WK), Shreyas Iyer, Shivam Dube, Kuldeep Yadav, Mohd.

The return of Rohit Sharma and Virat Kohli to the ODI side made India even stronger. However, the series went completely in a different direction as in the first match, Sri Lanka managed to pull off a draw while in the second match, the hosts stunned the Men in Blue through their excellent spin bowling and went on to win the match by 32 runs.\n\nSri Lanka's win in the second ODI resulted in them avoiding defeat in a bilateral series against India for the first time in 27 years. Even if India manages to win in the 3rd ODI, they will only be able to tie the series. However, a tie would definitely suit the Men in Blue better than a defeat in the series.\n\nThe pitch at the R Premadasa Stadium in Colombo generally assists the spinners. It is worth noting that in the second ODI, 15 out of 19 wickets were taken by spinners with Jeffrey Vandersay bowling the spell of his life and taking 6 wickets.\n\nThe weather at Colombo is expected to be cloudy and there are high chances that rain will interrupt the match.\n\nIndia: Rohit Sharma (c), Shubman Gill, Virat Kohli, Shreyas Iyer, KL Rahul (wk), Shivam Dube, Axar Patel, Washington Sundar, Kuldeep Yadav, Mohammed Siraj, Arshdeep Singh\n\nSri Lanka: Pathum Nissanka, Avishka Fernando, Kusal Mendis (wk), Sadeera Samarawickrama, Charith Asalanka (c), Kamindu Mendis, Janith Liyanage, Dunith Wellalage, Akila Dananjaya, Jeffrey Vandersay, Asitha Fernando", "source": {"uri": "cricketcountry.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Cricket Country"}, "authors": [{"uri": "ansh_sharma@cricketcountry.com", "name": "Ansh Sharma", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/India_national_cricket_team", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "India national cricket team"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/One_Day_International", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "One Day International"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sri_Lanka", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Sri Lanka"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Sri Lanka"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Whitewash_(sport)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Whitewash (sport)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rohit_Sharma", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Rohit Sharma"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twenty20_International", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Twenty20 International"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spin_bowling", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Spin bowling"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virat_Kohli", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Virat Kohli"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cricket_pitch", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Cricket pitch"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wicket", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Wicket"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colombo", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Colombo"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Colombo"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Sri Lanka"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dunith_Wellalage", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Dunith Wellalage"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arshdeep_Singh_(cricketer)", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Arshdeep Singh (cricketer)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Avishka_Fernando", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Avishka Fernando"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charith_Asalanka", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Charith Asalanka"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pathum_Nissanka", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Pathum Nissanka"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Akila_Dananjaya", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Akila Dananjaya"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sadeera_Samarawickrama", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Sadeera Samarawickrama"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shreyas_Iyer", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Shreyas Iyer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Axar_Patel", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Axar Patel"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kusal_Mendis", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Kusal Mendis"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/K._L._Rahul", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "K.

The ball-tracking technology confirmed that the delivery would have hit off and middle stump, cementing the decision made by umpire Raveendra Wimalasiri. Interestingly, Shivam Dube was late in joining the appeal; he only began his appeal after KL Rahul, behind the stumps, had already initiated it. Despite the delayed reaction, the appeal was perfectly timed and accurate.\n\nDube's return to the ODI team has been highly anticipated.

Basit Ali stated that Virat Kohli isn't well-prepared for the series after his back-to-back disappointing outings against Sri Lanka.\n\nVirat Kohli came under scrutiny after failing to score in the first two ODIs against Sri Lanka. The right-handed batter has faced difficulties against Sri Lankan spinners on a turning pitch. He managed to register scores of 24 runs and 14 runs. Team India is trailing 0-1 in the series after losing the second ODI match.\n\nIn a video shared on his YouTube channel, Basit Ali said that it is unexpected for proven player Virat Kohli to get out LBW twice in two ODIs against Sri Lanka. Ali stated that it's understandable if players like Shivam Dube and Shreyas Iyer were dismissed in the same manner in back-to-back matches.\n\n\"A great batsman like Virat Kohli, the world's number one batsman, has been out LBW twice. It's understandable if it happens to Iyer or Dube, but Virat Kohli is Virat Kohli. This means that he is not in practice,\" Basit said.\n\nVirat Kohli got off to a decent start, scoring 24 runs in the first match on August 2. The 35-year-old batter failed to convert his start and was out LBW to leg-spinner Wanindu Hasaranga. In the second game, Kohli was dismissed LBW by Hasaranga's replacement, Jeffrey Vandersay, after scoring 14 runs off 19 balls.\n\nBasit Ali also said that Shreyas Iyer and KL Rahul, who were not part of the T20I series, came to the series without enough practice on turning tracks. The former Pakistan batter stated that this lack of practice led to the batting lineup's struggles.\n\n\"It did not seem that this is the batting lineup which rules the world. I feel that Shreyas Iyer and KL Rahul probably haven't even practiced. These people have come without practice,\" Basit added.\n\nThe 53-year-old stated that Gautam Gambhir should consider including Rishabh Pant, Riyan Parag, and Rinku Singh in the playing XI. Ali warned that relying on reputations rather than current form could hurt their chances in the Champions Trophy 2025.\n\n\"I don't understand what is Shreyas Iyer going to do with such performances. I think the time has come for Rishabh Pant, Riyan Parag, and Rinku Singh. India's 50-over domestic tournament will be vital for Gautam Gambhir because he will have to take some players from there. If India pick players based on reputation, the results won't be too good in the Champions Trophy,\" he further stated.\n\nThe series opener between India and Sri Lanka ended in a tie, with both teams scoring 230 runs. In the second ODI of the three-match series, Sri Lanka defeated India by 34 runs in Colombo. Jeffrey Vandersay took six wickets as India was bowled out for 208. Sri Lanka leads the series 1-0 with one match remaining.\n\nThe third ODI between India and Sri Lanka will be played at R. Premadasa Stadium in Colombo on Wednesday, August 7.

Since then, India and Sri Lanka have played 11 bilateral ODI rubbers home and away, with the 'Men in Blue' emerging on the right side of the result in all of them.\n\nIndia will not be able to win the current three-match series after succumbing to the hosts by 32 runs in the second ODI and conceding a tie in the first game. This position of discomfort is brought upon the team by the batsmen, who seemed to have been plagued by indecisiveness on a pitch that offered plenty of turn to the spinners.\n\nCuriously, none reflected that brittleness more than star batter Kohli. He has made 38 runs in two matches, but more than the volume of runs, the manner of his dismissals evoked greater concern. Kohli looked subdued in the middle, particularly after the fiery starts given by Rohit. Kohli just needed to build on it. But the master batter in him remained dormant as he pottered around the leg-spin of Wanindu Hasaranga in the first match and of six-wicket man Jeffrey Vandersay in the next, before eventually getting consumed by them. He looked a far cry from the dominant batsman who once cracked four hundreds at this very same venue.\n\nPerhaps, Kohli should direct his mind to happier times than allowing it to be fettered by the demons of the present. A flowing Kohli is imperative for India's healthy run in the middle overs, be it while chasing or setting a target. But then his turmoil is a true reflection of the struggle that has gripped the Indian batting unit.\n\nIn Shivam Dube, India have a designated spin-basher, but the left-hander could not even pick a regulation leg-break by Vandersay in the second one-dayer, getting trapped in front of the wicket. Shreyas Iyer and KL Rahul too have lorded over spinners in the past, but here their feet and wrists have been unresponsive against the Lankan slow bowlers. They seemed to be going through a temporary memory loss as to how to rotate strike, the most effective weapon to keep spinners in check on tracks such as the ones at the Premadasa.", "source": {"uri": "newindianexpress.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The New Indian Express"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virat_Kohli", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Virat Kohli"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Batting_(cricket)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Batting (cricket)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/One_Day_International", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "One Day International"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/India", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "India"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rohit_Sharma", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Rohit Sharma"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spin_bowling", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Spin bowling"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sri_Lanka", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Sri Lanka"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Sri Lanka"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Captain_(cricket)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Captain (cricket)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sachin_Tendulkar", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Sachin Tendulkar"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colombo", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Colombo"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Colombo"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Sri Lanka"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cricket_pitch", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Cricket pitch"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leg_spin", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Leg spin"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wanindu_Hasaranga", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Wanindu Hasaranga"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shivam_Dube", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Shivam Dube"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shreyas_Iyer", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Shreyas Iyer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/K._L._Rahul", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "K.

Reminded you of Yuvi, didn't it?\"\n\nRavi Shastri, then India's head coach, made this observation at Auckland's Eden Park on 26 January 2020, seconds after Shivam Dube had clubbed Tim Southee over long-on for the six that sealed victory in the second of five Twenty20 Internationals.\n\nIt was the left-handed Mumbaikar's 10th T20I; he had announced himself with an unbeaten 30-ball 54 just a month and a half previously, against West Indies in Thiruvananthapuram. Dube was 27 at the time, with a long future ahead of him in white-ball cricket owing to his propensity to hit the ball a long way and the rare tag of a potential all-rounder who could also bowl medium-pace.\n\nFew knew at the time, not even the prescient Shastri, that following the end of that New Zealand series, Dube wouldn't play international cricket for three and a half years. The early promise was studiously ignored, the comparisons with 'Yuvi', aka Yuvraj Singh, quickly forgotten. Dube threatened to figure in the list of the could-have-beens, lumbering from IPL franchise to franchise and not really setting the domestic stage alight, either.\n\nTurning point\n\nThen, Chennai Super Kings happened. At the IPL mega auction in 2022, the multiple-times former champions dished out \u20b94.40 crores for the man from Mumbai, who had moved from Royal Challengers Bangalore to Rajasthan Royals with limited success. The sceptics tut-tutted, amazed that CSK would invest so much in someone who had done so little. Hardly did they know that a turning of the corner was imminent.\n\nChennai Super Kings' Shivam Dube during a training session ahead of the Indian Premier League (IPL) 2024, between CSK and DC at ACA-VDCA stadium in Visakhapatnam, Saturday, March 30, 2024. Photo K.R Deepak / The Hindu | Photo Credit: DEEPAK KR\n\nMahendra Singh Dhoni and Stephen Fleming assigned Dube a specific role - the takedown of spin in the middle overs. They gave him a stable position in the upper middle order, infused in him the confidence and belief that he could destroy the best with his power and timing. The backroom staff spent hours working on his mind, and even more hours getting his range-hitting prowess up and running.\n\nThe results were spectacular; Dube responded with 289 runs at an average of 28.90 and a strike-rate of 156.22. When he backed that up with 418 runs the following season at corresponding numbers of 38.00 and 158.33, it was impossible for the India selectors to keep looking beyond him.\n\nThus began Dube's second coming in international cricket, with a 'second' team against Ireland in Malahide in August 2023. A month and a half later, he was part of the gold medal-winning team at the Hangzhou Asian Games and while he hadn't had too many chances to showcase his ball-striking skills, combined returns of 47 runs (undefeated) in 35 balls in those two events since his comeback earned him a shot at Afghanistan at the start of this year.\n\nDube responded in spectacular style, backing up an unbeaten 60 in Mohali with 63 not out in Indore. Out of nowhere, he had stormed into contention for a place in the T20 World Cup in the Americas, locked in a battle for the middle-order slot/finisher's role with Rinku Singh, the exuberant youngster from Uttar Pradesh and Kolkata Knight Riders.\n\nIPL 2024 wouldn't seal the deal, but it wouldn't hurt either. Dube made the most of getting enough opportunities to bat and reiterate his power-hitting, while Rinku was unfortunate that between Phil Salt, Sunil Narine and the two Iyers, skipper Shreyas and Venkatesh, hardly allowed him a look-in. That was that, Dube was on the flight to North America with Rinku in tow as one of the reserves.\n\nThe introduction of the Impact Player is one of the more divisive topics in IPL history. Originally designed to bolster bowling strengths and ensure that teams no longer had to patch together a makeshift fifth option, it has had the exact opposite effect, with batters emboldened to keep firing away even when early wickets have fallen in a clutch because of the insurance of an additional batting choice.\n\nIn many ways, as even Rohit Sharma has pointed out, it has stunted the growth of the Indian all-rounder. Where, in the past, a Venkatesh Iyer broke into the national team because he could also bowl medium-pace, there was no need for his bowling skills to be utilised anymore. Ditto for Dube; in IPL 2023, when the Impact Player concept first reared its head, he didn't bowl at all and last year, his appearance at the bowling crease was limited to six deliveries.\n\nThere is no Impact Player in international cricket, but that didn't prevent India from investing in Dube. After all, they did have Hardik Pandya, the premier pace-bowling all-rounder. Dube was picked as a pure batter, and he didn't disappoint at the World Cup, where he showcased another facet of his batting - the ability to bat according to the situation.\n\nThat was on a decidedly dodgy surface at the Nassau County International Cricket Stadium in New York, the home of incalculable surfaces during the World Cup. India was all but through to the Super Eights but woe betide the team if it lost to United States! The latter had already conquered Pakistan in the Super Over and was eyeing its second big scalp on the bounce, defending a meagre 110 for eight with a desperation that beggared belief.\n\nView this post on Instagram\n\nA post shared by shivam dube (@dubeshivam)\n\nSaurabh Netravalkar, formerly of Mumbai and India Under-19, packed off Rohit and Virat Kohli in his first spell, Pakistan-born Ali Khan accounted for Rishabh Pant. At 39 for three, India was in a pickle; 72 needed off 75 with seven wickets in hand might have appeared a walk in the park, but it was anything but. The ball did things as if it had a mind of its own, as if it enjoyed making the best look mediocre, as if there was a perverse pleasure to be had in driving batters ragged. Even Suryakumar Yadav, then the No. 1 T20I batter in the world, couldn't impose himself on the bowling.\n\nDube struggled for timing, but didn't throw it away. He bided his time, aware that India needed him to step up in Suryakumar's company. The big strokes were put away in cold storage, the ones and twos became the staple diet. By the end, the two Mumbaikars hauled the team home with ten deliveries to spare, Dube's contribution in the stand of 72 -- a measured 31 off 35. One four, one six. Not just a six-hitter, but capable of batting at other gears too.\n\nAs the tournament moved solely to the Caribbean for the Super Eights, the pitches got better and the Dube of CSK fame resurfaced - 34 off 24 against Bangladesh, 28 off 22 against Australia and a vital 27 off 16 in the final against South Africa at a time when Kohli went without a boundary for 35 consecutive deliveries. Dube had done what he was picked for - not to score conservative half-centuries but to provide the final kick, the last push that could so often be the difference between victory and defeat.\n\nFurther reward, apart from a World Cup winner's medal, came in the form of a recall to the One-Day International set-up, more than four and a half years after his only 50-over game for the country, against West Indies in December 2019. He made nine off six and went for 68 in his 7.5 overs at Chepauk, with West Indies cantering to an eight-wicket win.\n\nJettisoned after that misadventure, he is back in the 50-over mix in Sri Lanka. In Friday's first ODI, he picked up his maiden wicket, Kusal Mendis, trapped in front, and almost took India past the finish line with 25 off 24 after coming in at No. 8. Two nights later, promoted to No. 4, he was transfixed by a ripping leg-break from Jeffrey Vandersay, trapped in front as he played right back and missed the line. Hazy shades of Yuvi there too, Ravi?\n\nDube's reintegration with the one-day format must be construed as a middling long-term option, as an insurance for Pandya. Fitness concerns and workload management combined to ensure that India's T20 captaincy in the wake of Rohit's retirement was conferred on Suryakumar.\n\nThe CSK batter's return to the ODI landscape must also be viewed through the same prism. He will get his chances to prove his worth, but his permanence will largely depend on Pandya. In any case, until the start of the Champions Trophy in late February, India have just four more ODIs and it's anyone's guess which of Dube or Pandya will start its final assignment before that tournament, the three-match home series against England in February.\n\nDube is a seasoned 31 years old, but he has much work ahead of him, especially when it comes to his fielding and catching. He isn't the fastest mover on the park nor the most assured catcher, both red flags in modern-day cricket, whether at the international level or below that. Dube isn't naturally athletic and there's precious little that can be done about it at this stage of his career, where T20Is will still be his preferred cup of tea.\n\nBut if he is desirous of a longer innings in a longer format, the onus is on him to become a better fielding version of himself. He has shown the hunger and the desire with the bat; if he can translate that into other aspects of his cricket, he potentially still has another T20 World Cup (in 2026) in him. At the very least.\n\nRead Comments", "source": {"uri": "thehindu.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Hindu"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shivam_Dube",

The Lankan Lions are just one win short (or another tie) to end their wait for an ODI series win against the Men in Blue. The last time they beat India in an ODI bilateral was way back in 1997.\n\nThe Sri Lankan batting has not fired at all. However, they have somehow found out ways to post par totals. While Dunith Wellalage propelled the Lankans to 230 in the opening ODI, it was a combined effort from the entire batting unit to get to 240 in the recent second affair. Unfortunately, the same hasn't been the case with Team India. Although Rohit Sharma has set the platform, smashing two fifties within the powerplay overs, none of the other batters have followed the suit.\n\nThe entire Indian middle-order has faltered. Virat Kohli, Shreyas Iyer, KL Rahul & Shivam Dube have all let the fans down. While Kohli and Iyer are irrepealable, India have backups ready for Rahul and Dube.\n\nRahul scored 31 runs in the first ODI but failed to take India hope. However, in the next match, he was out on a silver duck, completely faltering against Jeffrey Vandersay. Shivam Dube, meanwhile, almost won the game in the 1st bout. However, he looked absolutely clueless against a top-quality Lankan spin. Although dubbed as a 'spin basher', Dube doesn't move his feet in order to tackle the varying lengths. Moreover, he even fails to read the grip from a spinner's hand.\n\nIndia should ideally look at replacing Dube with Riyan Parag. The main idea behind this tactic should be simple and that is the amount of spin generating off the deck. All three ODIs are being played in Colombo and the surface is bound to get even slower. Parag, who showcased his skill as a bowlers in T20Is, should get a look-in as well. Take inspiration from Sri Lanka, who played just a solitary pacer in Asitha Fernando in the second ODI. India already have Washington, Axar and Kuldeep. With Parag coming in, the quartet should be enough to derail the Lankan batting.\n\nThere are discussions if India should also include Rishabh Pant in the upcoming match. The southpaw definitely adds a 'X-factor' due to his aggressive mindset and unorthodox batting ideas. The only way India can include Pant is by replacing KL Rahul. However, it would be unfair on the Karnataka-born lad, given how well he served the team in ODIs last year. 1060 runs at an average of 66.25 and at a strike rate of 87.74 - these are the 2023 numbers for Rahul, who regularly batted at number five. Moreover, Rahul is a great player of spin, which indicates that it is only a matter of time that he hit his straps once again.\n\nRohit Sharma (c), \u13dahubman Gill (vc), Virat Kohli, Shreyas Iyer, KL Rahul/ Rishabh Pant (wk), Riyan Parag, Washington Sundar, Axar Patel, Kuldeep Yadav, Mohammed Siraj, Arshdeep Singh.", "source": {"uri": "insidesport.in", "dataType": "news", "title": "Inside Sport India"}, "authors": [{"uri": "naman_jain@insidesport.in", "name": "Naman Jain", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Batting_(cricket)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Batting (cricket)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/One_Day_International", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "One Day International"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sri_Lanka", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Sri Lanka"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Sri Lanka"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/India", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "India"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/India_national_cricket_team", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "India national cricket team"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dunith_Wellalage", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Dunith Wellalage"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shivam_Dube", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Shivam Dube"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spin_bowling", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Spin bowling"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virat_Kohli", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Virat Kohli"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shreyas_Iyer", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Shreyas Iyer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/K._L._Rahul", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "K.

Shreyas Iyer was slotted to come in at No. 4 but instead, the team management decided to send a left-hander to make sure a left-right combination is maintained.\n\nDespite having other proven left-handed batters like Shivam Dube and Axar Patel in the Playing XI, the team management decided to send Washington Sundar up the order which proved to be a big surprise.\n\nAlso read: Ex-Pakistan star rips into Gautam Gambhir for promoting Washington Sundar to No.4 in IND vs SL 1st ODI\n\nWhile speaking on his YouTube channel, Aakash Chopra argued that if India wanted a left-hander at the fall of Rohit Sharma's wicket, they had the options of Shivam Dube and Axar Patel who are proven performers at the international level. But India opted for Washington Sundar at such an important batting spot.\n\n\"Washington Sundar was sent up the order. I was wondering why he has come up the order. If you want a left-hander, you have Shivam Dube but you didn't send him up. You sent him (Sundar). Later when he gets out, Shreyas Iyer comes and KL Rahul and Axar Patel come afterwards. Then you wonder why Shivam Dube wasn't sent up the order. These are some questions,\" Chopra said in his video.\n\nChopra further argued that Shivam Dube was sent below the allrounder Axar Patel at No. 8, which was not ideal.\n\n\"Gautam Gambhir is giving you something to think about because something is different. You don't want Shivam Dube to bat at No. 8. You want him to bat up the order. But you are sending him below Axar, you are sending Washy (Washington Sundar) up the order,\" he added.\n\nThe move to send Washington Sundar up the order did not work as he was dismissed for just 5 runs by spinner Akila Dananjaya. Shreyas Iyer came at No. 5 and tried to steady India's ship with a partnership with Virat Kohli. But both Kohli and Iyer were dismissed in quick succession.\n\nAxar Patel came to bat at No. 7 and stitched a useful sixth-wicket partnership with KL Rahul. Both took their time and scored runs steadily. But India lost both of them in quick succession to slide further.\n\nShivam Dube, who came at No. 8, batted well for his 25 off 24 balls. But he fell off the penultimate delivery of the day with India needing 1 run to win the game. Dube smashed 2 sixes during his knock.\n\nWith 1 required to win and a wicket in hand, Arshdeep Singh tried to slog a straight deliver on the stumps and was hit right in front. The umpire gave it out straight away as the match ended in a dramatic tie.

The path has been set by captain Rohit Sharma, and it is up to the rest of the batting lineup to follow the skipper.\n\nIn his maiden ODI series as head coach, this is definitely not the start Gautam Gambhir would have envisioned, given his emphasis on winning.\n\nIndia were last defeated in a bilateral ODI series against the Lankans in 1997. India haven't lost for 11 series of 50-over internationals between the two teams since then.\n\nHowever, the visitors find themselves in an unfamiliar position, after a tie in the opening match and a 32-run defeat in the second. Winning the three-match series is now beyond India's grasp, and the team will be determined to avoid a defeat in the final match of the series at Colombo's R Premadasa Stadium on Wednesday.\n\nThis position of discomfort is brought upon the team largely by their batsmen, who seemed to have been plagued by indecisiveness on a pitch that offered plenty of turn to the spinners.\n\nStar batter Virat Kohli epitomized the team's fragility more than anyone else. Besides scoring only 38 runs in two matches, it's the nature of Kohli's dismissals that has raised concerns.\n\nKohli has appeared subdued in the middle, after the explosive starts provided by Rohit in the two games. The master batter within Kohli remained dormant as he struggled against the leg-spin of Wanindu Hasaranga in the first match and Jeffrey Vandersay, who claimed six wickets, in the second, before eventually succumbing to them.\n\nPerhaps, Kohli should focus on the happier memories rather than allowing his mind to be shackled by the current challenges. India's success in the middle overs, whether chasing or setting a target, heavily relies on a free-flowing Kohli.\n\nShivam Dube, India's designated spin-basher, failed to read a simple leg-break from Vandersay in the second one-dayer, resulting in an lbw dismissal. Shreyas Iyer and KL Rahul, known for their prowess against spinners, have struggled to use their feet and wrists effectively against the Lankan slow bowlers.\n\nThe solution possibly lies in observing Rohit's batting, not necessarily his approach, but the confidence and strategy behind his innings.\n\nRohit's mastery over the Lankan bowlers, both pace and spin, has been remarkable. His 44-ball 64 was a display of well-calculated strokes that never seemed risky.\n\nThe team management may reconsider Dube's position in the lineup when deciding the eleven for the match on Wednesday.\n\nGiven the conditions in Colombo and the nature of the pitch, batting allrounder Riyan Parag's spin bowling can prove more useful than Dube's straightforward medium pace.\n\nOn their end, the Indian bowlers need to step up their performance in the crucial stages of the game as the previous matches highlight their failure to bowl the hosts out for a low score despite reducing them to 142 for 6 and 136 for 6.\n\nThe TOI Sports Desk excels in a myriad of roles that capture the essence of live sporting events and deliver compelling content to readers worldwide.

Kohli having recently retired from T20Is, returned to the Indian team for the ODI series against the island nation under new head coach Gautam Gambhir.\n\nHowever, his performances in the first two matches have been below par, with scores of 24 and 14 on spin-friendly tracks. Former Pakistan cricketer Basit Ali expressed his surprise at the 35-year-old's struggles.\n\n\"A great batsman like Virat Kohli, the world's number one batsman, has been out LBW twice.

The Arjuna Ranatunga-led Lankans then inflicted a 0-3 hammering on Sachin Tendulkar and his men.\n\nSince then, India and Sri Lanka have played 11 bilateral ODI rubbers home and away, with the 'Men in Blue' emerging on the right side of the result in all of them.\n\nIndia will not be able to win the current three-match series after succumbing to the hosts by 32 runs in the second ODI, and conceding a tie in the first game.\n\nThis position of discomfort is brought upon the team by the batsmen, who seemed to have been plagued by indecisiveness on a RPSC pitch that offered plenty of turn to the spinners.\n\nCuriously, none reflected that brittleness more than star batter Kohli. He has made 38 runs in two matches, but more than the volume of runs, the manner of his dismissals evoked greater concern.\n\nKohli looked subdued in the middle, particularly after the fiery starts given by Rohit. Kohli just needed to build on it.\n\nBut the master batter in him remained dormant as he pottered around the leg-spin of Wanindu Hasaranga in the first match and of six-wicket man Jeffrey Vandersay in the next, before eventually getting consumed by them.\n\nHe looked a far cry from the dominant batsman who once cracked four hundreds at this very same venue. Perhaps, Kohli should direct his mind to happier times than allowing it to be fettered by the demons of the present.\n\nA flowing Kohli is imperative for India's healthy run in the middle overs, be it while chasing or setting a target.\n\nBut then his turmoil is a true reflection of the struggle that has gripped the Indian batting unit.\n\nIn Shivam Dube, India have a designated spin-basher, but the left-hander could not even pick a regulation leg-break by Vandersay in the second one-dayer, getting trapped in front of the wicket.\n\nShreyas Iyer and KL Rahul too have lorded over spinners in the past, but here their feet and wrists have been unresponsive against the Lankan slow bowlers.\n\nThey seemed to be going through a temporary memory loss as to how to rotate strike, the most effective weapon to keep spinners in check on tracks such as the ones at the Premadasa.\n\nThey just need to watch the batting of Rohit to find a remedy - not so much in his approach but more in the confidence and planning behind his knocks.\n\nThere is no need to gild the lily while describing Rohit's batting, still his taming of the Lankan bowlers - pace and spin alike - has been exceptional.\n\nOften a 44-ball 64 would contain a few chancy shots, but Rohit's strokes were so well-calculated that they hardly appeared risky. Can his colleagues take a cue? Parag to get the call? ============= From a combination perspective, the team management might look at the position of Dube, despite a 24-ball 25 in the first match.\n\nUnder the existing conditions, Riyan Parag's spin, either off-spin or leg-spin, might come handier than the honest medium pace of Dube, and the former is an equally good hard-hitter.\n\nFrom their part, the Indian bowlers too should improve their effort in the business end as they failed to apply finishing touches to Lanka after reducing them to 142 for six and 136 for six.\n\nTeams (from): India: Rohit Sharma (C), \u13dahubman Gill (VC), Virat Kohli, KL Rahul (WK), Rishabh Pant (WK), Shreyas Iyer, Shivam Dube, Kuldeep Yadav, Mohd.

After losing the first ODI, Team India has fallen behind in the series and is also in a position to lose the series. Team India is trailing 1-0 and if it loses the next match, it will lose the series.\n\nThe situation has become do or die for India. Rohit Shama and company will try their best to win this match. The Indian team would never want to face defeat against Sri Lanka, on the other hand, Sri Lanka has a good chance to capture the series.\n\nThe last match is to be played between the two teams. After this the series will also end. The Indian team had a clean sweep in the T20 series. Here the Sri Lankan team will not be able to do a clean sweep but there is definitely a chance to capture the series. This match will be played on August 7 and it is to be held in Colombo itself. According to Indian time, this match will be played at 2:30 pm.\n\nThe pitch of Premadasa Stadium is considered the best for bowlers, good swing is seen here. The average score of the first innings on this pitch is 225 runs. In the last match, spinners dominated. Therefore, the last match is going to be very exciting.\n\nThe third and last match of the series between India and Sri Lanka will be played on 7 August. This match will also be held in Colombo. The biggest problem faced by Team India was that there is no left-handed batsman in the top order. In the first match, Washington Sundar was sent at number four, while in the second match Shivam Dubey had to come to bat at number four. No. 4 and 5 batsmen Shreyas Iyer and KL Rahul got a chance to bat after this, because both of them bat right-handed.\n\nWashington Sundar and Shivam Dubey bat very well, but they are not at least number four batsmen. Meanwhile, if Rishabh Pant was in the team's playing XI, then this problem would not have arisen, he can play regularly at number four.\n\nRishabh Pant has been included in Team India's team, but even after this he has not been given a chance in the playing XI yet. Therefore, batting was done at number four in turn. It was a risky decision, which did not work out. Sundar scored 5 runs in the first match, while Shivam Dubey could not even open his account.

India began the three-match series with a draw before losing their second game against Sri Lanka by 32 runs. In that match, Washington Sundar proved to be the most effective bowler for India having bagged three wickets. He was supported on the bowling front by Kuldeep Yadav who notched two more to help the visitors curb Sri Lanka at 240. During the run chase, skipper Rohit Sharma continued his brilliant form with a 44-ball 64. He smashed five boundaries and four sixes before being dismissed by Jeffrey Vandersay. Axar Patel stepped up later with a 44-run knock but that did not prove enough to win the fixture for India.

Kohli, who announced the retirement from T20Is after the World Cup in June, rejoined the Indian team for the ODI matches against Sri Lanka, but things have not worked out in his favour. The batting maestro struggled against spinners on the turning track in Lanka and scored 24 and 14 as India are trailing 0-1 behind in the series after losing the second ODI on Sunday. It is Kohli's first series under new head coach Gautam Gambhir, but he has not been able to make a valuable contribution to the side with the bat.\n\nFormer Pakistan cricketer Basit Ali expressed his shock on witnessing a player of Kohli's calibre getting out against spin in back-to-back matches as he feels that the Indian star has not entered the series well prepared.\n\n\"A great batsman like Virat Kohli, the world's number one batsman, has been out LBW twice. It's understandable if it happens to Iyer or Dube, but Virat Kohli is Virat Kohli. This means that he is not in practice,\" Basit said on his YouTube Channel.\n\nKohli was adjudged LBW in both matches as Wanindu Hasaranga dismissed him in the first match, and his replacement Jeffrey Vandersay got the better of him on Sunday.\n\nBasit also suggested that KL Rahul and Shreyas Iyer, who were not part of the T20I series, also came without practice for the ODI matches on turning tracks.\n\n\"It did not seem that this is the batting lineup which rules the world. I feel that Shreyas Iyer and KL Rahul probably haven't even practiced. These people have come without practice,\" he added.\n\nThe former Pakistan cricketer didn't mince his words while criticising Iyer for his back-to-back failures with bat and advised Gautam Gambhir to pick Rishabh Pant or Riyan Parag who missed the chance in playing XI in the first two matches.\n\n\"I don't understand what is Shreyas Iyer going to do with such performances. I think the time has come for Rishabh Pant, Riyan Parag, and Rinku Singh. India's 50-over domestic tournament will be vital for Gautam Gambhir because he will have to take some players from there. If India pick players based on reputation, the results won't be too good in the Champions Trophy,\" he added.\n\nThe third and final match of the series will be played on Wednesday at R.Premadasa Stadium, Colombo as India would be desperate to bounce back and tie the three-match series.", "source": {"uri": "hindustantimes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Hindustan Times"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cricket_bat", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Cricket bat"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virat_Kohli", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Virat Kohli"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Batting_(cricket)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Batting (cricket)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/One_Day_International", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "One Day International"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sri_Lanka", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Sri Lanka"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Sri Lanka"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twenty20_International", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Twenty20 International"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/India_national_cricket_team", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "India national cricket team"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spin_bowling", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Spin bowling"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gautam_Gambhir", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Gautam Gambhir"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cricket_World_Cup", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Cricket World Cup"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leg_before_wicket", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Leg before wicket"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pakistan_national_cricket_team", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Pakistan national cricket team"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cricket", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Cricket"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wanindu_Hasaranga", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Wanindu Hasaranga"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shreyas_Iyer", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Shreyas Iyer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/K._L._Rahul", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "K.

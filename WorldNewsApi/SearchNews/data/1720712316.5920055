As the weekend arrived, the Mets owner celebrated the London Series by becoming a local in the pub scene and mingling with the fans. And as badly as the season has unfolded for his underperforming team, Cohen said the Mets\u2019 fan base has \u201cbeen through worse\u201d over the years. \u201cThe fans, they love the Mets and they came all the way over here because they love the Mets and care about the Mets,\u201d Cohen said Sunday before the Mets played the Phillies at London Stadium. \u201cThey are in good spirits. \u2026 The fans have been through worse and trying to break that history. They are great and certainly are going to be here for the team.\u201d Cohen noted the fact the Mets began play nine games below .500, but also was cognizant of the wild-card race. On that count, the Mets were only four games behind for a playoff berth. Last season the Mets dismantled after the All-Star break, unloading veteran stars, but talk of what might happen at the trade deadline this year will have to wait, according to Cohen. \u201cI am focused on winning games right now,\u201d Cohen said. \u201cWe can worry about the trade deadline, that is seven weeks away, that is 45-50 games and a lot can happen so the focus right now is on the season and winning games and we\u2019ll worry about [the trade deadline] when the time comes.\u201d But Cohen acknowledged the goal should be more than just sneaking into the postseason. \u201cYou certainly want to have high standards,\u201d he said. \u201cIf you got into the playoffs and you are four games under .500, it\u2019s nice to make the playoffs and anything can happen, you know that. But still we would say, \u2018Wow that was not optimal.\u2019 Probably not the way you would envision it. But a lot of games left. I think the team is starting to show signs.\u201d Cohen praised his front office, led by president of baseball operations David Stearns for shrewd decision-making. Stearns was hired at the end of last season after building perennial playoff teams in Milwaukee. The Mets\u2019 recent addition of backup catcher Luis Torrens for $100,000 was cited by Cohen as an example of the shrewd moves orchestrated by Stearns. \u201cThe decision-making that is going on with the Mets is a lot sharper than it has been in the past, much more concise,\u201d Cohen said. \u201cA prime example is we bring in Luis Torrens and \u2026 he really helps us win a game. And when you are fighting for a playoff spot, winning one game or winning two games really matters. I like what I see, but unfortunately it\u2019s going to take time.\u201d The Mets\u2019 attendance decline of 25 percent at Citi Field has been among MLB\u2019s steepest and Cohen acknowledged that is in direct correlation to the manner in which the team has performed. \u201cIt\u2019s about winning,\u201d Cohen said. \u201cWinning solves a lot and frankly that\u2019s what we are going to have to do. New York City is a competitive marketplace. There\u2019s lots to do in New York, and to get fans to come out to the stadium you have got to give them a good product and something to get excited about. We have been spotty about that.\u201d", "summary": "As badly as the season has unfolded for his underperforming team, Cohen said the Mets' fan base has \u201cbeen through worse\u201d over the years.", "url": "https://nypost.com/2024/06/09/sports/steve-cohen-says-mets-fans-have-been-through-worse/", "image": "https://nypost.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/06/mets-cohen.jpg?quality=75&strip=all&1717925510&w=1200", "video": null, "publish_date": "2024-06-09 13:43:46", "author": "Mike Puma", "authors": ["Mike Puma"], "language": "en", "source_country": "us", "sentiment": 0.001}

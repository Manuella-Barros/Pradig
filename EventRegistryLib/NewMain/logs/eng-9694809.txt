Preparing for the assembly polls in 2026, the party will be focusing on 60 assembly segments where it secured 35,000 to 75,000 votes in the LS polls.\n\nBolstered by its performance in the recent polls, the party decided to rejuvenate the network at the grassroots ahead of the local body polls. National president J P Nadda will attend the extended state-level leaders' meet to be held in Thiruvananthapuram on July 9. Around 8,000 party leaders from panchayat committee president to state committee members will attend the meet.\n\n\"BJP's performance in the Lok Sabha election has highlighted the growing role of the party in state politics. Besides winning one seat, the party came first in 11 assembly seats and came second in 8 seats. However, nobody has noticed our performance in other seats. We secured 35,000 to 75,000 votes in 60 assembly segments. Our performance has upset both the UDF and the LDF,\" said K Surendran, BJP state president.\n\n\"CPM state secretary M V Govindan has been blaming some communities among the Hindus and Christians for the increase in BJP vote share. However, our assessment is that the marginalised sections and Christian minorities have left vote bank politics and supported development politics. ,\" he told mediapersons.\n\nAlleging that the CPM has introduced the bill for delimitation of local body wards to ensure its victory in the local body elections, he said the BJP will form committees at panchayat level to expose unscientific delimitation of wards. The party will oppose the move politically and legally.\n\nReplying to a question, Surendran said the lacklustre performance in Pathanamthitta is not because of the selection of the candidate. The BJP's performance in 2019 was largely influenced by the Sabarimala factor. The decline in polling percentage is the reason for the decrease in votes. He said the BJP's performance has been below expectations in some constituencies and the party will study the reasons.\n\nUnion ministers Suresh Gopi and George Kurian, former Union Minister V Muralidharan, Padmaja Venugopal and P C George attended the meeting.

I was criticised when I said in 2021 that the party may win around 35 seats in the then Assembly election.

The party has been able to break into the traditional vote banks of the Communist Party of India (Marxist) in this Lok Sabha poll. The people also accepted the alternative development model proposed by Prime Minister Narendra Modi, he said.\n\nIn his address, Mr. Gopi pointed out that the people have voted firmly for the party in the Lok Sabha election. The historic win in Thrissur is an indicator that a large section of voters had decided to support the party in the State.

Of the 140 assembly segments in the state, the BJP is likely to focus on 60 seats where it polled between 35,000 to 75,000 votes in the recent general elections.\n\nThe initial plans for the next round of elections were discussed at a state leadership meet held here on Saturday. The party assesses that it could make huge inroads into the scheduled caste and scheduled tribe categories as well as other backward segments in society in the general elections. The party believes that it could eat into the traditional vote bases of the Congress and the CPM too.\n\nAt a post-meet interaction with the media, BJP state president K Surendran said that the relevance of the BJP and the National Democratic Alliance (NDA) led by it has increased in Kerala with the Lok Sabha elections.\n\n\"CPM state secretary M V Govindan has repeatedly said that Hindu communities and Christians voted for the BJP. That fact is that the backward sections of society and Christians have shifted from vote bank politics to politics of development,\" Surendran said.\n\n\"CPM is trying to intimidate SNDP Yogam and its general secretary Vellappally Natesan. We will not allow the CPM to intimidate anyone. We will protect them,\" Surendran said.\n\nAlleging that the ruling CPM is attempting to delimit local body wards keeping an eye on the elections, the BJP state leadership has decided to form committees to scrutinise the delimitation process.\n\n\"The CPM is trying to overcome the Lok Sabha polls mandate through delimitation of local body wards. The government is trying to subvert the criteria for ward division,\" Surendran said. He alleged that the opposition Congress kept mum in the assembly when the ruling front discussed the delimitation matter.\n\nBJP's growth story in Kerala\n\nAcross Kerala, NDA's vote share rose to 19.21 per cent, an increase of 3.57 per cent compared with the 2019 Lok Sabha election.\n\nIn the 2019 Lok Sabha election, the BJP came first only in one of the 140 Assembly segments - Nemom in Thiruvananthapuram Lok Sabha constituency. It came second in seven assembly segments - Kasaragod and Manjeshwar in Kasaragod LS constituency; Thrissur assembly segment in Thrissur LS constituency; Adoor in Pathanamthitta; and Kazhakkoottam, Vattiyoorkavu, and Thiruvananthapuram.\n\nIn 2024, the BJP came first in 11 Assembly segments, thanks largely to its big win in Thrissur, second in nine segments in five districts, and close third (margin less than 5,000 votes) in 10 assembly segments in nine Lok Sabha constituencies. And that sets the ground for a keen three-cornered fight in 30 of the 140 assembly segments in Kerala.\n\nThe assembly segments where BJP was in number one position are Kazhakkoottam, Vattiyoorkavu and Nemom in Thiruvananthapuram LS seat; Attingal and Kattakkada in Attingal LS constituency; Manalur, Ollur, Thrissur, Nattika, Irinjalakuda, and Puthukkad in Thrissur.\n\nAssembly segments where it came second are Manjeshwar, Kasaragod, Palakkad, Haripad, Kayamkulam, Varkala, Thiruvananthapuram, Kovalam and Neyyattinkara. In Thiruvananthapuram, Parassala was the only segment where it was relegated to the third place, where it trailed the LDF by just 697 votes.", "source": {"uri": "onmanorama.com", "dataType": "news",

Nadda will be holding a brainstorming session with the Kerala unit BJP leaders to chalk out an effective strategy.\n\nThe local body poll is scheduled for 2025 and the Assembly polls the year after that.\n\nSuresh Gopi's victory came after the entire top brass of the BJP's rivals -- the ruling CPI-M-led Left Front, and the Congress-led UDF -- predicted a poor showing for the party.\n\nHowever, not only did the BJP win one seat, the silver lining was the 19.24 per cent vote share that the party got in the 2024 Lok Sabha polls, up from 15.64 per cent compared to the 2019 general elections.\n\nMeanwhile, compared to the 12.36 per cent votes the BJP got in the 2021 Assembly polls, the fresh electoral gains are impressive.\n\nThe meeting on Saturday also decided to come out with the \"best candidate\" for the soon-to-be announced dates for Assembly by-elections to two constituencies in Palakkad and Chelakkara.\n\nThe bypolls are due after two sitting legislators resigned after winning Lok Sabha elections.\n\nThe BJP has high hopes from the Palakkad seat, as in the 2021 Assembly polls, 'Metro Man' E. Sreedharan gave a close fight to Shafi Parambil, who has now resigned. Sreedharan, however, eventually lost to Parambil by around 3,000 votes.", "source": {"uri": "weeklyvoice.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Weekly Voice"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bharatiya_Janata_Party", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Bharatiya Janata Party"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kerala", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Kerala"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Kerala"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Suresh_Gopi", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Suresh Gopi"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/State_legislative_assemblies_of_India", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "State legislative assemblies of India"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Union_Council_of_Ministers", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Union Council of Ministers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lok_Sabha", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Lok Sabha"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kochi", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Kochi"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Kochi"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thrissur", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Thrissur"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Thrissur"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/J._P._Nadda", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "J.

It experienced a consistent rise in its electoral performance since its inception before seeing a decline after the 2012 UP Assembly elections.\n\nCurrently, there are six political parties recognised as national parties by the poll watchdog - BJP, BSP, Congress, AAP, National People's Party, and CPM.\n\nAccording to the Election Symbols (Reservation and Allotment) Order, 1968, a national party is one that has at least 6% of the total valid votes in four or more states in the last general election and at least four MPs; or wins at least 2% of the seats in the Lok Sabha, with the winners being from at least three states; or is a recognised state party in at least four states.\n\nWith the party failing to win any seat in the 18th Lok Sabha and getting only 2.04% of the total votes, as per the results available on the ECI website, it fails the first two criteria for retaining its national party status. The final results and statistics for the 2024 elections are yet to be published.\n\nFor the third criterion, the party has to meet the conditions for being a recognised state party in four or more states, which it also does not meet as of now. In all state Assembly elections held between 2019 and now, the BSP meets the criteria for being a state party only in Uttar Pradesh, where it won 12.88% votes in the 2022 state polls. In the 2024 Lok Sabha elections, it met the state party criteria, of having at least 8% of the valid votes polled in a particular state, in Uttar Pradesh, where it got 9.39% of the votes.\n\nAs per the Symbols Order, a state party is one which has got at least 6% of the total valid votes in a state and at least two MLAs; or at least 6% of the total valid votes polled in the state in the last Lok Sabha elections and at least one MP from that state; or at least 3% of the total seats in the Assembly or three seats, whichever is higher; or at least one MP for every 25 seats allotted to that state in the Lok Sabha; or at least 8% of the total valid votes in the last Lok Sabha election in that particular state or Assembly election.\n\nThe EC will start the review process after the statistical reports of the 2024 elections are published, expected in a month's time, sources said.\n\nThe BSP's national footprint has shrunk significantly over the last four Lok Sabha elections. In 2009, the party won 21 seats with a vote share of 6.17%, but its seats tally was reduced to zero and 4.19% vote share in 2014. In the 2019 Lok Sabha elections when the party had an alliance with the SP, BSP won 10 seats and cornered 3.66% of the vote share.\n\nThis is not the first time that BSP's national status is under scanner. In 2014, when it also had no seat in Lok Sabha and 4.19% vote share, it could have lost its national party status, but an amendment made by EC in 2016 came to its rescue.\n\nPost the 2014 elections, the Symbols Order was amended in 2016 with effect from January 1, 2014 saying that a party's national or state recognition would not be reviewed in the first election after the one in which they gain the status, meaning the first review would be after 10 years. This benefit was given to all parties, even the BSP, which became a national party in 1997.\n\nThe next review took place after the 2019 Lok Sabha elections and the BSP was able to retain its national status as it was a state party in four or more states based on results of the last two cycles of Assembly polls, not just the most recent cycle.\n\nWhen asked about the national party recognition of the BSP after its poor show in the Lok Sabha polls, BSP Uttar Pradesh state president Vishwanath Pal said: \"There are some rules related to vote share for national and state party status. But the Election Commission only can tell about these rules and the future status of the party.\"\n\nAn EC spokesperson did not respond to requests for comment.\n\nThe review process usually takes months after the Lok Sabha elections as the EC reviews the performance of parties and gives them an opportunity to respond, before deciding, sources said.\n\nWhile the process had started in late 2019 after the Lok Sabha elections that year, the results were only announced in April 2023, when the Aam Aadmi Party was given national status and the Communist Party of India, the Nationalist Congress Party and the Trinamool Congress lost their national party tags.\n\nAs a national party, a political party gets certain benefits, including the guaranteed use of their common election symbol for candidates across the country, land or accommodation for an office in Delhi, free copies of the electoral roll and airtime on Doordarshan and All-India Radio during elections.\n\nIn the case of state parties, they are given free copies of the electoral roll in their respective states and airtime in the regional centres of the public broadcasters.", "source": {"uri": "indianexpress.com",

It has formulated an action plan to make inroads into these party villages.\n\nThe BJP was able to increase its vote shares in many party villages which also included CM Pinarayi Vijayan's constituency in the Lok Sabha polls.\n\nTaking into account the people's concerns and assessing general trends, the party is trying to take advantage of the allegations against CPI-M leaders related to bomb politics, gold smuggling, and quotation gangs. During the Sabarimala issue, the problems within CPI-M and the general mood of the people benefited the Congress.\n\nDuring the Lok Sabha polls, the anti-incumbency factor and the corruption charges against the CPI-M leaders benefitted the BJP too. In Thiruvananthapuram, Attingal, and Alappuzha, despite being defeated, the party was able to increase its vote share substantially.\n\nCPI-M's traditional Ezhava vote bank suffered a big crack in the recent Lok Sabha elections. A substantial number of votes polled went in favour of the BJP in Alappuzha and Atingal.\n\nThe BJP was also able to maintain and increase its upper caste vote base, including the Nair votes, and was also successful in getting Christian votes.\n\nIn many CPI-M strongholds in Malabar like Uduma, Thrikaripur, Payyannur, Dharmadam, and Taliparamba, the party increased its votes by four times more than that they received in the 2019 LS polls. Its vote increased even in party villages which also included CM Pinarayi Vijayan's Dharmadam constituency.\n\nThe BJP was feeble in their election campaign in CPI-M strongholds, but the vote surge has raised many an eyebrow. It has been pointed out that the voters in these CPI-M strongholds were voluntarily voting for the saffron party even in the absence of booth-level campaigning by BJP workers. The reason for this is the dissatisfaction of the rank and file with the CPI-M leadership, and the BJP leadership is making efforts to take advantage of it.\n\nThe saffron party has decided to send its senior leaders to the so-called party villages and strengthen its activities in these places. Former BJP state president PK Krishnadas will coordinate these activities in Malabar.\n\nSources said the BJP would welcome the local leaders of the CPI-M, who are dissatisfied with the functioning of the party, to its fold.\n\nBolstered by its performance in the recent polls, the BJP will focus on 60 assembly seats where it polled between 35,000 to 75,000 votes in the recent general elections.\n\nBJP President J P Nadda will attend a state-level leaders' meeting to be held in Thiruvananthapuram on July 9. Around 8,000 party leaders from the panchayat committee president to state committee members will attend the meeting.", "source": {"uri": "thestatesman.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Statesman"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saffron", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Saffron"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Communist_Party_of_India_(Marxist)", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Communist Party of India (Marxist)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lok_Sabha", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Lok Sabha"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bharatiya_Janata_Party", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Bharatiya Janata Party"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chief_minister", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Chief minister"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pinarayi_Vijayan", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Pinarayi Vijayan"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electoral_district", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Electoral district"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alappuzha", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Alappuzha"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Alappuzha"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kerala", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Kerala"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Kerala"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thrikaripur", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Thrikaripur"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christians", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Christians"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Udma", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Udma"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ezhava", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Ezhava"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malabar_Coast", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Malabar Coast"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nair", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Nair"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indian_National_Congress", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Indian National Congress"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caste", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Caste"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Corruption", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Corruption"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gold", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Gold"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Attingal", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Attingal"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Attingal"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dharmadom", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Dharmadom"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Dharmadom"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Payyanur", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Payyanur"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Payyanur"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thiruvananthapuram", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Thiruvananthapuram"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Thiruvananthapuram"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Panchayati_raj_in_India", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Panchayati raj in India"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taliparamba", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Taliparamba"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Taliparamba"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Parties/Planning", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Parties/Planning", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Children/Parties", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Children/Parties", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Home/Entertaining/Party_Planning", "label": "dmoz/Home/Entertaining/Party Planning", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Home/Entertaining/Children", "label": "dmoz/Home/Entertaining/Children", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 98}], "image": "https://www.thestatesman.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/IMG_0574.jpeg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9694809", "eventUri": "eng-9694809", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-07-09", "textStart": 3077, "textEnd": 3083}], "sentiment": 0.2392156862745098, "wgt": 156, "relevance": 1}

its own AFL side within a decade", "body": "The Northern Territory's AFL peak body says the NT could see its own AFL team take to the field within the next decade, as it releases a road map including plans for a new city stadium.\n\nA business case published on Thursday recommends the federal government be asked to help fund construction of a long-mooted stadium in Darwin's CBD, in the hopes it would make an NT bid for a 20th AFL licence more compelling.\n\nIt says construction of a new stadium within the next seven to 10 years could cost between $700 million and $735 million.\n\nIt comes after Tasmania was awarded the 19th licence last year, despite plans to build a new waterfront stadium in Hobart being met with resistance.\n\nThe 210-page report envisages a new NT side could enter the competition \"shortly after Tasmania in 2028\", but would need the federal government to \"support the delivery of the key stadium and other infrastructure\" in both Darwin and Alice Springs.\n\nAnnouncing the plan at a press conference on Thursday, AFL NT chairman Sean Bowden said the economic case for an NT team was \"very strong\".\n\n\"Ultimately, the biggest challenges for us are going to be ... making sure our talent pathways are strong, the conditioning of players, and just winning the belief of the national competition that this is the right place and that we can take our rightful place in that competition.\"\n\nNT Chief Minister Eva Lawler said the business case showed an NT-based side would be a net-positive for the territory economy, and spruiked its potential to lead to better social and health outcomes for the NT.\n\n\"That business case shows that the value of an AFL team would be about $116 million per annum to the Northern Territory, and it would employ around 160 people every year,\" Ms Lawler said.\n\nAfter the NT last year lost thousands of people to interstate migration, Ms Lawler also argued an AFL side could address the NT's \"liveability factor\" and help retain more people in the territory.\n\nBut Mr Bowden also said the push to establish a team in Darwin and Alice Springs would need support from the AFL, its teams and the broader community.\n\n\"The talent that is just imbued in the Northern Territory amongst so many of our young people has to have that opportunity,\" he said.\n\n\"Talent pathways are critical.\n\nHe said a new CBD stadium would \"realise the full ambition\" for the AFL side, and could even attract visitors from South East Asia.\n\nThe AFL NT team taskforce that helped complete the business case includes some of the biggest names in AFL, including former AFL chief executive Andrew Demetriou, Collingwood star Nathan Buckley and Adelaide Crows player Andrew McLeod.", "source":

The NT is less populated and wealthy than Tasmania, which for a long time was viewed as too small a market for an AFL team, and is still working through the AFL-mandated construction of a new stadium in Hobart.\n\nThe business case acknowledges an $18.89 million per year funding gap, meaning additional AFL, territory and federal funding is likely to be required for the team to operate.\n\nIt expects the team, once operational, to involve 165 jobs on and off the field and 180 indirect employees, while also conceding a number of risks.\n\nThese include needing a fit-for-purpose stadium, commercial viability, Indigenous community support and the team to perform well, noting: \"Expansion teams in the AFL have experienced mixed successes in terms of performance. Sustained poor on and off field performance of a NT Club may have a detrimental impact on its long-term success and viability.\"\n\nThe AFL is viewed as likely to grant a 20th license to allow the creation of a 10th weekly game, which would add millions to their media deals and help pay for the new clubs.\n\nAFL CEO Andrew Dillon talked down the idea of a third club in Western Australia last month, even though it has arguably the strongest financial case due to a large footy fanbase and the benefits of playing more than one game a week at Optus Stadium.

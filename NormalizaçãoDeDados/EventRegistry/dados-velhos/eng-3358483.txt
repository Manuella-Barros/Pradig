navy fired two warning shots after a migrant rescue ship was seen patrolling near Libyan waters on Monday.\n\nOpen Arms, a humanitarian aid vessel belong to the Spanish NGO ProActiva said it was chased away by Libyan coast guards although it was within its territorial bounds at around 1.5 miles Libyan territorial waters.\n\nIn a statement, the Libyan navy said the Open Arms rescue boat was within the remit of the Libyan Coast Guard's search and rescue operation and asked the boat to leave. When it didn't, they opened fire into the air.\n\nThe Libyan Coast Guard said the Open Arms ship had been \"wishing for a precious trophy\" of illegal immigrants.\n\nSpeaking to CNN by phone on Tuesday, Libyan Brigadier Qassem said, \"We are capable of conducting rescue work. Our presence cancels their presence.\"\n\n\"We are fed up with these organizations. They increased the number of immigrants and empowered smugglers. Meanwhile, they criticize us for not respecting human rights,\" he added.\n\nA source close to Gen.

Doctors Without Borders (MSF) said on Saturday it was suspending its migrant rescues in the Mediterranean because it felt threatened by the Libyan coastguard and the Italian government's policies have made its job harder.\n\nThe aid group's decision is the latest development in mounting tensions between Rome and NGOs as migration dominates Italy's political agenda ahead of elections early next year.\n\n\"We are suspending our activities because now we feel that the threatening behaviour by the Libyan coastguard is very serious ... we cannot put our colleagues in danger,\" the president of MSF's Italian arm Loris De Filippi told Reuters.\n\nAlmost 600,000 migrants have arrived in Italy over the past four years, the vast majority setting sail from lawless Libya in flimsy vessels operated by people smugglers. More than 13,000 migrants have died trying to make the crossing.\n\nCharity boats have played a growing role in rescues, picking up more than a third of all migrants brought ashore so far this year against less than one percent in 2014.\n\nHowever, Italy fears the groups are facilitating people smuggling and encouraging migrants to make the passage, and it has proposed a Code of Conduct governing how they operate.\n\nSome groups, including MSF, have refused to sign the code.\n\nThey object to a requirement that Italian police officers be on their boats and that the boats must take migrants to a safe port themselves, rather than transferring them to other vessels to allow smaller boats to stay in the area for further rescues.\n\nMSF operates one rescue ship in the Mediterranean, the Prudence, currently docked in the Sicilian port of Catania.\n\nIn the last six weeks the number of migrant arrivals in Italy has slowed sharply and Rome has begun collaborating more closely with the Libyan coastguard, which De Filippi said was threatening the NGOs and preventing them from working.\n\nHe said the Libyan coastguard had demanded the NGOs should leave an area of up to hundreds of kilometres around its coast, whereas previously they had been allowed to conduct search and rescue operations as close as 11 nautical miles to the mainland.\n\n\"Last year the coastguard fired 13 shots on our boat and that was in a situation that was much calmer than the present one,\" said De Filippi.\n\nHe said MSF would continue its collaboration with another aid group, SOS Mediterranee, which operates a rescue ship in the Mediterranean with MSF doctors on board.\n\nDe Filippi said the Rome government's Code of Conduct for NGOs and its support for the Libyan coastguard showed it was now mixing the humanitarian goal of saving lives with \"a political and military intention\" of reducing arrivals.\n\n\"We refuse to be co-opted into a system that blocks people from seeking safety and protection,\" MSF tweeted, adding that the European Union's immigration policies showed it was \"determined to trap people in Libya.\"\n\nOscar Camps, the founder of Proactiva Open Arms, another aid group active in the Mediterranean, also took aim at the EU, tweeting: \"the first NGO out, this is just what the EU wants.\"\n\nAn Italian government spokesman was not immediately available to comment, while Matteo Salvini, leader of the anti-immigrant Northern League, said MSF's move meant there would be \"thousands fewer illegal immigrants for Italians to maintain.\"\n\nLast week Italy began a naval mission in Libyan waters to train and support its coastguard, despite opposition from factions in eastern Libya that oppose the U.N.-backed government based in Tripoli.\n\nGeneral Khalifa Haftar, a commander aligned with an Eastern-based parliament, told Italian daily Corriere della Sera on Saturday the presence of Italian military vessels in Libyan waters was unacceptable but he would not attack them.", "timeCrawl": "17:14:00", "sim": 0.8039215803146362, "extractedDates": null, "location": {"country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Italy"}}, "type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Rome"}}, "originalArticle": null, "date": "2017-08-12", "id": "8821673", "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Health/Public_Health_and_Safety/Emergency_Services", "label": "dmoz/Health/Public Health and Safety/Emergency Services", "id": 110, "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Immigration", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Immigration", "id": 318, "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Pets/Dogs", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Pets/Dogs", "id": 542, "wgt": 100}], "details": {}}

Anything less than four wins should not even be a consideration.\n\nDo you agree?\n\nThe Boks hammered a feeble French outfit three-zero. It was a job well done. They didn't just beat them; they smashed them.\n\nThe Boks were always in control of the series. The physicality was imposing, the gainline collisions were dominant and the brute strength combined with rugby intelligence to make for an emphatic statement of Springbok intent.\n\nFrance ordinarily are difficult opponents but it wasn't lost on the Springboks, their management or their support base that the French squad that arrived in South Africa wanted to be anywhere in the world but in South Africa.\n\nThe Springboks still had to play well to be convincing winners. They had to play well to ensure the stadium attendance grew with every Test. It was a struggle to get 25 000 to Loftus for the first Test against France but a fortnight later 55 000 were at Ellis Park as the Boks again won easily.\n\nThe Lions - and to a lesser degree the Stormers - continued the Ellis Park third Test momentum in Super Rugby's final month.\n\nNow the Springboks must again continue the Lions Super Rugby final appeal, which saw Ellis Park sold out and a South African rugby public put aside provincialism and unite behind the red of the Lions.\n\nThe Springboks will be in unfamiliar red when they play the Pumas in Argentina in a fortnight but the colour of the jersey should have no bearing on the outcome of the Test match.\n\nThe Springboks, horrific in 2016, have won back the faith and trust of the South African rugby public by way of their three-Test demolition of France.\n\nFurther victories are necessary in the Rugby Championship. Beating the All Blacks would be simply wonderful, but at this juncture it would be a bonus in the resurrection of these Springboks.\n\nI don't see the All Blacks losing at home to the Springboks but I do see the Springboks having the potential to beat the All Blacks at Newlands or, worst case scenario, coming within a score of toppling the world's best team.\n\nVictories, home and away against Argentina and Australia, simply have to be viewed as non-negotiable.\n\nAustralian rugby is at its lowest point in professionalism and the Wallabies, in the June international window, were as awful as their Super Rugby franchises.\n\nThe Wallabies lost in Sydney to Scotland and were leading Italy by a point with just five minutes to go.\n\nArgentina were as disjointed in losing a home series 2-0 to an England set-up that lost 15 players to the British and Irish Lions tour of New Zealand.\n\nThe Pumas and Wallabies currently are not strong enough to come to South Africa and beat the Springboks. Equally, the Boks are good enough to travel to Argentina and Australia expecting (and not hoping) to win.\n\nThe biggest challenge remains being competitive in New Zealand against the All Blacks and getting a rare win against the men in black in South Africa.\n\nFour wins from six is par for the Rugby Championship. Five wins is progress and six from six... utopia for South Africa, even if it has been standard fare for the All Blacks on too many occasions in the Rugby Championship.\n\nSpringbok coach Allister Coetzee has largely invested in those players who dealt with France but it would be na\u00efve to believe what worked against France will translate to success in the Rugby Championship.\n\nNew Zealand, Argentina and even Australia will offer more mongrel and intent than France. I just don't think the latter two have the playing squads currently to pose genuine threats of winning in South Africa.\n\nIt all depends on how quickly the Boks come together in Port Elizabeth in the August 19 Rugby Championship opening round against the Pumas.\n\nI'm still not convinced about the collective team back three skills of those three individuals who played against the French.\n\nI believe there are better players to select and a combination with more presence and Test pedigree. I'd be very surprised if the back three looks the same by the time the Boks visit New Zealand.\n\nThe Boks, two months ago, looked very dynamic at No 7 and No 8 with the option of Duane Vermeulen and Warren Whiteley. Both are injured and both will be missed.\n\nWhiteley's absence does change the dynamic in so many ways, especially after we got a hint of how the Boks operate under his leadership.\n\nThe duo's enforced unavailability offers opportunity to the young Du Preez twins, but this is a Rugby Championship in which the likes of captain Eben Etzebeth and hooker Malcolm Marx must be at the forefront of everything that is good about the Boks.\n\nThe French series win will seem a lifetime away if there are unexpected wobbles in the Rugby Championship, which is why this Rugby Championship must be one of expectation and not potential excuses.\n\nThe expectation has to be at least four wins if the Springboks resurrection of 2017 is to be considered real.\n\nMark Keohane is a Cape-Town based award-winning rugby specialist and former Springbok Communications Manager.

the activity of its rescue ship due to alleged threats from Libya's coast guard, which has become more aggressive in patrolling the coasts where human traffickers launch boats crowded with migrants desperate to reach Europe.\n\nThe humanitarian group said the rescue coordination center operated by Italy's coast guard had informed it on Friday that the Libyan threats pose a security risk. The group added that Libyan authorities declared their own rescue area, extending into international waters, the same day.\n\nDoctors Without Borders says its medical crew will keep working from a ship operated by another aid group while its own vessel, Prudence, is not involved in migrant rescues.\n\nThe Italian government agreed last month to dispatch a naval mission to assist the Libyan coast guard with anti-smuggler patrols. Hundreds of thousands of rescued asylum-seekers, many of them fleeing poverty in Africa, have been brought to safety in Italian ports in recent years.\n\nThe government also has pressured rescue groups to sign on to rules that would forbid them from entering Libyan waters to save migrants without specific authorization and require them to agree that armed Italian judicial authorities may board their ships.\n\nItaly is requiring groups operating rescue ships to subscribe to the rules else or risk not being allowed to dock in Italian ports. Doctors Without Borders has refused to endorse the rules, while some other humanitarian groups have given their approval.\n\nCritics of the new policies say they could put lives at risk by delaying rescues in Libyan waters. They also contend that if the Libyan coast guard blocks smugglers' boats, migrants will be returned to inhumane conditions, including beatings and forced labor, in Libyan detention centers.\n\n\"If humanitarian ships are pushed out of the Mediterranean, there will be fewer ships ready to aid persons before they drown,\" Doctors Without Borders Italy President Loris De Filippi said in a statement. \"And whoever doesn't drown will be intercepted and brought back to Libya, which we know to be a place of absent legality, arbitrary detention and extreme violence.\"\n\nA Spanish humanitarian group, Proactiva Open Arms, said the Libyan coast guard ordered its rescue ship to move north and fired warning shots last week when the vessel was involved in search-and-rescue work outside of Libyan territory.\n\nHumanitarian groups have had ships monitoring the Mediterranean Sea outside of Libya's territorial waters to help rescue migrants from smugglers' boats in distress. The Italian coast guard coordinates the rescues, including those conducted by naval vessels from other European countries.\n\nAnti-migrant sentiment has been rising in Italy, where newcomers from Africa and the Middle East are being blamed for crimes.\n\nItalian news agency ANSA reported Saturday that Italian authorities have issued an arrest warrant for a Somali man who had applied for asylum in Sicily. The asylum-seeker was identified as one of some 50 Somalis wanted for the 2011 hijacking of an Italian oil tanker off the coast of Somalia.\n\nANSA said the man's fingerprints matched ones taken from the hijacked tanker.

Image: AP\n\nA SECOND HUMANITARIAN group in two days has reluctantly decided to suspend migrant rescues in the Mediterranean Sea due to Libyan threats, and other charities with rescue ships were today considering doing the same.\n\nGermany-based Sea-Eye said it made the decision to halt its water rescues \"with a heavy heart,\" but for the sake of its crew's safety.\n\nSea-Eye cited the \"changed security situation in the Western Mediterranean\" following the Tripoli-based government's announcement it was extending its territorial waters.\n\nSave the Children said its rescue ship was staying in Malta after Libya declared that its search-and-rescue area now will extend far beyond the 12 nautical miles Italy and other countries consider the limit of its territorial waters.\n\nLibya also proclaimed its intention to \"extend its control and prohibition of NGO ships in international waters,\" according to Save the Children, which is evaluating whether to stop its ship's patrols.\n\nYesterday, M\u00e9decins Sans Fronti\u00e8res (Doctors Without Borders) also cited Libyan threats in suspending its sea rescue activities. A Spanish aid group's rescue ship reported that the Libyan coast guard last week fired warning shots at them while the vessel was in international waters.\n\nSource: AP\n\nHumanitarian groups worry that if migrants are blocked at sea after setting out from Libyan shores in smugglers' unseaworthy boats, they risk drowning without rescue ships nearby.\n\nThey also fear that migrants will be mistreated in Libyan detention centers if they are thwarted from leaving the North African country.\n\nThe Italian Parliament recently approved the center-left government's request to send a naval mission to Libya to help the Libyan coast guard patrol its coast for migrant smugglers.\n\nIn an interview published today in La Stampa daily newspaper, Italian Foreign Minister Angelino Alfano was quoted as saying, \"We must avoid deaths at sea by reducing the departures\" from Libya.\n\n\"We made two choices: that of taking away criminal earnings from traffickers - because fewer persons departing mean the traffickers earn less - and that of financing the UN agencies\" working with refugees and migrants to \"assure respect for human rights in the Libyan camps\".\n\nSome rescued migrants have told Italian judicial authorities that while waiting months for a chance to get on the smugglers' boats, they suffered from scarce rations, forced labor, rape, beating and torture.\n\nSave the Children said it was seeking guarantees it could safely carry out effective rescue operations, and expressed worry for \"the possibility that migrants are brought back to Libya, that's not considered a safe place where fundamental human rights are respected\".\n\nAfter hundreds of thousands of migrants rescued from foundering boats were brought to Italian ports in the last few years, Italians have become worried about the costs of caring for asylum-seekers in a country where unemployment is high and the economy is flat.\n\nWith elections due next year, Italian politicians of most stripes are advocating strategies to choke off the flow of migrants attempting to cross the Mediterranean Sea.\n\nRead: Six migrants found in the back of a refrigeration truck in Laois Read: At least 56 people die after human traffickers force 300 off boats and into the sea", "timeCrawl": "17:42:00", "sim": 0.7882353067398071, "extractedDates": null, "location": null, "originalArticle": null, "date": "2017-08-13", "id": "8948573", "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Health/Public_Health_and_Safety/Emergency_Services", "label": "dmoz/Health/Public Health and Safety/Emergency Services", "id": 110, "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Pets/Dogs", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Pets/Dogs", "id": 542, "wgt": 100}], "details": {}}

Doctors Without Borders said Saturday it is temporarily suspending the activity of its rescue ship due to alleged threats from Libya's coast guard, which has become more aggressive in patrolling the coasts where human traffickers launch boats crowded with migrants desperate to reach Europe.\n\nThe humanitarian group said the rescue co-ordinationcentre operated by Italy's coast guard had informed it on Friday that the Libyan threats pose a security risk. The group added that Libyan authorities declared their own rescue area, extending into international waters, the same day.\n\nDoctors Without Borders says its medical crew will keep working from a ship operated by another aid group while its own vessel, Prudence, is not involved in migrant rescues.\n\nThe Italian government agreed last month to dispatch a naval mission to assist the Libyan coast guard with anti-smuggler patrols. Hundreds of thousands of rescued asylum-seekers, many of them fleeing poverty in Africa, have been brought to safety in Italian ports in recent years.\n\nThe government also has pressured rescue groups to sign on to rules that would forbid them from entering Libyan waters to save migrants without specific authorization and require them to agree that armed Italian judicial authorities may board their ships.\n\nItaly is requiring groups operating rescue ships to subscribe to the rules else or risk not being allowed to dock in Italian ports. Doctors Without Borders has refused to endorse the rules, while some other humanitarian groups have given their approval.\n\nCritics of the new policies say they could put lives at risk by delaying rescues in Libyan waters. They also contend that if the Libyan coast guard blocks smugglers' boats, migrants will be returned to inhumane conditions, including beatings and forced labour, in Libyan detention centres.\n\n\"If humanitarian ships are pushed out of the Mediterranean, there will be fewer ships ready to aid persons before they drown,\" Doctors Without Borders Italy President Loris De Filippi said in a statement. \"And whoever doesn't drown will be intercepted and brought back to Libya, which we know to be a place of absent legality, arbitrary detention and extreme violence.\"\n\nA Spanish humanitarian group, Proactiva Open Arms, said the Libyan coast guard ordered its rescue ship to move north and fired warning shots last week when the vessel was involved in search-and-rescue work outside of Libyan territory.\n\nHumanitarian groups have had ships monitoring the Mediterranean Sea outside of Libya's territorial waters to help rescue migrants from smugglers' boats in distress. The Italian coast guard co-ordinates the rescues, including those conducted by naval vessels from other European countries.\n\nAnti-migrant sentiment has been rising in Italy, where newcomers from Africa and the Middle East are being blamed for crimes.\n\nItalian news agency ANSA reported Saturday that Italian authorities have issued an arrest warrant for a Somali man who had applied for asylum in Sicily. The asylum-seeker was identified as one of some 50 Somalis wanted for the 2011 hijacking of an Italian oil tanker off the coast of Somalia.\n\nANSA said the man's fingerprints matched ones taken from the hijacked tanker.

Two non-governmental organizations have said they are suspending migrant search and rescue operations in the Mediterranean because they feel threatened by the Libyan authorities.\n\nGermany-based NGO Sea-Eye cited an \"explicit threat\" to humanitarian organizations from the Libyan government as it announced its decision Sunday in a statement on its official Facebook page.\n\n\"We decided with a heavy heart to temporarily suspend our planned rescue missions in the Mediterranean,\" the group's founder Michael Buschheuer said.\n\n\"The reason for this is the changed security situation in the Western Mediterranean, after the Libyan Government announced an indefinite and unilateral extension of their territorial waters -- in connection with an explicit threat against the private NGOs. Under these circumstances, a continuation of our rescue work is not currently possible. It would be irresponsible towards our crews.\"\n\nThe announcement came a day after a similar decision was made by Doctors Without Borders, also known as M\u00e9decins Sans Fronti\u00e8res, or MSF.\n\nMSF said Libyan authorities had announced the establishment of a search and rescue zone on Friday, and restricted access to humanitarian vessels into the international waters off the Libyan coast.\n\n\"If these declarations are confirmed and the orders are implemented we see two grave consequences -- there will be more deaths at sea and more people trapped in Libya,\" said Annemarie Loof, operational manager for MSF.\n\nLibya is a popular jumping-off point for migrants hoping to reach European shores. Many of them are fleeing war and persecution while others are seeking better economic opportunities. The North African country is a well-established base for a human trafficking operation that sees smugglers operating with more ease because of the country's lack of effective central governance.\n\nMSF said Saturday that it had been warned there was a security risk by the Italian Maritime Rescue Coordination Center in Rome.\n\nThe humanitarian organization said it had asked Libyan authorities to adhere to the internationally recognized legal obligation to rescue boats in distress, and to allow this to take place in international and Libyan waters.\n\n\"MSF further requests that Libyan authorities clarify that all boats, operated by NGOs or anyone else, will be permitted to conduct these rescue activities unhindered and unharmed and that the Libyan nor Italian authorities will interfere with the legally guaranteed right to disembark people in a place of safety,\" it said in a statement.\n\nMSF said its medical support team would still assist in rescues aboard the SOS M\u00e9diterran\u00e9e-run boat Aquarius, which is currently patrolling in international waters.\n\nThe suspension of rescue operations by Sea-Eye and MSF comes less than a week after a Spanish NGO, ProActiva, said two of its ships were chased away by Libyan coast guards.\n\nThe Libyan navy confirmed that it had fired two warning shots in the air to scare away a Spanish NGO ship near Tripoli on Monday morning.\n\nProActiva said the ship concerned was the Open Arms, which was outside Libyan territorial waters, 13.5 nautical miles off the Libyan coast. The Libyan navy said the vessel was at the border of territorial waters and refused to comply to orders to leave the area.\n\n\"Even if they were 13 nautical miles away, they were still within the premise of Libyan search and rescue operations. They don't have permission to work there,\" Brigadier Ayoub Qassem, a spokesman for the Libyan Navy, told CNN on Tuesday.\n\nThe Italian government announced earlier this month that it would deploy two military ships to Libya in an effort to deter illegal migration and human smuggling into Europe. Humanitarian groups warned that the move would expose migrants to more danger on an already treacherous journey.\n\nThe vast majority of those reaching Europe this year have landed in Italy, according to the International Organization for Migration. As of August 9, at least 2,242 migrants had died this year attempting the Central Mediterranean crossing, according to its estimates.", "timeCrawl": "14:51:00", "sim": 0.7803921699523926, "extractedDates": [{"textStart": 3973, "date": "2017-08-09", "imp": true, "amb": false, "textEnd": 3981}], "location": null, "originalArticle": null, "date": "2017-08-13", "id": "8929283", "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Health/Public_Health_and_Safety", "label": "dmoz/Health/Public Health and Safety", "id": 109, "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Public_Health_and_Safety/Emergency_Services", "label": "dmoz/Health/Public Health and Safety/Emergency Services", "id": 110, "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Pets/Dogs", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Pets/Dogs", "id": 542, "wgt": 100}], "details": {}}

inhuman conditions in detention camps on the Libyan mainland\n\n* Save the Children, Sea Eye halt rescue operations\n\n* Migration is dominating political agenda in Italy\n\nBy Gavin Jones\n\nROME, Aug 13 (Reuters) - Two more aid groups have suspended migrant rescues in the Mediterranean, joining Doctors Without Borders, because they felt threatened by the Libyan coastguard.\n\nSave the Children and Germany's Sea Watch said on Sunday their crews could no longer work safely because of the hostile stance of the Libyan authorities. Doctors Without Borders - or Medecins sans Frontieres - cited the same concern when it said on Saturday it would halt Mediterranean operations.\n\n\"We leave a deadly gap in the Mediterranean,\" Sea Watch's founder Michael Busch Heuer warned on Facebook, adding that Libya had issued an \"explicit threat\" against non-government organisations operating in the area around its coast.\n\nTension has been growing for weeks between aid groups and the Italian government, which has suggested some NGOs are facilitating people smuggling and is trying to enhance the role of the Libyan coastguard in blocking migrant departures.\n\nThis month, Italy began a naval mission in Libyan waters to train and support its coastguard, despite opposition from factions in eastern Libya that oppose the U.N.-backed government based in Tripoli.\n\nImmigration is dominating Italy's political agenda before elections early next year, with public opinion increasingly hostile to migrants. Almost 600,000 migrants have arrived in Italy over the past four years.\n\nMost sailed from lawless Libya in flimsy vessels operated by people smugglers. More than 13,000 migrants have died trying to make the crossing.\n\nShips manned by charities have played a growing role in rescues, picking up more than a third of all migrants brought ashore so far this year, compared with less than one percent in 2014.\n\nAid groups and some Italian politicians warn that migrants intercepted by the Libyan coast guard are taken back to inhuman conditions in detention camps on the Libyan mainland.\n\nHowever, prosecutors in Sicily have opened investigations against some NGOs, which they suspect of collaborating with people smugglers, and Rome has proposed a Code of Conduct setting stricter rules on how the groups can operate.\n\nItalian Foreign Minister Angelino Alfano said in a newspaper interview on Sunday that Libya's growing role in controlling its waters was curbing people trafficking and producing a welcome \"readjustment\" in the Mediterranean.\n\nMSF's decision to halt its rescue operations was part of this positive process, he told daily La Stampa.\n\nSave the Children said its rescue ship, the Vos Hestia, would dock in Malta until it received assurances about the intentions of the Libyan authorities.\n\nLibya was trying to increase the range of the waters its ships controlled from 12 nautical miles around its coast to 70 nautical miles, the humanitarian organisation said.\n\n\"The necessary pause in operations from charity rescue ships likes ours and others will undoubtedly put lives at risk,\" its operations director Rob MacGillivray warned.", "timeCrawl": "16:28:00", "sim": 0.7764706015586853, "extractedDates": [{"textStart": 276, "date": "2017-08-13", "imp": true, "amb": false, "textEnd": 282}], "location": null, "originalArticle": null, "date": "2017-08-13", "id": "8940386", "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Health/Public_Health_and_Safety/Emergency_Services", "label": "dmoz/Health/Public Health and Safety/Emergency Services", "id": 110, "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Transportation_and_Logistics/Maritime", "label": "dmoz/Business/Transportation and Logistics/Maritime", "id": 288, "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Health", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Health", "id": 289, "wgt": 100}], "details": {}}

-- Two non-governmental organizations have said they are suspending migrant search and rescue operations in the Mediterranean because they feel threatened by the Libyan authorities.\n\nGermany-based NGO Sea-Eye cited an \"explicit threat\" to humanitarian organizations from the Libyan government as it announced its decision Sunday in a statement on its official Facebook page.\n\n\"We decided with a heavy heart to temporarily suspend our planned rescue missions in the Mediterranean,\" the group's founder Michael Buschheuer said.\n\n\"The reason for this is the changed security situation in the Western Mediterranean, after the Libyan Government announced an indefinite and unilateral extension of their territorial waters -- in connection with an explicit threat against the private NGOs. Under these circumstances, a continuation of our rescue work is not currently possible. It would be irresponsible towards our crews.\"\n\nThe announcement came a day after a similar decision was made by Doctors Without Borders, also known as M\u00e9decins Sans Fronti\u00e8res, or MSF.\n\nMSF said Libyan authorities had announced the establishment of a search and rescue zone on Friday, and restricted access to humanitarian vessels into the international waters off the Libyan coast.\n\n\"If these declarations are confirmed and the orders are implemented we see two grave consequences -- there will be more deaths at sea and more people trapped in Libya,\" said Annemarie Loof, operational manager for MSF.\n\nLibya is a popular jumping-off point for migrants hoping to reach European shores. Many of them are fleeing war and persecution while others are seeking better economic opportunities. The North African country is a well-established base for a human trafficking operation that sees smugglers operating with more ease because of the country's lack of effective central governance.\n\n'Security risk'\n\nMSF said Saturday that it had been warned there was a security risk by the Italian Maritime Rescue Coordination Center in Rome.\n\nThe humanitarian organization said it had asked Libyan authorities to adhere to the internationally recognized legal obligation to rescue boats in distress, and to allow this to take place in international and Libyan waters.\n\n\"MSF further requests that Libyan authorities clarify that all boats, operated by NGOs or anyone else, will be permitted to conduct these rescue activities unhindered and unharmed and that the Libyan nor Italian authorities will interfere with the legally guaranteed right to disembark people in a place of safety,\" it said in a statement.\n\nMSF said its medical support team would still assist in rescues aboard the SOS M\u00e9diterran\u00e9e-run boat Aquarius, which is currently patrolling in international waters.\n\nLibyan navy fires shots\n\nThe suspension of rescue operations by Sea-Eye and MSF comes less than a week after a Spanish NGO, ProActiva, said two of its ships were chased away by Libyan coast guards.\n\nThe Libyan navy confirmed that it had fired two warning shots in the air to scare away a Spanish NGO ship near Tripoli on Monday morning.\n\nProActiva said the ship concerned was the Open Arms, which was outside Libyan territorial waters, 13.5 nautical miles off the Libyan coast. The Libyan navy said the vessel was at the border of territorial waters and refused to comply to orders to leave the area.\n\n\"Even if they were 13 nautical miles away, they were still within the premise of Libyan search and rescue operations. They don't have permission to work there,\" Brigadier Ayoub Qassem, a spokesman for the Libyan Navy, told CNN on Tuesday.\n\nThe Italian government announced earlier this month that it would deploy two military ships to Libya in an effort to deter illegal migration and human smuggling into Europe. Humanitarian groups warned that the move would expose migrants to more danger on an already treacherous journey.\n\nThe vast majority of those reaching Europe this year have landed in Italy, according to the International Organization for Migration. As of August 9, at least 2,242 migrants had died this year attempting the Central Mediterranean crossing, according to its estimates.\n\nCNN's Laura Goehler, Lorenzo D'Agostino, Sarah El Sirgany and Vasco Cotovio contributed to this report.\n\nTM & \u00a9 2017 Cable News Network, Inc., a Time Warner Company.

The group added that Libyan authorities declared their own rescue area, extending into international waters, the same day.\n\nDoctors Without Borders says its medical crew will keep working from a ship operated by another aid group while its own vessel, Prudence, is not involved in migrant rescues.\n\nThe Italian government agreed last month to dispatch a naval mission to assist the Libyan coast guard with anti-smuggler patrols. Hundreds of thousands of rescued asylum-seekers, many of them fleeing poverty in Africa, have been brought to safety in Italian ports in recent years.\n\nThe government also has pressured rescue groups to sign on to rules that would forbid them from entering Libyan waters to save migrants without specific authorization and require them to agree that armed Italian judicial authorities may board their ships.\n\nItaly is requiring groups operating rescue ships to subscribe to the rules else or risk not being allowed to dock in Italian ports. Doctors Without Borders has refused to endorse the rules, while some other humanitarian groups have given their approval.\n\nCritics of the new policies say they could put lives at risk by delaying rescues in Libyan waters.

Two more aid groups have suspended migrant rescues in the Mediterranean, joining Doctors Without Borders, because they felt threatened by the Libyan coastguard.\n\nSave the Children and Germany's Sea Watch said on Sunday their crews could no longer work safely because of the hostile stance of the Libyan authorities. Doctors Without Borders - or Medecins sans Frontieres - cited the same concern when it said on Saturday it would halt Mediterranean operations.\n\n\"We leave a deadly gap in the Mediterranean,\" Sea Watch's founder Michael Busch Heuer warned on Facebook, adding that Libya had issued an \"explicit threat\" against non-government organizations operating in the area around its coast.\n\nTension has been growing for weeks between aid groups and the Italian government, which has suggested some NGOs are facilitating people smuggling and is trying to enhance the role of the Libyan coastguard in blocking migrant departures.\n\nThis month, Italy began a naval mission in Libyan waters to train and support its coastguard, despite opposition from factions in eastern Libya that oppose the U.N.-backed government based in Tripoli.\n\nImmigration is dominating Italy's political agenda before elections early next year, with public opinion increasingly hostile to migrants. Almost 600,000 migrants have arrived in Italy over the past four years.\n\nMost sailed from lawless Libya in flimsy vessels operated by people smugglers. More than 13,000 migrants have died trying to make the crossing.\n\nShips manned by charities have played a growing role in rescues, picking up more than a third of all migrants brought ashore so far this year, compared with less than one percent in 2014.\n\nAid groups and some Italian politicians warn that migrants intercepted by the Libyan coast guard are taken back to inhuman conditions in detention camps on the Libyan mainland.\n\nHowever, prosecutors in Sicily have opened investigations against some NGOs, which they suspect of collaborating with people smugglers, and Rome has proposed a Code of Conduct setting stricter rules on how the groups can operate.\n\nItalian Foreign Minister Angelino Alfano said in a newspaper interview on Sunday that Libya's growing role in controlling its waters was curbing people trafficking and producing a welcome \"readjustment\" in the Mediterranean.\n\nMSF's decision to halt its rescue operations was part of this positive process, he told daily La Stampa.\n\nSave the Children said its rescue ship, the Vos Hestia, would dock in Malta until it received assurances about the intentions of the Libyan authorities.\n\nLibya was trying to increase the range of the waters its ships controlled from 12 nautical miles around its coast to 70 nautical miles, the humanitarian organization said.\n\n\"The necessary pause in operations from charity rescue ships likes ours and others will undoubtedly put lives at risk,\" its operations director Rob MacGillivray warned.", "timeCrawl": "14:24:00", "sim": 0.7686274647712708, "extractedDates": null, "location": {"country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Italy"}}, "type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Rome"}}, "originalArticle": null, "date": "2017-08-13", "id": "8926709", "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Health/Public_Health_and_Safety/Emergency_Services", "label": "dmoz/Health/Public Health and Safety/Emergency Services", "id": 110, "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Transportation_and_Logistics/Maritime", "label": "dmoz/Business/Transportation and Logistics/Maritime", "id": 288, "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/History/By_Topic", "label": "dmoz/Society/History/By Topic", "id": 653, "wgt": 100}], "details": {}}

"04:00:00", "isDuplicate": false, "body": "More forceful action by Libyan navy and EU-funded boats credited with reducing migration to Italy to 11,500 last month\n\nThe Italian government has hailed a fall of more than 50% in the number of migrants from Libya reaching its coastline in July as a potential turning point made possible by tougher actions against smugglers operating in the Mediterranean.\n\nThe number of migrants reaching Italy fell to 11,459 in July from 23,524 in June and 23,522 in July last year. Over the past few years the summer months have been the peak period for traffickers in the Mediterranean.\n\nThe fall in numbers making the crossing is likely to be the result of a more aggressive turnaround policy by the Libyan navy and coastguard, backed by improved boats and equipment - funded by the European Union - and Italian-led training. In the past few days, the Libyan coastguard has fired warning shots at one NGO ship seeking to rescue migrants. At a press conference on Thursday the Libyan navy underlined the message by telling foreign ships to stay outside Libya's search and rescue zone.\n\nItaly, including its coalition government, is deeply divided over its response to the migrant crisis, but ministers are desperate for any sign that it is is managing to bring numbers under control as it faces attack from populist and centrist parties.\n\nMatteo Renzi, who is likely to be the Democratic party leader in elections expected next year, welcomed the July and early August fall as significant.\n\nHowever, even if the July fall is maintained through August, about 140,000 migrants are projected to reach Italy this year.\n\nThe Italian government's efforts to drive the figures down are under political attack both domestically and in Libya.\n\nAt home, the Italian government is pressing NGOs that are operating rescue ships to sign up to a 13-point code of conduct or else finds their ships barred from landing in Italian ports. So far four NGOs have agreed, with four refusing on the grounds it requires them to allow the Italian military to accompany their rescue missions, something they say is in breach of humanitarian principles.\n\nA vociferous political campaign has claimed the NGOs are not humanitarians, but working in tandem with the smugglers to act as a taxi service for African economic migrants that want to start a more prosperous life in Europe. The allegations have not been proven, and each of the NGOs has rescued tens of thousands of migrants from drowning.\n\nThe Italian transport minister, Graziano Delrio, who is responsible for the coastguard, has privately sided with some of the NGOs, saying that while he is not opposed to the code, \"if there is an NGO vessel close to people who need to be rescued, I can't exclude it\". He argues that even if an NGO has not signed the code, the coastguard had to cooperate if human lives were at stake, pointing out this is anyway a requirement of international humanitarian law. So far four NGOs have signed code - the Spanish NGO ProActiva, Save the Children, Moas and Sea-Eye. NGOs that have not signed include Sea-Watch, and Medicines Sans Frontiers.\n\nBut Loris De Filippi, the president of M\u00e9decins Sans Fronti\u00e8res Italy which has not signed the code, claimed the Italian government was seeking to criminalise the NGOs. He said the vast majority of its rescues took place 30 miles or so off the Libyan coast and follow requests from the Italian coastguard.\n\nIn Libya, the UN-backed government of Fayez al-Sarraj is under attack for agreeing to allow Italian military ships help the Libyan coastguard combat smugglers inside Libyan coastal waters. The rival Libyan administration based in Tobruk claims the agreement violates Libya's sovereignty and the Italian flag has been burned in Benghazi in protest. The scale of the protests has forced Rome to reduce the number of ships it sends. As the former colonial power, any perceived Italian interference in Libya is highly sensitive.\n\nThe commander of the eastern forces in Libya, Khalifa Haftar, has ordered his air force and naval force troops to bomb any foreign vessels in the Libyan waters but the Libyan navy seems prepared to defy the threats and cooperate with the Italian navy.\n\nItaly's defence ministry said the plan has UN backing and its ships are merely \"providing logistical, technical and operational support for Libyan naval vessels, helping them and supporting them in shared and coordinated actions\".", "timeCrawl": "04:02:00", "sim": 0.7686274647712708, "extractedDates": null, "location": null, "originalArticle": null, "date": "2017-08-11", "id": "8532850", "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Health/Public_Health_and_Safety/Emergency_Services", "label": "dmoz/Health/Public Health and Safety/Emergency Services", "id": 110, "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Transportation_and_Logistics/Maritime", "label": "dmoz/Business/Transportation and Logistics/Maritime", "id": 288, "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Pets/Dogs", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Pets/Dogs", "id": 542, "wgt": 100}], "details": {"liCnt": 3}}

for many a year.\n\nThat is so given that three of the nations are in a state of flux, while perennial champions New Zealand had their invincibility questioned by the British and Irish Lions.\n\nThe one thing we have learned over the years is that Super Rugby form is not always a guarantor of how a country will perform, although it can often be a pointer. Regional teams can battle in Super Rugby only for a national composite team to come good under a national coach.\n\nThis year's Championship is shaping up to be a cracker and could be one of the closer events for some time.\n\nNew Zealand\n\nThe back-to back World Cup winners won 47 consecutive matches on home soil before the Lions beat them in the second Test of their June series, and then the tourists had the effrontery to draw the \"decider\" at hallowed Eden Park.\n\nUnquestionably, the drawn series was interpreted by New Zealanders as a \"loss\" and a \"victory\" by the Lions.\n\nInevitably, the Kiwis will take that series result as a clarion call to raise their game to a higher level, to banish any possible vestiges of complacency and re-impose themselves on world rugby.\n\nHow dare the Lions question their supremacy...?\n\nUnfortunately for South Africa, Australia and Argentina, a visibly shaken All Blacks side is going to rebound with a vengeance, and with respect to the other three countries, this Championship could end up being about who comes second to New Zealand, unless the Boks, Wallabies and Pumas can raise their games to new levels, having seen that the All Blacks can be beaten.\n\nKey player\n\nSonny Bill Williams: The heavyweight boxer, former Rugby League star and All Blacks centre is one of sport's larger-than-life figures.\n\nHis sending off in the second Test against the Lions was regarded as game-changing and the master of the off-load is going to be in hungry mood to redress the damage he will feel he inflicted on his country by his moment of shoulder-charging madness.\n\nSouth Africa\n\nQuestions have been asked about the strength of the French team that toured here in June, especially in the first Test when they were short of a number of first-choice players, but the Springboks played even better in the second and third Tests, and there can be no denying that a clean sweep of France signals that the Boks have turned the corner after the horrors of 2016.\n\nCoach Allister Coetzee has learned the hard way and this year the spine of the Bok team from the very first Test was comprised of in-form Lions players from South Africa's in-form Super Rugby team.\n\nThe Boks this year are playing with a distinctive game plan (after the muddled performances of 2016), they have confidence, smiles on their faces and they have momentum.\n\nThey also have a more experienced and composed back-room staff, notably including Brendan Venter (defence).\n\nKey player\n\nJan Serfontein: The 2012 World Junior Player of the Year has yet to reach his potential, but in June against France, there were signs that he is not far off.\n\nIn 2016 he was sidelined by a wrist injury and probably only got his chance against France because of injuries to in-form No 12s such as Rohan Janse van Rensburg, but boy, did he grab the opportunity to show what he can do to defences.\n\nArgentina\n\nThe Jaguares were much improved in their second season of Super Rugby, which is a good sign for the Pumas, who are pretty much the Jaguares in sky blue and white disguise.\n\nBut this is also slightly misleading because there is no doubt that Agustin Creevy's men grow an inch or two when they pull on their national colours and national coach Danial Hourcade seems to be able to get more out of his players on the international stage than his counterpart at Super Rugby level.\n\nThe Latin temperament and the deeply rooted patriotism of the Argentinians contributes significantly to this.\n\nThe Pumas came fourth in the 2015 World Cup playing a new style of attacking rugby (encouraged by consultant former All Blacks coach Graham Henry) and they continue to grow in a style of rugby that suits their disposition.\n\nThey will continue to play positive rugby and will target the Springboks in Salta, where they have had success against the Boks, and the Wallabies in Mendoza.\n\nKey Player\n\nMartin Landajo: The 29-year-old scrumhalf has proved a worthy heir to legendary Puma Agustin Pichot and is a 70-cap veteran for his country.\n\nHe is the catalyst for the attacking rugby the Pumas are intent on playing. He is exceptional at reading the game and probing defences to target where best to attack.\n\nAustralia\n\nRugby sentiment is at an all-time low in Australia after their Super Rugby sides were swept aside, notably by the Kiwi teams that won every single game against Australian teams.\n\nIn June, the Wallabies struggled against touring Scotland and lost one of the Tests to the tourists.\n\nThere is unhappiness in Australia over the axing of the Western Force and even talk of players striking as a result.\n\nThe heartening news for Wallabies fans is that coach Michael Cheika is a supreme motivator and will believe he only needs the best 15 players, plus substitutes, from the ravaged Super Rugby franchises to build a strong national side.\n\nIn 1998, South Africa had one of their worst Super 12 years, but Nick Mallett built a Bok team that won the Tri-Nations.\n\nCheika, a fierce competitor, will have had the Wallabies for a month before their first game, against the All Blacks in Sydney, and will whipping his underdogs into a frenzy.\n\nKey Player\n\nMichael Hooper: The new Wallabies captain was often a lone figure in the front line of the desperately disappointing Waratahs side this year. He tackled himself to a standstill and won many a turnover.\n\nThe Waratahs just did not have the quality of player or the belief in their coaching staff to raise their game as a unit. Hooper is the kind of lead-from-the-front player who will get more out of better company.\n\nPREDICTION\n\n1. New Zealand\n\n2. South Africa\n\n3. Australia\n\n4.

The group added that Libyan authorities declared their own rescue area, extending into international waters, the same day.\n\nDoctors Without Borders says its medical crew will keep working from a ship operated by another aid group while its own vessel, Prudence, is not involved in migrant rescues.\n\nThe Italian government agreed last month to dispatch a naval mission to assist the Libyan coast guard with anti-smuggler patrols. Hundreds of thousands of rescued asylum-seekers, many of them fleeing poverty in Africa, have been brought to safety in Italian ports in recent years.\n\nThe government also has pressured rescue groups to sign on to rules that would forbid them from entering Libyan waters to save migrants without specific authorization and require them to agree that armed Italian judicial authorities may board their ships.\n\nItaly is requiring groups operating rescue ships to subscribe to the rules else or risk not being allowed to dock in Italian ports. Doctors Without Borders has refused to endorse the rules, while some other humanitarian groups have given their approval.\n\nCritics of the new policies say they could put lives at risk by delaying rescues in Libyan waters. They also contend that if the Libyan coast guard blocks smugglers' boats, migrants will be returned to inhumane conditions, including beatings and forced labor, in Libyan detention centers.\n\n\"If humanitarian ships are pushed out of the Mediterranean, there will be fewer ships ready to aid persons before they drown,\" Doctors Without Borders Italy President Loris De Filippi said in a statement. \"And whoever doesn't drown will be intercepted and brought back to Libya, which we know to be a place of absent legality, arbitrary detention and extreme violence.\"\n\nA Spanish humanitarian group, Proactiva Open Arms, said the Libyan coast guard ordered its rescue ship to move north and fired warning shots last week when the vessel was involved in search-and-rescue work outside of Libyan territory.\n\nHumanitarian groups have had ships monitoring the Mediterranean Sea outside of Libya's territorial waters to help rescue migrants from smugglers' boats in distress.

Two more aid groups have suspended migrant rescues in the Mediterranean, joining Doctors Without Borders, because they felt threatened by the Libyan coastguard.\n\nSave the Children and Germany's Sea Watch said on Sunday their crews could no longer work safely because of the hostile stance of the Libyan authorities. Doctors Without Borders - or Medecins sans Frontieres - cited the same concern when it said on Saturday it would halt Mediterranean operations.\n\n\"We leave a deadly gap in the Mediterranean,\" Sea Watch's founder Michael Busch Heuer warned on Facebook, adding that Libya had issued an \"explicit threat\" against non-government organisations operating in the area around its coast.\n\nTension has been growing for weeks between aid groups and the Italian government, which has suggested some NGOs are facilitating people smuggling and is trying to enhance the role of the Libyan coastguard in blocking migrant departures.\n\nThis month, Italy began a naval mission in Libyan waters to train and support its coastguard, despite opposition from factions in eastern Libya that oppose the U.N.-backed government based in Tripoli.\n\nImmigration is dominating Italy's political agenda before elections early next year, with public opinion increasingly hostile to migrants. Almost 600,000 migrants have arrived in Italy over the past four years.\n\nMost sailed from lawless Libya in flimsy vessels operated by people smugglers. More than 13,000 migrants have died trying to make the crossing.\n\nShips manned by charities have played a growing role in rescues, picking up more than a third of all migrants brought ashore so far this year, compared with less than one percent in 2014.\n\nAid groups and some Italian politicians warn that migrants intercepted by the Libyan coast guard are taken back to inhuman conditions in detention camps on the Libyan mainland.\n\nHowever, prosecutors in Sicily have opened investigations against some NGOs, which they suspect of collaborating with people smugglers, and Rome has proposed a Code of Conduct setting stricter rules on how the groups can operate.\n\nItalian Foreign Minister Angelino Alfano said in a newspaper interview on Sunday that Libya's growing role in controlling its waters was curbing people trafficking and producing a welcome \"readjustment\" in the Mediterranean.\n\nMSF's decision to halt its rescue operations was part of this positive process, he told daily La Stampa.\n\nSave the Children said its rescue ship, the Vos Hestia, would dock in Malta until it received assurances about the intentions of the Libyan authorities.\n\nLibya was trying to increase the range of the waters its ships controlled from 12 nautical miles around its coast to 70 nautical miles, the humanitarian organisation said.\n\n\"The necessary pause in operations from charity rescue ships likes ours and others will undoubtedly put lives at risk,\" its operations director Rob MacGillivray warned.

have suspended migrant rescues in the Mediterranean, joining Doctors Without Borders, because they felt threatened by the Libyan coastguard.\n\nSave the Children and Germany's Sea Watch said on Sunday their crews could no longer work safely because of the hostile stance of the Libyan authorities. Doctors Without Borders - or Medecins sans Frontieres - cited the same concern when it said on Saturday it would halt Mediterranean operations.\n\n\"We leave a deadly gap in the Mediterranean,\" Sea Watch's founder Michael Busch Heuer warned on Facebook, adding that Libya had issued an \"explicit threat\" against non-government organisations operating in the area around its coast.\n\nTension has been growing for weeks between aid groups and the Italian government, which has suggested some NGOs are facilitating people smuggling and is trying to enhance the role of the Libyan coastguard in blocking migrant departures.\n\nThis month, Italy began a naval mission in Libyan waters to train and support its coastguard, despite opposition from factions in eastern Libya that oppose the U.N.-backed government based in Tripoli.\n\nImmigration is dominating Italy's political agenda before elections early next year, with public opinion increasingly hostile to migrants. Almost 600,000 migrants have arrived in Italy over the past four years.\n\nMost sailed from lawless Libya in flimsy vessels operated by people smugglers. More than 13,000 migrants have died trying to make the crossing.\n\nShips manned by charities have played a growing role in rescues, picking up more than a third of all migrants brought ashore so far this year, compared with less than one percent in 2014.\n\nAid groups and some Italian politicians warn that migrants intercepted by the Libyan coast guard are taken back to inhuman conditions in detention camps on the Libyan mainland.\n\nHowever, prosecutors in Sicily have opened investigations against some NGOs, which they suspect of collaborating with people smugglers, and Rome has proposed a Code of Conduct setting stricter rules on how the groups can operate.\n\nItalian Foreign Minister Angelino Alfano said in a newspaper interview on Sunday that Libya's growing role in controlling its waters was curbing people trafficking and producing a welcome \"readjustment\" in the Mediterranean.\n\nMSF's decision to halt its rescue operations was part of this positive process, he told daily La Stampa.\n\nSave the Children said its rescue ship, the Vos Hestia, would dock in Malta until it received assurances about the intentions of the Libyan authorities.\n\nLibya was trying to increase the range of the waters its ships controlled from 12 nautical miles around its coast to 70 nautical miles, the humanitarian organisation said.\n\n\"The necessary pause in operations from charity rescue ships likes ours and others will undoubtedly put lives at risk,\" its operations director Rob MacGillivray warned. -- Reuters", "timeCrawl": "14:57:00", "sim": 0.7607843279838562, "extractedDates": [{"textStart": 112, "date": "2017-08-13", "imp": true, "amb": false, "textEnd": 118}], "location": null, "originalArticle": null, "date": "2017-08-13", "id": "8930018", "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Health/Public_Health_and_Safety/Emergency_Services", "label": "dmoz/Health/Public Health and Safety/Emergency Services", "id": 110, "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Transportation_and_Logistics/Maritime", "label": "dmoz/Business/Transportation and Logistics/Maritime", "id": 288, "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/History/By_Topic", "label": "dmoz/Society/History/By Topic", "id": 653, "wgt": 100}], "details": {}}

It would be irresponsible towards our crews,\" he added.\n\nItaly began training and supporting the coast guard of the UN-backed Libyan government in Tripoli last week, in an effort to increase its ability to intercept migrant boats and send them back to Libya.\n\nThe Tripoli government is one of three claiming authority in the country, and its power is disputed by other rival groups in Libya.\n\nItaly's government has welcomed Libya's decision to prevent NGOs from entering its waters, having previously suggested NGOs are in fact colluding with people smugglers to rescue migrants.\n\n\"This sends a signal that the balance is being restored in the Mediterranean,\" Italian Foreign Minister Angelino Alfano said Sunday.\n\nItaly has struggled with the wave of refugees and migrants arriving at its coast.

Libya of creating a \"blockade\" in Libyan coastal waters that would result in more Mediterranean deaths and more migrants stuck in Libyan detention.\n\nLast month, Italy approved a naval mission in Libyan waters to train and support the coastguard of the country's UN-backed government in Tripoli, whose authority is challenged by other Libyan factions.\n\nNGOs being shut out?\n\nEarlier this week, Libya said it was establishing a \"search and rescue\" zone off its coast - a move MSF said would extend Libyan patrols into international waters, where humanitarian groups pick up asylum seekers from flimsy boats.\n\nPreviously, non-governmental groups (NGOs) had conducted search and rescue operations as close as 11 nautical miles to the Libyan mainland.\n\nThe MSF, with its vessel Prudence, is one of nine NGOs involved in migrant rescues in the Mediterranean - rivalled by an anti-migrant group - since the Balkans route was virtually shut to refugees from early 2016\n\nAssault on dignity\n\nMSF's Director of Operations, Brice de le Vingne, on Saturday accused European states and Libyan authorities of \"jointly implementing a blockade on the ability of people to seek safety\" and assaulting their dignity.\n\n\"The recent developments represent another worrying element of an increasingly hostile environment for lifesaving operations,\" he said.\n\nAnother aid group active in the Mediterranean, Proactiva Open Arms, also criticized the EU, with its founder Oscar Camps tweeting: \"the first NGO out, this is just what the EU wants.\"\n\nLoris De Filippi, president of MSF's Italian arm said, \"We are suspending our activities because now we feel that the threatening behavior by the Libyan coastguard is very serious ... we cannot put our colleagues in danger.\"\n\nMSF said medical staff would, however, keep working from a ship operated by another aid group, SOS Mediterranee, while the Prudence remained idle.\n\n'Fewer illegal immigrants'\n\nMatteo Salvini, leader of Italy's anti-immigrant Northern League, asserted that MSF's move would result in \"thousands fewer illegal immigrants for Italians to maintain.\"\n\nMigrants, if intercepted while trying to cross to Europe are taken back to Libya, and often face slave labor and sexual violence, according to multiple reports.\n\n13,000 deaths in four years\n\nOver the past four years, almost 600,000 migrants have arrived in Italy, the vast majority setting sail from largely lawless Libya in flimsy vessels operated by people smugglers. More than 13,000 migrants have died trying to make the crossing.\n\nGeneral Khalifa Hifter, a Bengazi-based commander who rivals Tripoli and is aligned with Libya's eastern-region parliament, told the Italian newspaper Corriere della Sera on Saturday the presence of Italian military vessels in Libyan waters was unacceptable.\n\nThe newspaper quoted Hifter as saying he would not attack them.\n\nThe UN's migration agency counted 114,000 migrant arrivals since the beginning of 2017 until July 30, with almost 85 percent arriving in Italy.", "timeCrawl": "19:18:00", "sim": 0.7176470756530762, "extractedDates": [{"textStart": 3019, "date": "2017-07-30", "imp": true, "amb": false, "textEnd": 3026}], "location": null, "originalArticle": null, "date": "2017-08-12", "id": "8833828", "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Health/Public_Health_and_Safety/Emergency_Services", "label": "dmoz/Health/Public Health and Safety/Emergency Services", "id": 110, "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Science/Environment/Water_Resources", "label": "dmoz/Science/Environment/Water Resources", "id": 132, "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Energy/Utilities", "label": "dmoz/Business/Energy/Utilities", "id": 145, "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Immigration", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Immigration", "id": 318, "wgt": 100}], "details": {}}

A number of questions face the national team ahead of the Rugby Championship.\n\nThe problem with the Springboks' 3-0 series win over a patchwork French team is that the average South African rugby fan now expects that the team will ride roughshod over Argentina, Australia and New Zealand in the Rugby Championship.\n\nA more reasonable expectation would be good old-fashioned competitiveness - starting with Saturday's campaign opener\n\nagainst Argentina in Port Elizabeth - after the Boks could only muster two wins in last year's tournament.\n\nWhile Guy Nov\u00e8s' French team at times looked as though they were sleepwalking their way through the series, thanks to an interminable Top 14 season, the June Boks were characterised by desire (to play and to defend), an adventure of spirit and a togetherness that almost sucked the rest of us in.\n\nBut the Rugby Championship - with the All Blacks smarting from not putting away the British and Irish Lions, the Australians almost emerging from a second pre-season and Argentina not knowing which Pumas will turn up - will ask totally different questions.\n\nThe team going into the Rugby Championship isn't quite the same team as the one that played against the French in June, so here are a few questions it will need to answer during the course of the tournament:\n\nHow will they deal with their absent captain?\n\nLions captain and official Bok captain Warren Whiteley has another five weeks before he'll recover from his groin injury, meaning that, by the time he is back, the horse may have bolted.\n\nThe problem with Whiteley not being there is less about him being the best No 8 in the country and more about him being the quiet driver of the team culture that gave us the inspirational June Boks.\n\nWhether the rest of the leaders in the team, led by Whiteley's replacement Eben Etzebeth, can carry on the new-found tradition is a moot point.\n\nWhat of the other missing players?\n\nWhen the squad for the French test series was announced Lukhanyo Am, Ruan Combrinck and Rohan Janse van Rensburg were or would be injured.\n\nJan Serfontein emphatically reminding us why he was the World Junior Player of the Year in 2012 means the rusty Janse van Rensburg is not urgently needed.\n\nBut quite what Am, whose only sin after his call-up was to fracture his eye socket in the last game before camp, did to miss the boat is a mystery.\n\nWhat's the plan for the new additions in the squad?\n\nFullback Warrick Gelant, No 8 Dan du Preez and flyhalf Curwin Bosch are the new additions.\n\nWhile all gifted, and one suspects Du Preez's inclusion is thanks more to the paucity of natural eighthmen in the team, they come across as youngsters who need time to carry on working on their craft.\n\nWho is Jantjies' backup?\n\nThe Bok management team may have bought into many of the things that made the Lions Super Rugby finalists two seasons in a row, but they're not quite convinced about having Elton Jantjies as the only flyhalf in the squad.\n\nBackup is always good, but what actually happens if Jantjies gets injured or loses form like he did last year?\n\nWhat's a good number?\n\nWith nobody in their right mind necessarily thinking the Boks will win this year's Rugby Championship, what's a good number of games to win to signify progress from last year's two wins? Maybe the best-case scenario would be winning both games against Argentina to arrest their recent slide of losses against smaller nations, a home game against the plucky Australia and an overdue win at home against the All Blacks.", "timeCrawl": "04:40:00", "sim": 0.7058823704719543, "extractedDates": null, "location": {"country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "South Africa"}}, "type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Johannesburg"}}, "originalArticle": null, "date": "2017-08-13", "id": "8872569", "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Paintball/Teams", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Paintball/Teams", "id": 25, "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Robotics/Competitions", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Robotics/Competitions", "id": 28, "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Flying_Discs/Ultimate_Frisbee", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Flying Discs/Ultimate Frisbee", "id": 30, "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Football", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Football", "id": 31, "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Football/American", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Football/American", "id": 32, "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Football/Rugby_Union", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Football/Rugby Union", "id": 46, "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Football/Rugby_League", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Football/Rugby League", "id": 47, "wgt": 100}], "details": {}}

migrant rescues in the Mediterranean because it felt threatened by the Libyan coastguard and the Italian government's policies have made its job harder.\n\nThe aid group's decision is the latest development in mounting tensions between Rome and NGOs as migration dominates Italy's political agenda ahead of elections early next year.\n\n\"We are suspending our activities because now we feel that the threatening behavior by the Libyan coastguard is very serious ... we cannot put our colleagues in danger,\" the president of MSF's Italian arm Loris De Filippi told Reuters.\n\nAlmost 600,000 migrants have arrived in Italy over the past four years, the vast majority setting sail from lawless Libya in flimsy vessels operated by people smugglers. More than 13,000 migrants have died trying to make the crossing.\n\nCharity boats have played a growing role in rescues, picking up more than a third of all migrants brought ashore so far this year against less than one percent in 2014.\n\nHowever, Italy fears the groups are facilitating people smuggling and encouraging migrants to make the passage, and it has proposed a Code of Conduct governing how they operate.\n\nSome groups, including MSF, have refused to sign the code.\n\nThey object to a requirement that Italian police officers be on their boats and that the boats must take migrants to a safe port themselves, rather than transferring them to other vessels to allow smaller boats to stay in the area for further rescues.\n\nMSF operates one rescue ship in the Mediterranean, the Prudence, currently docked in the Sicilian port of Catania.\n\nIn the last six weeks the number of migrant arrivals in Italy has slowed sharply and Rome has begun collaborating more closely with the Libyan coastguard, which De Filippi said was threatening the NGOs and preventing them from working.\n\nHe said the Libyan coastguard had demanded the NGOs should leave an area of up to hundreds of kilometers around its coast, whereas previously they had been allowed to conduct search and rescue operations as close as 11 nautical miles to the mainland.\n\n\"Last year the coastguard fired 13 shots on our boat and that was in a situation that was much calmer than the present one,\" said De Filippi.\n\nHe said MSF would continue its collaboration with another aid group, SOS Mediterranee, which operates a rescue ship in the Mediterranean with MSF doctors on board.\n\nDe Filippi said the Rome government's Code of Conduct for NGOs and its support for the Libyan coastguard showed it was now mixing the humanitarian goal of saving lives with \"a political and military intention\" of reducing arrivals.\n\n\"We refuse to be co-opted into a system that blocks people from seeking safety and protection,\" MSF tweeted, adding that the European Union's immigration policies showed it was \"determined to trap people in Libya.\"\n\nOscar Camps, the founder of Proactiva Open Arms, another aid group active in the Mediterranean, also took aim at the EU, tweeting: \"the first NGO out, this is just what the EU wants.\"\n\nAn Italian government spokesman was not immediately available to comment, while Matteo Salvini, leader of the anti-immigrant Northern League, said MSF's move meant there would be \"thousands fewer illegal immigrants for Italians to maintain.\"\n\nLast week Italy began a naval mission in Libyan waters to train and support its coastguard, despite opposition from factions in eastern Libya that oppose the U.N.-backed government based in Tripoli.\n\nGeneral Khalifa Haftar, a commander aligned with an Eastern-based parliament, told Italian daily Corriere della Sera on Saturday the presence of Italian military vessels in Libyan waters was unacceptable but he would not attack them.", "timeCrawl": "20:41:00", "sim": 0.7058823704719543, "extractedDates": null, "location": null, "originalArticle": null, "date": "2017-08-12", "id": "8841760", "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Health/Public_Health_and_Safety/Emergency_Services", "label": "dmoz/Health/Public Health and Safety/Emergency Services", "id": 110, "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Immigration", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Immigration", "id": 318, "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Pets/Dogs", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Pets/Dogs", "id": 542, "wgt": 100}], "details": {}}

Without Borders (MSF) said on Saturday it was suspending its migrant rescues in the Mediterranean because it felt threatened by the Libyan coastguard and the Italian government's policies have made its job harder.\n\nThe aid group's decision is the latest development in mounting tensions between Rome and NGOs as migration dominates Italy's political agenda ahead of elections early next year.\n\n\"We are suspending our activities because now we feel that the threatening behaviour by the Libyan coastguard is very serious ... we cannot put our colleagues in danger,\" the president of MSF's Italian arm Loris De Filippi told Reuters.\n\nAlmost 600,000 migrants have arrived in Italy over the past four years, the vast majority setting sail from lawless Libya in flimsy vessels operated by people smugglers. More than 13,000 migrants have died trying to make the crossing.\n\nCharity boats have played a growing role in rescues, picking up more than a third of all migrants brought ashore so far this year against less than one percent in 2014.\n\nHowever, Italy fears the groups are facilitating people smuggling and encouraging migrants to make the passage, and it has proposed a Code of Conduct governing how they operate.\n\nSome groups, including MSF, have refused to sign the code.\n\nThey object to a requirement that Italian police officers be on their boats and that the boats must take migrants to a safe port themselves, rather than transferring them to other vessels to allow smaller boats to stay in the area for further rescues.\n\nMSF operates one rescue ship in the Mediterranean, the Vox Prudence, currently docked in the Sicilian port of Catania.\n\nIn the last six weeks the number of migrant arrivals in Italy has slowed sharply and Rome has begun collaborating more closely with the Libyan coastguard, which De Filippi said was threatening the NGOs and preventing them from working.\n\nHe said the Libyan coastguard had demanded the NGOs should leave an area of hundreds of kilometres around its coast, whereas previously they had been allowed to conduct search and rescue operations as close as 11 nautical miles to the mainland.\n\n\"Last year the coastguard fired 13 shots on our boat and that was in a situation that was much calmer than the present one,\" said De Filippi.\n\nHe said MSF would continue its collaboration with another aid group, SOS Mediterranee, which operates a rescue ship in the Mediterranean with MSF doctors on board.\n\nDe Filippi said the Rome government's Code of Conduct for NGOs and its support for the Libyan coastguard showed it was now mixing the humanitarian goal of saving lives with \"a political and military intention\" of reducing arrivals.\n\nA government spokesman was not immediately available to comment.\n\nLast week Italy began a naval mission in Libyan waters to train and support its coastguard, despite opposition from factions in eastern Libya that oppose the U.N.-backed government based in Tripoli.\n\nGeneral Khalifa Haftar, a commander aligned with an Eastern-based parliament, told Italian daily Corriere della Sera on Saturday the presence of Italian military vessels in Libyan waters was unacceptable but he would not attack them.\n\n(This article has not been edited by DNA's editorial team and is auto-generated from an agency feed.)", "timeCrawl": "14:18:00", "sim": 0.7019608020782471, "extractedDates": null, "location": null, "originalArticle": null, "date": "2017-08-12", "id": "8802790", "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Health/Public_Health_and_Safety", "label": "dmoz/Health/Public Health and Safety", "id": 109, "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Public_Health_and_Safety/Emergency_Services", "label": "dmoz/Health/Public Health and Safety/Emergency Services", "id": 110, "wgt": 100}], "details": {}}

In recent years, the Boks have been unable to hold their own against New Zealand and having shown some improvements against France in the three match series, the biggest expectation is that they could finish second in the Championship after Steve Hansen's All Blacks.\n\nFor Mohoje, though, the Boks have a lot to be positive about if they can draw inspiration from the Lions' Super Rugby semifinal win over the Hurricanes and gallant display in the defeat to the Crusaders in the final, where they produced a good performance even when they were down to 14 men.\n\n\"Facing France in those three matches was tough, but you cannot compare that to the Rugby Championship. It will be a different challenge and we are definitely preparing well for it. \"The previous year was a bad one and we want to make it up to the nation and to ourselves. What we can promise at the moment is results and some good rugby,\" Mohoje said. \"But having the Lions players in the team will help a lot because they have played rugby at the highest level in the last couple of months.\n\n\"We will draw from their fights against the Hurricanes and Crusaders. For the Boks though, the wins against France brought about a bigger wave of expectation and we set some lofty standards against France. We will have to play every game like it is our last.\" There aren't too many issues as questions regarding who will captain the Springboks with regular captain Warren Whiteley sidelined have been answered with Eben Etzebeth getting the nod. Mohoje is now focused on making the final squad.\n\n\"To play for the Springboks in Bloemfontein where I play my rugby for the Cheetahs will be exciting, but for me the important thing is to make the final team that will start with the first match against Argentina in Port Elizabeth.\"", "timeCrawl": "05:54:00", "sim": 0.6941176652908325, "extractedDates": null, "location": null, "originalArticle": null, "date": "2017-08-10", "id": "8327304", "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Football/Rugby_Union", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Football/Rugby Union", "id": 46, "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Football/Rugby_League", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Football/Rugby League", "id": 47, "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Organizations/Service_Clubs", "label": "dmoz/Society/Organizations/Service Clubs", "id": 823, "wgt": 100}], "details": {}}

Immediately after the announcement yesterday, Italian Maritime Rescue Coordination Centre (MRCC) in Rome warned MSF about security risks associated with threats publicly issued by the Libyan Coast Guard against humanitarian search and rescue (SAR) vessels operating in international waters.\n\nFollowing these additional restrictions on independent humanitarian assistance and an increasing blockade of migrants within Libya, MSF has decided to temporarily suspend the search and rescue activity of its ship, Prudence. The MSF medical support team will still assist the rescue capacity of the Aquarius vessel, run by the SOS Mediterranean, which is currently patrolling in international waters.\n\n\"If these declarations are confirmed and the orders are implemented we see two grave consequences -- there will be more deaths at sea and more people trapped in Libya,\" declared Annemarie Loof, MSF's operational manager. \"If humanitarian ships are pushed out of the Mediterranean, there will be fewer ships in the area to rescue people from drowning. Those who will not drown will be intercepted and brought back to Libya, which we know is a place of lawlessness, arbitrary detention, and extreme violence.\"\n\nThese declarations came barely a week after the deployment of the Italian Navy inside Libyan waters to help the Libyan coastguard intercept migrant and refugees and send them back to Libya.\n\n\"The recent developments represent another worrying element of an increasingly hostile environment for lifesaving rescue operations,\" said Brice de le Vingne, MSF's director of operations. \"European states and Libyan authorities are jointly implementing a blockade on the ability of people to seek safety. This is an unacceptable assault on people's lives and dignity.\"\n\nMSF requests Libyan authorities to rapidly confirm that they will adhere to and respect the internationally recognized legal obligation to rescue boats in distress, and that they will allow this to take place in international and Libyan waters. MSF further requests that Libyan authorities clarify that all boats, operated by NGOs or anyone else, will be permitted to conduct these rescue activities unhindered and unharmed and that Libyan and Italian authorities will not interfere with the legally guaranteed right to disembark people in a place of safety.\n\n\"MSF refuses to be coopted into a system that aims at all cost to block people from seeking safety,\" said de le Vingne. \"We call on the EU and Italian authorities to stop implementing deadly containment strategies that trap people in a country at war with no regard for their protection and assistance needs. Safe and legal pathways for refugees and migrants are urgently needed in order to reduce unnecessary death and suffering.\"", "timeCrawl": "13:36:00", "sim": 0.6901960968971252, "extractedDates": [{"date": "2017-08-12", "textStart": 19, "amb": false, "textEnd": 34}], "location": {"country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Belgium"}}, "type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Brussels"}}, "originalArticle": null, "date": "2017-08-13", "id": "8921348", "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Health/Public_Health_and_Safety", "label": "dmoz/Health/Public Health and Safety", "id": 109, "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Public_Health_and_Safety/Emergency_Services", "label": "dmoz/Health/Public Health and Safety/Emergency Services", "id": 110, "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Energy/Utilities", "label": "dmoz/Business/Energy/Utilities", "id": 145, "wgt": 100}], "details": {}}

brace yourself - Romain Poite will be in your hood next!\n\nThe controversial Frenchman has been appointed to handle the Boks' Rugby Championship opener against Argentina on August 19, with the match taking place at Port Elizabeth's Nelson Mandela Bay Stadium.\n\nPoite hit the headlines over the weekend once more when he controversially changed his decision in the decisive Test between the All Blacks and the British and Irish Lions at Eden Park in Auckland.\n\nWith time almost up on the clock and the scores locked at 15-15 in the series decider, Poite first awarded a penalty to New Zealand after Lions hooker Ken Owens caught the ball in an offside position following a kickoff.\n\nPoite appeared to confirm his decision after consulting with South African assistant referee Jaco Peyper and Australian TMO George Ayoub after watching the incident on the big screen again.\n\nBut after walking across to captains Kieran Read and Sam Warburton, Poite suddenly changed his mind and ruled that it was accidental offside, and awarded a scrum instead to the All Blacks. Read was incensed, but there was no changing the Frenchman's mind again, and the match ended in a draw.\n\nThe Boks have borne the brunt of Poite's bad side previously - in 2013, Bismarck du Plessis was given a yellow card despite a legal tackle on Dan Carter, and the South Africans lost that game 29-15 after Du Plessis received a second yellow card early in the second half for using his elbow in trying to hand-off Liam Messam.\n\nIt led to a public outcry, and the then-International Rugby Board published a statement afterwards admitting that Poite had made a mistake in dishing out a yellow card for Du Plessis' tackle on Carter.\n\nAnd Poite won't be the only French referee that the Boks have to deal with during the Rugby Championship. Pascal Gauzere will take charge of the return game against Argentina in Salta, while Jerome Garces will have the whistle for the big clash against the All Blacks at Newlands on October 7.\n\nReferees For Rugby Championship\n\nAugust 19\n\nSydney: Australia v New Zealand - Jerome Garces (France)\n\nPort Elizabeth: South Africa v Argentina (5.05pm) - Romain Poite (France)\n\nAugust 26\n\nDunedin: New Zealand v Australia - Wayne Barnes (England)\n\nSalta: Argentina v South Africa (9.40pm) - Pascal Gauzere (France)\n\nSeptember 9\n\nNew Plymouth: New Zealand v Argentina - Angus Gardner (Australia)\n\nPerth: Australia v South Africa (12.05pm) - Glen Jackson (New Zealand)\n\nSeptember 16\n\nAlbany: New Zealand v South Africa (9.35am) - Nigel Owens (Wales)\n\nCanberra: Australia v Argentina - John Lacey (Ireland)\n\nSeptember 30\n\nBloemfontein: South Africa v Australia (5.05pm) - Ben O'Keeffe (New Zealand) Buenos Aires: Argentina v New Zealand - Jaco Peyper (South Africa)\n\nOctober 7\n\nCape Town: South Africa v New Zealand (5.05pm) - Jerome Garces (France)\n\nMendoza: Argentina v Australia - Mathieu Raynal (France)\n\n@ashfakmohamed\n\nIOL Sport\n\nLike us on Facebook\n\nFollow us on Twitter", "timeCrawl": "10:44:00", "sim": 0.6901960968971252, "extractedDates": [{"imp": true, "freq": 2, "amb": false, "textEnd": 205, "date": "2017-08-19", "textStart": 196}, {"imp": true, "freq": 2, "amb": false, "textEnd": 2011, "date": "2017-10-07", "textStart": 2002}, {"textStart": 2191, "date": "2017-08-26", "imp": true, "amb": false, "textEnd": 2200}, {"textStart": 2329, "date": "2017-09-09", "imp": true, "amb": false, "textEnd": 2340}, {"textStart": 2481, "date": "2017-09-16", "imp": true, "amb": false, "textEnd": 2493}, {"textStart": 2618, "date": "2017-09-30", "imp": true, "amb": false, "textEnd": 2630}], "location": null, "originalArticle": null, "date": "2017-08-11", "id": "8593651", "categories": [], "details": {}}

begun what it describes as a \"limited naval\" mission to help Libya's coastguard curb migrant flows.\n\n\"(We will) provide logistical, technical and operational support for Libyan naval vessels, helping them and supporting them in shared and coordinated actions,\" defence minister Roberta Pinotti said ahead of Wednesday's parliamentary vote authorising the operation.\n\n\"There will be no harm done or slight given to Libyan sovereignty, because, if anything, our aim is to strengthen Libyan sovereignty,\" she told parliament, stressing that Italy had no intention of imposing a blockade on Libya's coast.\n\nSome Libyans reject the Italian initiative, arguing that it is an infringement of their country's rights. General Khalifa Haftar, who controls most of eastern Libya, threatened to use his own forces to repel the Italians if they enter Libyan waters.\n\nThe Italian government is facing mounting criticism at home for allowing tens of thousands of Africans to arrive on its shores. This year year more than 95,000 have landed, according to the UN's refugee agency. A further 2,385 have lost their lives or gone missing.\n\nItalian attempts to curb the African exodus now has the support of the European far right. Members of the \"Identitarian movement\" have sent their own ship into the Mediterranean with the explicit aim of returning Africans to Libya.\n\nDefend Europe has raised over $180,000 to support their mission to intercept the refugees on the high seas. They accuse the rescue missions of organisations like M\u00e9decins Sans Fronti\u00e8res and Save the Children of working with traffickers, and see the NGO's as their targets.\n\nDefend Europe is explicit about its aims: \"Our goal is to document the doings of the NGOs, expose their collaboration with the human smugglers, and intervene if they do something illegal. Our goal is to step in where our politicians are failing and to do what is necessary to stop the deadly illegal migration into Europe.\"\n\nTheir work has been backed by several far-right organisations, including fringe groups operating in the UK. This includes Generation Identity UK, whose mission is \"the preservation of our ethno-cultural heritage\".\n\n\"The Defend Europe project has been funded by the international far-right and this no doubt includes UK far-right activists,\" said Dr Joe Mulhall, Senior Researcher at the campaign group Hope not Hate.\n\n\"However, most worrying is the encouragement being shown by Leave.EU, the pro-Brexit campaign run by former Ukip donor Arron Banks, who has the influence and resources to significantly support the dangerous Defend Europe mission should he choose to,\" said Dr Mulhall.\n\nThe backing of Arron Banks is certainly a boost for Defend Europe. Leave.EU has produced a video lauding the work of Defend Europe, saying that they \"are doing some valuable work in raising awareness of ongoing crisis in the Med and the alarming role NGOs are playing.\"\n\nWATCH | @DefendEvropa are doing some valuable work in raising awareness of ongoing crisis in the Med and the alarming role NGOs are playing. pic.twitter.com/3tCfnm2xSt\n\n-- LEAVE.EU (@LeaveEUOfficial) July 27, 2017\n\nDefend Europe's boat - the CStar - is now off the Libyan coast. Exactly what it will do is unclear.\n\nThe organisation intercepted an MSF boat leaving the Italian port of Catania in May. \"They tried to halt us, but were intercepted by the Italian coastguards, interrogated and released,\" MSF humanitarian co-ordinator Hassiba Hadj Sahraoui, told the New Statesman. \"We don't want to engage with them: people are dying. Rescuing them - that's our mission.\"\n\nBut the operations of CStar are little more than a distraction for the international rescue effort. Italy has introduced a code of conduct for the NGO's rescuing the migrants off the Libyan coast.\n\nA number of the rescue missions refused to sign - including MSF. The code banned the transfer of survivors from one ship to another - insisting instead that the ship disembark them at a port.\n\n\"We refused to sign because it would decrease the number of rescue vessels at sea at any time,\" explained Sahraoui,. MSF also rejected plans to station armed police on board the boats, arguing that this would compromise their neutrality.\n\nOne of the eight humanitarian vessels operating in the Mediterranean has already been impounded by the Italian authorities. The Iuventa, a boat operated by German NGO Jugend Rettet, was impounded on the Italian island of Lampedusa.\n\n\"This looks like a reprisal,\" says Ms Sahraoui. \"The Italians are using administrative measures to try to halt the rescue operations, despite insisting that the code of conduct is voluntary.\"\n\nThe Royal Navy is also involved in the maelstrom off the Libyan coast, as part of Operation Sophia, run from Rome. Their mandate has just been updated, and now includes training the Libyan coastguard.\n\nBut the Libyan coastguard has a poor reputation.\n\nMSF says it has evidence that the Libyans use force, including firearms, to escort any migrants back to their shores. Once in Libya they will be sent to the country's notorious detention camps, where thousands of men, women and children are left to rot with little hope of ever making it to Europe.", "timeCrawl": "03:40:00", "sim": 0.6745098233222961, "extractedDates": [{"date": "2017-07-27", "textStart": 3270, "amb": false, "textEnd": 3283}], "location": null, "originalArticle": null, "date": "2017-08-09", "id": "8104038", "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Health/Public_Health_and_Safety/Emergency_Services", "label": "dmoz/Health/Public Health and Safety/Emergency Services", "id": 110, "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Religion_and_Spirituality/Christianity", "label": "dmoz/Society/Religion and Spirituality/Christianity", "id": 253, "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Pets/Dogs", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Pets/Dogs", "id": 542, "wgt": 100}], "details": {"liCnt": 18}}

threatened by the Libyan coastguard and the Italian government's policies have made its job harder.\n\nThe aid group's decision is the latest development in mounting tensions between Rome and NGOs as migration dominates Italy's political agenda ahead of elections early next year.\n\n\"We are suspending our activities because now we feel that the threatening behaviour by the Libyan coastguard is very serious ... we cannot put our colleagues in danger,\" the president of MSF's Italian arm Loris De Filippi said.\n\nAlmost 600,000 migrants have arrived in Italy over the past four years, the vast majority setting sail from Libya in flimsy vessels operated by people smugglers.\n\nMore than 13,000 migrants have died trying to make the crossing.\n\nCharity boats have played a growing role in rescues, picking up more than a third of all migrants brought ashore so far this year against less than 1% in 2014.\n\nHowever, Italy fears the groups are facilitating people smuggling and encouraging migrants to make the passage, and it has proposed a Code of Conduct governing how they operate.\n\nSome groups, including MSF, have refused to sign the code.\n\nThey object to a requirement that Italian police officers be on their boats and that the boats must take migrants to a safe port themselves, rather than transferring them to other vessels to allow smaller boats to stay in the area for further rescues.\n\nMSF operates one rescue ship in the Mediterranean, the Prudence, currently docked in the Sicilian port of Catania.\n\nIn the last six weeks the number of migrant arrivals in Italy has slowed sharply and Rome has begun collaborating more closely with the Libyan coastguard, which Mr De Filippi said was threatening the NGOs and preventing them from working.\n\nHe said the Libyan coastguard had demanded the NGOs should leave an area of up to hundreds of kilometres around its coast.\n\nPreviously, they had been allowed to conduct search and rescue operations as close as 11 nautical miles to the mainland.\n\n\"Last year the coastguard fired 13 shots on our boat and that was in a situation that was much calmer than the present one,\" said Mr De Filippi.\n\nHe said MSF would continue its collaboration with another aid group, SOS Mediterranee, which operates a rescue ship in the Mediterranean with MSF doctors on board.\n\nMr De Filippi said the Rome government's Code of Conduct for NGOs and its support for the Libyan coastguard showed it was now mixing the humanitarian goal of saving lives with \"a political and military intention\" of reducing arrivals.\n\n\"We refuse to be co-opted into a system that blocks people from seeking safety and protection,\" MSF tweeted, adding that the European Union's immigration policies showed it was \"determined to trap people in Libya\".\n\nOscar Camps, the founder of Proactiva Open Arms, another aid group active in the Mediterranean, also took aim at the EU, tweeting: \"the first NGO out, this is just what the EU wants.\"\n\nAn Italian government spokesman was not immediately available to comment.\n\nMatteo Salvini, leader of the anti-immigrant Northern League, said MSF's move meant there would be \"thousands fewer illegal immigrants for Italians to maintain\".", "timeCrawl": "08:08:00", "sim": 0.6666666865348816, "extractedDates": null, "location": null, "originalArticle": null, "date": "2017-08-13",

MSF is the largest NGO involved in search and rescue operations in the area.\n\nSince last week, the Italian coastguard has been training Libya's coastguard to better control the movement of migrants across the sea. The Libyan coastguard recently warned that MSF rescue boats risk being shot if they venture too close to Libya's coast, De Filippi tells Reuters. Such shootings have happened in the past.\n\nAid organizations committed to saving lives in the Mediterranean are increasingly coming into conflict with the Italian government, which is embracing a strong anti-immigration position ahead of the 2018 elections. As more and more Italians blame immigration for the country's economic woes, Rome is making journeys across the Mediterranean even more perilous.\n\nIn February, the government agreed to train Libya's coast guard in stopping migrant vessels trying to leave the country. International humanitarian organization condemned the move; migrants who are detained in Libya are kept in notoriously bad conditions.\n\nThe number of migrant arrivals from Libya to Italian shores decreased following the agreement. Nevertheless, nearly 100,000 people have still reached Italy in this period. Over 2,400 migrants have died crossing the Mediterranean since the beginning of 2017, according to the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR).\n\nSearch and rescue missions play a key role in reducing the number of casualties at sea. NGOs have played a growing part in them, which has led to accusations of colluding with smugglers.\n\nProviding support to sinking boats has been said to encourage migrants to attempt the journey towards Europe. The Italian government has asked NGOs to sign a code of conduct (link in Italian) -- with 13 rules, including one that prescribes migrants not be rescued in Libyan waters except in extraordinary circumstances.\n\nMSF is one of a handful of NGOs that have refused to sign the code of conduct. Save the Children (which has signed the code of conduct) has also announced (link in Italian) that they might withdraw from Mediterranean.\n\nThis is just what #UE wants.

banned foreign vessels from an area of water off its coast.\n\nLibya's navy this week ordered foreign vessels to stay out of a coastal \"search and rescue zone\" for migrants headed for Europe.\n\nThe measure was aimed at NGOs \"which pretend to want to rescue illegal migrants and carry out humanitarian actions\", a Libyan navy spokesman said.\n\nMSF said it would continue to provide assistance to other rescue operations but was suspending the use of the Prudence, one of the largest NGO vessels in the Mediterranean which rescued 1,500 people in May alone.\n\n\"With NGOs more and more restricted in the Med & the #EU determined to trap people in #Libya, we've put the #Prudence on standby,\" MSF said on Twitter.\n\n\"European states and the Libyan authorities are jointly implementing a roadblock for people looking for security,\" MSF Italy President Loris De Filippi said.\n\n\"It's an unacceptable attack on the lives and dignity of people.\"\n\nTwitter Post\n\nItaly, which has borne of the brunt of the migrant crisis this year, warned NGOs earlier this month that they would be prevented from operating in the Mediterranean if they did not sign up to new rules.\n\nA new code of conduct was created after a German vessel was impounded for allegedly aiding people smugglers, with boats now required to have an Italian police officer on board to monitor activities.\n\nMost aid agencies conducting rescue operations have signed up to the agreement, but not MSF.\n\nItaly's centre-left government is under intense pressure from domestic opponents and EU partners to close down the route that has seen more than 600,000 refugees and other migrants reach Italy from Libya since 2014.\n\nSo far in 2017, around 2,230 people have died while undertaking the perilous sea journey from Libya to Europe's shores.\n\nMany of those on board the trafficking boats are fleeing poverty, conflict and political persecution.", "timeCrawl": "09:34:00", "sim": 0.6431372761726379,

by the Italian Maritime Rescue Coordination Centre (MRCC) that threats against search & rescue vessels operating in international water have been issued by the Libyan Coast Guard.\n\nMany migrants & refugees attempt to make the dangerous Mediterranean crossing from Libya, often in flimsy boats operated by people smugglers.\n\nThe Guardian reports that the Libyan Coast Guard has become 'increasingly more aggressive' in its patrols of the waters off its coast.\n\nYesterday, MSF confirmed it is suspending activity of its ship 'Prudence', although its medical support team will continue to assist on board a ship operated by the SOS Mediterranee organisation.\n\nAnnemarie Loof, MSF's operational manager, said: \"If these declarations are confirmed and the orders are implemented we see two grave consequences - there will be more deaths at sea and more people trapped in Libya.\n\n\"If humanitarian ships are pushed out of the Mediterranean, there will be fewer ships in the area to rescue people from drowning. Those who will not drown will be intercepted and brought back to Libya, which we know is a place of lawlessness, arbitrary detention and extreme violence.\"\n\nAs well as calling for for Libyan authorities to clarify their position, the medical charity is also urging EU and Italian authorities \"to stop implementing deadly containment strategies that trap people in a country at war\".\n\nMSF's Brice de le Vingne added: \"Safe and legal pathways for refugees and migrants are urgently needed in order to reduce unnecessary death and suffering\".\n\nThe German NGO Sea Eye has also announced its decision to suspend operations.\n\nThe organisation's founder Michael Buschheuer explained: \"The reason for this is the changed security situation in the Western Mediterranean, after the Libyan Government announced an indefinite and unilateral extension of their territorial waters - in connection with an explicit threat against the private NGOs.\"\n\nAccording to Reuters, charity boats have played an increasing significant role in responding to the crisis in the Mediterranean - picking up more than a third of all migrants brought to Italy so far this year, compared to only 1% in 2014.\n\nIn recent months, charities have found themselves in dispute with Italian officials over efforts to introduce a 'code of conduct' for operations in the Mediterranean.\n\nMSF has refused to agree to the proposed code, saying the proposed presence of armed police officers on board NGO ships \"would be in breach of fundamental humanitarian principles of independence, neutrality and impartiality\".", "timeCrawl": "15:59:00", "sim": 0.6392157077789307, "extractedDates": null, "location": null, "originalArticle": null, "date": "2017-08-13", "id": "8936587", "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Health/Public_Health_and_Safety/Emergency_Services", "label": "dmoz/Health/Public Health and Safety/Emergency Services", "id": 110, "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Transportation_and_Logistics/Maritime", "label": "dmoz/Business/Transportation and Logistics/Maritime", "id": 288, "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/History/By_Topic", "label": "dmoz/Society/History/By Topic", "id": 653, "wgt": 100}], "details": {}}

migration policy and, particularly, over the rescue of refugees and migrants attempting to cross the Mediterranean Sea.\n\nItalian officials are investigating an Eritrean Catholic priest and a German humanitarian organization on suspicion of \"aiding and abetting illegal migration,\" but overcrowded and unseaworthy boats carrying migrants and refugees continue to make their way toward Italy's shores.\n\nFor years Italy has been the first port of call for refugees and migrants desperate to reach Europe and, as Pope Francis often has noted, the country has received little help from its European Union partners in rescuing, caring for and processing the newcomers.\n\nThe EU's 2013 Dublin Accord stipulates that requests for asylum and migrant processing must be handled by the first EU country a migrant or refugee enters. Because of its geographical proximity to Libya -- the primary port of departure to Europe -- Italy usually is that first country, although Malta also is a frontline destination.\n\nIn late July, Italy's prime minister announced an agreement with the Libyan government to have Italian military ships join Libyan ships in patrolling the Libyan coast. Prime Minister Paolo Gentiloni said the aim was to halt human trafficking and migrant smuggling. Migrants pay criminals for a place on the boats.\n\nBut, of course, many Italian politicians applauded the move as the best way to stop the influx of migrants and refugees.\n\nPope Francis, the Vatican office for migrants and refugees and a host of Catholic agencies and humanitarian organizations have long argued that the best way to defeat the traffickers is to expand quotas for legal immigration throughout Europe. Bypassing the traffickers would allow countries to organize the reception and would save migrants from the dangers that come from the sea and from extortion by the traffickers and a host of players that prey on the desperate in Libya.\n\nThe Italian government's second approach to handling the migration crisis was to attempt to forge an agreement with the nongovernmental organizations who are rescuing people at sea, providing food, water, medical care and safe transport to an Italian port.\n\nRight-wing political groups have claimed the likelihood of being rescued simply emboldens smugglers, who provide boats that are in increasingly bad shape, betting those onboard will be rescued.\n\nItaly asked the NGOs to sign a \"code of conduct\" promising, among other things: to refrain from communicating with or signaling to refugee boats in a way that facilitates their departure from Libyan waters; to inform the Rome-based Maritime Rescue Coordination Center about migrant sightings and rescue operations; to ferry rescued persons directly to a port without transferring them to or from other rescue boats; and, when requested, to allow police onboard to investigate possible cases of migrant smuggling or human trafficking.\n\nSome NGOs, like Doctors Without Borders, refused to sign the agreement. The rule against transferring migrants between boats would mean all rescue vessels would be making long roundtrips, rather than having the bigger boats go to port and smaller boats continuing to patrol, the organization said. In addition, the organization asked for a stipulation that investigating police would not be armed because it does not permit weapons aboard its ships; the Italian Interior Ministry declined to amend the agreement.\n\nJugend Rettet, a Germany-based group that raised money from young Europeans to buy a rescue ship, also declined to sign the agreement.\n\nItalian authorities seized the Jugend Rettet's ship, the Iuventa, Aug. 3, claiming that on as many as three occasions, the group did not technically rescue migrants at risk in the sea, but rather transferred them to the Iuventa from the hands of smugglers. The prosecutor in the case emphasized, however, that the group is not accused of accepting money or anything else from the smugglers.\n\nAlso under investigation for \"aiding and abetting illegal immigration\" is Father Mussie Zerai, a Rome-based priest from Eritrea and hero to many refugees and aid agencies that assist them. Since 2003, when someone wrote his phone number on the wall of a migrant detention center in Libya, Father Zerai has responded to distress calls from migrants on sinking boats in the Mediterranean and forwarded the position of the boats to the Italian and Maltese coast guards and to NGO rescue ships.\n\nHe told Avvenire, the Italian Catholic newspaper, that he never has had contact with Jugend Rettet, if that's how his name came up, and he has never contacted any NGO for a rescue without informing either the Italian or the Maltese coast guard. The charges, he said Aug. 9, are \"slanderous.\"\n\nFor Vatican officials, Catholic aid agencies and even a top official from the Italian foreign ministry, the campaign against humanitarian agencies is a bizarre twist in the debate over the best way to handle the migration crisis.\n\nMario Giro, vice minister for foreign affairs and the former Africa expert for the Catholic Sant'Egidio Community, said Jugend Rettet and others may be examples of \"humanitarian extremism,\" but that is more humane and more Christian than any of the other extreme positions being voiced.\n\n\"Are the NGOs right to save lives in the sea or should their salvation be the exclusive prerogative of state action,\" Giro asked in a guest column in Avvenire Aug. 8. Deciding whether to proceed with criminal charges against Jugend Rettet, the Italian magistrates will have to determine \"how to 'sanction' those who do not respect some of the rules of conduct established by the government without introducing -- as an Avvenire editorial phrased it -- a kind of 'humanitarian crime.'\"\n\nGiro called for caution and calm, urging his government and the NGOs to take seriously each other's concerns and work together for a solution. Even with their limits, he said, the NGOs represent \"the globalization of aid\" as surely as the migrant smugglers and human traffickers represent the globalization of crime.", "timeCrawl": "15:16:00", "sim": 0.6274510025978088, "extractedDates": [{"textStart": 3725, "date": "2017-08-03", "imp": true, "amb": false, "textEnd": 3731}, {"textStart": 4809, "date": "2017-08-09", "imp": true, "amb": false, "textEnd": 4815}, {"textStart": 5514, "date": "2017-08-08", "imp": true, "amb": false, "textEnd": 5520}], "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Vatican City"}}, "originalArticle": null, "date": "2017-08-11", "id": "8646395", "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Health/Public_Health_and_Safety/Emergency_Services", "label": "dmoz/Health/Public Health and Safety/Emergency Services", "id": 110, "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Transportation_and_Logistics/Maritime", "label": "dmoz/Business/Transportation and Logistics/Maritime", "id": 288, "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Pets/Dogs", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Pets/Dogs", "id": 542, "wgt": 100}], "details": {}}

if only to act as counterweight to the all-conquering Kiwis, because 2016 turned into the worst year ever in the history of the Springboks.\n\nThe team won exactly four of their 12 matches and the losses included a 57-17 shellacking at the hands of the All Blacks in Durban and, pinch yourself, a scarcely believable loss to the Six Nations whipping boys Italy.\n\nThe coach Allister Coetzee was handed the Springbok reins in April of 2016 with South Africa placed third in World Rugby's rankings. One year later the proud Bokke had slipped to seventh, two places below Scotland. France showed up in June licking their lips in anticipation of a rare series win on the road but left South Africa with their tails between their legs after losing all three Tests by an aggregate margin of 109-41.\n\nSouth African-born former Scotland prop Matthew Proudfoot is the Bokke forwards coach and he explained how the South Africans hauled themselves off the canvas and landed a knock-out blow to a big, physical French team.\n\n\"I think that we had proper preparation time this year,\" says the four-time Scotland international.\n\n\"In April of last year we weren't even confirmed as coaches and we started our Test series in June so it was a late turnaround last year.\n\n\"I think decent preparation time and alignment with our franchises - we had three training camps already this season - gave us the opportunity to prepare and that was the turnaround.\"\n\nProudfoot could have added several other reasons. The Springboks hired a former favourite Brendan Venter as defence coach, a role he already fulfils for Italy, and he tightened up a good few nuts and bolts.\n\nThe players have also changed, with some of the old guard being shown the door. Only two players started the Italy game in 2016 and the first French Test in June of this year in the same jersey, Tendai Mtwirawara and new skipper Warren Whiteley, although the \"eightman\" is currently injured and will miss next weekend's start of the Rugby Championship when the Bokke welcome Argentina to Nelson Mandela Stadium in Port Elizabeth.\n\nAnd the absent Whiteley is the clue to another important change in the Springboks. He is one of the many (Johannesburg) Lions, beaten Super Rugby finalists only recently, who make up the spine of this team and bring with them a more adventurous style of play.\n\nSouth African \"loosies\" are usually the size of a house but Whiteley is listed as 15\u00bd stones. He is a bantamweight amongst the big beasts in the Springboks' pack but the leader has distribution skills and vision and the ability to do the right thing at the right time. He is a rugby playing breakaway, whisper it, in the New Zealand mould.\n\nThere is no question of the Bokke giving up on the biff and boff but, as Proudfoot explains, they are trying to find a balance in their play which has not always been evident.\n\n\"Allister [Coetzee] believes that South African rugby has a DNA and that is the philosophy he preaches,\" says the former Scottish international. \"At the end of the day, rugby is a contact sport and the contacts tend to be physical!\n\n\"Rugby has been played that way in South Africa but it's about finding a blend. The modern game revolves more around space, not necessarily just running into each other and bashing each other which is a way that South African rugby has been stereotyped in the past ten years.\n\n\"But we are looking to blend physicality and skill in a particular way that Allister believes and June was pretty close to what he was looking for.\n\n\"He would like people to sit back and look at South Africa playing and know it was a South African team just from the way they play and I think if you look at the way we played in June I think that is pretty much how he wants to play the game.\"\n\nProudfoot had two stints in Scotland, the first with Edinburgh when he won three caps, the second with Glasgow when injuries meant he was never properly conditioned...but he still added a fourth Test cap.\n\nHe recalls his time in Scotland with warmth and talks about how much he learned from the likes of Jim Telfer and Glasgow's Hugh Campbell, who he rates amongst the best scrum coaches he has ever come across. His Scotland jersey hangs on the wall in his Cape\n\nTown house and he contacted the new Scotland coach over the summer.\n\n\"Gregor [Townsend] is a good mate of mine. We were room mates when we toured Australia (in 1998) so I sent him some messages of congratulations when they beat Australia. I always watch how the Scots play. I have fond memories from my time in Scotland and of course what I learned there.\"\n\nThe inclusion of Whiteley - when fit - the athletic flanker Sila Kolise, the classy (Johannesburg) Lions' stand-off Elton Jantjies and Jan Serfontain in the midfield means the Bokke scored 12 tries in the three-match series against France, seven of which fell to backs. Meanwhile the (B&I) Lions did South Africa a favour in the summer by reminding everyone that New Zealand are not invincible.\n\n\"The All Blacks didn't lose the series so they still took something out of it, but the talk beforehand was the All Blacks would win 3-0 and to see what the Lions have done was really remarkable,\" says Proudfoot.\n\n\"I don't know if you can just follow that recipe. I think every country has its own process to follow to beat the All Blacks.\n\n\"We are a young side and we are just taking this Championship for what it is, a really tough Championship.\n\n\"We are growing in confidence. We just want some continuity and some performances back-to-back. New Zealand are leading the way and everyone is trying to catch them.\"\n\nThe Springboks should be too strong for Argentina and the Wallabies but the only question on anyone's mind is how close are they to the All Blacks?\n\n\"Oh, it's a tough question,\" Proudfoot replies. \"Can I answer it in a few months time after we've played them?\"", "timeCrawl": "13:42:00", "sim": 0.6235294342041016, "extractedDates": null, "location": null, "originalArticle": null, "date": "2017-08-13", "id": "8921900", "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Football/Rugby_Union", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Football/Rugby Union", "id": 46, "wgt": 100}], "details": {}}

More than 83,000 migrants arrived in southern Italy in the first half of this year, an increase of 19 per cent on the first six months of last year. Over 2,300 have died on the crossing in 2017, after more than 4,000 last year.\n\nThe use of Italian ports has become a touchy subject with Italian voters. The Italian government, which faces an election early next year - with the populist Beppo Grillo's 5-Star party currently in the lead - has adopted a tough approach to migrant boats.\n\nHelpfully, Libya's Prime Minister, who is the head of the UN-backed unity government, has asked Italy to send its navy to help the Libyan coastguard pick up migrants within Libya's 12-mile territorial waters and take them back to shore.\n\nItaly's tough policy shift has led to a number of repercussions. One incident involved a standoff between Italy and Malta. A charity vessel, the Golfo Azzurro, was refused entry by the Italian government to allow three rescued migrants to disembark in Lampedusa. The ship was re-directed to Malta, but the Maltese authorities refused it entry on the solid grounds under international law that people rescued at sea should disembark at the closest safe port of call.\n\nThe Maltese government was absolutely within its rights to adhere to that principle for fear of setting an important precedent.\n\nBut there are broader issues at stake. Before Italy's recent agreement with Libya, the majority of migrants would sail from Libyan ports into international waters to be rescued by charity boats or the Italian coastguard. Critics have accused the rescue NGOs of operating a \"taxi service\" for migrants.\n\nThe people-traffickers' ploy had been to deliver migrants not to Italy, but just outside the boundary of Libya's territorial waters so they could be rescued by NGO charity boats beyond. Though there can be absolutely no doubt that the charities were - and are - motivated by noble intentions, they were in effect inadvertently aiding the traffickers.\n\nThe deal just reached with Libya makes it very difficult for people-smugglers to operate, and is an important element of EU policy. But by teaming up with the Libyans, Italy is facing accusations of helping their coastguard to force migrants back into camps where rape, torture and slavery are commonplace.\n\nTurning back the boats in Libya's territorial waters may carry risks in the short term, but Italy has recognised this in its plans to establish proper refugee camps in Libya. It must now press ahead with these urgently to ensure that the Italian intervention inside Libyan waters does not exacerbate an already bad humanitarian situation.\n\nAs Bill Gates - definitely not a hard-liner on migration - has said: \"Europe must make it more difficult for Africans to reach the continent [of Europe] via the current transit routes.\" The top three countries of origin of those arriving in Italy in the first quarter of this year were Nigeria, Bangladesh and Guinea.\n\nUN figures suggest that 70 per cent of those who have arrived in Libya were escaping poverty.\n\nUnless and until the central Mediterranean is viewed by economic migrants as a cul de sac, the numbers will continue to increase along with the profits for the people-traffickers.\n\nLong term, the most benevolent and sensible strategy is to improve life in the poorest countries and so weaken the desire to migrate.

Over the first 10 days of August, for example, 1,572 migrants landed on Italy's shores -- most of them from Libya -- a dramatic 76-percent drop compared to the 6,554 in the same period a year ago.\n\nIn July, 11,459 arrived, a little less than half the 23,552 migrants who came to Italy in July 2016.\n\nItalian Interior Minister Marco Minniti said the drop off is part of a trend as Italy and -- to a lesser extent -- other European Union states, invested cash and manpower in Libya to help stabilize the country that had fallen into chaos since 2011. The money was used to stabilize the country's economy and institutions and, most importantly, to beef up the country's coastguard.\n\nMinniti told Italian journalists,\"The idea of reinforcing the Libyan coast guard seemed like a fantasy, but it is already paying dividends.\"\n\nThe Interior Ministry said that during the first weekend in August, Libyan ships rescued 1,180 migrants, compared to just 130 by all non-Libyan vessels.\n\nThe move comes after the efforts to better patrol the waters between Turkey and Greece -- which until last year had been the most used entry path into the European Union for migrants -- produced similar results.\n\nIn recent weeks, Italian government officials have said there is no reason the number of arrivals will not continue to drop if efforts in Libya and other ports of departure for the migrants continue.\n\nMinniti said that after the August summer break, he plans to lobby the rest of the European Union to funnel more resources into the initiatives like the one that Italy started to reinforce the Libyan coast guard.\n\nBut others aren't so sure the plan will have the intended effect.\"If you close one door, it doesn't take long for someone looking to get in to find another one,\" Maurizio Ambrosini, a sociologist and commentator on migrant issues in the school of political science at the University of Milan, told Xinhua.\n\n\"It's too early to call this a trend. After all, who is to say that the migrants who were stopped won't end up arriving in Spain or elsewhere?\" Other commentators echoed that view in the local press.\n\nAmbrosini said that as long as life in the African and Middle Eastern countries providing the bulk of the migrants remains so difficult, there will be those willing to take risks to seek a better life.\n\n\"As long as there is war and extreme poverty, there will be people who will want to become migrants,\" the professor said, \"In that context, enforcement efforts can only have a limited success.\"\n\nCentral delegation visits residents in Inner Mongolia\n\nIn pics: magnificent landmarks of BRICS countries\n\nLocal community organizes donation event to aid Jiuzhaigou in Hefei\n\nSilk Road Chinese Ethno Music Festival held in Pula, Croatia", "timeCrawl": "22:56:00", "sim": 0.4705882370471954, "extractedDates": [{"textStart": 6, "date": "2017-08-12", "imp": true, "amb": false, "textEnd": 13}, {"date": "2011-07-", "textStart": 475, "amb": false, "textEnd": 483}, {"date": "2016-07-", "textStart": 562, "amb": false, "textEnd": 571}], "location": {"country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Italy"}}, "type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Rome"}}, "originalArticle": null, "date": "2017-08-12", "id": "8852051", "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues", "id": 41, "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Government", "label": "dmoz/Society/Government", "id": 139, "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Government/Multilateral", "label": "dmoz/Society/Government/Multilateral", "id": 140, "wgt": 100}], "details": {}}

No big deal! It has happened before and it has happened on countless other occasions. Nothing special.\n\nOr is it?\n\nFor the past four years, since this government came to power, Malta has been spared the constant flow of migrants entering our shores simply because the Italians have taken the lot with no questions asked. Frankly, Italy has constantly taken the brunt.\n\nSo this incident might seem to many like the odd case of a lonely boat having lost its way to Italy and instead ended up in Malta. It may already have fallen under the radar, but for those who follow migration closely it is a first sign of a crisis waiting to happen.\n\nOnly a few weeks ago, a Sicilian prosecutor said he had hard evidence of NGOs aiding and abetting human smugglers. During the past few years, NGOs like MOAS were allowed to conduct search and rescue operations in the Mediterranean, even quite close to Libyan shores. There are plenty, and most of them, like MOAS, do sterling work.\n\nHowever, the Sicilian prosecutor accused some of them (not MOAS) of having become simply a taxi service for migrants wanting to make the trip from Libyan waters to Italy.\n\nNeedless to say, this story hit the headlines almost instantly in Italy and it has been tough-going for Prime Minister Paolo Gentiloni ever since. As expected, the pressure was ratcheted up mostly by right leaning parties and populists like Beppe Grillo of the Five-Star movement. Lately, even the centre-right Forza Italia has weighed in.\n\nThe Socialist minster of the Interior Marco Minitti, who is the former Italian spy chief, moved swiftly to rein in the NGOs, generally by piling pressure on them to sign a code of conduct. Some did, others did not.\n\nMeanwhile, the Italian authorities seized a German NGO's rescue vessel alleging that its crew had taken on migrants directly from smugglers' boats near Libya's coast. Reportedly, the preventive seizure was based on evidence that emerged from three episodes in which crew members had contact with human smugglers operating boats crowded with migrants. One of these episodes happened in September 2016 and two in June. \"There were contacts, meetings, understandings between the group's boat and the smugglers,\" the prosecutor said.\n\nNow, the Italian government seems to have taken the decision not to allow access to its port to NGOs which continue to refuse to sign the code of conduct. This brings us to the lonely boat stranded just outside Malta waiting for the Maltese authorities to give it access to our port.\n\nThe Maltese refused to give it access and the Italians caved in eventually when they realised that the boat was owned by an NGO that had actually signed the Code of Conduct. It seems that at first the Italians thought this boat was owned by The Boat Refugee Foundation, an NGO that has consistently refused to sign the Code of Conduct, but it then transpired that the vessel had actually changed hands and is now owned by another NGO which did sign the code. When this was brought to the attention of the Italian government, it allowed the boat to enter Italy.\n\nWith a million migrants on the North African coast waiting to cross over to Europe and with a relatively new Italian Prime Minster constantly under immense pressure for taking ever-increasing numbers of migrants, the situation is bound to explode.\n\nWhat happens if the Italian government refuses to give access to other NGO boats in the coming days and weeks? Will these boats then try to come to Malta?\n\nIf there was a hushed-up agreement between former Prime Minister Matteo Renzi and our Prime Minster, Joseph Muscat, will the current Italian Prime Minister continue to honour it?\n\nVery pertinent questions indeed. My advice to our Prime Minister is to be prepared.

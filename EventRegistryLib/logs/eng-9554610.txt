"Geneva, May 9 (Prensa Latina) The World Health Organization (WHO) on Thursday launched the first global guidelines to prevent the occurrence of bloodstream and other infections caused by use of catheters placed in minor blood vessels during medical procedures.\n\nDeveloping and implementing guidance to prevent the spread of such infections has been a key priority for WHO.\n\nThe new guidelines include 14 good practice statements and 23 recommendations on key areas for health workers, including education and training of health workers, techniques of asepsis and hand hygiene practices, insertion, maintenance, access, removal of catheters, and catheter selection.\n\nAccording to experts, poor practices in the insertion, maintenance and removal of these catheters carry a high risk of introducing germs directly to the bloodstream, which can lead to serious conditions such as sepsis, and difficult-to-treat complications in major organs like brain and kidneys.\n\nSoft tissue infections at the insertion site of the catheter can also occur.\n\nUp to 70% of all in-patients require the use of a catheter inserted into a peripheral vein or artery, also known as peripherally inserted catheters (PIVCs), at some point during their hospital stay.\n\nPeople who receive catheter-based treatments are often particularly vulnerable to infections, as they may be seriously ill or have low immunity.\n\nAccording to WHO estimates, between 2000 and 2018, average mortality among patients affected by healthcare-associated sepsis was 24.4%, rising to 52.3% among patients treated in ICUs.\n\nMany bloodstream infections are caused by antibiotic resistant bacterial infections.\n\nIt is estimated that bacterial antimicrobial resistance (AMR) was directly

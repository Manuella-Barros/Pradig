Gukesh and R. Praggnanandhaa faced off in the Superbet rapid tournament, with Gukesh emerging victorious. Praggnanandhaa later defeated Anish Giri, while Gukesh defeated Vincent Keymer. Kirill Shevchenko's winning streak ended against Erigaisi Arjun. Magnus Carlsen shares the lead with Shevchenko, followed by Wei Yi. Gukesh, Praggnanandhaa, and Arjun share fourth place with five points. Giri holds the last spot with two points. Four rounds of rapid remain before an 18-round blitz tournament starts.\n\nNewly-crowned FIDE Candidates' champion D Gukesh struck back after recovering from a sedate start to defeat compatriot R Praggnanandhaa and Vincent Keymer in the Superbet rapid and blitz tournament, a part of the Grand Chess tour.\n\nGukesh, who recorded just a lone draw out of three games, fought his way back at the expense of Praggnanandhaa earlier in the first round of the day. Praggnanandhaa lost his way in the middle game and did not quite recover.\n\nWasting no time following the loss to Gukesh, Praggnanandhaa also returned much stronger in the fifth-round, defeating Holland's Anish Giri, while Gukesh made most of chances to crush Keymer.\n\nThe dream run of Romanian Kirill Shevchenko was ended by Erigaisi Arjun who scored his first victory in the event.\n\nAt the top, World number one Magnus Carlsen of Norway joined Shevchenko in the lead on seven points out of a possible ten and these two are now followed by Wei Yi of China who is one point behind.\n\nThe Indian trio of Gukesh, Praggnanandhaa and Arjun are sharing the fourth spot on five points along with Nodirbek Abdusattorov of Uzbekistan. Duda Jan-Kryzstof of Poland and Vincent Keymer of Germany share the eighth spot on four points and a completely off-form Giri is now in the last spot with just two points. Four more rounds remain in the rapid section of the event before an 18-round blitz tournament kickstarts.\n\nEarlier, World Number seven Arjun held Carlsen to an easy draw in the opener and then drew two more games to remain within striking distance of early leader Kirilll Shevchenko of Romania after the third round of tournament.\n\nWhile Gukesh lost his first two games before drawing the third, R Praggnanandhaa recovered in the third round to beat Nodirbek Abdusattorov of Uzbekistan to be on a fifty percent score.\n\nShevchenko, the lowest seed in the tournament emerged as the early leader with three victories on the trot coming in contrasting fashion.\n\nThe Ukrainian-turned-Romanian benefitted from a rare blunder by Gukesh in the first round, defeated Praggnanandhaa in a brilliantly crafted game and then showed his technical acumen to crash throught he defenses of Vincent Keymer of Germany.\n\nWith each victory in the rapid worth two points, Shevchenko marched his way to six points and enjoys two points lead over nearest rivals Carlsen and Abdusattorov who both have four points.\n\nArjun and Praggnanandhaa share the fourth spot on 3 points apiece along with Keymer.

The tour also has a bonus prize pool of USD 175000 for the top three finishers out of which a UDS 100000 is reserved for the winner.\n\nThe four players who have signed up for the entire tour are Gukesh, Praggnanandhaa, Anish Giri of Holland and Nodirbek Abdusattarov of Uzbekistan. All of them will take part in four out of five events out of which two will be classical and remaining three will be rapid and blitz.\n\nBesides Carlsen and Arjun, the other four wild cards have been given to Wei Yi of China, Duda Jan-Krzysztof of Poland, Vincent Keymer of Germany and Kirill Shevchenko of Romania.\n\nSet to play four out of five events in the tour, Gukesh looks like one of the tour favourites. The Chennai-based player also has a World Championship match to play later this year against Ding Liren of China and he surely has his hands full.\n\nPraggnanandhaa is a known expert in the faster version of the game and has beaten Carlsen a few times already. If there is one opponent that creates fear for the opposition -- that's this 18-year-old Praggnanandhaa.\n\nArjun might have missed out on a Candidates berth very narrowly but has quickly put that setback aside. Banking on open events that elite players seldom play, Arjun struck back like a hurricane and briefly became top Indian rated player too till Gukesh surpassed him. Arjun is one uncompromising player in the world who fears none and wants to be his best, no matter who the opposition is.\n\nFor Carlsen, the biggest opposition will come from the Indian trio only, both in Rapid and Blitz.\n\nGukesh may not be the best when it comes to faster version of the game but the reason why he is playing is a clear signal that he wants to get better at it.

Wei Yi of China shares the seventh spot with Giri and Duda Jan-Krzystof of Poland with two points in their kitty, while Gukesh is in the rear on one point.\n\nSix more rounds in rapid and 18 in blitz still remain in the USD 175000 prize money tournament.\n\nArjun was clearly the pick of the day among three Indians showcasing a solid approach with three draws. Playing black against Carlsen, Arjun came up with the French defense and Carlsen surprisingly chose the exchange variation.\n\nThe middle game did not offer much for Carlsen and gradual exchanges led to a drawn rook and pawns endgame wherein draw was a just result.\n\nIt was another rook and pawns endgame against Giri out of a Nimzo Indian defense game. Playing his second black, Arjun again gave nothing away and drew when the players were left with bare kings.\n\nIn his third game of the day, Arjun had some optical advantage but had to split the point with Wei Yi.\n\nGukesh blundered his queen away thinking about a check-mate that was not happening in the first round against Shevchenko. It was a shocker for the fans of the recently crowned world championship challenger.\n\nAs is usually the case, it was hard to deal with the oversight. In the second round too, Gukesh was doing fine but blundered again to walk himself in to a lost knights and pawns endgame against Abdusattarov. Gukesh finally recovered in the final game of the day and drew with Anish Giri.\n\nPraggnanandhaa started off with a draw against Duda but then fell prey to Shevchenko. The Indian showed steely nerves yet again and defeated Abdusattorov in the last game of the day to come back on fifty percent.\n\nStandings after round 3 Rapid: 1.

No surprise, therefore, that he looked miserable as he took a 57-move draw in which he got no real chances.\n\nAs it turned out, however, that result was just fine for the Norwegian's tournament chances. Unfortunately for Shevchenko, he lost the next two games, while Carlsen did Carlsen things as he turned a good knight versus an average bishop position into a superior queen endgame that he went on to win in 107 moves against a player who has outplayed him in queen endgames in the past: GM Nordirbek Abdusattorov. The applause was deserved.\n\nThat set up the clash against world championship challenger Gukesh in the final round of the day perfectly, and the players treated us to a wild opening until the 17-year-old backed down from a fight with 10.Nf3.\n\nHe explained afterward: \"Obviously 10.Qh5 is the main move here, but I couldn't remember all the details, and I thought it's risky to play this without proper knowledge, so I tried to play something simple but he just easily equalized.\"\n\nIn fact, it was worse than that, as Carlsen took over and gained a serious initiative. An exchange sac then made precision essential, and one mistake left Gukesh in a losing position. It wasn't trivial for either side, however, and the win slipped through the world number one's fingers.\n\nThat's our Game of the Day and has been analyzed by GM Rafael Leitao below:\n\nThat miss by Carlsen allowed Wei, the winner of this year's Tata Steel Chess Masters, to storm into the joint lead with a perfect 6/6 score on day two.\n\nWei Yi Shows More Of His Tata Steel Form\n\nWei had two draws and a loss to Carlsen on day one, but he turned things around on day two. He started with a win over GM Anish Giri which he confessed was somewhat lucky, since his opponent had a good position until he got into time trouble, lost the plot, and got cut down by a ruthless attack.\n\nIt's move 28, all the pieces are still on the board, and pawns are level, but Black is completely busted, with weak pawns on b7, d6, and h5, while White's pieces have perfect outposts.\n\nWei's win over Shevchenko in the final round was another tour de force, featuring targeted preparation against his opponent's Alapin Sicilian, relentless pressure, and then a fine conversion... up to a point. When the position simplified, Wei had a queen and four extra pawns against two rooks.\n\nHe let his guard down, admitting, \"I thought every move was winning, but then I found the only way to draw!\" Objectively (based on tablebases), it seems the win never slipped, but Shevchenko managed to construct something that looked to be a fortress before Wei's determination finally paid off in 75 moves.\n\nA Good Day For India\n\nThe first day in Warsaw was very tough for the Indian trio, but on day two everything came together. Although GM Arjun Erigaisi started with a loss to Duda, he hit back to win a model game against the tournament leader, Shevchenko.\n\nThe other two Indian stars, Gukesh and Praggnanandhaa, started against each other, with Gukesh feeling that his opponent played a solid position unnecessarily aggressively. It could have paid off, however, with the computer pointing out that 25...Rxf1+! would have been strong instead of 25...Rf2? 26.Qg4!, when it was essentially game over.\n\nGukesh was surprised when that line was pointed out to him but noted his opponent had too little time. That was where he felt he improved on day two: \"Yesterday it was a long time since I'd played some rapid and my time management was obviously so bad, but my games were quite good, so I was not that worried about my games, but today I just made sure I managed my time better, and I'm quite happy.\"\n\nGukesh then punished Keymer for not castling in a complex game featuring a dubious king walk and an attractive final queen sacrifice.\n\nThe world championship challenger had made it back to 50 percent and then ended well by avoiding defeat against Carlsen.\n\nPraggnanandhaa managed to shrug off the poor start to the day by winning an insane game against Giri that was another terrifying glimpse into the depths of modern computer preparation.\n\nPraggnanandhaa explained that both players knew the line, but his opponent was shaky on the details: \"There were many options for Black, but most of them go into some crazy complications and he went wrong there, and I had to find a couple of accurate moves, which weren't too difficult.\"\n\nHe was asked if he would want such a bizarre game to be shown to kids, and responded: \"It would have been nice if I'd taken Rxf1+ in the previous game to show to the kids, but I didn't, so I have to show this now!\"\n\nHe ended the day by trapping Keymer's queen in a much more understandable manner -- it was a day to forget for the German number one.\n\nPraggnanandhaa shares third place, just a point behind Carlsen, who he faces in round seven and could overtake with a win, since wins in rapid chess are worth two points. Gukesh and Arjun are just one more point back, so that there's everything for the Indian stars to play for going into the final day of the rapid and the weekend of blitz to come.\n\nThe 2024 Superbet Rapid & Blitz Poland is the first event on the 2024 Grand Chess Tour and runs May 8-12 in the POLIN Museum of the History of Polish Jews in Warsaw, Poland. The 10 players first compete in a single rapid round-robin with a time control of 25 minutes plus a 10-second increment per move, followed by a blitz double round-robin with a 5+2 time control.\n\nPrevious coverage:", "source": {"uri": "chess.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Chess.com"}, "authors": [{"uri": "colin_mcgourty@chess.com", "name": "Colin McGourty", "type": "author",

The Chennai teenager broke Garry Kasparov's record as the youngest world championship challenger, and will meet China's Ding Liren for the crown at the end of this year.\n\nCarlsen, who abdicated his title in 2023 after a 10-year reign, and Gukesh are both competing over the board over five days in the Warsaw Rapid and Blitz, part of the St Louis-organised Grand Chess Tour created by the US patron and FT reader Rex Sinquefield. Rapid games last approximately an hour, blitz around 10 minutes. Play starts at noon BST on Wednesday and can be followed on YouTube, as well as on lichess.org and other major chess websites.\n\nOnline, Carlsen plays in the Chess.com Classic, part of the Champions Tour which includes qualifiers in which all grandmasters can compete. The action begins on Wednesday at 5.30pm BST and can be followed on twitch.tv. Carlsen is pre-qualified for the later rounds and will start his tournament on Friday.\n\nIt seems that Carlsen is confident enough in his stamina to accept what could be up to eight or 10 hours of play daily from Friday to Sunday. Alternatively, he may be prioritising the Warsaw Rapid in Warsaw on Wednesday and Thursday over the weekend Blitz.\n\nWarsaw is the more interesting event in terms of participants, as it features a rare showdown between Carlsen and the cream of the new crop of younger players. The 33-year-old will take on not only Gukesh but also Praggnandhaa Rameshbabu, 18, Arjun Erigaisi, 20, and Nodirbek Abdusattorov, 19. The two Indians and the Uzbek are all, along with Gukesh, the most prominent rising stars of the new chess generation.\n\nPraggnanandhaa was fifth in the Candidates, a debut performance highly praised by Carlsen, while in the past few weeks Abdusattorov has won major tournaments at Prague and Malmo and has risen to No 4 in the world rankings. At Malmo, the Uzbek sacrificed a rook and a knight to checkmate his Swedish opponent.\n\nFide, the governing chess body, has invited bids for the Gukesh v Ding Liren world championship match, quoting figures that have stirred up a debate. Their 14-game series is scheduled for November 20 to December 15.\n\nFide's minimum total budget for bidders is $8.5mn, including a $2.5mn prize fund and a $1.1mn fee to Fide. These sums have not deterred interested parties, and bids are expected from Singapore and Argentina, as well as at least two from India, with unconfirmed reports that Saudi Arabia is also interested. Of these, Argentina seems the least likely since online audiences from India and China would need to watch the games in the small hours of the night.\n\nThe biennial world championship is a major fund generating event for Fide, comparable to Wimbledon for the LTA. Fide's CEO, Emil Sutovsky, said: \"We are trying to maximise our top events, to generate income. That is reasonable, and that is not different from what any sport is doing. Revenue from such events is reinvested into other projects and promotion of the game.\"\n\nExamples of the latter are the tours by the former world title challenger, Nigel Short, who has visited many small nations in the Americas, Africa and Oceania, enlisting them as Fide members while giving simultaneous displays against local enthusiasts for whom it is a once in a lifetime opportunity to challenge a grandmaster. Fide also organises global championships for schools, corporations, and people with disabilities.\n\nPuzzle 2571\n\nArnar Gunnarson v Ivan Sokolov, Reykjavik 2001. White chose 1 gxf7+? and drew.

He commented, after his amazing first day, \"For me it is the strongest tournament I ever played, because the field is really without underdogs... except me!\"\n\nThe field is really without underdogs... except me!\n\n-- Kirill Shevchenko\n\nShevchenko mentioned that this year, he was trying to put no pressure on himself since a year ago, he'd approached the event with clear goals, only to crash and burn in the rapid section.\n\nAlthough Shevchenko did recover well in the blitz to score seven wins, he might have feared a repeat in rapid when he found himself on the defensive against newly-minted world championship challenger Gukesh. \"He's better, but his king is weak, my king is weak, so it's a fight,\" was Shevchenko's hope, and suddenly things went his way after the shocking time-trouble blunder, 34.Qd3??.\n\nShevchenko, in fact, proved to be a blunder-magnet, as in the very next game, another hugely talented Indian star, Praggnanandhaa, went astray early on.\n\n9...Bg4? was a disastrous move, but this time you needed to be eagle-eyed to spot the winning shot: 10.Nxe5!. Shevchenko did, though his opponent fought back, and the last decisive mistake only came on move 36.\n\nShevchenko was on a roll, and his third game, against Keymer, would also be determined by a shocking blunder. Once again, however, he'd earned it by making the decision not to win back a pawn and make a draw but to play on a pawn down in an unclear position.\n\nDown to seconds, his German opponent slipped with 41.Rhc1?, which ran into 41...f4!, winning the pinned knight on e3.\n\nIt's going to be hard for Shevchenko to follow up on such a start, but he's already scored almost half as many points in one day as he managed in five in 2023.\n\nFor the first two rounds the one player to match Shevchenko was Abdusattorov, who carried his momentum from winning the TePe Sigeman Chess Tournament in Malmo into the start in Warsaw. His first game, against GM Anish Giri, had some shaky moments but finished with an absolutely wonderful queen-sacrifice!\n\nDon't miss GM Rafael Leitao's full analysis of our Game of the Day:\n\nAbdusattorov followed that up by inflicting more misery on Gukesh, who once again played well only to miss a detail that allowed his opponent to trade down into a winning endgame.\n\nIt wasn't to be a perfect start for the Uzbek star, however, since Praggnanandhaa bounced back from his blunder against Shevchenko to overcome huge resistance and defeat Abdusattorov in the final round of the day.\n\nAbdusattorov is one of just four Grand Chess Tour regulars playing in Warsaw (the others are Gukesh, Praggnanandhaa, and Giri) who will be eligible for prizes at the end of the season, while no less than six players are wildcards. They're led by a certain Carlsen, who joined Abdusattorov in second place after ending the day on an unbeaten 4/6.\n\nThe former world champion is, at 33, the oldest player in the tournament, with the next oldest being 29-year-old Giri. Another former champion knows how that feels.\n\n\"I'm really happy to be the only representative of adults, 30 and older. It's going to be an interesting challenge, for sure. I've played tournaments where there's a mix, but I don't think I've played a tournament like this where it's almost exclusively young players, so it's going to be fun. Sometimes it's easy to underestimate younger players because you don't know how quickly they develop. You expect them to have a certain level and then the very next tournament they've actually gotten a bit better, so it's going to be super fun and super interesting to see, and hopefully I can still teach them a thing or two.\"\n\nThe first game against GM Arjun Erigaisi felt like a case of being the adult in the room, but that was mainly down to Arjun, who made three draws on Wednesday with 98.2, 98.9, and 96.9 accuracy scores.\n\nCarlsen's win, against Chinese GM Wei Yi, came from what the Norwegian confessed was a \"pretty suspicious opening,\" but he was happy with how he went on to win.\n\nCarlsen, not famous for making fast starts, shared his feelings going into the final game of the day against local hero GM Jan-Krzysztof Duda:\n\n\"Before the game I was thinking I've sort of survived the first day, let's try and be safe, and the game starts and I'm out of control from the get-go. I could feel that he was not completely on form, he was probably a bit tilted after losing the previous game, otherwise he might have punished me harder in that game.\"\n\nThe game looked set to be a Najdorf before Carlsen met 1.e4 c5 2.Nf3 d6 with 3.h3!?, which was a theme for his day. Against Arjun, he'd used an early h3 in the Exchange French recommended by Nikos Ntirlis, and now he followed the Sicilian recommendation.\n\n\"You can always play something against the Najdorf. If the Najdorf was the only playable opening against 1.e4 everybody would play e4, I think.\"\n\nIf the Najdorf was the only playable opening against 1.e4 everybody would play e4.\n\n-- Magnus Carlsen\n\nWhat followed was a fine bar brawl of a game where both players missed winning chances.\n\nThat eventful day left Carlsen in a healthy second place, as almost all the players experienced ups and downs.\n\nOne game that deserves to be mentioned is Keymer-Wei, which saw the young German GM sacrifice a knight in the opening for a winning position, then a queen (a sound sac, though not even the best move!), then a bishop (three times!), before Wei got in on the act and sacrificed material of his own to make a 130-move draw, though he also missed a chance to win. It's too much to try and annotate, but you can play through the rollercoaster below!\n\nThe tournament is just beginning, with another six rounds of rapid chess to be played on Thursday (including Gukesh-Carlsen) and Friday, before 18 rounds of blitz over the weekend.\n\nIt's a tough schedule for the players, but it's noteworthy that Carlsen and Keymer will both be playing the Champions Chess Tour Chess.com Classic from Friday, while the likes of Giri, Abdusattorov, and Duda are playing today's Play-In as they attempt to join them.\n\nThe 2024 Superbet Rapid & Blitz Poland is the first event on the 2024 Grand Chess Tour and runs May 8-12 in the POLIN Museum of the History of Polish Jews in Warsaw, Poland. The 10 players first compete in a single rapid round-robin with a time control of 25 minutes plus a 10-second increment per move, followed by a blitz double round-robin with a 5+2 time control.\n\nPrevious coverage:", "source": {"uri": "chess.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Chess.com"}, "authors": [{"uri": "colin_mcgourty@chess.com", "name": "Colin McGourty", "type": "author",

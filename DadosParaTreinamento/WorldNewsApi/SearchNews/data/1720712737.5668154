The star, 42, rose to fame as a teenager, hosting GMTV children\u2019s TV show The Disney Club and its replacement, Diggit. As an adult, she went on to host Top of the Pops before later helming Love Island in 2006 and X Factor spin-off The Xtra Factor in 2007. Fearne\u2019s wide and varied career in broadcasting has seen her hosting shows on BBC Radio 1 and Radio 2, and as team leader opposite Holly Willoughby on the raunchy ITV panel show Celebrity Juice. However, her journey has not been without its pitfalls. In a recent interview, Fearne \u2013 whose early rise to fame left her battling bulimia and poor mental health \u2013 has revealed the darker side of the industry \u2013 and one which left her unsure of where her next job is coming from. Even worse, she revealed how she had been brutally sacked in the past \u2013 finding out only by seeing another person in her place. Fearne rose to fame as a TV and radio personality in the early 2000s (Picture: 2005 Comic Relief) \u2018I\u2019ve been sacked a million times,\u2019 Fearne told The Sunday Times. \u2018I\u2019ve been sacked and not told I\u2019ve been sacked. You just turn the telly on and someone else is doing your job,\u2019 she continued. \u2018It\u2019s all a big game. You\u2019ve got the Monopoly board out and you\u2019re moving around [trying to] dodge the danger,\u2019 she added. Fame hasn\u2019t always been kind to Fearne (Picture: WireImage) Elsewhere in the interview, Fearne revealed the toll that fame had taken on her mental health over the years. \u2018If you want to get a whole host of mental health problems, get in the public eye really young because you get them all,\u2019 she said. \u2018There\u2019s no way you can get through it in one piece \u2026 All my mental health lows are because of my job. Nothing else. It is not conducive to a balanced mind.\u2019 Fearne has written a number of books, including her debut novel (Picture: Dave Benett) The stress only intensified when she took over from Jo Whiley on Radio 1, where a live stream of abuse left her anxious and depressed. \u2018You had a big screen with all the text messages coming in. It\u2019s ghastly speaking live with people going \u201cYou\u2019re a k**b!\u201d I took over from Jo Whiley \u2014 the queen of radio \u2014 so imagine the abuse,\u2019 she said. \u2018I can do live radio with my eyes closed, but I could not sleep the night before,\u201d she recalls. \u201cI\u2019d get a week down the line and go, \u2018I feel ill \u2014 I can\u2019t do this.\u2019\u201d The anxiety escalated into panic attacks. \u201cI got to the point where I just thought, \u2018Why am I doing this to myself? Am I that desperate to be seen or heard?\u2019 she added. Fearne has two children with husband Jesse Wood (Picture: WireImage) Having dialled back her live work (\u2018I\u2019ve learnt that I couldn\u2019t do live radio or TV today for any money in the world!\u2019) Fearne began hosting her own podcast in 2018, titled Happy Place. In 2014, Fearne married her husband, Jesse Wood \u2013 the son of Rolling Stones guitarist Ronnie Wood. The pair share two children together; Rex Wayne Wood, born in 2013, and Honey Krissy Wood, born in 2015.

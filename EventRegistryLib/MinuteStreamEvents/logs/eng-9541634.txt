In 2014, the then state president Devendra Fadnavis had appointed Upadhye as the spokesperson in his team. Owing to his journalistic background and better understanding of the socio-economic issues of the state, Upadhye made a mark as a spokesperson in a short span. He articulates the views of the party and aggressively defends the party on various platforms including the Marathi and Hindi national news channels. Keshav Upadhye worked for the Akhil Bharatiya Vidyarthi Parishad (ABVP) and after completing his degree in Journalism from Ranade Institute, Pune, he began his career as a journalist with daily Pudhari, Loksatta and Mumbai Tarun Bharat. Knowing the pulse of the news, he writes on varied topics and on various platforms like the newspapers, blogs and other social media platforms. He was involved in two study groups formed by the Rambhau Mhalgi Prabodhini in 2006 to study the naxalite movement and its adverse impact on the development of Chhatisgarh. The Prabodhini later published this report. He was also a part of the Prabodhini's fact-finding committee formed to study the Solapur riots. LESS ... MORE\n\nThe fear mongering Congress leadership is desperate after having faced a 'washout' from the Centre for ten consecutive years and no signs whatsoever of coming back to power in the next five years at least. The leadership is also losing patience as they seem to have ascertained the intentions of the voters. And presumably as a result of their frustration, they have started disseminating false narrative that the Bharatiya Janata Party will amend the constitution once it regains power. This is nothing but their yet another attempt at winning over the electorates. I'm confident that the astute Indian voter won't accept such narratives promoted by these leaders, who themselves have at least 80 times amended the Constitution, denied reservation to the OBCs and insulted Dr. Babasaheb Ambedkar, the father of Indian Constitution, numerous times.\n\nCongress has always tried to defame and bring discredit to the BJP. From the outset, they have opposed reservation for Dalits and other backward classes. In 1961, the then Prime Minister Jawaharlal Nehru wrote to the then chief minister expressing his objection to reservation for Dalits and the backward classes. In fact, both, the Kaka Kalelkar Commission and the Mandal Commission had recommended reservation to the OBCs and a report suggesting reservation was also received by the then central government. But the Congress, that ruled the Centre for a very long period, declined to put the recommendations into practice. Later, in 1990, the VP Singh government that came to power with support of the BJP, put the Mandal Commission's recommendations into practice. And in this way, the OBCs were able to get 27 percent reservation. In fact, the Modi government was instrumental in granting constitutional status to the Backward Classes Commission.\n\nIn Karnataka, the Congress government classified Muslims as OBCs and granted reservation. Here, it is important to note that Dr. Babasaheb Ambedkar was against granting reservation based on religion. On what criterion did the Congress government categorize all Muslims as backward class in Karnataka is inapprehensible. The OBC community is entitled to reservations as per the provisions of the Constitution. But by including Muslims in OBC category, they violated the latter's constitutional rights. In fact, the Congress had implemented religious reservation in the earlier unified Andhra Pradesh as well wherein Muslims were granted reservation from the Dalits' and backward classes' reserve quota. Dr. Manmohan Singh's government also established a commission under the leadership of Justice Ranganath Mishra to look into Muslim reservation wherein the commission had recommended the then central government to reduce reservation for Dalits and backward classes and instead grant it to the Muslims. It must be noted that Dr. Babasaheb Ambedkar was against giving reservation based on religion and hence there was no such provision made in the constitution as well.\n\nRecently, Sam Pitroda, a known ally of the Gandhi family, said that Pandit Nehru was more influential in making of the constitution than Dr. Babasaheb Ambedkar. In fact, Dr. Ambedkar was also against inclusion of Article 370 and Article 35(A) in the Constitution. But Pandit Nehru went ahead and included these Kashmir-related provisions in the constitution despite the opposition. It was due to these clauses that the backward classes, tribal people and Dalits in Jammu &amp; Kashmir were deprived of due justice. It also caused the highly educated youth from the Dalit community to be restricted to employment with the Kashmir government as 'safai' workers. Regardless of their qualifications, the Dalit youths were denied jobs as officers, clerks, teachers or even academicians only because of Articles 370 and 35(A). Today, following Prime Minister Narendra Modi's repeal of Article 370, the Indian Constitution's reservations for Dalits, the Backward Classes and tribal people in Jammu &amp; Kashmir began to be granted. It must be noted that owing to Article 370, Dr. Ambedkar's constitution could not be implemented in J&amp;K. It is only today, that Dr. Ambedkar's constitution is being implemented in its true sense across the nation. Unfortunately, the Congress and its allied partners in the I.N.D.I Alliance are assuring to reinstate Article 370 in Kashmir. In that case, Kashmir's backward castes and Dalits will never be eligible for reservation.\n\nIt is interesting to note during its tenure, the Congress amended the Constitution roughly around 80 times. The Indira Gandhi government declared Emergency in 1975, defeating the fundamental goal of the Constitution. Congress never honored Dr. Babasaheb Ambedkar. In fact, the Congress had defeated Dr. Ambedkar in both the Constituent Assembly and Lok Sabha elections. The party with the longest reign at the Centre, the Congress, never presented Dr. Babasaheb Ambedkar with a Bharat Ratna. It was the BJP-backed Singh administration that bestowed Bharat Ratna to Dr. Ambedkar as a mark of national respect in 1990. Narendra Modi-led government identified five significant locations connected to Dr. Ambedkar's memories and transformed them into 'Panchtirtha'.\n\nNow, the Congress leadership is also opposing the CAA Act owing to pressure from the Marxist Communist Party. Congress has also assured to repeal CAA in its manifesto. With the help of this Act, the most persecuted communities - Hindus, Sikhs, Parsis, Buddhists and Jains - who fled Afghanistan, Bangladesh and Pakistan after suffering atrocities, will be able to get Indian citizenship. Those who sought refuge in India prior to 2014 will also be eligible to obtain Indian citizenship. Nearly 70-75% of these people who sought refuge are people from the Scheduled Castes. Even a large number of oppressed people from Bangladesh's 'Namoshudra' and 'Matua' communities fled to India. Today, if the CAA gets repealed, all these people from the Scheduled Castes will be severely impacted.\n\nA case in point is the establishment of Aligarh Muslim University in 1920 and Banaras Hindu University in 1916. While Aligarh Muslim University does not offer reservations for Dalits and other backward castes, Banaras Hindu University does, in accordance with the Constitution. In fact, it was the Indira Gandhi government that had abolished reservation for the Dalits and backward classes in Aligarh Muslim University by amending the Constitution in 1981. The Allahabad High Court had also invalidated the constitutional changes made by Indira Gandhi administration in its 2005 and 2006 judgements. But still, till date, Dalits and students from the backward classes are not able to get reservation in this university. This is the outcome of the appeasement politics of the Congress.\n\nIt is important to highlight that the Modi government carried out several welfare projects for the tribal people, Dalits and the backward classes during its ten-year tenure, something that no other government has ever done since independence. It's time the nation realizes that the main threat to the Constitution is Congress. And hence there is not an ounce of doubt in my mind that the electorates will not fall for Congress's disingenuous rhetoric.", "source": {"uri": "timesofindia.indiatimes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Times of India"}, "authors": [{"uri": "keshav_upadhye@timesofindia.indiatimes.com", "name": "Keshav Upadhye", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muslims", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Muslims"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reservation_in_India", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Reservation in India"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Akhil_Bharatiya_Vidyarthi_Parishad", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Akhil Bharatiya Vidyarthi Parishad"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constitution_of_India", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Constitution of India"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/B._R._Ambedkar", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "B.

In Karnataka, they formed government and overnight, without conducting a backward class survey, the Muslim community was included in the backward community and they were given a 5 per cent reservation. Congress reduced the 5 per cent reservation of backward communities and gave it to Muslims. When BJP will form government in Karnataka and Andhra Pradesh, we will end this reservation of Muslims,\" Shah said.\n\nIn Karnataka, for example, Muslims had a 4 per cent sub-quota within the 32 per cent OBC quota, which the Basavaraj Bommai government in 2023 redistributed among Vokkaligas and Lingayats.\n\nIn Andhra Pradesh, as per the 2011 census, Muslims constitute about 9.5 per cent of the population.\n\nIn Andhra, while Prime Minister Narendra Modi and other prominent BJP leaders have categorically stated that the BJP will not give reservation to Muslims based on religion, contradicting his stance, his ally, Chandrababu Naidu, from the Telugu Desam Party (TDP) has promised to preserve the 4 per cent reservation for the Muslims under the OBC category in the state.\n\nAmit Shah, however, continued his attack on the Opposition over a range of issues, including alleged corruption.\n\nAmit Shah also lashed out at the Rashtriya Janata Dal (RJD) led by former Bihar Chief Minister Lalu Yadav and the Congress for not attending the Pran Pratishtha ceremony at Ram Temple in Ayodhya held earlier this year.\n\n\"RJD's Lalu Prasad, Congress always opposed construction of Ram Temple in Ayodhya.

Jairam Ramesh emphasised that social justice cannot be realised without a comprehensive caste census, shedding light on the party's stance on constitutional values amidst current political dynamics. The party leader also talked about the upcoming Lok Sabha Elections, asserting the party will win a clear majority in the polls.\n\nQ:Why is the PM accusing that the by Congress introducing the OBC reservation, it will into the OBC quota?\n\nThe PM is spreading an epidemic of lies and is referring repeatedly to the Karnataka model of reservation. Over a 20-year period, there was a successive backward class commission that advocated reservations for minorities, including Muslims, Christians, Buddhists, Jains on the basis of social and economic backwardness, not on religion. So finally in 1996 when Veerampally was the CM, reservations were introduced for Musllims, Christians, Buddhists, Jains Scheduled Castes converts to Christianity. A survey was carried out and based on that, 4% reservation for Muslims was carried out. Since 1994, there have been 4 BJP Chief Ministers in Karnataka. There have been 2 Prime Ministers. 16 years BJP has ruled in the state. Suddenly, the Prime Minister discovers this as an issue. I want to ask the PM, Mr Devegowda became the Chief Minister in 1994. He continued with this. Was he communal? As we are speaking today, on the morning of 5th May,\n\nQ: In 2002, you were in power in 14-states, you had a hegemony in the northeast. You were strong in today what is Andhra Pradesh and Telangana, Himachal, Uttarakhand and Delhi, Rajasthan, Gujarat.\n\nI don't disagree with you. We have lost a large number of states. Today we have Himachal Pradesh, Karnataka and Telangana. We don't have a single government in northeast. I don't disagree that the cycle of political history has shifted against us. I said it after phase 1, I said it after phase 2, 'Dakshin bharat mein BJP saaf, uttar bharat aur madhya bharat mein BJP half'.

The Kaka Kalelkar Commission was the first to prepare a report recommending the reservation for the backward caste people but Congress never implemented that. Then, the Mandal Commission came but it was also put on the back-burner by the Congress. When the Mandal Commission was approved, Rahul Gandhi's father Rajiv Gandhi opposed it the most,\" Home Minister Shah said addressing a rally in Bihar's Ujiarpur on Monday.\n\n\"Many years passed and no one did anything for the backward and extremely backward classes in the country. After the formation of the Narendra Modi government, the Backward-Extremely Backward Commission was constituted,\" he added.\n\n\"The Narendra Modi government had given 27 per cent reservation in AIIMS for doctors of backward and extremely backward communities. Congress robbed the reservation of the backward class. When the Congress government was formed in Karnataka, they gave 5 per cent OBC reservation to the entire Muslim community overnight. 4 per cent reservation was also given to Andhra Pradesh,\" the Home Minister said, adding that the BJP \"end it immediately if comes to power in the two states\".\n\nHome Minister Shah said that Lalu Prasad Yadav, who roams around \"pretending to be a well-wisher of the backward community\", should respond to these issues.\n\nThe Home Minister hailed the government's move to confer socialist icon Karpoori Thakur with the Bharat Ratna. \"He (Karpoori Thakur) did a lot of work for the poor. On his demand, the Atal Bihari Vajpayee government had included the Maithili language in the Eighth Schedule,\" Home Minister Shah said.\n\nThe Home Minister also targeted the INDIA bloc over the recovery of \"unaccounted cash\" from the residences of leaders of its constituent parties. \"Today, Rs 30 crore was found in the house of a Jharkhand minister. Jharkhand Mukti Morcha (ruling party) is a partner of the INDI Alliance. Two months ago, Rs 350 crore was found from a Congress MP. Before that, Rs 51 crore was found from the house of Mamata Banerjee's minister. These people have taken away the money of the poor and Narendra Modi will bring it back,\" he said.\n\nHome Minister Shah also appreciated the works of MoS Home and BJP's Ujiarpur candidate Nityanand Rai. \"I have come here to Ujiarpur which is 1500 km away from Delhi, only for Nityanand Rai. He is my dearest friend and a minister in Narendra Modi's cabinet. He has always worked very well. During the pandemic period, when I was sick, Nityanand Rai was sitting in the control room from 6 p.m. to 6 a.m. Prime Minister Narendra Modi had brought vaccine and oxygen concentrator and Nityanand

Gallen, who finished third in the NL CY Young voting a year ago, could make his next start Tuesday, although that is unclear.\n\nIt has seemed like one bad-news day after another for manager Torey Lovullo, Baseball America's 2023 manager of the year.\n\n\"It's a very uneasy feeling when you are worried about the health of your players,\" he said. \"I can't help but think with the way they have been walking off the field, that something bad is going to happen. That's a helpless feeling. I'm going to protect the athletes and I want the athletes to be healthy. That's kind of the space I'm living in.\n\n\"I don't want to force (Gallen) into a situation when I feel like we could take steps backward. I want one of the best pitchers in the National League to be as healthy as possible for as long as possible.\"\n\nRodriguez, who signed a four-year $80 million contact that is to pay him $14 million this season, was diagnosed with a lat strain in the final week of spring training after being hit hard in four Cactus League starts. He opened the season on the 15-day injured list but felt shoulder tightness during his throwing program and was transferred to the 60-day injured list in mid-April.\n\nKelly was added to the 60-day injured list after making only four starts -- true of form, going 2-0 with a 2.19 ERA -- before being diagnosed with a teres major strain in his right shoulder. Kelly pitched five innings the Chicago Cubs on April 15 but felt soreness while playing catch before his next scheduled start April 21.\n\nKelly's absence, especially, is meaningful. He was 25-16 over 63 starts the last two seasons, and he was particularly effective when the Diamondbacks made World Series, going 3-1 with a 2.25 ERA in four postseason starts.\n\nHe won the first game of a three-game sweep against the Los Angeles Dodgers in the NLDS, won the series-tying Game 6 against Philadelphia in the NLCS and beat Texas in Game 2 of the World Series, the only game the Diamondbacks won.\n\nMontgomery, one of the Boras Four late spring training signees, has made three starts after progressing through a throwing program to get ready for the regular season. He was signed on March 29, the day after the regular season opened, and made his first start April 19.\n\nThe Diamondbacks also have played the first five weeks without closer Paul Sewald, whose acquisition from Seattle at the 2023 trade deadline solidified what had been an iffy bullpen. He had 13 saves the final two months of the regular season and had six saves and a win in eight postseason appearances.\n\nSewald also opened the season on the injured list after suffering an oblique strain at the end of spring training. While his rehab assignment was paused last week when he felt soreness during an outing at Triple-A Reno, he is expected to join the the team on a road trip that begins in Cincinnati on Tuesday.\n\nArm injuries are the unpredictable downside risk of the occupation, and it seems only the most fortunate can evade them.\n\nThe Diamondbacks made it a point to slow-play both Gallen and Kelly in spring training after their heavy workloads in 2023, when both logged a career high in innings pitched.\n\nGallen was 17-9 with a 3.47 ERA in 201 innings in the regular season and finished with 243 2/3 innings. Kelly had 201 2/3 despite missing four regular-season starts while on the injured list with blood clots in his left leg.\n\nGallen had 39 quality starts in the 2022-23 seasons, sixth in the majors. Kelly had 36, tied for 10th.\n\nThe Diamondbacks have filled the rotation from among a corps of young, high draft picks.\n\nBrandon Pfaadt, who showed well in the 2023 postseason, has made seven starts, one more than Gallen and Tommy Henry. Pfaadt is 1-2 with a 4.61 ERA. Henry was recently optioned to Reno after going 1-2 with a 5.40 ERA, and Slade Cecconi is 1-2 with a 4.96 ERA. Henry was a second-round pick in 2019 and Cecconi was a first-rounder in 2020.\n\nRyne Nelson, who opened the season as the No. 5 starter with Rodriguez out, was to take Gallen's start Sunday. Nelson also has missed time. He was struck in the right elbow by a line drive in an April 18 start at San Francisco and is to be activated from the injured list for this start.\n\n\"We find energy in the watching the young players go out there and do what they can do,\" Lovullo said. \"That's very inspiring to us. We ride with them, and that keeps pushing us forward.\n\n\"How do you deal with that? Slowly, Process it minute by minute. I hurt for the athletes. You just have fight the right fight and know that it is going to be OK.\"", "source": {"uri": "forbes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Forbes"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

Their bullpen has been without its most important piece, the defense without two up-the-middle standouts, the rotation far from full strength.\n\nIn many cases, health has been a reasonable excuse for their 15-20 start. But the injuries do not explain it all.\n\nWith the Diamondbacks starting to look more like their anticipated selves from a health perspective -- closer Paul Sewald and center fielder Alek Thomas are expected off the injured list on Tuesday, following Sunday's starter, Ryne Nelson -- it is a good time to look at the other things that are going to need to start falling into place if the Diamondbacks hope to start playing the sort of baseball they did last October.\n\nCorbin Carroll needs to get going\n\nOutfielder Corbin Carroll's slow start was masked in the first few weeks of the season by the hot-hitting Ketel Marte and Lourdes Gurriel Jr. As Marte has begun to plateau and Gurriel has cratered, Carroll's lack of production has become more glaring.\n\nA year ago, he was the straw that stirred the drink for the Diamondbacks' offense. He did it all last year, hitting for power and stealing bases, sparking rallies and capping them. He hasn't been the same this year, and while his comments in previous weeks had seemed more focused on pitch selection, he appears to have turned his attention to swing mechanics, at least based on his comments from Saturday.\n\n\"There have been some mechanical things that I've been trying to address and I feel like are headed in the right direction and our coaches feel like are headed in the right direction,\" Carroll said. \"I made my swing too flat. It's been a lot of work to try and create better attack angles and a better vertical bat angle.\"\n\nHe took some good swings against the San Diego Padres over the weekend, including on Sunday, when he collected a pair of singles -- one on a 109.2 mph line drive -- and drove a ball to the warning track in his final at-bat. Perhaps it was a sign of things to come.\n\nIt's going to take more than Carroll\n\nBut Carroll's struggles do not fully explain the offense's inconsistency. Their 11-run outburst on Sunday marked the fifth time this season they have scored double-digit runs. Incredibly, they have scored 40 percent of their season total of runs in those five games.\n\nCertainly, the Diamondbacks have faced some good pitching this year, including Logan Webb (Giants), George Kirby (Mariners), Logan Gilbert (Mariners) and Dylan Cease (Padres), among others.\n\nBut the Diamondbacks of last postseason found ways to beat good starters by scratching across runs here and there. They're going to need to find ways to do that again. There are plenty more good starters on the schedule the rest of the way.\n\nThat means they will need more consistent performances from Gurriel and more from Eugenio Suarez and Gabriel Moreno.\n\nAnd it's not just the offense\n\nThe Diamondbacks' bullpen ranks in the bottom third in things like ERA, save percentage and inherited runners scored. Assuming he pitches like he did last year, Sewald should provide a significant lift, bumping others, like Ryan Thompson and Kevin Ginkel, into the roles they were in last year when the unit thrived.\n\nBut the Diamondbacks cannot go to the same three pitchers every night, and they are going to need more consistent contributions from everyone else.\n\nThe defense has made some costly mistakes -- shortstop Blaze Alexander, in particular, has made critical errors -- and the baserunning has not been as sharp as it has been in previous years.\n\nKeep those returns coming\n\nSewald, Thomas and Nelson -- plus, to a lesser degree, Gallen, who did not go on the injured list but will pitch on Tuesday after missing a start with a hamstring issue -- are welcome additions back to the fold.\n\nThe next significant returnee likely will be Geraldo Perdomo, whose consistent defense at shortstop and on-base ability at the bottom of the lineup have been sorely missed. He could be a couple weeks away from a return.\n\nTheir next wave of returns seems a bit further down the horizon. Left-hander Eduardo Rodriguez could be back in June and Merrill Kelly in July.\n\nIt is worth remembering, too, that players don't always roll off the injured list and suddenly look like their normal selves. That can take time.\n\nWhich is another reason to stress that good health isn't everything for this team. It needs to play better in a number of ways. Perhaps that will start on Tuesday night in Cincinnati.\n\nDiamondbacks RHP Zac Gallen (3-2, 3.38) vs. Reds RHP Frankie Montas (2-2, 4.19).\n\nAt Great American Ball Park: Gallen exited his start on April 26 with tightness in his right hamstring, and though he was initially not expected to miss a start, the Diamondbacks opted to give him additional time to rest after the rotation was jumbled by the bee-delay game last week. ... Gallen was not as sharp in his previous two outings as he had been in his first four, giving up eight runs in 10 innings. ... He has faced the Reds three times in his career, logging a 3.93 ERA. He hasn't seen them since giving up two runs in seven innings in a start at Chase Field on June 15, 2022. ... Like Gallen, Montas is coming off a somewhat minor injury. He last pitched on April 21 when he was struck on the right forearm by a comebacker from Angels LF Taylor Ward. ... Montas missed nearly all of last year with shoulder issues, making just one appearance late in the season for the Yankees. ... He averages 93-94 mph with his fastball. His best pitch is a splitter that generates whiffs at a 38.7 percent rate.\n\nComing up\n\nWednesday: At Cincinnati, 3:40 p.m., Diamondbacks LHP Jordan Montgomery (1-2, 5.63) vs. Reds RHP Graham Ashcraft (3-1, 3.63).\n\nThursday: At Cincinnati, 10:10 a.m., Diamondbacks RHP Slade Cecconi (1-2, 4.96) vs. Reds RHP Hunter Greene (1-2, 3.12).\n\nFriday: At Baltimore, 4:05 p.m., Diamondbacks RHP Brandon Pfaadt (1-2, 4.61) vs. Orioles LHP Cole Irvin (3-1, 2.86).\n\nWhat to know about the Cincinnati Reds\n\nThe Reds are off to a mediocre start, going just 16-18 so far, though they were looking a lot better before dropping eight of their past 10 games, including five in a row. Most recently, they were swept in three games by the Baltimore Orioles, whom the Diamondbacks will face after seeing the Reds for three games in Cincinnati. The Reds rank in the middle of the pack in the National League with 4.47 runs per game. Similarly, their pitching staff has a 4.00 ERA that ranks eighth out of the league's 15 teams. SS Elly De La Cruz is off to a fantastic start, hitting .271/.377/.551 with eight homers and an incredible (and MLB-best) 19 steals in 22 attempts. LF Spencer Steer (.246/.350/.426) also has been a solid contributor so far, though he is just 7 for 51 (.137) in his past 14 games. The Reds' rotation, led by RHP Hunter Greene (3.12 ERA) and LHP Nick Lodolo (2.79 ERA), has been solid, ranking fifth in the majors with a 3.75 ERA. The bullpen, however, has had its struggles, posting a 4.40 ERA. Closer RHP Alexis Diaz has a 6.57 ERA, though he has converted six of seven save chances.", "source": {"uri": "azcentral.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "AZ Central"}, "authors": [{"uri":

However, MLB analyst Bob Nightengale has now reported that Gallen's much-awaited start, since the last outing on April 26 against the Seattle Mariners, has been tentatively pushed back to Tuesday.\n\nThis implies that Gallen will play no part in the three-game series at home against the Padres, and he might only pitch in the next series, which will be away against the Cincinnati Reds on May 7th, 2024.\n\nGallen exited the losing game against the Mariners on April 26th in the 6th inning due to a hamstring issue, later reported as right hamstring tightness.\n\nAlthough he was scheduled to pitch in the current series against the Padres, his hamstring issue resurfaced, forcing manager Torey Lovullo and the Diamondbacks staff to pull him away from making a start.\n\nThe tentative date for his next start remains May 7th until further developments, when Arizona will travel to Cincinnati to play a three-game series at the Great American Ballpark in Ohio.\n\nZac Gallen has been fairly decent in all his starts so far this season for the Diamondbacks\n\nZac Gallen holds a record of 3-2 in six starts this season with the Arizona Diamondbacks. After going 3-0 in his first four starts, the pitcher registered back-to-back losses in his last two outings, against the San Francisco Giants on April 20 and the Mariners on April 26.\n\nDespite those losses, one cannot write off the talent possessed by the right-handed strike thrower, who has consistently been in contention for the NL Cy Young Award. His current ERA is 3.38 with a WHIP of 1.22, and he has struck out 35 batters in 32 innings pitched so far this season.\n\nZac Gallen's strikeout-to-walk ratio is highly impressive at 3.9 this season, having walked a total of nine batters while striking out 35 in his six starts of the 2024 campaign. With a win percentage of .600, he continues to dominate at the mound for the D-backs.\n\nHe was a third-round pick by the St. Louis Cardinals in 2016 before being traded to the Marlins in 2017. He made his big league debut with Miami in 2019 before being traded to the Arizona Diamondbacks later that same year.", "source": {"uri": "sportskeeda.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Sportskeeda"}, "authors": [{"uri": "karan_tyagi@sportskeeda.com", "name": "Karan Tyagi", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zac_Gallen", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Zac Gallen"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hamstring", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Hamstring"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arizona_Diamondbacks", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Arizona Diamondbacks"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/San_Diego_Padres", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "San Diego Padres"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seattle_Mariners", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Seattle Mariners"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ace_(baseball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Ace (baseball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chase_Field", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Chase Field"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Major_League_Baseball", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Major League Baseball"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inning", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Inning"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Torey_Lovullo", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Torey Lovullo"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_American_Ball_Park", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Great American Ball Park"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cincinnati_Reds", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Cincinnati Reds"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manager_(baseball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Manager (baseball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arizona", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Arizona"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Arizona"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cincinnati", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Cincinnati"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Cincinnati"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/San_Francisco_Giants", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "San Francisco Giants"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/St._Louis_Cardinals", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "St. Louis Cardinals"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Walks_plus_hits_per_inning_pitched", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Walks plus hits per inning pitched"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miami_Marlins", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Miami Marlins"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strikeout-to-walk_ratio", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Strikeout-to-walk ratio"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Innings_pitched", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Innings pitched"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strikeout", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Strikeout"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cy_Young_Award", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Cy Young Award"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earned_run_average", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Earned run average"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pitcher", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Pitcher"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miami", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Miami"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Miami"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Browser_Based", "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Browser Based", "wgt": 9}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Play_Groups", "label": "dmoz/Games/Play Groups", "wgt": 9}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Play_Groups/North_America", "label": "dmoz/Games/Play Groups/North America", "wgt": 9}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Golf/Pitch_and_Putt", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Golf/Pitch and Putt", "wgt": 9}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Play_Groups/Europe", "label": "dmoz/Games/Play Groups/Europe", "wgt": 9}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 99}], "image": "https://staticg.sportskeeda.com/editor/2024/05/23090837-1714786946.jpeg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9544173", "eventUri": "eng-9544173", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-04-26", "textStart": 251, "textEnd": 259, "freq": 3}, {"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-05-07", "textStart": 948, "textEnd": 955}, {"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-04-20", "textStart": 1421, "textEnd": 1429}], "sentiment": -0.07450980392156858, "wgt": 187, "relevance": 1}

A tough little stretch for our team,\" Cincinnati manager David Bell said. \"It's going to turn around. Not a whole lot more to say.\"\n\nBell indicated Sunday that one significant player could be on the verge of returning. Starting center fielder TJ Friedl has played four minor league games with Triple-A Louisville as he attempts to return from a fractured right wrist sustained in spring training.\n\nFriedl went 2-for-4 with a double, a walk and two runs in Louisville's 7-6 win at St. Paul on Sunday.\n\n\"There is a chance, but I think it really just kind of depends,\" Bell said. \"I think it matters a lot with TJ. So we'll talk to him, see where he is. Of course, he wants to play. He wants to be here as quick as he can, and we're gonna make him want to do it in a healthy way when he's ready.\"\n\nAnother Cincinnati player is certain to return from injury as right-hander Frankie Montas (2-2, 4.19 ERA) will be activated off the 15-day injured list and start for the Reds in the series opener Tuesday.\n\nMontas was drilled on the right forearm by a 101-mph line drive off the bat of the Los Angeles Angels' Taylor Ward on April 21 just 16 pitches into the game. He missed two starts but didn't require a minor league rehab stint.\n\nPrior to his injury on April 21, he lasted just two innings in Seattle on April 15, allowing five runs on just three hits, walking five and surrendering two home runs. He took the loss in Cincinnati's 9-3 defeat to the Mariners.\n\nLifetime, Montas is 1-1 with a 11.74 ERA in two previous starts against Arizona, allowing 10 runs on nine hits over 7 2/3 innings.\n\nThe Diamondbacks counter with right-hander Zac Gallen (3-2, 3.38), making his seventh start of the season.\n\nGallen has dropped his last two starts after a 3-0 start to the season. In his last start on April 26, Gallen was charged with three hits and three runs in Arizona's 6-1 loss to Seattle.\n\nGallen will be making his fourth career start against the Reds, and his first in Cincinnati since 2021. The righty is 0-1 with a 3.93 ERA in three previous career starts, allowing eight runs on 11 hits over 18 1/3 innings.\n\nComing off a run to the 2023 World Series, Arizona has started 15-20 and has been having its own offensive problems to open 2024.\n\nThe Diamondbacks broke out for double-digit runs Sunday in an 11-4 home win over San Diego. Arizona had scored only 16 runs in its previous nine games.\n\n\"I just think it's about having good at bats,\" D-backs outfielder Jake McCarthy said. \"Obviously, we all want to slug, we all want to have a ton of hits. But a walk here or there, just moving a guy over early in the inning (is important). So, again, it sounds really simple, but I think when one through nine does that, it gives us a better chance.\"", "source": {"uri": "deadspin.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Deadspin"}, "authors":

first two games.", "source": {"uri": "arizonasports.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Arizona Sports"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inning", "type": "wiki",

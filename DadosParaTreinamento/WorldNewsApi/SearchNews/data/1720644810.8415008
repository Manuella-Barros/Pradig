He pleaded guilty to possessing an imitation firearm with intent to cause fear of violence at Wolverhampton Court on March 20. Demming-Dacosta had only been released from prison on licence in December 2023. He was sentenced on Monday, June 3. He was jailed for five years for the gun offence alongside the remaining four years on his licence, with both running concurrently. The weapon was never found and officers were unable to establish what type of gun it was. West Midlands Police said its licensing team moved swiftly to act against the club for breaching terms of its operating conditions, including failures in its security. The venue, which the force did not name, was no longer trading as a nightclub. Det Con Martin Boyle, from the Major Crime Unit Proactive Team, said: \"Tyrese Demming-Dacosta went out that night in February carrying a firearm, which he clearly had no qualms about brandishing. \"Given that Demming-Dacosta was so readily prepared to use the weapon, together with the fact that he had just come out of prison and was in blatant breach of his licence conditions, is testament to his arrogance and callous disregard for others. We\u2019re pleased to see him back behind bars where he fully deserves to be.\"", "summary": "Tyrese Demming-Dacosta, 24, aimed the gun at a crowd in Dudley after an argument spilled out onto the street from a nightclub on King Street", "url": "https://www.birminghammail.co.uk/black-country/five-years-arrogant-gunman-who-29318285", "image": "https://i2-prod.birminghammail.co.uk/incoming/article29318379.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_Gunman-Dudley.png", "video": null, "publish_date": "2024-06-08 14:30:48", "author": "Jamie Brassington", "authors": ["Jamie Brassington"], "language": "en", "catgory": "politics", "source_country": "gb", "sentiment": -0.563}

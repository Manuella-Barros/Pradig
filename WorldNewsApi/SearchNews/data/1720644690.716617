A White Sox spokesperson described the bottles as plastic and \u201ctravel-sized.\u201d The team said it was investigating, but there were no injuries. The delay occurred before Paul DeJong batted with runners on first and second with one out in the bottom of the fourth. DeJong said during the White Sox TV broadcast that they were \u201cflying full bottles of liquor.\u201d He said a kid in the front row was hit in the head and had to leave. Chicago snapped a 14-game losing streak with a 7-2 victory over Boston. Speaking after the win, White Sox first baseman Andrew Vaughn said he heard a kid was hit. \u201cI don\u2019t know when that happened,\u201d Vaughn said. \u201cI was on-deck, (Gavin Sheets) was up and heard a loud thud and looked down and there was a little shot glass or something right in front of me.\u201d White Sox manager Pedro Grifol praised the response by ballpark security. \u201cI really don\u2019t know where they came from,\u201d Grifol said. \u201cOne landed close to me and closer to some fans there. The most important thing is we notified security and they took care of it. We didn\u2019t have anymore issues.\u201d", "summary": "<p>Chicago snapped a 14-game losing streak with a 7-2 victory over Boston.</p>\n<p>The post <a href=\"https://www.boston.com/sports/boston-red-sox/2024/06/08/red-sox-white-sox-game-delayed-bottles-thrown-toward-field/\">Red Sox-White Sox game delayed by 3 bottles thrown toward the field</a> appeared first on <a href=\"https://www.boston.com\">Boston.com</a>.</p>", "url": "https://www.boston.com/sports/boston-red-sox/2024/06/08/red-sox-white-sox-game-delayed-bottles-thrown-toward-field/", "image": "https://bdc2020.o0bc.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Paul-DeJong-66646171bbeaf-768x432.jpg", "video": null, "publish_date": "2024-06-08 13:42:00", "author": "Associated Press", "authors": ["Associated Press"], "language": "en", "source_country": "us", "sentiment": -0.154}

The source added: \"They've known each other for a few years and see each other when they can.\" And a source told People magazine that they don't label their relationship with terms like \"boyfriend-girlfriend,\" saying: \"They see each other here and there.\"\n\nThe duo reportedly first crossed paths at the 55th Karlovy Vary International Film Festival in August 2021, and according to the Daily Mail, beautician Yulia has posted Instagram photos with Johnny, including one where she was asked to name her \"favourite actor\" during a Q&A, with her replying: \"JD. He is a man who is incredibly talented and inspiring.\"\n\nThe apparent relationship comes following reports earlier this year that Johnny - who has two children with his former partner Vanessa Paradis - is \"focused on moving forward\" following his legal battle with his ex-wife Amber Heard, 38.\n\nA source told People previously: \"He's focused on moving forward. He's keeping busy. There's a lot of good distractions, so there's not that much time to be reminiscing on that darker period.\" The source added that there's been a \"release of the old\" and \"embarking on this new chapter,\" saying that he feels \"better about where he is in life,\" before adding that there's \"no animosity toward anybody\".\n\nHe's reportedly currently living in London, with a source telling the outlet that he feels that the city is \"home\". They said it offers \"more of a quiet life,\" filled with painting and music. It was added that he's \"jamming out\" with friends and \"playing solo\" at times when not focused on filmmaking.\n\nJohnny has previously suggested that he's kept a distance from Hollywood after his high-profile court cases. Speaking at a press conference during the Cannes Film Festival, Johnny remarked: \"Do I feel a boycott now? No, not at all. I don't feel boycotted by Hollywood because I don't think about Hollywood.\" He added to Deadline that he doesn't have \"much further need\" for Hollywood.\n\nThe actor has been involved in two high-profile cases related to his past relationship with his now ex-wife Amber in recent years. Johnny first lost a libel case against News Group Newspapers in the UK in 2020 over an article in the Sun that had referred to him as a \"wife beater\".\n\nA separate court case took place in the US in 2022 after Johnny sued Amber for defamation over her Washington Post op-ed about domestic violence. Although she didn't name him in it, Johnny argued that the article from 2018 implied he had abused her and it was claimed that the piece had impacted his ability to work.\n\nThe jury found in favour of Johnny and awarded him $15 million in damages. It however was reduced to around $10 million due to a cap in Virginia, where the case was heard. The jury in the trial also found in favour of one of Amber's counterclaims, which related to remarks made about her, awarding her $2 million in damages. Amber had initially suggested that she would appeal the trial's verdict, though it was announced in December 2022 that the former couple had settled the case.\n\nFollow Mirror Celebs on TikTok, Snapchat, Instagram, Twitter, Facebook, YouTube and Threads.", "source": {"uri": "mirror.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "Mirror"}, "authors": [{"uri": "joel_leaver@mirror.co.uk", "name": "Joel Leaver", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Johnny_Depp", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Johnny Depp"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Karlovy_Vary_International_Film_Festival", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Karlovy Vary International Film Festival"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pirates_of_the_Caribbean_(film_series)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Pirates of the Caribbean (film series)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cinema_of_the_United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Cinema of the United States"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Entertainment_Tonight", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Entertainment Tonight"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daily_Mail", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Daily Mail"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amber_Heard", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Amber Heard"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vanessa_Paradis", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Vanessa Paradis"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jam_session", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Jam session"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boycott", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Boycott"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Instagram", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Instagram"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/London", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "London"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "London"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TikTok", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "TikTok"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deadline_Hollywood", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Deadline Hollywood"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Filmmaking", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Filmmaking"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cannes_Film_Festival", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Cannes Film Festival"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Op-ed", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Op-ed"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Defamation", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Defamation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Washington_Post", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "The Washington Post"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Snapchat", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Snapchat"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domestic_violence", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Domestic violence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Facebook", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Facebook"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/YouTube", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "YouTube"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twitter", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Twitter"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virginia", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Virginia"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Virginia"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Kingdom", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Death", "label": "dmoz/Society/Death", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Advice", "label": "dmoz/Society/Advice", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Relationships/Advice", "label": "dmoz/Society/Relationships/Advice", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article33254080.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_Screen-Shot-2024-07-15-at-61039-PMjpeg.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9737776", "eventUri": "eng-9737776", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.2784313725490195, "wgt": 221, "relevance": 1}

The 61-year-old Pirates of the Caribbean star has not publicly commented on the relationship, but multiple outlets reported earlier this week that the two have been casually seeing each other over the past \"few years.\"\n\nAccording to Daily Mail, the couple were spotted together last week. Johnny met the 28-year-old in 2021 at a film festival, and they've been seen spending time together since then. The outlet reported that their romance is \"casual\" and shared since-deleted Instagram photos of them getting close. PEOPLE further reported that Johnny and Yulia have not used the \"boyfriend-girlfriend\" labels.\n\nYulia is based in Prague and owns a beauty studio. According to Page Six, she shared a note via her Instagram Stories on Monday, July 15, imploring her followers to \"refrain from giving any interviews to journalists concerning [her] and [her] personal life.\"\n\nAmber, 38, and Johnny were married from 2015 to 2017. The following year, the Aquaman actress published an op-ed in The Washington Post. Although it didn't mention him by name, Johnny argued that the published piece destroyed his reputation in Hollywood and sued her. For her part, Amber countersued Johnny.\n\nThe highly publicized 2022 trial -- which was televised -- ended in Johnny's favor. Shortly thereafter, Amber was bombarded with threatening comments from social media users, and Johnny kept a low profile. The actress eventually moved to Spain with her daughter, Oonagh Paige.\n\nAmber sat down with TODAY after the verdict was reached.

The couple reportedly met in the Czech city in 2021, attending the Karlovy Vary International Film Festival.\n\nYet while the 28-year-old is primarily based in Prague, she regularly visits Johnny who lives in London.\n\nPer her Instagram, it's clear that the model loves to travel as just this year she's shared snaps from London, Antibes, Cannes, Ibiza, Milan, and Dubai.\n\nWhile Johnny has yet to earn a spot on her Instagram grid, the Daily Mail reported that she shared a photo on her Instagram Story in which the couple rested their hands on each other's legs.\n\nThe couple have featured in photographs on friends' social media, with Yulia standing next to Johnny after he performed in Prague in July 2022.\n\nJohnny's former relationships\n\nThe actor's love life has received much media attention over the years, from his short-lived marriage to Lori Anne Allison from 1983 to 1985, to relationships with Winona Ryder and Kate Moss.\n\nJohnny was in a relationship with singer Vanessa Paradis from 1998 to 2012, with whom he shares Lily-Rose Depp and Jack. Following the end of their relationship, he started dating Amber Heard, who he had met on the set of The Rum Diaries (2011).\n\nThe couple married in 2015, and over a year later in 2016 Amber filed for divorce, obtaining a temporary restraining order against the actor who she claimed was verbally and physically abusive throughout their relationship, allegations Johnny denied.\n\nTheir divorce was finalized in 2017, although the former couple went head-to-head when Johnny sued Amber for defamation over a 2018 op-ed for The Washington Post about sexual violence. She would counter-sue, alleging he coordinated a \"harassment campaign via Twitter\", \"orchestrating online petitions in an effort to get her fired from Aquaman and L'Oreal.\"\n\nThe verdict found that all three statements from Amber's op-ed were false, defamatory and made with malice, with the jury awarding Johnny $10 million in compensatory damages and $5 million in punitive damages. Amber was awarded $2 million in compensatory damages for her counter suit and zero in punitive damages from Depp.\n\nFollowing the trial, Depp was linked with his lawyer Joelle Rich.", "source":

Her bio links to her She Studio based out Prague in the Czech Republic, where Yulia lists herself as an \"International makeup artist\" with talents in \"makeup and hairstyling.\"\n\nThe page features plenty of videos and photos of Yulia's work, with models showing off their glam looks. For makeup, she favors brands such as Bobbi Brown, Dior and Chanel.\n\nIn one post, Yulia told followers that her \"top 5\" favorite makeup products are Bobbi Brown under eye corrector, Charlotte Tilbury beautiful skin foundation, Tom Ford lip color matte lipstick, Dior Diorshow mascara and Dior Backstage face palette.\n\nThe two met at the 55th Karlovy Vary International Film Festival in Prague in August 2021, The Daily Mail reported. The pair were spotted hanging out together again in the city in July 2022, when Johnny was in town performing with his late pal, guitarist Jeff Beck. Yulia even posted a selfie kissing the Pirates of the Caribbean star on the cheek following the concert.\n\nIn an Instagram Q&A with fans in early 2024, Yulia was asked who her \"favorite actor\" was.

He is a man who is incredibly talented and inspiring,\" while showing a photo of their hands on each other's legs.\n\nThe pair were most recently photographed looking cozy while flying out of a London heliport together on July 11, 2024.\n\nJohnny began dating his Rum Diary costar Amber Heard in 2012. The pair married in 2015, but split in May 2016 after she accused the Black Mass actor of domestic violence in court papers. Their divorce was finalized in January 2017.\n\nThe City of Lies star sued his ex-wife for $50 million in 2019, accusing her of defamation stemming from a 2018 Washington Post op-ed titled \"I spoke up against sexual violence -- and faced our culture's wrath.\" Johnny went on to accuse Amber of assault and she countersued him.\n\nThe trial began in April 2022 in Fairfax, Virgina, and fans were riveted watching the live court proceedings. A seven-person jury determined that Amber defamed Johnny in a verdict reached on June 1, 2022.\n\nJohnny was awarded $10 million in damages, while Amber won three counts of her defamation claims and was awarded $2 million in damages. The Aquaman star announced she settled her case against Johnny in December 2022.\n\n\"Six years ago, my life, the life of my children, the lives of those closest to me, and also, the lives of the people who for many, many years have supported and believed in me were forever changed. All in the blink of an eye,\" Johnny said after the verdict.\n\nHe continued, \"False, very serious and criminal allegations were levied at me via the media, which triggered an endless barrage of hateful content, although no charges were ever brought against me. It had already traveled around the world twice within a nanosecond and it had a seismic impact on my life and my career. And six years later, the jury gave me my life back.\"", "source": {"uri": "intouchweekly.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "In Touch Weekly"}, "authors": [{"uri": "beth_shilliday@intouchweekly.com",

Their relationship ended in a highly publicised divorce, with Amber accusing Johnny of domestic violence in court papers.\n\nThe pair's legal battles continued, with Johnny suing Amber for $50 million in 2019 over a Washington Post op-ed titled \"I spoke up against sexual violence -- and faced our culture's wrath.\"\n\nThe op-ed was published in 2018, and Johnny claimed it was defamatory. Amber countersued, accusing Johnny of assault.\n\nThe trial began in April 2022 in Fairfax, Virginia, and the live court proceedings captivated fans. On June 1, 2022, a seven-person jury ruled that Amber had defamed Johnny, awarding him $10 million in damages.", "source": {"uri": "thenews.com.pk", "dataType": "news", "title": "The News International"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Johnny_Depp", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Johnny Depp"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Instagram", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Instagram"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Romanticism", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Romanticism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Entrepreneurship", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Entrepreneurship"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amber_Heard", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Amber Heard"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prague", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Prague"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Prague"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Czech Republic"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Juris_Doctor", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Juris Doctor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/London", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "London"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "London"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Damages", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Damages"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sexual_violence", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Sexual violence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Divorce", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Divorce"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Op-ed", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Op-ed"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Defamation", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Defamation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Washington_Post", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "The Washington Post"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domestic_violence", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Domestic violence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fairfax,_Virginia", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Fairfax, Virginia"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Fairfax, Virginia"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Online_Writing/Journals", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Online Writing/Journals", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Death/In_Memoriam", "label": "dmoz/Society/Death/In Memoriam", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Relationships", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Relationships", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 92}], "image": "https://www.thenews.com.pk/assets/uploads/updates/2024-07-17/l_1210717_100001_updates.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9737776", "eventUri": "eng-9737776", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "date": "2016-07-", "textStart": 180, "textEnd": 187}, {"amb": false, "date": "2011-07-", "textStart": 737, "textEnd": 744}], "sentiment": 0.1686274509803922, "wgt": 184, "relevance": 1}

The 61-year-old actor has gone public with 28-year-old Yulia Vlasova, and his fans are very invested in the relationship. Vlaslova's comments are filled with opinions, but could the 33-year-age gap be the kind of relationship he needs right now?\n\nDepp and Heard had one of the biggest celebrity trials: John C. Depp, II v. Amber Laura Heard in 2022. Talking to Fox News Digital, Amy Laurent, professional matchmaker and author, shared her thoughts on Depp's new flame. \"Given the tumultuous breakup with Amber Heard and the huge fallout that came from a highly publicized court battle, he's not exactly winning any 'Bachelor of the Year' awards, or even 'Bachelor of the Decade' for that matter,\" she told the outlet.\n\nAccording to Laurent, the relationship, described as \"casual,\" could be what works for him \"at the moment.\" \"Perhaps being with someone younger who is not looking for something substantial or isn't as turned off by his track record may actually suit him well at the moment.\"\n\nVlasova is a Russian model and beautician and has her own makeup and hairstyling studio in Prague. According to the outlet, they met in August 2021 at the 55th Karlovy Vary International Film Festival and have been hanging out since then.\n\nThe couple was recently spotted at the London Heliport, and she later shared photos aboard a private jet. She sparked engagement rumors earlier this week when she shared a ring emoji on her Instagram Story, but a source later told PEOPLE they are \"absolutely not\" engaged.\n\nVlasova has shared photos on social media looking loved up, including him kissing her cheek. She also shared a photo holding his hand in response to a Q&A asking who her favorite actor is, replying, \"JD. He is a man who is incredibly talented and inspiring.\" As of now, they do not follow each other on social media.\n\nThis is seemingly the first relationship for Depp since his divorce from Heard. He was briefly linked to Joelle Rich, a lawyer who represented him in his UK libel lawsuit, but his love life has been under the radar since they stopped seeing each other in November 2022.\n\nThe Pirates of the Caribbean star has been married twice. His first marriage was to makeup artist Lori Anne Allison in 1983 when he was 20. It was short-lived, and they divorced in 1985.", "source": {"uri": "hola.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Hola.com"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Johnny_Depp", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Johnny Depp"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amber_Heard", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Amber Heard"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fox_News", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Fox News"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amber", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Amber"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Divorce", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Divorce"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/55th_Karlovy_Vary_International_Film_Festival", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "55th Karlovy Vary International Film Festival"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hanging", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Hanging"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prague", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Prague"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Prague"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Czech Republic"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russia", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Russia"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Russia"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/London_Heliport", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "London Heliport"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Make-up_artist", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Make-up artist"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pirates_of_the_Caribbean_(film_series)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Pirates of the Caribbean (film series)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jet_aircraft", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Jet aircraft"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Juris_Doctor", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Juris Doctor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emoji", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Emoji"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Defamation", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Defamation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lawyer", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Lawyer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radar", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Radar"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lawsuit", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Lawsuit"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Instagram", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Instagram"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_media", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Social media"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Kingdom", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Relationships", "label": "dmoz/Society/Relationships", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Home/Family/Parenting", "label": "dmoz/Home/Family/Parenting", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Death/In_Memoriam", "label": "dmoz/Society/Death/In Memoriam", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Relationships/Advice", "label": "dmoz/Society/Relationships/Advice", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 98}], "image": "https://www.hola.com/us/horizon/landscape/4a3a3756738d-lajatico-italy-johnny-depp-attends-the-andrea-bocelli-30-the-celebration-andrea-.jpg?im=Resize=(1200)", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9737776", "eventUri": "eng-9737776", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.2156862745098038, "wgt": 135, "relevance": 1}

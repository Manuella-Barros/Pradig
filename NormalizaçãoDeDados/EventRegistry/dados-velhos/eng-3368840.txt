the Britain-based group said.\n\nThe Syrian Democratic Forces also fought IS in the western district of Al-Dariya and the northwestern neighbourhood of Al-Barid, as well as on the outskirts of the central district of Al-Murur, it said.\n\nThe coalition has repeatedly stressed it takes every precaution to avoid civilian casualties.\n\nBut it has recognised 624 such deaths in its air strikes

capital.\n\nThe SDF launched an operation to capture Raqa province from IS last year, and in June the alliance broke into Raqa city for the first time.\n\nIt now holds more than half of the city, but

Dozens of residential buildings and public properties have been destroyed as well.\n\nThe US-led coalition has been conducting airstrikes against what are said to be Daesh targets inside Syria since September 2014 without any authorization from the Damascus government or a UN mandate.\n\nThe military alliance has repeatedly been accused of targeting and killing civilians. It has also been largely incapable of fulfilling its declared aim of destroying Daesh.\n\nThe city of Raqqah, which lies on the northern bank of the Euphrates River, was overrun by Daesh terrorists in March 2013, and was proclaimed the center for most of the Takfiris' administrative and control tasks the following year.\n\nIt is estimated that a population of 300,000 civilians is trapped inside Raqqah, including 80,000 displaced from other parts of Syria. Thousands have fled in recent months, and the United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs believes about 160,000 people remain in the city.\n\nOn June 6, the US-backed militiamen from the so-called Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF) said they had launched an operation aimed at pushing Daesh out of Raqqah.", "id": "9341160", "details": {}, "date": "2017-08-15", "title":

multinational coalition, a Kurdish-Arab alliance on Thursday battled the jihadists in Raqqa's Old City, of which it now controls 70 percent, the Britain-based group said.\n\nThe Syrian Democratic Forces also fought IS in the western district of Al-Dariya and the northwestern neighborhood of Al-Barid, as well as on the outskirts of the central district of Al-Murur, it said.\n\nThe coalition has repeatedly stressed it takes every precaution to avoid civilian casualties.\n\nBut it has recognized 624 such deaths in its air strikes since 2014, a figure which many rights groups say is vastly underestimated.\n\nAccording to the United Nations, 25,000 civilians are trapped inside Raqqa, the jihadist group's erstwhile de facto Syrian capital.\n\nThe SDF launched an operation to capture Raqqa province from IS last year, and in June the alliance broke into Raqqa city for the first time.\n\nIt now holds more than half of the city, but the fighting has proved fierce and civilians have been

reports emerged of more civilians killed by US-led coalition air strikes.\n\nRepresentational image.AFP\n\nThe Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said 21 children were among at least 59 civilians killed since Monday in the air strikes aimed at dislodging the jihadists from Raqqa.\n\n\"The worst place probably today in Syria is the part of Raqqa that is still held by the so-called Islamic state,\" the UN's humanitarian pointman for Syria, Jan Egeland, told reporters in Geneva.\n\nThe UN estimates there are up to 25,000 civilians trapped inside Raqqa, the jihadist group's erstwhile de facto Syrian capital.\n\n\"They are encircled by the SDF (Syrian Democratic Forces) fighters and they are used seemingly as human shields by the Islamic State,\" Egeland added, noting the \"constant air raids\" by the US-led coalition.\n\n\"We are therefore urging the coalition, the SDF whom we can deal with to allow as much as they can people to escape\", the UN official added.\n\nThe SDF, a Kurdish-Arab alliance backed by the multinational coalition, was on Thursday battling the jihadists in Raqqa's Old City, of which it now controls 70 per cent, according to the Britain-based Observatory.\n\nThe SDF also fought the Islamic State in the western district of Al-Dariya and the northwestern neighbourhood of Al-Barid, as well as on the outskirts of the central district of Al-Murur, it said.\n\nThe coalition has repeatedly stressed it takes every precaution to avoid civilian casualties.\n\nBut it has recognised 624 such deaths in its air strikes since 2014, a figure which many rights groups say is vastly underestimated.\n\nThe SDF launched an operation to capture Raqqa province from Islamic State last year, and in June the alliance broke into Raqqa city for the first time.\n\nIt now holds more than half of the city, but the fighting has proved fierce and civilians have been killed both in the crossfire and while trying to flee.\n\nHumanitarian workers believe \"the situation couldn't be worse for these women, children (and) civilians who are now in this crossfire,\" Egeland told reporters.\n\nPublished Date: Aug 17, 2017 07:17 pm | Updated Date:

Our forces are trying to surround more and more IS,\" said Nuri Mahmud, a spokesman for the Kurdish YPG militia that dominates the SDF.\n\nHe said IS extremists were \"using every means at their disposal to survive\".\n\nNear the ancient wall surrounding the Old City, the AFP correspondent saw SDF fighters help five wounded comrades to safety after they were hit by shrapnel from a landmine explosion.\n\nIS fighters have heavily mined the city to slow the SDF advance, and are also using booby-trapped cars, drones and suicide bombers.\n\nU.S regards the Syrian Kurdish Democratic Union Party PYD and its powerful military wing YPG, which is part and backbone of SDF alliance, as key ally against Islamic State and the most effective fighting force against IS in Syria and has provided them with arms, air support as well as the military advisers.\n\nThe YPG, which has 60,000 fighters, has seized swathes of Syria from IS.\n\nNevertheless the US-backed alliance has seized nine districts in the city's west and east since first entering Raqqa on June 6 after a months-long campaign.\n\nThe fight for Raqqa has prompted tens of thousands of civilians to flee, with many wounded by crossfire or IS-planted explosive devices during their escape.\n\nThe United Nations has estimated that between 20,000 and 50,000 people remain in the city, though others have given lower estimates.", "id": "9128582", "details": {}, "date": "2017-08-14", "title": "Syrian Kurdish-led forces continue battle to retake Raqqa from IS", "image":

Despite several ceasefires and the intervention of international coalitions, the conflict deepened and fostered the emergence of anti-Assad rebel groups.\n\nThe warring sides involved in the conflict are numerous. The US coalition backs some of the militia groups that want to overthrow Assad, including SDF and Free Syrian Army.\n\nOn the other side, Russia, Iran and Hezbollah back Assad forces.\n\nIsis fights both pro and anti-Assad forces and aims to establish an Islamic caliphate throughout the occupied territories.\n\nThe conflict has resulted in the death of hundreds of thousands of people and the displacement of millions.", "id": "9710956", "details": {}, "date": "2017-08-17", "title": "US-led coalition raids against Isis kill 60 civilians in Raqqa", "image":

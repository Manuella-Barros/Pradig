{"id": 223670010, "title": "Forensic archaeologists help cops with probe into body of man missing for 20 years", "text": "Forensic archaeologists are helping police with their investigation into what happened to a man who was missing for 20 years before his remains were found in woodland. The body of Russell Scozzi was discovered in woods in Mumbles 12 months ago, more than two decades after he disappeared without a trace. Detectives have turned to experts in disciplines including forensic archaeology, anthropology, and pathology in an attempt to explain what happened to the 43-year-old, in Swansea. A key archaeological report is expected to land on officers' desks within weeks which police hope will help to establish the cause of Mr Scozzi's death. Forensic archaeology is a field of forensic science which uses archaeological methods to investigate a crime scene or other location in order to identify possible evidence, reports Wales Online. As part of their investigation detectives are also continuing to try to identify and trace people associated with Mr Scozzi at the time he disappeared in an effort to piece together his final movements. The last confirmed sighting of computer expert Mr Scozzi was at Swansea's Quadrant bus station in May 2002. The previous year he had given up his well-paid IT job with a multi-national company without explanation. Mr Scozzi, from the West Cross area of Swansea, had travelled extensively to the likes of Bali and Australia over the years and spoke both German and French fluently but when he disappeared he left left his passport and wallet behind, and his family said it was was unusual for him not to keep in regular touch with them. What concerned them most was that he made no attempts to contact his children, something that was completely out of character. Mr Scozzi's remains were found in woodland off residential Waverley Drive in Mumbles in April last year prompting a major investigation to establish the circumstances of his death. Forensic investigators spent a number of weeks at the location, and a year on their working is continuing. Police say they remain in regular contact with Mr Scozzi's family, and are keeping them updated on the progress of what they acknowledge is a \"prolonged\" investigation. A spokesman for South Wales Police said: \"The investigation into Russell Scozzi\u2019s death is ongoing. Russell\u2019s family are being kept updated, and are aware of the protracted nature of this investigation.\" Don't miss the latest news from around Scotland and beyond.

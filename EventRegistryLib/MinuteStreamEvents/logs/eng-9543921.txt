Here are three things we learned from Manchester United's 4-0 loss vs. Crystal Palace.\n\nAmidst United's injury crisis, Casemiro has in recent games been forced to play at the heart of the backline and he was deployed once more on that part of the pitch against Palace.\n\nTo say the Brazilian was exposed would be an understatement. His fingerprints were all over the Eagles' first two goals.\n\nFor the first goal, Casemiro abandoned his position and drifted into the middle of the park. He recklessly dived into a tackle in an effort to take the ball away from Michael Olise, but the Frenchman easily evaded him to completely take him out of the game. Olise then ran towards Onana's goal and expertly found the bottom corner.\n\nFor Jean-Philippe Mateta's goal, Casemiro was once again dragged into midfield and left Evans all alone and isolated at the back. Mateta produced a fine piece of skill to beat Evans before firing a powerful shot that beat Onana.\n\nCasemiro was also at fault for Palace's fourth and Olise's double in the second half. His casual handling of the ball near the corner flag saw him easily dispossessed before the ball was fed to Olise. The Palace forward made no mistake as he curled the ball into the back of the United net, past the reach of a helpless Onana.\n\nDespite having less possession, Palace deserved their victory as they were significantly the better team. They created the most chances and posed the greatest danger.\n\nBeyond his defensive lapses that cost the Red Devils, Casemiro's passing - as has been mostly the case this term - was erratic and he often failed to find a teammate.\n\nThe Palace attackers found plenty of joy down Casemiro's side as he was either out of position or just not proactive enough to snuff out danger.\n\nThe 32-year-old is also susceptible to being beaten during races as he's lost one or two yards of pace with age. It's clear that playing Casemiro at centre-back has little benefit, if any. United would be best served by restoring him to a more familiar role in central defensive midfield.\n\nAhead of the game against Arsenal this weekend, Ten Hag will be hoping that a few players currently recovering from physical setbacks make their returns to action so that he's not forced to have Casemiro in the backline.\n\nOlise and Eze are reportedly targets for Sir Jim Ratcliffe and INEOS ahead of the summer transfer window - they showed why they're so highly rated against United tonight.\n\nBeyond his goals for the South London outfit, Olise was a constant thorn in the backside of the United defence. His class shone throughout the match. He displayed moments of brilliance in the way he cleverly danced around with the ball at his feet.\n\nOlise kept the ball well even under pressure and never seemed fazed. The 22-year-old could have had more goals to his name. A cut-back in the first half from Mitchell found him on his favoured left foot but luckily for United, Onana was alive to it and came up with a good save.\n\nThe Palace winger linked up well with Eze, a formidable partnership Ten Hag's men struggled to deal with.\n\nEze, who United have also been linked with, was fantastic in midfield and showed United exactly what they're missing. He found it very easy to get about the pitch due to his amazing dribbling and quick feet.\n\nAfter the break, the England international had two big chances to find the back of the net. One was saved by Onana while the other went just wide.\n\nThe duo's talent is undeniable and based on their respective displays at Selhurst Park, they're certainly ready to make the jump to a club like United. The 20-time English champions could do with players of their skill set and abilities. In addition to this, they're Premier League-proven and young. They still have plenty of room for improvement. United should do everything in their power to ensure they're playing at Old Trafford next season.\n\nSince Ratcliffe and INEOS walked through the door, it has been repeatedly mentioned that they'll delay their final decision on the manager until the end of the season. The new owners have been undertaking a thorough audit of the club to identify areas of improvement.\n\nWith this in mind, it's becoming increasingly clear with each passing game that United need to part ways with Ten Hag. In yet another game, United were poor and were humiliated by perceived lesser opponents.\n\nPalace were first to everything and it's mostly down to Oliver Glasner, who arrived just a few weeks ago as a replacement for Roy Hodgson. In such a short space of time, Palace look like a new side with a clear style of play - something Ten Hag has been unable to implement since he took charge in 2022.\n\nUnited continue to be poor and it doesn't get any easier. Up next is Arsenal and then Newcastle before facing Brighton on the final day of the season. There is then the small matter of an FA Cup final against Manchester City. With such a run of fixtures and on current form, it's very difficult to see where United will get their next win from.\n\nTen Hag has of course not been aided by constantly-occurring injuries to his key players and an incompetent structure above him but he has also not helped his own cause. There's nothing to suggest that United would be the subject of a change of fortunes if he's given more time and money to spend. Even worse are the excuses he gives in press conferences and interviews.\n\nINEOS would be making a big statement by letting him go immediately rather than prolonging the inevitable. With other European giants also on the hunt for managers, United risk missing out on their desired targets by continuing to keep Ten Hag. At the very least, fans should be given clarity and assured that he won't be in charge next season.", "source": {"uri": "thepeoplesperson.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Peoples Person | MUFC

obliterate meek Man United", "body": "Crystal Palace complete their first-ever league double over Manchester United with a 4-0 obliteration of the Red Devils at Selhurst Park.\n\nCrystal Palace completed their first-ever Premier League double over Manchester United in astonishing style as they decimated the woeful Red Devils 4-0 at Selhurst Park.\n\nFollowing up their 1-0 triumph at Old Trafford earlier in the campaign, the Eagles were in the ascendancy right from the get-go and were two goals up at the break courtesy of Michael Olise and Jean-Philippe Mateta.\n\nNormal service resumed in the second period, where Olise notched his second of the night after Tyrick Mitchell had also got in on the act, moving the 15th-placed hosts onto 43 points as they end a troubled campaign with a flourish.\n\nOliver Glasner's men may still be seven places below Erik ten Hag's troops, but they outclassed their meek opponents in every department to leave the Red Devils below Chelsea in the final European spot on goal difference, and it is now 81 goals shipped for the permeable visitors, surpassing the 80 they let in during the 1977-78 term.\n\nOnce again sporting an incredibly youthful bench and makeshift defence, Man United were also ruing the rare absence of captain Bruno Fernandes, whose omission saw Mason Mount make a rare Premier League start.\n\nMateta matches Shearer feet against appalling Red Devils\n\nThe ageing backline of Jonny Evans and Casemiro immediately came under siege by the Olise and Eze-inspired hosts, and Ten Hag's centre-backs were among the Red Devils men who failed to cover themselves in glory for a somewhat comical Palace opener in the 12th minute.\n\n\u00a9 Reuters\n\nLatching onto a throw-in between the lines with no real pressure, Olise shrugged off Eriksen and beat an onrushing Casemiro all ends up before charging at Evans, who just backed off and backed off against the advancing Frenchman.\n\nWith not a single Man United player prepared to put a tackle in, the Frenchman had ample time and space to pick out the bottom corner from the edge of the box, thereby registering his eighth strike of the Premier League season.\n\nThe Red Devils' response was feeble for the most part, but the ball was in the back of the Palace net in the 27th minute, when Dean Henderson would seemingly catch Casemiro's looping header, but the Eagles shot-stopper was nudged in the back by Rasmus Hojlund and the goal was chalked off.\n\nThere were shades of the David Raya vs. Bournemouth incident as Man United were controversially denied a leveller, and the visitors quickly returned to their meek ways, allowing Palace to punish them again in the 40th minute.\n\nA calamity of errors on the right saw Palace regain possession through Chris Richards, whose through ball to Jean-Philippe Mateta ended with the Frenchman gliding past Jonny Evans as if he was not there and firing a fierce drive past Andre Onana.\n\nCasemiro horror show continues in second half\n\nMateta emulated Alan Shearer with his strike, becoming the first man since the ex-Newcastle United forward in 1996-97 to score in each of his first six Premier League home games under a new manager, whose opposite number Ten Hag held off on making any half-time changes.\n\nIt was deja vu for Man United in the second period, as Casemiro had another goal ruled out for offside in the 53rd minute, and the Red Devils subsequently came under the cosh once more.\n\nOnana managed to forestall Tyrick Mitchell and Will Hughes within the space of a few seconds, but the Cameroonian was powerless to deny the former his hard-earned goal in the 58th minute, as he tapped in from unmissable range after Joachim Andersen prodded Wharton's delivery into his path.\n\nThe visitors' embarrassment went up a notch in the 68th minute, when the lackadaisical Casemiro was robbed of the ball on the byline by Daniel Munoz, who sprayed the ball to Olise just inside the box, and the winger's venomous drive flew past Onana's futile reach.\n\nOne could even argue that the 4-0 scoreline flattered Man United, who were all over the shop defensively and were fresh out of ideas in the final third too, not that they enjoyed many forays into the Palace half anyway.\n\nSubstitute Odsonne Edouard nearly made it a five-star performance from the hosts in added time, clipping the post with an effort that left Onana stranded to the spot, but Glasner's men ultimately declared at four.\n\nThe Eagles' final road fixture of the campaign takes them to Wolverhampton Wanderers on Saturday, while Man United return to face the discontent Old Trafford faithful on Sunday, hosting none other than leaders Arsenal.\n\nID:543043:1false2false3false:QQ:: from db desktop :LenBod:collect7659:No

"body": "ERIC CANTONA'S name was belted out by Manchester United fans, nearly 30 years on from his infamous kung-fu kick on a Palace fan.\n\nBut it was another enigmatic Frenchman who dealt a devastating blow to the European hopes of Cantona's old side - and floundering Erik ten Hag's job prospects.\n\nMichael Olise has a habit of ice-cool, hard-to-read celebrations, just like collar-up King Eric did all those years ago.\n\nThe mercurial 22-year-old was motionless and emotionless after netting a fabulous, point-saving free-kick deep into stoppage time in this fixture last season.\n\nThis term, after a sublime early opener, there was a little more to his routine as he opted to point one finger to his lips, another to his right ear and closed his eyes.\n\nIt depicted a zen-like calm and control - in contrast to the Keystone Cops he was facing.\n\nNo wonder United have Olise, who has seven Under-21 caps for France but could still play for England, high up on their summer shopping list.\n\nThough when you watch him play with such grace like he did here, and how grim United were, you wonder why he would even consider trading places.\n\nOlise's wonder goal sparked another predictably difficult night for Ten Hag, who saw his weak side go further down before the break through in-form Jean-Philippe Mateta.\n\nTen Hag will have winced as Jonny Evans, who had given Olise the freedom of Selhurst for the opener, was left for dead by Mateta for the second.\n\nCASINO SPECIAL - BEST CASINO WELCOME OFFERS\n\nThe bad night in Croydon, which worsened when Tyrick Mitchell and Olise again doubled the lead after the break, saw United well and truly cock up the chance to go sixth.\n\nAnd given they face Arsenal, Newcastle and Brighton in their final three games, the smart money is on them missing out on Europe altogether before the cup final with City.\n\nFor many observers, Ten Hag looks like a dead man walking already, with this the latest in an embarrassment of embarrassments.\n\nFormer England midfielder Danny Murphy, doing punditry last night on talkSPORT, said he would be \"gobsmacked\" if the Dutchman was still in charge next season.\n\nWhen asked why, he replied that all United's rivals \"would be laughing at them\" should he remain in place, given the lack of progress on the former Ajax boss' watch.\n\nFor balance, Ten Hag has had to deal with a crippling injury list this season.\n\nOne that is so bad that it even got to captain Bruno Fernandes, who last night, incredibly, missed his first ever game through injury in his entire career due to an ankle problem.\n\nIt meant Mason Mount, himself sidelined for most of his maiden season at United, was given his first start since October 7.\n\nWhile Harry Maguire's latest setback saw captain Casemiro and Evans form somewhat of a dad's army partnership in the middle of defence.\n\nA new centre-back will surely be a high transfer priority this summer, with Palace defender Marc Guehi in their sights.\n\nOlise is also on their radar - it would be a dereliction of duty if he was not - and it was he who broke the deadlock here in style.\n\nReceiving Daniel Munoz's throw-in not far from the halfway line, his twinkle toes put Casemiro on his backside before racing towards goal.\n\nEvans backed off, fearing a run by Mateta, while Kobbie Mainoo could not keep pace, and Olise took aim from the edge of the box and found the corner.\n\nIt was scintillating stuff which will have impressed the watching Gareth Southgate, who must be still hoping he can convince London-born winger of switching to the Three Lions.\n\nOlise would have had a second ten minutes later when Munoz cut it back to him, but his goalbound shot hit his own man in Mateta.\n\nUnited did have the ball in the Palace net midway through the first half thanks to Casemiro's looping header.\n\nBut ref Jarred Gillett ruled it out after Rasmus Hojlund had bumped keeper Dean Henderson.\n\nGillet was wearing a 'ref cam' for a TV programme designed to showcase the demands of a Premier League match official.\n\nWe will have to wait for the show to come out to confirm if the device on his left ear picked up Palace fans branding the Aussie a \"s*** referee\" towards the end of the first half.\n\nTheir attention quickly shifted though as Mateta left Evans looking like a statue before belting the ball in at the near post for his ninth goal since Oliver Glasner took over in mid February.\n\nIt was game over from that point and just a question of how many for the rampant hosts.\n\nEberechi Eze, Mitchell and Will Hughes all went close before Palace's left wing-back turned home a cut-back from Joachim Andersen.\n\nTen Hag's night hit a new low when Casemiro was robbed of possession in the corner by Munoz, who gave it back to Olise, who promptly smashed it into the top corner.\n\nFor this one, the starlet did allow himself a smile and a high five with his manager.\n\nEagles chief Glasner looks like a man with a plan and fans are loving him for it.\n\nHis opposite number, in contrast, was left looking clueless once again and as if Olise, nay, even peak

Rasmus Hojlund met the dropping ball to head home while making contact with Dean Henderson, which was deemed pressure enough to give a foul to the Eagles in a clear case of goalkeepers being treated as a protected species.\n\nStill, United had plenty of the ball and did very little with it until they were punished again by weak defending. Eberechi Eze won the ball in midfield for Chris Richards to send Mateta through, and he sat Evans down with a delightful twist before firing a rocket past Onana.\n\nThere was little sign of any serious elevation in the quality of United's approach after the break even though Casemiro had a goal ruled out for a far-less controversial infringement, having been clearly offside when hitting the post and scoring the rebound.\n\nPalace began to up the ante via efforts from Eze and Will Hughes, with their surge in pressure telling in what were proving typical circumstances for the away team. Adam Wharton's fine cross was turned towards Mitchell for a simple finish from close range under little pressure.\n\nAnother error from Casemiro, this time losing possession by his own corner flag to Daniel Munoz, led to Olise slamming an effort through Onana's weak palms on 66 minutes.\n\nOdsonne Edouard came within the width of the post from a fifth in stoppage time and the final whistle confirmed United's 13th league defeat of the year, something they had never previously managed in the Premier League, and they now enter the final fortnight of the season outside the European qualification places.", "source": {"uri": "ca.sports.yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo Sports Canada"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Olise", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Michael Olise"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jean-Philippe_Mateta", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Jean-Philippe Mateta"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amadou_Onana", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Amadou Onana"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tyrick_Mitchell", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Tyrick Mitchell"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Casemiro", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Casemiro"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jonny_Evans", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Jonny Evans"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harry_Maguire", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Harry Maguire"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christian_Eriksen", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Christian Eriksen"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Belgium_national_football_team", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Belgium national football team"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Selhurst_Park", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Selhurst Park"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crystal_Palace_F.C.", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Crystal Palace F.C."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Midfielder", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Midfielder"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manchester_United_F.C.", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Manchester United F.C."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eberechi_Eze", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Eberechi Eze"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goalkeeper_(association_football)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Goalkeeper (association football)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dean_Henderson", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Dean Henderson"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chris_Richards_(soccer)", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Chris Richards (soccer)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Will_Hughes", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Will Hughes"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Offside_(association_football)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Offside (association football)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Premier_League", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Premier League"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Association_football", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Association football"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Odsonne_\u00c9douard", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Odsonne \u00c9douard"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Amateur", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Amateur", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Soccer", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Soccer", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Softball/Slowpitch", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Softball/Slowpitch", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Cue_Sports/Pool", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Cue Sports/Pool", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://media.zenfs.com/en/evening_standard_239/8ea37dac3a500422f9d8d6dd5546e6ae", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9543921", "eventUri": "eng-9543921", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.2705882352941177, "wgt": 145, "relevance": 1}

Jonny Evans and Mason Mount replaced them in the starting XI.\n\nAnd the threadbare side were no match for a rampant home team as their European hopes took another hit. Michael Olise and Jean-Philippe Mateta put Palace 2-0 up at half-time, before goals from Tyrick Mitchell and a thunderbolt from Olise added further misery on manager Erik ten Hag.\n\nIt was another terrible performance which sees United remain in eighth place in the Premier League, and in danger of missing out on European qualification. Here's how the players rated from a disastrous night in London.\n\nAndre Onana\n\nBeaten with precision by Michael Olise and power by Jean-Philippe Mateta. Let in a saveable shot from Olise in the second half. 2\n\nAaron Wan-Bissaka\n\nSwitched flanks, presumably to counter Olise, but was nowhere near him when he made it 1-0. Applauded on his return to Palace and could go back in the summer. 2\n\nJonny Evans\n\nErik ten Hag admitted United had not planned to play him and it showed. Skinned by Mateta for the second goal and utterly overwhelmed. His nadir this season. 2\n\nCasemiro\n\nSo rash and impetuous in charging out of defence to engage Olise, only to be turned with alarming ease. Hounded for the fourth goal. Drew the only real save from Dean Henderson. 2\n\nDiogo Dalot\n\nNot the first time he has struggled against a Palace winger and he never got a measure of Ebrechi Eze. Did not make his presence felt at either end. 2\n\nKobbie Mainoo\n\nClearly lacking confidence and suffering from a sound and stable partner next to him. Played a hospital pass by Christian Eriksen's selection. 2\n\nChristian Eriksen\n\nStarted by default again. The alternative was Sofyan Amrabat but Eriksen should not have been out there and he was off the pace for both first half goals. 1\n\nAntony\n\nWorse than at Selhurst Park last season. Should be leading the attack but never looked capable of it. His recent goals have been false dawns. 2\n\nMason Mount\n\nHis first Premier League start in seven months and it showed.

Jonny Evans and Mason Mount replaced them in the starting XI.\n\nAnd the threadbare side were no match for a rampant home team as their European hopes took another hit. Michael Olise and Jean-Philippe Mateta put Palace 2-0 up at half-time, before goals from Tyrick Mitchell and a thunderbolt from Olise added further misery on manager Erik ten Hag.\n\nIt was another terrible performance which sees United remain in eighth place in the Premier League, and in danger of missing out on European qualification. Here's how the players rated from a disastrous night in London.\n\nAndre Onana\n\nBeaten with precision by Michael Olise and power by Jean-Philippe Mateta. Let in a saveable shot from Olise in the second half. 2\n\nAaron Wan-Bissaka\n\nSwitched flanks, presumably to counter Olise, but was nowhere near him when he made it 1-0. Applauded on his return to Palace and could go back in the summer. 2\n\nJonny Evans\n\nErik ten Hag admitted United had not planned to play him and it showed. Skinned by Mateta for the second goal and utterly overwhelmed. His nadir this season. 2\n\nCasemiro\n\nSo rash and impetuous in charging out of defence to engage Olise, only to be turned with alarming ease. Hounded for the fourth goal. Drew the only real save from Dean Henderson. 2\n\nDiogo Dalot\n\nNot the first time he has struggled against a Palace winger and he never got a measure of Ebrechi Eze. Did not make his presence felt at either end. 2\n\nKobbie Mainoo\n\nClearly lacking confidence and suffering from a sound and stable partner next to him. Played a hospital pass by Christian Eriksen's selection. 2\n\nChristian Eriksen\n\nStarted by default again. The alternative was Sofyan Amrabat but Eriksen should not have been out there and he was off the pace for both first half goals. 1\n\nAntony\n\nWorse than at Selhurst Park last season. Should be leading the attack but never looked capable of it. His recent goals have been false dawns. 2\n\nMason Mount\n\nHis first Premier League start in seven months and it showed. Not short of endeavour but ineffective and his decline continues. 2\n\nAlejandro Garnacho\n\nDrew the odd foul but failed to have a profound impact and seemed flummoxed by Palace's 3-4-2-1 formation. 2\n\nRasmus Hojlund\n\nPenalised for a soft foul on Dean Henderson but never came close to dominating Palace's back three.

Olise shined with a brilliant performance, scoring two goals, showcasing a level of play United desperately need. United's dismal performance was highlighted by weak defending and lackluster attacking, missing their injured captain Fernandes.\n\nCrystal Palace made Premier League history by beating a depleted Manchester United at Selhurst Park on Monday night. The Eagles put four past the visitors to add further pressure onto Erik ten Hag.\n\nThe Red Devils went into the game with five academy products on the bench, including three who had yet to make an appearance for the first team. They were also without captain Bruno Fernandes, who missed his first ever professional club game through injury. They came up against a Palace side who were on the up under new manager Oliver Glasner, having been unbeaten in their previous four.\n\nIt was the in-form side who took the initiative thanks to some brilliant footwork and abysmal defending. Frenchman Michael Olise picked up the ball just inside his own half and beat both Eriksen and a reckless Casemiro with ease before slotting past Andre Onana under no pressure inside the penalty area.\n\nOlise should've made it two, but his close range effort was blocked by teammate Jean-Philippe Mateta. The striker made up for it by finding his ninth goal in 11 games under his new manager with a thumping strike after gliding past Jonny Evans with ease.\n\nTyrick Mitchell was able to tap home a third before Olise grabbed his second after Casemiro embarrassingly lost the ball in his own corner for the hosts to ensure Palace completed their first ever Premier League double over the 20-time Champions of England.\n\nA couple of disallowed goals were all the visitors had to offer in what was one of their worst performances of the season. No doubt their much changed line-up will be used as an excuse, but showcases like this will only support Erik ten Hag's doubters.\n\nKey Match Statistics\n\nCrystal Palace\n\nStats\n\nManchester United\n\n41\n\nPossession\n\n59\n\n9\n\nShots on target\n\n2\n\n6\n\nShots off target\n\n5\n\n6\n\nCorners\n\n2\n\n12\n\nFouls\n\n7\n\n1\n\nYellow cards\n\n1\n\nCrystal Palace Player Ratings GK - Dean Henderson - 7/10\n\nThe foul on lead to deny United an equaliser was soft but goalkeepers are always going to be given the benefit of the doubt. Aside from that, the former United keeper had nothing to do.\n\nCB - Nathaniel Clyne - 7/10\n\nA solid defensive display from the former Southampton man. Given he is not naturally a centre-back, he looked good in an unfamiliar role.\n\nCB - Joachim Andersen - 7/10\n\nThe Dane got an assist to his name but was a little clumsy at times compared to the rest of his defenders. Had a foul on Hojlund happened in the box, VAR may have opted to send him off.\n\nCB - Chris Richards - 7/10\n\nWith Marc Guehi returning from injury, it was important for Richards to put in a strong display. He did exactly that and was rewarded by being given the full 90 minutes.\n\nRWB - Daniel Munoz - 8/10\n\nThe combination of Munoz and Olise on the right-hand side tore United's opposite flank apart. A near perfect wing-back showing.\n\nCM - Will Hughes - 8/10\n\nThe cries of Hughes' name rung out Selhurst Park throughout as he made crunching tackle after crunching tackle. The Englishman dominated the midfield against a fragile United side who seemed too frightened to get stuck in.\n\nCM - Adam Wharton - 7/10\n\nWharton was the composed figure next to the brute Hughes. A very complimentary partnership that dominated the game in the middle of the park. At just 20, it will be interesting to see how the youngster continues to develop.\n\nLWB - Tyrick Mitchell - 8/10\n\nMitchell was less impressive overall than Munoz, but he got himself a well-earned goal and caused havoc down the left.\n\nRW - Michael Olise - 9/10\n\nIt's performances like this that show exactly why INEOS are desperate to bring this man to Old Trafford. He had Aaron Wan Bissaka on strings from minute one and scored two wonderful (if poorly defended) goals to cap a wonderful performance.\n\nST - Jean-Philippe Mateta - 8/10\n\nThe Frenchman continued his hot streak with a powerful finish which encapsulated his entire display. He bullied a shell-shocked United defence.\n\nLW - Eberechi Eze - 8/10\n\nAnother solid performance from Eze. He may have been second fiddle to Olise tonight, but had plenty of moments to remind people how good he is.\n\nManchester United Player Ratings GK - Andre Onana - 4/10\n\nOnana can hardly be blamed for the goals against him, but did little to progress the play from deep. He seems to be regressing after a decent turn of the year. Much like the rest of the team.\n\nRB - Diogo Dalot - 3/10\n\nDalot has often been a player whose work ethic can't be questioned, but even he looked like he didn't want to be on the pitch tonight.\n\nCB - Casemiro - 1/10\n\nIf there was ever a game to show Erik ten Hag must cut ties with Casemiro, it was this one. Yes, he was out of position, but the immaturity to dive in high up the pitch on multiple occasions was not the decision-making of a multi-time Champions League winner. That's without talking about his role in the fourth goal. An appalling display.\n\nCB - Jonny Evans - 3/10\n\nEvans was the better of the two central defenders, but that's not saying much. He was caught far too square for Palace's second and you can tell he was rusty after some time on the sidelines.\n\nLB - Aaron Wan-Bissaka - 3/10\n\nThe former Crystal Palace man acted as if he wished he was anywhere other than his old stomping grounds. Olise had him on toast throughout, but the full-back wasn't helped by a lack of support in dealing with the overlapping Munoz.\n\nCM - Kobbie Mainoo - 3/10\n\nMainoo was uncharacteristically sloppy on the ball and was overwhelmed defensively with a lack of support from his midfield partners.\n\nCM - Christian Eriksen - 2/10\n\nPlayed some nice switches of play, but it was a poor display overall on both ends of the pitch. Another individual who has lost their legs for the job asked them.\n\nRW - Antony - 2/10\n\nIt feels harsh to rank United's attacking players, they weren't allowed to do anything of note because what was going on behind them was dismal. Out of everyone, the Brazilian was least effective.\n\nCAM - Mason Mount - 3/10\n\nMason Mount was brought in from the start, but didn't take his opportunity. If anything, his performance highlighted how much United missed their captain.\n\nLW - Alejandro Garnacho - 4/10\n\nGarnacho was lively and showed no signs of surrendering. If only his teammates had his same spirit.\n\nST - Rasmus Hojlund - 4/10\n\nHojlund looked like United's biggest threat with moments of good link-up play. But he barely mustered an effort on goal. If you don't get service to your striker, he won't score.\n\nMan of the Match - Michael Olise\n\nUnited are absolutely desperate for a player like Olise on the right-hand side. The former Reading man showed exactly what his game was all about against a sorry opposition. Some brilliant pieces of footwork, great work rate on and off the ball and a well deserved double.\n\nWhen you look at Erik ten Hag's wingers this season, with the exception of Garnacho perhaps, there is no one who has come close to putting in this level of performance all season. If Marcus Rashford is watching this game from the sidelines, he needs to take inspiration from what the 22-year-old produced tonight.", "source": {"uri": "givemesport.com", "dataType": "news",

The winger tormented a dishevelled, disorganised United, scoring twice, with Jean-Philippe Mateta and Tyrick Mitchell also on target for the home side.\n\nIt was a painful watch for the United manager whose side have now won just one of their last six games and are in serious danger of missing out on European football. The nature of this loss will have caused alarm to Sir Jim Ratcliffe, the co-owner, as he plots a course for next season. Alarmingly from United's point of view, the scoreline could have been even more one-sided.\n\nIn Ten Hag's defence, he had once again been forced to reshape his team after injuries ruled out Harry Maguire and Bruno Fernandes. The absence of Maguire meant Jonny Evans was the only senior centre-back still standing. Short on options, Ten Hag opted to pair Casemiro with the Northern Ireland international, his 14th different centre-back combination in the Premier League this season. It came as little surprise then, that the cracks soon began to show.\n\nThe visitors's weaknesses were brutally exposed when Olise fired Palace into a 12th minute lead. The Palace winger collected a throw-in 40 yards from goal, easily side-stepped Casemiro who had been drawn into his more familiar midfield possession and simply ran unchallenged into the space vacated by the Brazilian before placing a left foot shot across Andre Onana.\n\nThe goal exposed United's defensive weaknesses and certainly wasn't the last time Casemiro was guilty of losing his bearings. At times Evans could be seen screaming and pointing at his partner while trying to cover two positions at once.\n\nIt could have got worse for Ten Hag's side when Daniel Munoz, the Palace right-back, played the ball inside to Olise who saw his goal-bound shot blocked by teammate Mateta midway through the first half. Moments later a poor back pass from Kobbie Mainoo almost let Olise in again with Onana just able to recover the situation by diving bravely at the Palace winger's feet.\n\nUnited were creaking every time they were put under pressure and it came as no surprise that Palace were able to double their lead before half-time. It also came as no surprise that Casemiro was at fault in the build up to the goal.\n\nOnce again the Brazil international got drawn out of position, this time finding himself moonlighting at right-back near the halfway line when he conceded possession. That allowed the Mateta a direct run at Evans and the in-form forward easily side-stepped the United centre-back before racing into the box and beating Onana with a powerful left foot shot. The look of despair on Ten Hag's face as he sat back down in the dug out told its own story.\n\nThe Dutchman's mood wasn't helped by the decision to disallow Casemiro's header that would have brought United level midway through the first half after a rare United attack. A Christian Eriksen free-kick was deflected over the bar and from the corner, Casemiro looped a far post header into the goal, only for referee Jarred Gillett to rule that Rasmus Hojlund fouled Palace keeper Dean Henderson.\n\nTen Hag sent his players back out early at the start of the second half but it made little difference. Antony did finally manage to produce United's first effort on target but there was little doubt the momentum was still with Palace who were visibly growing in confidence.\n\nEberechi Eze tested Onana with a first time shot and then fired narrowly wide after being set up by a neat flick from Olise. Onana was then forced to save from Mitchell and Will Hughes in quick succession, adding to the sense a third goal was imminent.\n\nIt came in the 58th minute after a short-corner was only half cleared, allowing Adam Wharton to deliver the ball into the far post where United right-back Diogo Dalot, under pressure from Joachim Andersen, could only play the back across goal where Mitchell finished from close range. Ten Hag complained Dalot was fouled but the main problem lay with his side's inability to deal effectively with the ball into the box.\n\nUnited were falling apart and worse was to come when Casemiro once again had a moment to forget in the 66th minute when he was robbed by Munoz close to the byline. The full-back pulled the back towards Olise who produced the moment of the match when he arrowed in a left foot shot that flew past Onana.\n\nCrystal Palace (3-4-3): Henderson 6; Clyne 7 (Gu\u00e9hi

The winger tormented a dishevelled, disorganised United, scoring twice, with Jean-Philippe Mateta and Tyrick Mitchell also on target for the home side.\n\nIt was a painful watch for the United manager whose side have now won just one of their last six games and are in serious danger of missing out on European football. The nature of this loss will have caused alarm to Sir Jim Ratcliffe, the co-owner, as he plots a course for next season. Alarmingly from United's point of view, the scoreline could have been even more one-sided.\n\nIn Ten Hag's defence, he had once again been forced to reshape his team after injuries ruled out Harry Maguire and Bruno Fernandes. The absence of Maguire meant Jonny Evans was the only senior centre-back still standing. Short on options, Ten Hag opted to pair Casemiro with the Northern Ireland international, his 14th different centre-back combination in the Premier League this season. It came as little surprise then, that the cracks soon began to show.\n\nThe visitors's weaknesses were brutally exposed when Olise fired Palace into a 12th minute lead. The Palace winger collected a throw-in 40 yards from goal, easily side-stepped Casemiro who had been drawn into his more familiar midfield possession and simply ran unchallenged into the space vacated by the Brazilian before placing a left foot shot across Andre Onana.\n\nThe goal exposed United's defensive weaknesses and certainly wasn't the last time Casemiro was guilty of losing his bearings. At times Evans could be seen screaming and pointing at his partner while trying to cover two positions at once.\n\nIt could have got worse for Ten Hag's side when Daniel Munoz, the Palace right-back, played the ball inside to Olise who saw his goal-bound shot blocked by teammate Mateta midway through the first half. Moments later a poor back pass from Kobbie Mainoo almost let Olise in again with Onana just able to recover the situation by diving bravely at the Palace winger's feet.\n\nUnited were creaking every time they were put under pressure and it came as no surprise that Palace were able to double their lead before half-time. It also came as no surprise that Casemiro was at fault in the build up to the goal.\n\nOnce again the Brazil international got drawn out of position, this time finding himself moonlighting at right-back near the halfway line when he conceded possession. That allowed the Mateta a direct run at Evans and the in-form forward easily side-stepped the United centre-back before racing into the box and beating Onana with a powerful left foot shot. The look of despair on Ten Hag's face as he sat back down in the dug out told its own story.\n\nThe Dutchman's mood wasn't helped by the decision to disallow Casemiro's header that would have brought United level midway through the first half after a rare United attack. A Christian Eriksen free-kick was deflected over the bar and from the corner, Casemiro looped a far post header into the goal, only for referee Jarred Gillett to rule that Rasmus Hojlund fouled Palace keeper Dean Henderson.\n\nTen Hag sent his players back out early at the start of the second half but it made little difference. Antony did finally manage to produce United's first effort on target but there was little doubt the momentum was still with Palace who were visibly growing in confidence.\n\nEberechi Eze tested Onana with a first time shot and then fired narrowly wide after being set up by a neat flick from Olise. Onana was then forced to save from Mitchell and Will Hughes in quick succession, adding to the sense a third goal was imminent.\n\nIt came in the 58th minute after a short-corner was only half cleared, allowing Adam Wharton to deliver the ball into the far post where United right-back Diogo Dalot, under pressure from Joachim Andersen, could only play the back across goal where Mitchell finished from close range. Ten Hag complained Dalot was fouled but the main problem lay with his side's inability to deal effectively with the ball into the box.\n\nUnited were falling apart and worse was to come when Casemiro once again had a moment to forget in the 66th minute when he was robbed by Munoz close to the byline. The full-back pulled the back towards Olise who produced the moment of the match when he arrowed in a left foot shot that flew past Onana.\n\nCrystal Palace (3-4-3): Henderson 6; Clyne 7 (Gu\u00e9hi

with a 4-0 drubbing in south London.\n\nOlise has been linked with a summer switch to Old Trafford and run amok at Selhurst Park with a dazzling display, scoring twice to move on to nine goals in 12 league starts this season.\n\nTwo sparkling efforts by Olise in the 12th and 66th minutes bookended this latest superb result for Oliver Glasner's side, with Jean-Philippe Mateta and Tyrick Mitchell also on target to make it four wins in five for Palace.\n\nIt was another sorry display for Ten Hag, though, with Jonny Evans and Casemiro given a torrid night.\n\nInjury-hit United have won only two of their last 10 league matches and could be set for a lowest ever Premier League finish.\n\nUnited had dropped to eighth after wins for Newcastle and Chelsea at the weekend, while the club's injury list increased with Harry Maguire and Bruno Fernandes not available for this clash.\n\nEvans was fit enough to start, but he endured a nervy opening and had to block an early Olise shot after his own poor clearance before Palace wanted a penalty when Evans challenged Mitchell in the area.\n\nHowever, Ten Hag's side did not heed the warning of how dangerous Olise can be as he broke the deadlock in the 12th minute.\n\nOlise skipped away from Christian Eriksen and left Casemiro sprawled on the floor by the centre circle before he drilled a shot into the bottom corner, having been given the freedom of Selhurst Park by United's backpedalling defence\n\nIt was a wonderful effort from Olise, but one to forgot for the visitors and a sign of things to come.\n\nTwo more Olise efforts were repelled, one accidentally by his team-mate Mateta before Andre Onana saved after another fine Palace move.\n\nIt looked the correct decision, although Ten Hag appeared bemused when in discussion with fourth official Graham Scott on the touchline.\n\nFive minutes before half-time and United's bank holiday trip to the capital went from bad to worse.\n\nEberechi Eze and Chris Richards combined and the latter passed into Mateta, who sped away from Evans far too easily and unleashed a powerful strike into the roof of the net for his eighth goal in nine appearances.\n\nUnited had to wait until the 51st minute to have their first shot on target, but Antony's 22-yard curler was routine for Henderson.\n\nThose fleeting forays for United only momentarily interrupted the Olise show as his skill should have resulted in a third for Palace, but Eze curled wide.\n\nMitchell was next to go close as Onana thwarted his near-post effort before Will Hughes had a half-volley clawed away.\n\nUnited's respite did not last long as a perfectly-weighted chipped pass by Adam Wharton found Joachim Andersen, who teed up Mitchell for a 58th-minute tap-in.\n\nNot long after Hojlund had calls for a spot-kick turned down, Olise made it 4-0 with 24 minutes left.\n\nDaniel Munoz was too strong for Casemiro and teed up Olise, who brilliantly curled beyond Onana from 16 yards before he celebrated with Glasner.\n\nThere would be no hat-trick for Olise as he was replaced in the 85th minute and United avoided further embarrassment in stoppage time when Odsonne Edouard hit a post on a night to remember for Palace.", "source": {"uri": "guernseypress.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Guernsey Press"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Olise", "type":

thumping Palace win", "body": "A Michael Olise masterclass helped Crystal Palace complete a first ever Premier League double over Manchester United and inflict further misery on Erik ten Hag's team with a 4-0 drubbing in south London.\n\nOlise has been linked with a summer switch to Old Trafford and run amok at Selhurst Park with a dazzling display, scoring twice to move on to nine goals in 12 league starts this season.\n\nTwo sparkling efforts by Olise in the 12th and 66th minutes bookended this latest superb result for Oliver Glasner's side, with Jean-Philippe Mateta and Tyrick Mitchell also on target to make it four wins in five for Palace.\n\nIt was another sorry display for Ten Hag, though, with Jonny Evans and Casemiro given a torrid night.\n\nInjury-hit United have won only two of their last 10 league matches and could be set for a lowest ever Premier League finish.\n\nUnited had dropped to eighth after wins for Newcastle and Chelsea at the weekend, while the club's injury list increased with Harry Maguire and Bruno Fernandes not available for this clash.\n\nEvans was fit enough to start, but he endured a nervy opening and had to block an early Olise shot after his own poor clearance before Palace wanted a penalty when Evans challenged Mitchell in the area.\n\nHowever, Ten Hag's side did not heed the warning of how dangerous Olise can be as he broke the deadlock in the 12th minute.\n\nOlise skipped away from Christian Eriksen and left Casemiro sprawled on the floor by the centre circle before he drilled a shot into the bottom corner, having been given the freedom of Selhurst Park by United's backpedalling defence\n\nIt was a wonderful effort from Olise, but one to forgot for the visitors and a sign of things to come.\n\nTwo more Olise efforts were repelled, one accidentally by his team-mate Mateta before Andre Onana saved after another fine Palace move.\n\nIt looked the correct decision, although Ten Hag appeared bemused when in discussion with fourth official Graham Scott on the touchline.\n\nFive minutes before half-time and United's bank holiday trip to the capital went from bad to worse.\n\nEberechi Eze and Chris Richards combined and the latter passed into Mateta, who sped away from Evans far too easily and unleashed a powerful strike into the roof of the net for his eighth goal in nine appearances.\n\nUnited had to wait until the 51st minute to have their first shot on target, but Antony's 22-yard curler was routine for Henderson.\n\nThose fleeting forays for United only momentarily interrupted the Olise show as his skill should have resulted in a third for Palace, but Eze curled wide.\n\nMitchell was next to go close as Onana thwarted his near-post effort before Will Hughes had a half-volley clawed away.\n\nUnited's respite did not last long as a perfectly-weighted chipped pass by Adam Wharton found Joachim Andersen, who teed up Mitchell for a 58th-minute tap-in.\n\nNot long after Hojlund had calls for a spot-kick turned down, Olise made it 4-0 with 24 minutes left.\n\nDaniel Munoz was too strong for Casemiro and teed up Olise, who brilliantly curled beyond Onana from 16 yards before he celebrated with Glasner.\n\nThere would be no hat-trick for Olise as he was replaced in the 85th minute and United avoided further embarrassment in stoppage time when Odsonne Edouard hit a post on a night to

The makeshift centre-back had drifted offside before Eriksen's free-kick.\n\nThose fleeting forays for United only momentarily interrupted the Olise show as his skill should have resulted in a third for Palace, but Eze curled wide.\n\nMitchell was next to go close as Onana thwarted his near-post effort before Will Hughes had a half-volley clawed away.\n\nUnited's respite did not last long as a perfectly-weighted chipped pass by Adam Wharton found Joachim Andersen, who teed up Mitchell for a 58th-minute tap-in.\n\nNot long after Hojlund had calls for a spot-kick turned down, Olise made it 4-0 with 24 minutes left.\n\nDaniel Munoz was too strong for Casemiro and teed up Olise, who brilliantly curled beyond Onana from 16 yards before he celebrated with Glasner.\n\nThere would be no hat-trick for Olise as he was replaced in the 85th minute and United avoided further embarrassment in stoppage time when Odsonne Edouard hit a post on a night to remember for Palace.", "source":

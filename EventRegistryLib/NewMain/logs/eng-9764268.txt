(AP Photo/Seth Wenig, File)NEW YORK (AP) - Prosecutors are urging a judge to uphold Donald Trump's historic hush money conviction, arguing in court papers released Thursday that the verdict should stand despite the Supreme Court's recent ruling on presidential immunity.

Former President Donald Trump's sentencing in his hush money case has been postponed until Sept. 18.\n\nNEW YORK (AP) -- Prosecutors are urging a judge to uphold Donald Trump's historic hush money conviction, arguing in court papers made public Thursday that the verdict should stand despite the Supreme Court's recent ruling on presidential immunity.\n\nThe Manhattan district attorney's office said in a court filing that the high court's opinion \"has no bearing\" on the hush money case because it involves unofficial acts for which the former president is not immune.\n\n\"This case involved evidence of defendant's personal conduct, not his official acts,\" prosecutors wrote in a 66-page filing. They contend there is \"no basis for disturbing the jury's verdict.\"\n\nThe Republican presidential nominee is trying to get the verdict -- and even the indictment -- tossed out because of the Supreme Court's July 1 decision. The ruling curbs prosecutions of ex-presidents for official acts and restricts prosecutors from pointing to official acts as evidence that a commander in chief's unofficial actions were illegal.\n\nTrump's lawyers have argued that prosecutors rushed to trial instead of waiting for the Supreme Court's presidential immunity decision, and that the trial was \"tainted\" by evidence that should not have been allowed under the high court's ruling, such as testimony from some Trump White House staffers and tweets he sent while president in 2018.\n\nProsecutors countered that the Supreme Court ruling doesn't apply to the evidence in question, and that regardless, it's \"only a sliver of the mountains of testimony and documentary proof\" that the jury considered before reaching its verdict May 30.\n\nIn a letter Thursday to trial Judge Juan M. Merchan, Trump lawyer Todd Blanche said the prosecution filing contains \"several legal and factual misrepresentations,\" and asked for permission to file a 30-page response next week.\n\nThe Supreme Court ruled about a month after the jury found Trump guilty of falsifying business records to conceal a deal to pay off porn actor Stormy Daniels shortly before the 2016 election. At the time, she was considering going public with a story of a sexual encounter with Trump a decade earlier.\n\nHe denies her claim, maintains he did nothing wrong and says the case is politically motivated. Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg is a Democrat.\n\nTrump was a private citizen -- campaigning for president, but neither elected nor sworn in -- when Cohen paid Daniels. But Trump was president when Cohen was reimbursed, and Cohen testified that they discussed the repayment arrangement in the Oval Office.\n\nProsecutors say the reimbursements to Cohen were misleadingly logged as legal expenses in Trump's company records.\n\nMerchan is due to rule Sept. 6 on Trump's request to overturn the verdict and dismiss the indictment. Trump's sentencing is set for Sept. 18, if the verdict stands.\n\nThe sentencing, which carries the potential for anything from probation to up to four years in prison, was initially set for mid-July. But within hours of the Supreme Court's ruling, Trump's lawyers persuaded Merchanto delay it.\n\nThe Supreme Court did not define what constitutes an official act, leaving that matter to lower courts. Indeed, even the conservative justices responsible for the majority opinion differed about what is proper for jurors to hear about a president's conduct.\n\nIn a separate concurring opinion, Justice Amy Coney Barrett wrote that the Constitution does not require juries to be blinded \"to the circumstances surrounding conduct for which presidents can be held liable\" and suggested that it would needlessly \"hamstring\" a prosecutor's case to prohibit any mention of an official act in question.\n\nBefore the Supreme Court ruling, Trump's lawyers brought up presidential immunity in a failed bid last year to get the hush money case moved from state court to federal court. In rejecting the move, U.S. District Judge Alvin Hellerstein wrote that \"hush money paid to an adult film star is not related to a president's official acts.\"\n\nLater, Trump's lawyers beseeched Merchan to hold off the hush money trial until the Supreme Court ruled on his immunity claim, which arose from a separate prosecution -- the Washington, D.C., federal criminal case pertaining to Trump's efforts to overturn his 2020 presidential election loss. But Merchan ruled that they raised the issue too late because it came well after a deadline for such pretrial requests.\n\nTrump's lawyers never raised presidential immunity as a defense in the hush money trial, but they tried unsuccessfully to prevent prosecutors from showing the jury evidence from his time in office. As the trial got underway in April, Merchan balked at the idea that prosecutors be prohibited from showing jurors tweets that Trump had voluntarily sent out to millions of followers.\n\nTrump's lawyers argue that presidential immunity should have ruled out some testimony from former White House communications director Hope Hicks and another aide, as well as documents including his 2018 financial disclosure.\n\nProsecutors countered that the aides' testimony -- including Hicks' account of conversations with Trump about news coverage -- concerned Trump's personal matters or described his work practices so generally that immunity doesn't apply. The financial disclosure form fell within allowances for using public records, they argued.\n\nAs for Trump's tweets, his lawyers contend they were official acts: a president's communications to Americans about something pertinent to his credibility as their leader.\n\nProsecutors maintained otherwise in the new filing.\n\n\"Defendant's tweets conveying his personal opinion about his private attorney do not bear any conceivable relationship to any official duty of the presidency,\" they wrote.", "source": {"uri": "eagletribune.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Eagle-Tribune"}, "authors": [{"uri": "associated_press@eagletribune.com", "name": "Associated Press", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}, {"uri": "michael_r_sisak@eagletribune.com", "name": "Michael R.

They contend there is \"no basis for disturbing the jury's verdict.\"\n\nThe Republican presidential nominee is trying to get the verdict -- and even the indictment -- tossed out because of the Supreme Court's July 1 decision. The ruling curbs prosecutions of ex-presidents for official acts and restricts prosecutors from pointing to official acts as evidence that a commander in chief's unofficial actions were illegal.\n\nREAD MORE: Trump lawyers push to overturn his felony conviction after Supreme Court immunity ruling\n\nTrump's lawyers have argued that prosecutors rushed to trial instead of waiting for the Supreme Court's presidential immunity decision, and that the trial was \"tainted\" by evidence that should not have been allowed under the high court's ruling, such as testimony from some Trump White House staffers and tweets he sent while president in 2018.\n\nProsecutors countered that the Supreme Court ruling doesn't apply to the evidence in question, and that regardless, it's \"only a sliver of the mountains of testimony and documentary proof\" that the jury considered before reaching its verdict May 30.\n\nIn a letter Thursday to trial Judge Juan M. Merchan, Trump lawyer Todd Blanche said the prosecution filing contains \"several legal and factual misrepresentations,\" and asked for permission to file a 30-page response next week.\n\nThe Supreme Court ruled about a month after the jury found Trump guilty of falsifying business records to conceal a deal to pay off porn actor Stormy Daniels shortly before the 2016 election. At the time, she was considering going public with a story of a sexual encounter with Trump a decade earlier.\n\nHe denies her claim, maintains he did nothing wrong and says the case is politically motivated. Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg is a Democrat.\n\nTrump was a private citizen -- campaigning for president, but neither elected nor sworn in -- when Cohen paid Daniels. But Trump was president when Cohen was reimbursed, and Cohen testified that they discussed the repayment arrangement in the Oval Office.\n\nProsecutors say the reimbursements to Cohen were misleadingly logged as legal expenses in Trump's company records.\n\nMerchan is due to rule Sept. 6 on Trump's request to overturn the verdict and dismiss the indictment. Trump's sentencing is set for Sept. 18, if the verdict stands.\n\nThe sentencing, which carries the potential for anything from probation to up to four years in prison, was initially set for mid-July. But within hours of the Supreme Court's ruling, Trump's lawyers persuaded Merchanto delay it.\n\nThe Supreme Court did not define what constitutes an official act, leaving that matter to lower courts. Indeed, even the conservative justices responsible for the majority opinion differed about what is proper for jurors to hear about a president's conduct.\n\nIn a separate concurring opinion, Justice Amy Coney Barrett wrote that the Constitution does not require juries to be blinded \"to the circumstances surrounding conduct for which presidents can be held liable\" and suggested that it would needlessly \"hamstring\" a prosecutor's case to prohibit any mention of an official act in question.\n\nBefore the Supreme Court ruling, Trump's lawyers brought up presidential immunity in a failed bid last year to get the hush money case moved from state court to federal court. In rejecting the move, U.S. District Judge Alvin Hellerstein wrote that \"hush money paid to an adult film star is not related to a president's official acts.\"\n\nLater, Trump's lawyers beseeched Merchan to hold off the hush money trial until the Supreme Court ruled on his immunity claim, which arose from a separate prosecution -- the Washington, D.C., federal criminal case pertaining to Trump's efforts to overturn his 2020 presidential election loss. But Merchan ruled that they raised the issue too late because it came well after a deadline for such pretrial requests.\n\nREAD MORE: Trump's 2024 trials: Where they stand and what to expect\n\nTrump's lawyers never raised presidential immunity as a defense in the hush money trial, but they tried unsuccessfully to prevent prosecutors from showing the jury evidence from his time in office. As the trial got underway in April, Merchan balked at the idea that prosecutors be prohibited from showing jurors tweets that Trump had voluntarily sent out to millions of followers.\n\nTrump's lawyers argue that presidential immunity should have ruled out some testimony from former White House communications director Hope Hicks and another aide, as well as documents including his 2018 financial disclosure.\n\nProsecutors countered that the aides' testimony -- including Hicks' account of conversations with Trump about news coverage -- concerned Trump's personal matters or described his work practices so generally that immunity doesn't apply. The financial disclosure form fell within allowances for using public records, they argued.\n\nAs for Trump's tweets, his lawyers contend they were official acts: a president's communications to Americans about something pertinent to his credibility as their leader.\n\nProsecutors maintained otherwise in the new filing.\n\n\"Defendant's tweets conveying his personal opinion about his private attorney do not bear any conceivable relationship to any official duty of the presidency,\" they wrote.", "source": {"uri": "pbs.org", "dataType": "news", "title": "PBS.org"}, "authors": [{"uri": "associated_press@pbs.org", "name": "Associated Press", "type": "author", "isAgency": true}, {"uri": "michael_r_sisak@pbs.org", "name": "Michael R.

They contend there is \"no basis for disturbing the jury's verdict.\"\n\nThe Republican presidential nominee is trying to get the verdict -- and even the indictment -- tossed out because of the Supreme Court's July 1 decision. The ruling curbs prosecutions of ex-presidents for official acts and restricts prosecutors from pointing to official acts as evidence that a commander in chief's unofficial actions were illegal.\n\nTrump's lawyers have argued that prosecutors rushed to trial instead of waiting for the Supreme Court's presidential immunity decision, and that the trial was \"tainted\" by evidence that should not have been allowed under the high court's ruling, such as testimony from some Trump White House staffers and tweets he sent while president in 2018.\n\nProsecutors countered that the Supreme Court ruling doesn't apply to the evidence in question, and that regardless, it's \"only a sliver of the mountains of testimony and documentary proof\" that the jury considered before reaching its verdict May 30.\n\nIn a letter Thursday to trial Judge Juan M. Merchan, Trump lawyer Todd Blanche said the prosecution filing contains \"several legal and factual misrepresentations,\" and asked for permission to file a 30-page response next week.\n\nThe Supreme Court ruled about a month after the jury found Trump guilty of falsifying business records to conceal a deal to pay off porn actor Stormy Daniels shortly before the 2016 election. At the time, she was considering going public with a story of a sexual encounter with Trump a decade earlier.\n\nHe denies her claim, maintains he did nothing wrong and says the case is politically motivated. Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg is a Democrat.\n\nTrump was a private citizen -- campaigning for president, but neither elected nor sworn in -- when Cohen paid Daniels. But Trump was president when Cohen was reimbursed, and Cohen testified that they discussed the repayment arrangement in the Oval Office.\n\nProsecutors say the reimbursements to Cohen were misleadingly logged as legal expenses in Trump's company records.\n\nMerchan is due to rule Sept. 6 on Trump's request to overturn the verdict and dismiss the indictment. Trump's sentencing is set for Sept. 18, if the verdict stands.\n\nThe sentencing, which carries the potential for anything from probation to up to four years in prison, was initially set for mid-July. But within hours of the Supreme Court's ruling, Trump's lawyers persuaded Merchanto delay it.\n\nThe Supreme Court did not define what constitutes an official act, leaving that matter to lower courts. Indeed, even the conservative justices responsible for the majority opinion differed about what is proper for jurors to hear about a president's conduct.\n\nIn a separate concurring opinion, Justice Amy Coney Barrett wrote that the Constitution does not require juries to be blinded \"to the circumstances surrounding conduct for which presidents can be held liable\" and suggested that it would needlessly \"hamstring\" a prosecutor's case to prohibit any mention of an official act in question.\n\nBefore the Supreme Court ruling, Trump's lawyers brought up presidential immunity in a failed bid last year to get the hush money case moved from state court to federal court. In rejecting the move, U.S. District Judge Alvin Hellerstein wrote that \"hush money paid to an adult film star is not related to a president's official acts.\"\n\nLater, Trump's lawyers beseeched Merchan to hold off the hush money trial until the Supreme Court ruled on his immunity claim, which arose from a separate prosecution -- the Washington, D.C., federal criminal case pertaining to Trump's efforts to overturn his 2020 presidential election loss. But Merchan ruled that they raised the issue too late because it came well after a deadline for such pretrial requests.\n\nTrump's lawyers never raised presidential immunity as a defense in the hush money trial, but they tried unsuccessfully to prevent prosecutors from showing the jury evidence from his time in office. As the trial got underway in April, Merchan balked at the idea that prosecutors be prohibited from showing jurors tweets that Trump had voluntarily sent out to millions of followers.\n\nTrump's lawyers argue that presidential immunity should have ruled out some testimony from former White House communications director Hope Hicks and another aide, as well as documents including his 2018 financial disclosure.\n\nProsecutors countered that the aides' testimony -- including Hicks' account of conversations with Trump about news coverage -- concerned Trump's personal matters or described his work practices so generally that immunity doesn't apply. The financial disclosure form fell within allowances for using public records, they argued.\n\nAs for Trump's tweets, his lawyers contend they were official acts: a president's communications to Americans about something pertinent to his credibility as their leader.\n\nProsecutors maintained otherwise in the new filing.\n\n\"Defendant's tweets conveying his personal opinion about his private attorney do not bear any conceivable relationship to any official duty of the presidency,\" they wrote.", "source": {"uri": "wlos.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "WLOS"}, "authors": [{"uri":

The ruling insulates former presidents from being criminally prosecuted for official acts and bars prosecutors from pointing to official acts as evidence that a commander in chief's unofficial actions were illegal.\n\nThat decision came about a month after a Manhattan jury found Trump guilty of falsifying business records to conceal a deal to pay off porn actor Stormy Daniels shortly before the 2016 election. At the time, she was considering going public with a story of a 2006 sexual encounter with Trump, who says no such thing happened. He has denied any wrongdoing.\n\nTrump was a private citizen when his then-lawyer, Michael Cohen, paid Daniels. But Trump was president when Cohen was reimbursed. Prosecutors say those repayments were misleadingly logged simply as legal expenses in Trump's company records. Cohen testified that he and Trump discussed the repayment arrangement in the Oval Office.\n\nTrump's lawyers have argued that prosecutors rushed to trial instead of waiting for the Supreme Court's view on presidential immunity, and that the trial was \"tainted\" by evidence that should not have been allowed under the high court's ruling.\n\nJudge Juan M. Merchan plans to rule Sept. 6 on the Trump lawyers' request. The judge has set Trump's sentencing for Sept. 18, \"if such is still necessary\" after he reaches his conclusions about immunity.\n\nThe sentencing, which carries the potential for anything from probation to up to four years in prison, initially was set for mid-July. But within hours of the Supreme Court's ruling, Trump's team asked to delay the sentencing. Merchan soon pushed the sentencing back to consider their immunity arguments.\n\nUnder the Supreme Court's decision, lower courts are largely the ones that will have to figure out what constitutes an official act.\n\nIndeed, even the conservative justices responsible for the majority opinion differed about what is proper for jurors to hear about a president's conduct.\n\nIn a separate concurring opinion, Justice Amy Coney Barrett wrote that the Constitution does not require juries to be blinded \"to the circumstances surrounding conduct for which presidents can be held liable\" and suggested that it would needlessly \"hamstring\" a prosecutor's case to prohibit any mention of an official act in question.\n\nBefore the Supreme Court ruling, Trump's lawyers brought up presidential immunity in a failed bid last year to get the hush money case moved from state court to federal court.\n\nLater, they tried to hold off the hush money trial until the Supreme Court ruled on his immunity claim, which arose from a separate prosecution -- the Washington-based federal criminal case surrounding Trump's efforts to overturn his 2020 presidential election loss.\n\nTrump's lawyers never raised presidential immunity as a defense in the hush money trial, but they tried unsuccessfully to prevent prosecutors from showing the jury evidence from his time in office.\n\nMore from this section\n\nInformative Research Enhances Verification Platform through Expanded Integration with The Work Number\u00ae from Equifax\n\nHitPaw Edimakor for Mac 3.0.0 Released with AI Video Translator and AI Copywriting!\n\nOptimal Blue Launches New Generative AI Assistant Capabilities", "source": {"uri": "kulr8.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "KULR-8 Local News"}, "authors": [{"uri": "associated_press@kulr8.com", "name": "Associated Press", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}, {"uri": "michael_r_sisak@kulr8.com", "name": "Michael R.

He is the first U.S. president past or present to be convicted of a crime.\n\nIn a 6-3 ruling, the Supreme Court on July 1 ruled that presidents cannot face criminal charges over official acts, and that evidence of official acts cannot be used in a prosecution on private matters.\n\nLegal experts say Justice Juan Merchan is unlikely to grant Trump's request to toss the verdict, since much of the conduct at issue predated Trump's 2017-2021 presidency and relates to personal matters, not official acts.\n\nBut Merchan delayed Trump's sentencing from July 11 to Sept. 18, less than two months before the election, to allow his lawyers the chance to make their case.\n\nTwo weeks ago, Trump's defense lawyers urged the judge to toss the jury's guilty verdict because prosecutors relied on evidence of his official acts during the trial, which they said was improper in light of the justices' ruling.\n\nTrump's lawyers took issue with introduction of evidence of Twitter posts Trump made in 2018 about Cohen, which prosecutors said showed Trump was aware that his former lawyer had paid off Daniels. Defense lawyers said those posts were official communications.\n\nIn their Thursday filing, prosecutors said Trump made the posts in his \"unofficial capacity.\"\n\nMerchan has said he will decide on Trump's arguments by Sept. 6. If the conviction is upheld, the case will proceed to sentencing. Once he is sentenced, Trump could formally appeal the verdict and the sentencing to a higher-level state court.

Trump is scheduled to be sentenced Sept. 18. Elizabeth Williams/Associated Press\n\nNEW YORK -- Manhattan prosecutors on Thursday asked a judge to uphold Donald Trump's conviction for falsifying records in a hush money scheme to hide claims that he cheated on his wife with Stormy Daniels from voters - arguing the Supreme Court's presidential immunity ruling has \"nothing to say\" to say about the case despite what Trump claims.\n\nTrump's lawyers earlier this month asked Manhattan Supreme Court Justice Juan Merchan to vacate his conviction and dismiss the underlying indictment in light of the July 1 ruling by the Supreme Court's conservative majority finding that most actions undertaken by presidents in the course of \"official acts\" are immune from criminal prosecution.\n\nOpposing the request in new filings, Assistant District Attorney Matthew Colangelo argued that Trump's conviction for reimbursing his personal lawyer, Michael Cohen, for hush money under the table and the underlying scheme were utterly unrelated to his official duties.\n\n\"(All) of the evidence that he complains of either concerned wholly unofficial conduct or, at most, official conduct for which any presumption of immunity has been rebutted. The Supreme Court's recent ruling thus has nothing to say about defendant's conviction,\" Colangelo wrote.\n\n\"(The) scheme was entirely personal and largely committed before the election, and it had no relationship whatsoever to any official duty of the presidency,\" the prosecutor later wrote.\n\nThe jury's May 30 verdict finding Trump guilty of 34 felonies determined he falsified records to cover up payback to Cohen for silencing Daniels, illegally documenting checks to him as compensation for legitimate legal services.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe verdict made him the first U.S. president to be criminally convicted and could be his only conviction if he wins the election. He still faces two other criminal cases in Fulton County, Georgia, and Washington, D.C., alleging he plotted to overturn President Biden's win in 2020, in which he's pleaded not guilty. Neither case is expected to make it to trial before the election, and it's unclear whether they ever will if he wins.\n\nThe federal case in Florida alleging Trump hoarded classified documents after his presidency and hid them from authorities was dismissed by a Trump-appointed judge in a decision that sent shockwaves through the legal community last week. Federal prosecutors are appealing the ruling, which could take years.\n\nAlthough Trump's Manhattan case mostly centered on the year leading up to his presidency -- when prosecutors alleged the hush money scheme was carried out to win the election -- his defense team has argued that any evidence presented to jurors relating to his time in office in 2017 and 2018, including the reimbursement to Cohen, was out-of-bounds, thus nullifying the verdict. The Supreme Court's immunity decision, which is expected to pare down Trump's federal election subversion case significantly, also blocked prosecutors from presenting evidence of presidential acts while trying to prove a president's unofficial acts were against the law.\n\nAmong other examples, Trump's defense team has argued that testimony by his campaign manager and then White House communications director, Hope Hicks, was impermissible. She told jurors that in early 2018, Trump acknowledged he reimbursed Cohen for paying off Daniels and said it would have been worse had the payoff been reported by the media before the 2016 election. In their motion, they also cited tweets Trump fired off from his official presidential account on Twitter, now known as \"X,\" which prosecutors presented as evidence that Trump tried to intimidate Cohen from cooperating with authorities probing the hush money scheme.\n\nIn the filing made public Thursday, prosecutors said that even if some evidence was improperly admitted at trial, Merchan should let Trump's conviction stand as the trial record contained \"overwhelming evidence\" of his guilt.\n\n\"For all the pages that defendant devotes to his current motion, the evidence that he claims is affected by the Supreme Court's ruling constitutes only a sliver of the mountains of testimony and documentary proof that the jury considered in finding him guilty of all 34 felony charges beyond a reasonable doubt,\" Colangelo wrote.\n\n\"Under these circumstances, there is no basis for disturbing the jury's verdict, and defendant's motion should be denied.\"\n\nMerchan granted a defense request to delay Trump's sentencing, initially slated for July 11 until Sept. 18, \"if such is still necessary\" following the Supreme Court ruling. He's expected to rule on Trump's request to throw out the verdict by Sept. 6.\n\nAttorneys for Trump did not immediately respond to requests seeking comment.\n\nCopy the Story Link\n\nSend

They said certain evidence and testimony should have been withheld from the jury, because they were related to protected official acts of the presidency.\n\nThe Supreme Court's July 1 ruling barred evidence involving a president's official acts from being used in prosecutions, even if the charges involve unofficial activity. Trump was convicted in May of 34 counts of falsification of business records as part of a scheme to cover up reimbursements for a \"hush money\" payment to an adult film star shortly before the 2016 election.\n\nTrump's lawyers argued in a filing earlier this month that much of the testimony and evidence introduced at trial that related to Trump's time in office should not have been allowed. That material included testimony by former White House communications director Hope Hicks, former director of Oval Office operations Madeleine Westerhout, Trump's tweets during his presidency and his disclosures to the Office Of Government Ethics.\n\nBut prosecutors claimed Wednesday that very little of the evidence related to Trump's official acts, saying any that did were \"harmless error\" that should not derail a case that included 22 witnesses and reams of documents.\n\nThey cited a pretrial ruling related to the case in which a federal judge rejected arguments that the evidence had anything to do with official acts, calling the matter \"a personal item of the president.\"\n\nTrump's lawyers argued in their filing that \"presidential immunity errors are never harmless.\"\n\n\"The harmless-error doctrine cannot save the trial result,\" they wrote. \"The Supreme Court's constitutional analysis ... forecloses harmless-error analysis.\"\n\nJustice Juan Merchan has said he will rule on Trump's effort to overturn the conviction on Sept. 6. If Trump's motion fails, sentencing will take place on Sept. 18.\n\nTrump, who is again the Republican nominee for president, could face jail time in the case, but Merchan can also sentence him to a variety of less severe penalties, including probation.", "source": {"uri": "cbsnews.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "CBS News"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supreme_Court_of_the_United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Supreme Court of the United States"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alvin_Bragg", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Alvin Bragg"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_(state)", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "New York (state)"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_County_District_Attorney", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "New York County District Attorney"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conviction", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Conviction"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manhattan", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Manhattan"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Manhattan"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2016_United_States_presidential_election", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "2016 United States presidential election"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Absolute_immunity", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Absolute immunity"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_House_Communications_Director", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "White House Communications Director"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hush_money", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Hush money"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Forgery", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Forgery"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Juan_Merchan", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Juan Merchan"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Madeleine_Westerhout", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Madeleine Westerhout"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hope_Hicks", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Hope Hicks"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harmless_error", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Harmless error"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oval_Office", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Oval Office"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Probation", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Probation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_federal_judge", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "United States federal judge"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republican_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Republican Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twitter", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Twitter"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Law/Legal_Information", "label": "dmoz/Society/Law/Legal Information", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Crime_and_Justice", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Crime and Justice", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Trials", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Trials", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Law/Courts", "label": "dmoz/Society/Law/Courts", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Law", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Law", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 92}], "image": "https://assets2.cbsnewsstatic.com/hub/i/r/2024/07/23/c89a0db1-78b9-41e1-a60c-4d5eb95cc08d/thumbnail/1200x630/7ef27e34b82fbf407237dbd0d56a4144/gettyimages-1925298558.jpg?v=5501038cbc281520ff9fdc308faab7dc", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9764268", "eventUri": "eng-9764268", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-07-11", "textStart": 598, "textEnd": 605}, {"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-07-01", "textStart": 943, "textEnd": 949}, {"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-09-06", "textStart": 2510, "textEnd": 2517}, {"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-09-18", "textStart": 2574, "textEnd": 2582}], "sentiment": 0.02745098039215677, "wgt": 197, "relevance": 1}

The Supreme Court's recent ruling thus has nothing to say about defendant's conviction,\" Colangelo wrote.\n\n\"(The) scheme was entirely personal and largely committed before the election, and it had no relationship whatsoever to any official duty of the presidency,\" the prosecutor later wrote.\n\nThe jury's May 30 verdict finding Trump guilty of 34 felonies determined he falsified records to cover up payback to Cohen for silencing Daniels, illegally documenting checks to him as compensation for legitimate legal services.\n\nThe verdict made him the first U.S. president to be criminally convicted and could be his only conviction if he wins the election. He still faces two other criminal cases in Fulton County, Georgia, and Washington, D.C., alleging he plotted to overturn President Joe Biden's win in 2020, in which he's pleaded not guilty. Neither case is expected to make it to trial before the election, and it's unclear whether they ever will if he wins.\n\nThe federal case in Florida alleging Trump hoarded classified documents after his presidency and hid them from authorities was dismissed by a Trump-appointed judge in a decision that sent shockwaves through the legal community last week. Federal prosecutors are appealing the ruling, which could take years.\n\nAlthough Trump's Manhattan case mostly centered on the year leading up to his presidency -- when prosecutors alleged the hush money scheme was carried out to win the election -- his defense team has argued that any evidence presented to jurors relating to his time in office in 2017 and 2018, including the reimbursement to Cohen, was out-of-bounds, thus nullifying the verdict. The Supreme Court's immunity decision, which is expected to pare down Trump's federal election subversion case significantly, also blocked prosecutors from presenting evidence of presidential acts while trying to prove a president's unofficial acts were against the law.\n\nAmong other examples, Trump's defense team has argued that testimony by his campaign manager and then White House communications director, Hope Hicks, was impermissible. She told jurors that in early 2018, Trump acknowledged he reimbursed Cohen for paying off Daniels and said it would have been worse had the payoff been reported by the media before the 2016 election. In their motion, they also cited tweets Trump fired off from his official presidential account on Twitter, now known as \"X,\" which prosecutors presented as evidence that Trump tried to intimidate Cohen from cooperating with authorities probing the hush money scheme.\n\nIn the filing made public Thursday, prosecutors said that even if some evidence was improperly admitted at trial, Merchan should let Trump's conviction stand as the trial record contained \"overwhelming evidence\" of his guilt.\n\n\"For all the pages that defendant devotes to his current motion, the evidence that he claims is affected by the Supreme Court's ruling constitutes only a sliver of the mountains of testimony and documentary proof that the jury considered in finding him guilty of all 34 felony charges beyond a reasonable doubt,\" Colangelo wrote.\n\n\"Under these circumstances, there is no basis for disturbing the jury's verdict, and defendant's motion should be denied.\"\n\nMerchan granted a defense request to delay Trump's sentencing, initially slated for July 11 until Sept. 18, \"if such is still necessary\" following the Supreme Court ruling. He's expected to rule on Trump's request to throw out the verdict by Sept. 6.\n\nAttorneys for Trump did not immediately respond to requests seeking comment.", "source": {"uri": "ca.news.yahoo.com",

In that ruling, the court said former presidents are immune from prosecution over many of their official acts and said that official presidential acts can't be used even as evidence to prove unofficial acts that are allegedly criminal.\n\nTrump was convicted in late May of 34 counts of falsifying the records of his private business in an effort to conceal an October 2016 hush money payment to a porn star that he orchestrated before he was elected president. Though the payment was made before he took office, Trump falsified the records after he became president. And during the trial, prosecutors introduced a variety of other evidence of actions he took while he was president, including testimony from some White House staffers such as Hope Hicks.\n\nTrump's lawyers have said that evidence used during the trial improperly included \"official acts\" that he undertook as president, including social media messages, calling the prosecution an effort \"to front-run the Supreme Court on a federal constitutional issue with grave implications.\"\n\nBut prosecutors argued, in effect, that that evidence was immaterial, writing that \"the evidence that he claims is affected by the Supreme Court's ruling constitutes only a sliver of the mountains of testimony and documentary proof that the jury considered in finding him guilty of all 34 felony charges beyond a reasonable doubt.\"\n\nProsecutors also told Justice Juan Merchan that Trump passed up his opportunity to make an immunity argument by failing to do so earlier in the case and waiting until March, shortly before the trial was originally set to begin, to claim that evidence related to official acts should be precluded.\n\nMerchan is set to rule on Trump's bid to toss the verdict in early September.

He is the first U.S. president past or present to be convicted of a crime.\n\nIn a 6-3 ruling, the Supreme Court on July 1 ruled that presidents cannot face criminal charges over official acts, and that evidence of official acts cannot be used in a prosecution on private matters.\n\nLegal experts say Justice Juan Merchan is unlikely to grant Trump's request to toss the verdict, since much of the conduct at issue predated Trump's 2017-2021 presidency and relates to personal matters, not official acts.\n\nBut Merchan delayed Trump's sentencing from July 11 to Sept. 18, less than two months before the election, to allow his lawyers the chance to make their case.\n\nTwo weeks ago, Trump's defense lawyers urged the judge to toss the jury's guilty verdict because prosecutors relied on evidence of his official acts during the trial, which they said was improper in light of the justices' ruling.\n\nTrump's lawyers took issue with introduction of evidence of Twitter posts Trump made in 2018 about Cohen, which prosecutors said showed Trump was aware that his former lawyer had paid off Daniels. Defense lawyers said those posts were official communications.\n\nIn their Thursday filing, prosecutors said Trump made the posts in his \"unofficial capacity.\"\n\nMerchan has said he will decide on Trump's arguments by Sept. 6. If the conviction is upheld, the case will proceed to sentencing. Once he is sentenced, Trump could formally appeal the verdict and the sentencing to a higher-level state court.\n\n(Reporting by Luc Cohen in New York; Editing by Noeleen Walder and Daniel Wallis)\n\nCLICK HERE TO READ MORE FROM THE GAZETTE", "source": {"uri": "gazette.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Colorado Springs Gazette"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hush_money", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Hush money"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Legal_immunity", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Legal immunity"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pornographic_film_actor", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Pornographic film actor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supreme_Court_of_the_United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Supreme Court of the United States"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stormy_Daniels", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Stormy Daniels"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reuters", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Reuters"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manhattan", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Manhattan"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Manhattan"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Juan_Merchan", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Juan Merchan"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Falsifying_business_records", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Falsifying business records"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Cohen_(lawyer)", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Michael Cohen (lawyer)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2016_United_States_presidential_election", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "2016 United States presidential election"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_County_District_Attorney", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "New York County District Attorney"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Felony", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Felony"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lawyer", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Lawyer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republican_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Republican Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_(state)", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "New York (state)"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twitter", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Twitter"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Crime_and_Justice", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Crime and Justice", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Law/Organizations", "label": "dmoz/Society/Law/Organizations", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Law", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Law", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Dice/Cosmic_Wimpout", "label": "dmoz/Games/Dice/Cosmic Wimpout", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Flying_Discs/Double_Disc_Court", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Flying Discs/Double Disc Court", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 82}], "image": "https://bloximages.newyork1.vip.townnews.com/gazette.com/content/tncms/assets/v3/editorial/c/cd/ccd680cc-c303-5f8a-8106-90c8fc18f023/66a281f655f14.image.jpg?crop=800%2C420%2C0%2C56&resize=438%2C230&order=crop%2Cresize", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9764268", "eventUri": "eng-9764268", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-07-11", "dateEnd": "2024-09-18", "textStart": 1645, "textEnd": 1664}, {"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-07-24", "textStart": 291, "textEnd": 298}, {"amb": false, "date": "-11-05", "textStart": 743, "textEnd": 749}, {"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-05-30", "textStart": 777, "textEnd": 783}, {"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-07-01", "textStart": 1212, "textEnd": 1218}, {"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-09-06", "textStart": 2404, "textEnd": 2411}], "sentiment": -0.05882352941176472, "wgt": 191, "relevance": 1}

After a six week long trial at Manhattan criminal court, the jury in May found Trump guilty on all 34 felony counts and Trump became the first former president in the history of America to be convicted of a crime.\n\nOn July 1, the Supreme Court released its decision on presidential immunity, which granted some immunity protections to presidents and former presidents from prosecution for actions relating to the core powers of their office, and at least a presumption that they have immunity for their official acts. Within hours after the publication of the historic ruling, Trump's attorneys sent a letter to the presiding judge in the hush-money case, Juan Merchan, asking him to dismiss the guilty verdict.\n\nAt the time, the district attorney's office responded that they did not agree with Trump's claims that the Supreme Court decision impacted their case, but prosecutors agreed to delay the sentencing, which had originally been scheduled for July 11.\n\nJudge Merchan granted the defense's request to file a motion to challenge the verdict, and adjourned the sentencing, \"if such is still necessary,\" to September 18.\n\nAs the Sun reported, Trump's attorneys then filed a full-fledged motion to vacate the verdict and dismiss the entire indictment, which would prevent prosecutors from charging Trump in a new trial, on July 11 - coincidentally on the same day Trump was originally scheduled to be sentenced.\n\nThe defense argued that the Supreme Court's ruling shielded Trump with immunity because evidence brought by the prosecution in his trial - such as tweets and phone calls he made while president, as well as testimony by witnesses such as his former communications director Hope Hicks, and his former Oval Office assistant, Madeleine Westerhout - were part of his presidential duties and \"official acts.\"\n\nMr. Bragg had accused Trump of ordering his former personal lawyer and current nemesis, Michael Cohen, of paying $130,000 to the adult film star, Stormy Daniels, whose real name is Stephanie Clifford, on the eve of the 2016 presidential election to buy her silence about her claim that she had a single sexual encounter with Trump at a celebrity golf tournament at Lake Tahoe in 2006. The prosecution further accused Trump of disguising his reimbursement of the hush-money to Cohen as a legal fee. Trump denies the charges and the sexual encounter. During his June 27 debate with President Biden, he said, \"I didn't have sex with a porn star.\"\n\nIf Trump did in fact repay Cohen the hush-money, as the prosecution alleged, he did so in 2017, when he was president and working from the Oval Office. Therefore, his attorneys argued, any actions he took should be regarded as \"official acts.\"\n\nBut prosecutors pushed back in their court filing on Thursday, writing that paying hush-money to an adult film star is \"entirely personal\" and has \"no relationship whatsoever to any official duty of the presidency.\"\n\nRegarding Trump's tweets, they found the \"challenged Tweets bear no resemblance to the kinds of public comments that the Supreme Court indicated would qualify as official presidential conduct.\" The prosecutors argued that, \"Defendant's Tweets conveying his personal opinion about his private attorney do not bear any conceivable relationship to any official duty of the Presidency.\" They applied this argument as well to Ms. Hicks's tearful testimony, which \"related solely to unofficial conduct.\"\n\n\"[T]he evidence that he claims is affected by the Supreme Court's ruling constitutes only a sliver of the mountains of testimony and documentary proof that the jury considered in finding him guilty of all 34 felony charges beyond a reasonable doubt,\" the district attorney's office wrote, referring to Trump.\n\nThe defense has challenged the indictment, claiming that the evidence presented to the grand jury was already \"tainted\" with evidence related to duties Trump had to perform as a result of being the sitting president. But here too, the prosecutors disagreed.\n\n\"The extensive grand jury evidence cited above far exceeds the required prima facie showing of every element of falsifying business records in the first degree,\" prosecutors concluded. \"And no part of the grand jury record described above relies on any official-acts evidence. Because the indictment is overwhelmingly supported by admissible evidence... defendant's belated and unpreserved effort to dismiss the indictment should be rejected.\"\n\nLast summer, Trump unsuccessfully attempted to move the case from state to federal court, arguing that Mr. Bragg was submitting official-acts evidence. But a federal judge rejected that argument, writing that the \"evidence overwhelmingly suggests that the matter was a purely personal item of the president -- a cover-up of an embarrassing event.\"\n\nCiting the Supreme Court's decision, the prosecution argued that the \"Court explained that the scope of a President's immunity from criminal prosecution depended on whether his acts while in office were official or unofficial. 'As for a President's unofficial acts, there is no immunity,' even if he committed those acts while serving as President.'\"\n\nThe essential question boils down to: what actions should be considered official or unofficial acts? Judge Merchan wrote in his July 2 decision that he would review the matter and render his ruling by September 6.\n\nTrump and his team have already stated that they will appeal the verdict, if the judge should decide to keep it intact.", "source": {"uri": "nysun.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The New York Sun"}, "authors": [{"uri": "marie_pohl@nysun.com", "name": "Marie Pohl", "type":

They said certain evidence and testimony should have been withheld from the jury, because they were related to protected official acts of the presidency.\n\nThe Supreme Court's July 1 ruling barred evidence involving a president's official acts from being used in prosecutions, even if the charges involve unofficial activity. Trump was convicted in May of 34 counts of falsification of business records as part of a scheme to cover up reimbursements for a \"hush money\" payment to an adult film star shortly before the 2016 election.\n\nTrump's lawyers argued in a filing earlier this month that much of the testimony and evidence introduced at trial that related to Trump's time in office should not have been allowed. That material included testimony by former White House communications director Hope Hicks, former director of Oval Office operations Madeleine Westerhout, Trump's tweets during his presidency and his disclosures to the Office Of Government Ethics.\n\nBut prosecutors claimed Wednesday that very little of the evidence related to Trump's official acts, saying any that did were \"harmless error\" that should not derail a case that included 22 witnesses and reams of documents.\n\nThey cited a pretrial ruling related to the case in which a federal judge rejected arguments that the evidence had anything to do with official acts, calling the matter \"a personal item of the president.\"\n\nTrump's lawyers argued in their filing that \"presidential immunity errors are never harmless.\"\n\n\"The harmless-error doctrine cannot save the trial result,\" they wrote. \"The Supreme Court's constitutional analysis ... forecloses harmless-error analysis.\"\n\nJustice Juan Merchan has said he will rule on Trump's effort to overturn the conviction on Sept. 6. If Trump's motion fails, sentencing will take place on Sept. 18.\n\nTrump, who is again the Republican nominee for president, could face jail time in the case, but Merchan can also sentence him to a variety of less severe penalties, including probation.\n\nGraham Kates\n\nGraham Kates is an investigative reporter covering criminal justice, privacy issues and information security for CBS News Digital.

The DA's office countered Thursday that Hicks' testimony was \"personal\" in nature and not an \"official\" presidential action.\n\nBut even if Manhattan jurors never heard that conversation and other challenged evidence from Trump's White House stint, such evidence \"constitutes only a sliver of the mountains of testimony and documentary proof\" that jurors used to convict Trump on 34 counts of felony falsifying business records, prosecutors wrote.\n\n\"Under these circumstances, there is no basis for disturbing the jury's verdict, and defendant's motion should be denied,\" Bragg's office added.\n\nProsecutors also urged Merchan to find that the evidence in question relatively \"harmless\" to the overall case, and to agree with a federal judge's July 2023 ruling that, \"Hush money paid to an adult film star is not related to a president's official acts.\"\n\nMerchan delayed Trump's sentencing date from July 11 to Sept. 18 to hear from both sides on the presidential immunity issue, and said he'll decide by Sept. 6. whether to scuttle the historic verdict.\n\nIf the sentencing does happen as planned, Trump faces up to four years in prison, though legal experts told The Post that he's more likely to get probation or community service.\n\nTrump has denied having sex with Daniels, but chose not to testify at the trial.\n\nHe's repeatedly claimed that the case brought by Bragg --

reject former President Donald Trump's attempt to throw out his criminal hush money conviction, arguing that the U.S. Supreme Court's landmark ruling on presidential immunity \"has nothing to say about defendant's conviction.\"\n\nTrump earlier this month asked Judge Juan Merchan to vacate his conviction on the grounds that the trial was \"tainted\" by evidence and testimony that was made off-limits after the Supreme Court ruled Trump has presumptive immunity from criminal prosecution for official acts taken while in office.\n\nProsecutors said in Thursday's court filing that paying hush money to an adult film actress is \"entirely personal\" with \"no relationship whatsoever to any official duty of the presidency.\"\n\nThe former president was found guilty in May of falsifying business records related to a 2016 hush money payment to adult film actress Stormy Daniels in order to boost his electoral prospects in the 2016 presidential election.\n\nThe jury convicted Trump of 34 felony counts after seeing \"overwhelming evidence of the defendant's guilt,\" prosecutors argued in the filing.\n\nTrump argued that certain evidence presented at trial -- including testimony from former White House aide Hope Hicks and Trump's tweets about his former attorney Michael Cohen -- related to his official acts as president and should now be considered inadmissible in light of the Supreme Court opinion.\n\nProsecutors pushed back in their filing.\n\n\"The challenged Tweets bear no resemblance to the kinds of public comments that the Supreme Court indicated would qualify as official presidential conduct,\" the district attorney's office said. \"Defendant's Tweets conveying his personal opinion about his private attorney do not bear any conceivable relationship to any official duty of the Presidency.\"\n\nProsecutors also argued that testimony from Hicks, who was once Trump's communications director, \"related solely to unofficial conduct.\"\n\n\"[T]he evidence that he claims is affected by the Supreme Court's ruling constitutes only a sliver of the mountains of testimony and documentary proof that the jury considered in finding him guilty of all 34 felony charges beyond a reasonable doubt,\" the filing said.\n\nEarlier this month, Judge Merchan postponed Trump's sentencing in the case from July 11 to Sept. 18 so he could consider Trump's request to

address whether the convictions should be tossed out based on Trump's argument that improper evidence came into the trial.\n\nA 12-person jury unanimously convicted Trump of falsifying 34 business records in order to cover up a 2016 election-interference conspiracy involving hush money to porn star Stormy Daniels.\n\nTrump says that various pieces of evidence constituted immune official conduct, including testimony by former Trump aide Hope Hicks that a conversation with Trump during his presidency led her to believe he preferred having news of the hush money payment break in 2018 rather than before the 2016 election.\n\nProsecutor Joshua Steinglass described the Hicks testimony as \"devastating\" in his closing argument to the jury, adding that it \"puts the nail in Mr. Trump's coffin.\"\n\nProsecutors have previously said they don't believe Trump's latest arguments have merit, although they consented to delaying the sentencing.", "source": {"uri": "yahoo.com",

Trump's criminal hush-money trial to uphold his conviction, seeking to cast doubt on the former president's long-shot bid to overturn the case because of a recent Supreme Court ruling.\n\nIn a court filing made public on Thursday, the Manhattan district attorney's office argued that the Supreme Court's decision this month granting Mr. Trump broad immunity for official actions he took in the White House had \"no bearing on this prosecution.\"\n\nAlthough the high court's ruling was a blow to a separate criminal case against Mr. Trump in Washington, the Manhattan charges did not hinge on official acts. Instead, the Manhattan prosecutors noted, he was convicted in May of covering up of a sex scandal that had threatened to derail his 2016 campaign, a personal and political crisis that did not involve his conduct as president.\n\nMr. Trump's lawyers, seeking to link the two cases, have mounted a novel argument. In a recent filing to the judge who presided over the Manhattan trial, Juan M. Merchan, they contended that the Supreme Court's decision had invalidated at least some of the evidence presented in Manhattan, including the testimony of former White House employees and tweets that Mr. Trump sent as president. The Supreme Court, they noted, had held that official acts could be inadmissible as evidence -- even if a case concerned private misconduct.\n\nBut the district attorney, Alvin L. Bragg, fired back this week, arguing that the former president's lawyers had missed their window of opportunity to raise the immunity defense and then distorted the Supreme Court's ruling once it emerged.\n\nProsecutors from Mr. Bragg's office argued in the court filing that the ruling did not apply to the type of evidence they had deployed against Mr. Trump, and highlighted the personal nature of testimony that had nothing to do with Mr. Trump's duties as president.\n\nEven if it had, the prosecutors argued, they presented so much other evidence that \"any error was harmless\" and the guilty verdict should still stand.\n\n\"For all the pages that defendant devotes to his current motion, the evidence that he claims is affected by the Supreme Court's ruling constitutes only a sliver of the mountains of testimony and documentary proof that the jury considered in finding him guilty of all 34 felony charges beyond a reasonable doubt,\" the prosecutors wrote.\n\nTodd Blanche, a lawyer for Mr. Trump, declined to comment on the district attorney's filing. But in a two-page letter to Justice Merchan on Thursday, he attacked \"the jury's flawed and unjust\" verdict, and argued that the prosecutors' filing contained several \"legal and factual misrepresentations.\"\n\nIn his letter, Mr. Blanche also criticized the district attorney for what he described as \"a desperate attempt to counter President Trump's arguments for total dismissal of the lawless indictment.\"\n\nThe dispute stems from the Supreme Court's July 1 decision in Mr. Trump's criminal case in Washington, where he is accused of plotting to overturn his 2020 election loss. The controversial ruling, which was decided 6 to 3 along partisan lines, held that a former president was \"entitled to at least presumptive immunity from prosecution for all his official acts.\"\n\nWithin hours of the ruling, Mr. Trump's lawyers in the Manhattan case asked Justice Merchan to delay the former president's sentencing in order to consider setting aside the verdict.\n\nThe judge agreed to rule on the verdict on Sept. 6, and postpone the sentencing in the meantime. If he ultimately sides with prosecutors and upholds the conviction, he will impose a sentence on Sept. 18.\n\nMr. Trump faces up to four years in prison, though Justice Merchan could sentence him to as little as a few weeks in jail, or even probation.\n\nThe case centered on a salacious set of facts about Mr. Trump's sex life and the great lengths he went to keep them under wraps. In late May, after a seven-week trial, a jury of 12 New Yorkers convicted Mr. Trump on all 34 felony counts of falsifying records to cover up a hush-money payment to a porn star, Stormy Daniels, in the final days of the 2016 campaign.\n\nMr. Trump's fixer at the time, Michael D. Cohen, paid Ms. Daniels $130,000 to bury her story of a sexual liaison with Mr. Trump. Mr. Trump repaid Mr. Cohen soon after ascending to the presidency, and approved plans to lie on company paperwork to hide the nature of the reimbursement, the jury found.\n\nIt is hardly Mr. Trump's only legal entanglement: He was indicted in three other jurisdictions last year. But Mr. Trump, the current Republican nominee for president, has thrown up a number of legal roadblocks, including the appeal to the Supreme Court in the Washington case.\n\nIn the Manhattan case -- the only one that will make it to trial before Election Day -- Mr. Trump has denied all wrongdoing and lashed out at the judge and Mr. Bragg, falsely portraying them as members of a Democratic cabal doing the bidding of the Biden administration.\n\n\"No president of the United States has ever been treated as unfairly and unlawfully as District Attorney Bragg has acted towards President Trump,\" Mr. Trump's lawyers wrote in a motion this month seeking to throw out the case.\n\nIn the filing, Mr. Trump's lawyers highlighted the trial testimony of two aides who worked for him when he was president, including Hope Hicks, his communications director. The testimony, the defense said, included mentions of \"official communications\" from the White House.\n\nIn one crucial portion of her testimony, Ms. Hicks told the jury about a discussion she had with Mr. Trump in the White House after the hush-money deal with Ms. Daniels came to light.\n\nMs. Hicks said that after The Wall Street Journal broke the story, she spoke to President Trump about \"how to respond.\"\n\nMr. Trump's lawyers also cited the testimony of Madeleine Westerhout, a former director of Oval Office operations, who told the jury about scheduling a February 2017 meeting between Mr. Trump and Mr. Cohen, during which Mr. Cohen says they discussed reimbursement for the hush-money payment.\n\nMs. Westerhout's testimony, the defense said, included \"observations of President Trump exercising presidential authority.\"\n\n\"Your Honor now has the authority to address these injustices, and the court is duty bound to do so in light of the Supreme Court's decision,\" they wrote to Justice Merchan.\n\nBut in response this week, Mr. Bragg's prosecutors emphasized that Ms. Hicks and Ms. Westerhout were testifying about personal conversations, not official acts taken by a president. A meeting that simply took place in the White House is not automatically an official act.\n\nMs. Hicks's testimony about her conversations with Mr. Trump, they said, concerned \"discussions related solely to unofficial conduct.\"\n\nThe prosecutors similarly stated that \"much of Westerhout's testimony involved details about how she helped defendant handle his private affairs -- unofficial conduct that is not subject to any claim of immunity.\" And they noted that Mr. Trump's lawyers had largely failed to object to Ms. Westerhout's testimony during the trial, a decision that might now preclude them from raising it after his conviction.\n\nMr. Trump, the prosecutors said, was also too slow to raise the immunity issue before the trial began. His lawyers did not do so until just days before the trial was set to start, prompting Justice Merchan to reject the bid as untimely and \"unjustifiable.\"\n\nIn the filing this week, the prosecutors also disputed Mr. Trump's claim that his tweets -- and other public statements made as president -- should be wiped from the record of the trial.\n\nThe statements were all already in the public record, the prosecutors noted, and the Supreme Court opinion noted that a \"prosecutor may point to the public record\" to illustrate an argument, even if it involves official acts.\n\nMr. Trump faces long odds, at least for now. Justice Merchan has appeared skeptical of the former president's immunity claims in the past, as has a federal judge, Alvin K. Hellerstein, who evaluated the case last year when Mr. Trump tried to move it to federal court.\n\nAlthough Mr. Trump's lawyers argued that the evidence centered on his official acts as president, Judge Hellerstein noted in his opinion that \"hush money paid to an adult film star is not related to a president's official acts.\"\n\n\"The evidence overwhelmingly suggests that the matter was a purely personal item of the president,\" he wrote, \"a cover-up of an embarrassing event.\"\n\nJonah E.

They specifically highlighted testimony from former White House aide Hope Hicks and tweets from Trump's Twitter account.\n\nHe is currently scheduled to be sentenced in September. The sentencing was delayed to allow arguments over the immunity issue.\n\nProsecutors with the Manhattan district attorney's office said the conviction should stand.\n\nThe district attorney's office argued that the crimes Trump was convicted of - falsifying business records to interfere in the 2016 presidential election - were not part of his \"official acts\" and that the Supreme Court's ruling on evidence does not apply to this case. They also noted that Trump's attorneys didn't raise objections during the trial to most of the evidence they now question, arguing they can't now challenge it after the trial.\n\n\"For all the pages that defendant devotes to his current motion, the evidence that he claims is affected by the Supreme Court's ruling constitutes only a sliver of the mountains of testimony and documentary proof that the jury considered in finding him guilty of all 34 felony charges beyond a reasonable doubt,\" prosecutors wrote.\n\n\"To the extent the Court concludes that any evidence of official presidential acts was improperly admitted at trial, defendant's request to set aside the verdict should be rejected on harmless-error grounds because the trial record contains overwhelming evidence of defendant's guilt,\" prosecutors wrote.\n\nThe district attorney's office argued that Trump's tweets introduced at trial also did not constitute officials acts, because the subject matter \"consists solely of 'unofficial acts' for which 'there is no immunity.'\"\n\n\"Defendant is wrong to claim that the recent Supreme Court decision would apply 'absolute immunity with respect to these Tweets,'\" prosecutors wrote. \"To the contrary, the Supreme Court specifically recognized that defendant could make public statements -- including Tweets -- 'in an unofficial capacity,' such as if he spoke 'as a candidate for office or party leader,' rather than as the President exercising his Article II powers.\"\n\nThey also downplayed the testimony from Hicks, who recalled for the jury a conversation she had with Trump in 2018. According to Hicks, Trump said it would have been bad for Stormy Daniels' allegations to have come out before the election.\n\nProsecutors said her testimony \"was merely confirmatory of the mountain of other evidence proving beyond any doubt that defendant sought to conceal both the fact of his sexual encounter with Daniels and the broader Trump Tower conspiracy.\"\n\nThe district attorney's office also argued that the indictment should not be dismissed because the grand jury did not rely on evidence of \"official acts.\"\n\nTrump's lawyers asked the judge overseeing the case for permission to file a response to the district attorney's filing.\n\nThe-CNN-Wire\n\n\u2122 & \u00a9 2024 Cable News Network, Inc., a Warner Bros.

Mr Trump's fixer at the time, Michael Cohen, paid Ms Daniels US$130,000 (S$174,000) to bury her story of a sexual liaison with Mr Trump.\n\nMr Trump repaid Mr Cohen soon after ascending to the presidency and approved plans to lie on company paperwork to hide the nature of the reimbursement, the jury found.\n\nIn a recent filing to the judge who presided over the Manhattan trial, Juan M. Merchan, Mr Trump's lawyers contended the Supreme Court's decision had invalidated at least some evidence presented in Manhattan, including the testimony of former White House employees and tweets Mr Trump sent as president. The Supreme Court had held that official acts could be inadmissible as evidence - even if a case concerned private misconduct.\n\nBut the district attorney, Alvin L. Bragg, fired back this week, arguing that the former president's lawyers had missed their window of opportunity to raise the immunity defence and then distorted the Supreme Court's ruling once it emerged.\n\nTodd Blanche, a lawyer for Mr Trump, declined to comment on the district attorney's filing. But in a two-page letter to Judge Merchan on July 25, he attacked \"the jury's flawed and unjust\" verdict and argued that the prosecutors' filing contained several \"legal and factual misrepresentations\".\n\nJudge Merchan agreed to rule on the verdict Sept 6. If he sides with prosecutors and upholds the conviction, he will impose a sentence on Sept 18. Mr Trump faces up to four years in prison, though Judge Merchan could sentence him to a few weeks in jail or even probation.

Daniels alleges she had a sexual encounter with Trump in 2006, which he denies. The former president has maintained his innocence, claiming the case was politically motivated.\n\nAfter the U.S. Supreme Court's bombshell ruling on July 1, which stated that former presidents have immunity for official acts conducted while in office, but not for unofficial acts, Trump's legal team moved to dismiss the indictment and vacate the jury's verdicts in the hush-money case.\n\nTrump's lawyers argued in a July 10 filing addressed to the New York court where the case was tried that the prosecution used evidence and testimony that the Supreme Court's July 1 ruling made off-limits, writing: \"Because of the implications for the institution of the Presidency, the use of official-acts evidence was a structural error under the federal Constitution that tainted [Bragg's] grand jury proceedings as well as the trial.\"\n\nBragg asked the court to reject Trump's request in his own brief on Thursday, arguing that the criminal charges relate to unofficial acts by Trump, which are not immune from prosecution.\n\nHe also argued that while the Supreme Court ruled that certain types of evidence related to presidents' official actions cannot be used against them, it does not apply to Trump's hush money case.\n\n\"For one thing, [Trump] failed to preserve an objection on immunity grounds to most of the evidence that is the subject of his current motion,\" Bragg wrote. \"And, in any event, all of the evidence that he complains of either concerned wholly unofficial conduct or, at most, official conduct for which any presumption of immunity has been rebutted.\"\n\nMoreover, Bragg wrote that even if all the evidence that Trump's team claims is now invalid had to be excluded, \"there would still need be no basis for disturbing the verdict because of the other overwhelming evidence of defendant's guilt,\" adding that the evidence in question is \"only a sliver of the mountains of testimony and documentary proof that the jury considered in finding him guilty of all 34 felony charges beyond a reasonable doubt.\"\n\nNewsweek reached out to Trump's lawyer on the case and Bragg's office via email for comment on Thursday afternoon.\n\nCNN legal analyst Norm Eisen, who served as a special counsel to the House Judiciary Committee during Trump's first impeachment, called Bragg's brief \"devastating\" for Trump on X, formerly Twitter, on Thursday afternoon.\n\nEisen previously argued on X that Trump's attempts to overturn his 34 felony convictions \"won't work,\" noting that the former president's lawyers already tried and failed to use the presidential immunity argument during pre-trial proceedings.", "source": {"uri": "newsweek.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Newsweek"}, "authors": [{"uri": "rachel_dobkin@newsweek.com", "name": "Rachel Dobkin", "type":

But he failed to object during trial to four of the six. You can't say he didn't know about the issue bc he DID object to the other two!\" Eisen wrote.\n\nThe day after the Supreme Court's ruling, former Department of Justice official Chuck Rosenberg commented that he didn't think a Trump appeal was going to work.\n\n\"I mean, if you look at the Supreme Court's decision from yesterday, ... the conduct that underlined in the New York case seems to me to be purely private,\" he pointed out. \"So perhaps Judge Merchan grants them a hearing, but I have a hard time imagining that they would prevail on it.\"\n\nJurors convicted Trump in May on 34 counts of falsifying business records around hush money he paid to actress and director Stormy Daniels to cover up a tryst they'd had years prior.

Chief Justice John Roberts, writing the majority opinion, also stipulated that communications between a president and his aides cannot be probed for the purposes of determining whether an act was official.\n\nHours after that ruling on July 1, attorneys representing former President Trump in his Manhattan case asked New York Supreme Court Justice Juan Merchan to throw out the indictment and guilty verdict, arguing communications between President Trump and his aides had been used as evidence before a grand jury that returned the indictment and a jury that returned a guilty verdict.\n\nThe district attorney is arguing that all criminal charges in this case \"stem from defendant's 'unofficial acts' -- conduct for which 'there is no immunity.'\"\n\nDefense attorneys had raised presidential immunity objections to Ms. Hicks's testimony, and Justice Merchan had overruled the objections. The defense had also objected during Ms. Westerhout's testimony, but not specifically citing presidential immunity.\n\nProsecutors had also shown several social media posts made by President Trump during his time in office, some directly addressing allegations after his former attorney Michael Cohen was charged for financial crimes.\n\nDefense attorneys had objected to the admission of these quotes, but not on the basis of presidential immunity.\n\nProsecutors argue defendants failed to preserve a record of objections based on immunity for official acts, and this \"precludes this Court from considering any claim to vacate his conviction.\"\n\nPrior to the trial, attorneys for President Trump did file a presidential immunity motion. Justice Merchan had dismissed the motion, ruling that defense attorneys could make individual objections against the admission of specific evidence during the trial and that he did not believe the motion was filed in good faith. The judge had faulted defendants for not raising presidential immunity earlier, including during an attempt to remove the case to federal court.\n\nThe 34 records are 11 checks to Mr. Cohen and their corresponding invoices and vouchers, including one repeated record after the initial one was lost. Prosecutors argue that the grand jury record establishes that these are business records, that they contain false entries, that former President Trump caused or made the entries, and that he \"acted with intent to defraud.\"\n\n\"Even excluding all of the evidence defendant belatedly identifies as immune, the grand jury record is easily sufficient to support the indictment,\" the brief reads.\n\nJustice Merchan has scheduled former President Trump's sentencing in the case to Sept. 18. The judge is expected to issue a ruling on the presidential immunity arguments by then.", "source": {"uri": "theepochtimes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "www.theepochtimes.com"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Absolute_immunity", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Absolute immunity"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sovereign_immunity", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Sovereign immunity"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Criminal_procedure", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Criminal procedure"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supreme_Court_of_the_United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Supreme Court of the United States"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Roberts", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "John Roberts"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Majority_opinion", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Majority opinion"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_County_District_Attorney", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "New York County District Attorney"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_Supreme_Court", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "New York Supreme Court"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indictment", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Indictment"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manhattan", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Manhattan"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Manhattan"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Juan_Merchan", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Juan Merchan"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Cohen_(lawyer)", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Michael Cohen (lawyer)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grand_jury", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Grand jury"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/District_attorney", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "District attorney"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lawyer", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Lawyer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_media", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Social media"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_judiciary_of_the_United_States", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Federal judiciary of the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fraud", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Fraud"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Defendant", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Defendant"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Law/Legal_Information", "label": "dmoz/Society/Law/Legal Information", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Crime_and_Justice", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Crime and Justice", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Trials", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Trials", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Law/Courts", "label": "dmoz/Society/Law/Courts", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Law", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Law", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 86}], "image": "https://img.theepochtimes.com/assets/uploads/2024/06/04/id5662612-Trump_Hush_Money_24151832349575-1080x720.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9764268", "eventUri": "eng-9764268", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-07-01", "textStart": 712, "textEnd": 718}, {"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-09-18", "textStart": 3094, "textEnd": 3102}], "sentiment": 0.09019607843137245, "wgt": 157, "relevance": 1}

The court filing from July 24, made public on Thursday, highlights the distinction between Trump's personal conduct and his presidential responsibilities.\n\nThe conviction, stemming from Trump's falsification of business records related to hush money paid to Stormy Daniels, hinges on purely personal matters, according to prosecutors. Trump's defense lawyers argue that evidence of his official acts was improperly used during the trial, but legal experts believe Judge Juan Merchan is unlikely to overturn the verdict.\n\nProsecutors emphasized that even if some evidence pertained to official acts, the conviction should stand due to abundant proof of Trump's guilt. Merchan is expected to decide on Trump's arguments by September 6 and, if the conviction is upheld, the case will proceed to sentencing.", "source": {"uri": "devdiscourse.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Devdiscourse"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manhattan", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Manhattan"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Manhattan"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supreme_Court_of_the_United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Supreme Court of the United States"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Juan_Merchan", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Juan Merchan"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stormy_Daniels", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Stormy Daniels"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hush_money", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Hush money"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Law/Legal_Information", "label": "dmoz/Society/Law/Legal Information", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Crime_and_Justice", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Crime and Justice", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Trials", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Trials", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Law/Courts", "label": "dmoz/Society/Law/Courts", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Law", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Law", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 47}], "image": "https://www.devdiscourse.com/remote.axd?https://devdiscourse.blob.core.windows.net/devnews/25_07_2024_09_40_46_919239.jpg?width=920&format=jpeg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9764268", "eventUri": "eng-9764268", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-07-24", "textStart": 545, "textEnd": 552}, {"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-09-06", "textStart": 1244, "textEnd": 1255}], "sentiment": -0.09019607843137256, "wgt": 156, "relevance": 1}

Trump would have been convicted despite any official-act evidence, they argue.\n\nManhattan prosecutors are fighting to keep Donald Trump's September 18 hush-money sentencing on track, saying in a new filing Thursday that it was \"harmless error\" if evidence he's now immune from entered the case.\n\nTrump's recent US Supreme Court immunity victory \"has no bearing on this prosecution,\" lawyers for District Attorney Alvin Bragg argue in a 69-page court filing.\n\n\"That holding has no bearing here because, as defendant does not dispute, the charges in this case all involve purely personal conduct, rather than official presidential acts,\" the filing says.\n\nBut Trump would have been indicted and convicted even if evidence the defense calls \"official\" were removed, the filing adds.\n\nTrump was indicted in April, 2023, and convicted in May, 2024, on 34 felony counts of falsifying business records. Trump falsified 34 Trump Organization records throughout 2018 in order to hide hush money he paid to porn actor Stormy Daniels as part of a conspiracy to illegally influence the 2016 election.\n\nThe DA's filing is a response to defense arguments that prosecutorial immunity voids not just his conviction, but the hush-money indictment in its entirety. The SCOTUS decision found that using official-act evidence in prosecuting a current or former president violates their constitutional rights.\n\nThe defense argued the grand jurors who voted to indict Trump and the trial jurors who voted to convict him were all shown significant evidence involving Trump's official acts, and that this evidence is now retroactively inadmissible.\n\nDonald Trump at his arraignment, with Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg seated behind him. Foto: Reuters/Jane Rosenberg\n\nOn Thursday, Bragg responded in papers signed by Matthew Colangelo, an assistant district attorney who was a lead prosecutor on the case.\n\nThe filing argues that Trump is wrong in now stamping much of the prosecutor's case \"official act evidence.\"\n\nThe defense is challenging four incriminating 2018 tweets shown to jurors from Trump's personal Twitter account, in which he referred private payments to Daniels by his then-personal attorney, Michael Cohen. But these tweets describe unofficial acts unrelated to Trump's official duties, and for which he has no immunity, the prosecution filing now argues.\n\n\"Trump was not performing, or even describing, any official presidential act in conveying his personal opinions about his personal attorney and a private nondisclosure agreement entered into prior to his Presidency,\" the filing says of the four tweets. \"No Presidential decision-making was involved.\"\n\nThe defense is also challenging trial testimony by Hope Hicks, Trump's former White House communications director, who described an incriminating 2018 Oval Office conversation in which Trump expressed relief that Daniels' claims to a one-night sexual encounter surfaced only after the 2016 election.\n\nBut this conversation again involved a hush-money scheme that \"was entirely personal and largely committed before the election, and it had no relationship whatsoever to any official duty of the presidency,\" the prosecution filing continues.\n\nAdditional challenged evidence -- an incriminating government ethics form Trump signed in 2018, and snippets of trial testimony by Cohen and by Madeleine Westerhout, Trump's former White House assistant -- all likewise concerned private, not presidential, matters, prosecutors argue.\n\nBut even if the challenged evidence was removed from the trial, \"the error was harmless in light of the overwhelming evidence of defendant's guilt,\" the filing argues.\n\nAs for tossing the underlying indictment -- a move that would take Trump off the hook entirely -- the prosecution filing argues that Trump would have been indicted even without what the defense calls \"official act\" evidence.\n\nThe submission of some inadmissible evidence during the grand jury presentation \"is held to be fatal only when the remaining legal evidence is insufficient to sustain the indictment,\" the filing says, quoting caselaw from 1996.\n\nStill, \"the indictment in this case was not 'based on' any evidence of immune conduct,\" prosecutors argue.\n\nLawyers for Trump did not immediately respond to requests for comment on the prosecution filing.\n\nThe trial judge, state Supreme Court Justice Juan Merchan, has said he will issue a written decision on September 6 on whether the indictment and conviction survive this challenge.\n\nIf they do, Trump will be sentenced September 18 as planned, the judge has said.\n\nRead the original article on Business Insider", "source": {"uri": "businessinsider.nl", "dataType": "news", "title": "Business Insider

Additionally, prosecutors cited four tweets sent by then-president Trump said to have been in service of the campaign.\n\nA defense pre-trial motion sought to exclude evidence of that alleged campaign -- arguing it implicated Trump's official acts. The state opposed that motion and the court denied it as untimely.\n\nOther relevant evidence included testimony elicited from Trump's former communications director, Hope Hicks, and former Trump White House official Madeleine Westerhout.\n\nDuring trial, the state moved to use the evidence. The defense objected. Justice Juan Merchan, who is still in charge of the case and will decide the motion to dismiss, partially deferred ruling on the issue -- instructing Trump's team to use objections during trial but declining to bar the evidence but only allowing the state to use such evidence in a limited way.\n\nWhen it came time for the two sides to either use the evidence or lodge objections, the state was more willing while the defense was mostly mum, Bragg's motion argues.\n\n\"As trial proceeded, defendant objected twice to the admission of evidence regarding defendant's purportedly official acts as President,\" the filing argues. Defendant did not raise any objection based on his purportedly official acts to the testimony of Michael Cohen or Madeleine Westerhout, nor did he raise any such objection to the admission of four statements posted to his Twitter account while he was President.\"\n\nBut Bragg's effort does not hang its hat on procedural heft.\n\nEngaging with the merits of Trump's immunity argument, the elected prosecutor argues, \"all of the evidence\" cited in the motion to dismiss \"either concerned wholly unofficial conduct or, at most, official conduct for which any presumption of immunity has been rebutted.\"\n\nTrump also claims a more fundamental problem -- that the official acts evidence infects the indictment itself because it was presented during the grand jury process. Included here are allegations that the state improperly used a few references to David Pecker, 72, the onetime CEO of the National Enquirer's parent company, American Media Inc. in laying out their case for grand jurors.\n\nAgain, Bragg's office takes issue with that line of thought.\n\n\"[T]he evidence defendant claims was erroneously presented to the grand jury is not entitled to any protection on a claim of presidential immunity,\" the state's motion goes on. \"The grand jury testimony from Hicks, Pecker, and Cohen, as well as the four Tweets defendant issued while serving as President, all reflect unofficial conduct and are admissible.\"\n\nThe state also argues the holding of the nation's high court is irrelevant to what happened in the Big Apple.\n\n\"For all the pages that defendant devotes to his current motion, the evidence that he claims is affected by the Supreme Court's ruling constitutes only a sliver of the mountains of testimony and documentary proof that the jury considered in finding him guilty of all 34 felony charges beyond a reasonable doubt,\" Bragg argues in summary. \"Under these circumstances, there is no basis for disturbing the jury's verdict, and defendant's motion should be denied.\"", "source": {"uri": "lawandcrime.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Law & Crime"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

Image via Shutterstock.\n\nManhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg's office just submitted its official response to the Supreme Court of the United States' immunity decision from earlier this month, and argues that his 34 felony convictions should still apply.\n\nIn a 69-page filing, Bragg and his team of prosecutors painstakingly laid out how former President Donald Trump being granted broad criminal immunity for official acts by SCOTUS doesn't change his late May conviction by a New York jury. Bragg argued that the crimes Trump committed in the lead-up to the 2016 presidential election are not tied to any official acts he took as president, and that no evidence prosecutors introduced ran significantly afoul of SCOTUS' immunity boundaries laid out in the Trump v. United States decision.\n\nBragg referred to a practice known as \"harmless-error analysis\" in which a criminal conviction can still be upheld despite a \"harmless error\" by a judge overseeing a criminal trial if that error is not rooted in bias or not significant enough to merit a reversal -- like the admission of evidence later found to be admitted erroneously. A harmless error is different than a reversible error, as a reversible error requires a conviction be overturned while a harmless error does not.\n\nREAD MORE: 'Not very difficult': Former federal prosecutor explains how Alvin Bragg can convict Trump\n\n\"Like New York's courts, the U.S. Supreme Court 'repeatedly has held' that 'errors such as mistaken admission of evidence' are not 'immune from harmless-error analysis,'\" Bragg wrote. \"And, as particularly relevant here, the Supreme Court has applied harmless-error review even when the improperly admitted evidence involved 'conduct that was not criminal when the defendant engaged in that conduct.'\"\n\n\"If a reviewing court can determine whether it was harmless to introduce evidence of conduct for which a defendant could not have been prosecuted because it was not a crime, then the same must be true for evidence of conduct for which a defendant could not have been prosecuted because of immunity,\" he continued. \"Under both New York and federal law, harmless-error analysis is unavailable for only extremely narrow categories of errors -- none of which include the erroneous introduction of evidence.\"\n\nIt's unclear how Judge Juan Merchan will rule given that the evidence compiled by the grand jury that led to Trump's indictment is still under seal, according to Business Insider legal correspondent Jacob Shamsian. While he opined that the harmless-error analysis could \"cinch\" Bragg's case that the convictions should be upheld, the fact that the evidence has not been made public remains a wild card.\n\n\"[W]e can't evaluate whether it would have violated the Supreme Court's immunity ruling -- based on the public record, at least,\" Shamsian tweeted.\n\nREAD MORE: 'There's going to be a criminal conviction': Ex-Trump attorney predicts guilty verdict in NY\n\nTrump was initially going to be sentenced for his 34 felony convictions on July 11 after being found guilty on all counts in late May. After SCOTUS' 6-3 ruling in the former president's favor in Trump v. United States, Merchan pushed sentencing back to September 18 in order to allow for time to review how the immunity decision may impact the verdict.\n\nAt the core of the case was Trump's role in orchestrating hush money payments to multiple women who claimed to have had affairs with him (Trump has denied the affairs) in order to prevent them from sharing their stories with the media ahead of the 2016 election. Bragg argued in his indictment that the payments -- which were illegally labeled as legal expenses to his then-attorney, Michael Cohen -- constituted illegal campaign contributions, as they were done to advance his political goals.\n\nWhen he took the witness stand, Cohen testified that he made the payments to adult film star Stormy Daniels and former Playboy model Karen McDougal, and that Trump reimbursed him for those payments by calling the reimbursement a legal retainer. Cohen maintained there was no legal retainer and that the reimbursements were for the hush money payments.", "source": {"uri": "alternet.org", "dataType": "news", "title": "Alternet.org"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harmless_error", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Harmless error"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_County_District_Attorney", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "New York County District Attorney"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Legal_immunity", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Legal immunity"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supreme_Court_of_the_United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Supreme Court of the United States"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alvin_Bragg", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Alvin Bragg"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reversible_error", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Reversible error"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Defendant", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Defendant"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2016_United_States_presidential_election", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "2016 United States presidential election"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_(state)", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "New York (state)"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Criminal_procedure", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Criminal procedure"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conviction", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Conviction"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Felony", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Felony"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_law", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Federal law"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Attorney", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United States Attorney"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Juan_Merchan", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Juan Merchan"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indictment_of_Donald_Trump", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Indictment of Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Cohen_(lawyer)", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Michael Cohen (lawyer)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Karen_McDougal", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Karen McDougal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stormy_Daniels", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Stormy Daniels"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Under_seal", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Under seal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hush_money", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Hush money"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Playboy", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Playboy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Business_Insider", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Business Insider"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grand_jury", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Grand jury"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indictment", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Indictment"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twitter", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Twitter"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Law/Legal_Information", "label": "dmoz/Society/Law/Legal Information", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Crime_and_Justice", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Crime and Justice", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Trials", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Trials", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Law", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Law", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 80}], "image": "https://www.alternet.org/media-library/image.jpg?id=51742330&width=1200&height=600&coordinates=0%2C83%2C0%2C83", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9764268", "eventUri": "eng-9764268", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-07-11", "textStart": 3091, "textEnd": 3098}, {"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-09-18", "textStart": 3269, "textEnd": 3281}, {"amb": false, "date": "2018-04-", "textStart": 51, "textEnd": 59}], "sentiment": -0.01960784313725494, "wgt": 138, "relevance": 1}

Become an Insider and start reading now. Have an account? Log in.\n\n\"That holding has no bearing here because, as defendant does not dispute, the charges in this case all involve purely personal conduct, rather than official presidential acts,\" the filing says.\n\nTrump was indicted in April, 2023, and convicted in May, 2024, on 34 counts of falsifying business records in order to hide hush money he paid to porn actor Stormy Daniels as part of a conspiracy to illegally influence the 2016 election.\n\nThe DA's filing is a response to defense arguments that prosecutorial immunity voids not just his conviction, but the hush-money indictment in its entirety. The SCOTUS decision found that using official-act evidence against the president is against the former president's constitutional rights.\n\nThe defense argued the grand jurors who voted to indict Trump and the trial jurors who voted to convict him in the hush-money case were all shown significant evidence involving Trump's official acts, and that this evidence is now retroactively inadmissible.\n\nOn Thursday, Bragg responded in papers signed by Matthew Colangelo, an assistant district attorney who was a lead prosecutor on the case.\n\nThe filing argues that Trump is wrong in now stamping much of the prosecutor's case \"official act evidence.\"\n\nThe jury saw four incriminating 2018 tweets from Trump's personal Twitter campaign, in which he referred private payments to Daniels by his then-personal attorney, Michael Cohen. These tweets describe unofficial acts unrelated to his official duties, and for which Trump has no immunity, the filing argues.\n\nIn tweeting, \"Trump was not performing, or even describing, any official presidential act in conveying his personal opinions about his personal attorney and a private nondisclosure agreement entered into prior to his Presidency,\" the filing says. \"No Presidential decision-making was involved.\"\n\nThe jury also heard testimony by Hope Hicks, Trump's former White House communications director, who described an incriminating 2018 conversation in the Oval Office in which Trump expressed relief that Daniels' claims to a one-night sexual encounter surfaced only after, not before the 2016 election.\n\nBut this conversation again involved a hush-money scheme that \"was entirely personal and largely committed before the election, and it had no relationship whatsoever to any official duty of the presidency,\" the prosecution filing continues.\n\nAdditional challenged evidence -- an incriminating government ethics form Trump signed in 2018, and snippets of trial testimony by Cohen and by Madeleine Westerhout, Trump's former White House assistant -- all likewise concerned private, not presidential, matters, the filing says.\n\nBut even if all or any of the challenged evidence were removed from the trial, \"the error was harmless in light of the overwhelming evidence of defendant's guilt,\" the filing argues.\n\nAs for tossing the underlying indictment -- a move that would take Trump off the hook entirely -- the papers argue that Trump would have been indicted even if grand jurors did not see what the defense calls \"official act\" evidence.\n\nThe submission of some inadmissible evidence during the grand jury presentation \"is held to be fatal only when the remaining legal evidence is insufficient to sustain the indictment,\" the filing says, quoting caselaw from 1996.\n\nThat, too, was not the case, the filing argues.\n\n\"The indictment in this case was not 'based on' any evidence of immune conduct,\" it argues.\n\nInstead, it argues, grand jurors relied on Trump Organization records and related testimony, evidence that showed Trump falsified business records to hide hush-money payments to porn actor Stormy Daniels as part of a conspiracy to influence the 2016 election.\n\nLawyers for Trump did not immediately respond to requests for comment on the prosecution filing.\n\nThe trial judge, state Supreme Court Justice Juan Merchan, has said he will issue a written decision on September 6 on whether the indictment and conviction survive this challenge.\n\nIf they do, Trump will be sentenced September 18 as planned, the judge has said.", "source": {"uri": "businessinsider.com", "dataType":

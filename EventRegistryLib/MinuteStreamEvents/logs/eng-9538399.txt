Vietnamese volunteers and experts continued to unite and stand side by side with Lao officers, soldiers and people to fight and shatter the invasion ambition of the imperialists and their henchmen, winning many victories in the campaigns of Luang Namtha province (1962), Nambak (1968), Meuang Soui, Kukiet and Lam Son 719 (1971), and Xieng Khouang - Plain of Jars.\n\nTo support Vietnamese soldiers in completing the historic mission of liberating the South and reunifying the country, the Lao People's Revolutionary Party and the Central Committee of the Lao Patriotic Front also created favourable conditions to open the Ho Chi Minh Trail through Laos to transport personnel and military supplies for many years, thereby making an important contribution to the common victory of the two peoples of Laos and Vietnam, Chansamone Chanyalath said.\n\nOn April 30, 1975, the south of Vietnam was completely liberated. In coordination with the victory of the Vietnamese people, Laos launched an uprising campaign to seize power nationwide on August 23, 1975, abolishing the old monarchy and establishing the new regime of the Lao People's Democratic Republic on December 2, 1975.\n\nThe Lao Deputy PM went on to say that in the context of complex and unpredictable changes in the international and regional situations, the two countries need to strengthen and deepen their great friendship, special solidarity, and comprehensive cooperation.\n\nIt is necessary to maintain education for the young and future generations to have a deep understanding of the history of the time-tested relations so that they will continue to preserve, cultivate, and promote this relationship, he added./.\n\nPublic screening of documentaries marking Dien Bien Phu Victory opens in Hanoi\n\nA documentary film screening programme to celebrate the 70th anniversary of the Dien Bien Phu Victory (May 7, 1954 - 2024) opened in Hanoi on May 3 by the National Documentary and Scientific Film Studio Co.

It also aimed to instill patriotism and national pride in younger generations.\n\nSpeaking at the ceremony, Russian Ambassador to Vietnam G.S. Bezdetko reiterated the significant contributions of Vietnamese soldiers, who stood shoulder to shoulder with the Soviet people during the years of 1941-1945, stressing that their names have been immortalised at the Memory Lane museum complex in Moscow, Russia.\n\nThe diplomat also expressed his appreciation for the sacrifices and losses endured by the Vietnamese people in their struggles for national liberation and reunification, which paved the way for historic triumphs like the Dien Bien Phu Victory (May 7, 1954) and the liberation of South Vietnam and national reunification (April 30, 1975).\n\nPermanent Vice President of the Vietnam-Russia Friendship Association Trinh Quoc Khanh highlighted the longstanding relationship shared between the former Soviet Union and the current Russian Federation with Vietnam.\n\nDuring the Great Patriotic War, the Soviet people suffered immense losses to repel fascism, and standing side by side with them in the fight to defend Moscow were Vietnamese volunteer soldiers. In Vietnam's resistance against the US, many Soviet experts were present, assisting the Vietnamese people in their fight against imperialism and colonialism.\n\nThe deep and respected tradition between the two nations needs to be preserved, he noted.\n\nVietnam, Ivory Coast further deepen friendship, cooperation\n\nSecretary of the Communist Party of Vietnam (CPV) Central Committee and Chairman of the CPV Central Committee's Commission for External Relations Le Hoai Trung hosted a reception in Hanoi on May 3 for a delegation from the Rally of Houphou\u00ebtists for Democracy and Peace (RHDP), the ruling Party of Ivory Coast.\n\nThe delegation, led by Sahy Claude Soumahoro, member of the RHDP's Standing Committee and Deputy Secretary in charge of communication and external relations, is on the first visit to Vietnam on the occasion of the 70th anniversary of the Dien Bien Phu Victory.\n\nTrung congratulated Ivory Coast on its achievements in maintaining a peaceful and stable environment and becoming one of the world's fastest growing economies.\n\nHe believed that under the leadership of the RHDP, Ivory Coast's reform efforts will continue to succeed, further improving the lives of its citizens.\n\nVietnam values its friendship and cooperation with the RHDP and Ivory Coast, he said.\n\nTrung also discussed several major directions to develop relations between the two Parties and two countries across various sectors.\n\nSoumahoro, who is also Chief of Staff for Civil Affairs in the Office of the President of Ivory Coast, hailed the Dien Bien Phu Victory's significant contributions to the global liberation movement, including in Africa.He expressed his admiration for the great and historic achievements that Vietnam has attained in nearly 40 years of renewal under the leadership of the CPV, with General Secretary Nguyen Phu Trong at the helm.\n\nHe stressed that the RHDP and Ivory Coast expect to foster their ties with the Party and State of Vietnam through sharing experiences and learning from each other in Party building and national development, thereby further deepening the long-standing friendship and cooperation between the two nations for the benefit of their people.\n\nRussian scholar highlights Vietnam's bravery in Dien Bien Phu Campaign\n\nThe strength of the Vietnamese army in the Dien Bien Phu battle came from wisdom, ingenuity, and bravery, a professor from the Saint Petersburg State University of Russia said about the Dien Bien Phu Victory 70 years ago (May 7, 1954).\n\nIn an interview granted to the Vietnam News Agency, Prof. Vladimir Kolotov, head of the Ho Chi Minh Institute at the Saint Petersburg State University, said that in the Dien Bien Phu Campaign, the Vietnamese army had to fight against a stronger, larger, and more modern military, and the commander of the Vietnamese army then - General Vo Nguyen Giap - made use of ingenuity to find out a way to defeat French colonialists.\n\nHe noted basing on the principle of \"knowing yourself and knowing the enemy, in a hundred battles you will never be defeated\", General Giap, an excellent disciple of President Ho Chi Minh, brainstormed a stratagem for beating the enemy.\n\nKolotov laid a particular emphasis on political struggle as the secret weapon of General Giap, who set up a force of commissars for explaining the justice of Vietnam's fight so as to persuade and give encouragement to soldiers and people. Thanks to that, the Vietnamese army, from zero, became one securing respect from any enemy.\n\nAnother source of the Vietnamese army's strength was bravery, which could be seen in not only battles but also in the preparations for the campaign from 1953, the Russian scholar noted.\n\nHe said every 10 soldiers on the battlefield needed up to a hundred people working in the rear to provide support to them. Facing tough conditions in the midst of mountains and forests and the request for absolute secrecy, Vietnamese soldiers transported all ammunitions to the battlefield on pack-bikes and their own shoulders during nighttime. Food and the injured were also transported safely.\n\nThis reflected extraordinary preparations for the campaign, he went on.\n\nThe professor held that the Dien Bien Phu Victory created a turning point for the war that resulted in the signing of the 1954 Geneva Accords on the cessation of hostilities in Vietnam, heralding a new chapter in Vietnam's struggle for national liberation and reunification.\n\nWith this victory, Vietnam became an example for many oppressed nations around the world and a source of encouragement for other countries on the path to national liberation, according to Kolotov.\n\nVietnam considers Peru a leading partner in region\n\nVietnam attaches importance to strengthening relations with Peru, a leading partner in the region, Foreign Minister Bui Thanh Son told his Peruvian counterpart Javier Gonzalez Olaechea in Paris on May 2.\n\nMeeting the Peruvian diplomat on the sidelines of the 2024 OECD Ministerial Council Meeting (MCM), Son said Vietnam appreciates positive developments in relations with Peru in recent times, noting bilateral trade is continuously increasing, making Peru one of Vietnam's top five important economic partners in the region.\n\nSon thanked the Government and people of Peru for donating the COVID-19 vaccine, helping Vietnam soon overcome the pandemic and recover the economy.\n\nDiscussing measures to further promote bilateral relations, the two sides agreed to organize activities in celebration of the 30th anniversary of the establishment of diplomatic relations between Vietnam and Peru (1994 - 2024).\n\nThe two sides will maintain the exchange of high-level delegations, and strengthen coordination and mutual support within the framework of the United Nations, Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD), Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC), and Comprehensive and Progressive Agreement for Trans-Pacific Partnership (CPTTP), contributing to the success of the 2024 APEC Economic Leaders' Summit hosted by Peru in November 2024.\n\nThe two Ministers expected to further enhance the friendship and multi-faceted cooperation, especially in politics, diplomacy, trade and investment between the two countries, and at the same time seek solutions to iron out snags in economic relations.\n\nThey also agreed to effectively deploy cooperation mechanisms, and strengthen the signing and implementation of specialized cooperation agreements to promote multifaceted cooperation between the two countries.\n\nHa Long Bay's tourism strongly rebounds\n\nHa Long Bay in the northern province of Quang Ninh has seen robust tourism recovery, sparking hopes that the bay's tourism revenue would return to pre-COVID-19 pandemic levels.\n\nAccording to the Ha Long Bay Management Board, the bay welcomed around one million tourists, including 810,949 foreign arrivals, in the first four months of this year. Ticket sales for the bay earned an estimated VND321.8 billion (USD12.91 million) between January and April.\n\nHa Long Bay served 84,744 travellers, including 26,526 foreigners, during the five-day Reunification Day (April 30) and May Day holiday.\n\nHa Long has seen a surge in foreign arrivals, mainly from South Korea, India, Malaysia, and Europe.\n\nHa Long Bay's tourism revenue could surpass this year's target of VND800 billion and reach a record-high revenue of nearly VND1.2 trillion in 2019.\n\nQuang Ninh wants to attract 17 million travellers this year. The province has launched many new tourism products for Ha Long and Bai Tu Long bays.\n\nHa Long Bay served 2.69 million tourists and earned VND792 billion last year.\n\nCan Tho riverbank erosion increases\n\nThe Mekong Delta City of Can Tho has faced more erosion along rivers and canals, damaging many houses.\n\nCan Tho has reported eight cases of erosion in April alone. The latest incidents damaged more than 20 houses, causing losses of around VND12 billion (USD472,441).\n\nOn April 29, four consecutive erosion sites occurred in Can Tho City with two in Thoi Thuan District and two in Phong Dien District.\n\nOn April 30, three houses by Thot Not River in Thot Not District collapsed due to erosion which is around 100 metres long. Authorities of Thot Not District supported VND30 million for the affected households.\n\nLast year, roughly 1,000 cork trees were planted to prevent erosion along rivers in Can Tho.\n\nThe major reasons for the erosion in Can Tho have been changes in water flow at bends in rivers and canals, weak banks, illegal construction of infrastructure and houses along banks, use of boats, excessive sand extraction and reduced sediment deposits in the Mekong River.\n\nDong Nai food poisoning victims rise to nearly 500\n\nThe number of people hospitalised after eating banh mi sandwiches at a bakery in the southern province of Dong Nai has risen to 481 including five critical cases.\n\nAccording to the Dong Nai Health Department, as of 11am May 3, hospitals in Dong Nai had received 469 patients, including 12 children, with similar food poisoning symptoms.\n\n\"All the victims had banh mi sandwiches at the Bang Bakery in Xuan Binh Ward between 3-7 pm on April 30,\" the department said. \"After that, they started to develop high fevers, stomach aches, diarrhoea, and vomiting and had to be hospitalised.\n\nFive children treated at the Dong Nai Children's Hospital are in critical condition and two of them have received hemofiltration.\n\nDoctors at the Long Khanh General Hospital said that they admitted 321 of these food poisoning cases, and all the victims had gastroenteritis, and many were recovering after treatment.\n\nThe bakery that sold over 1,100 banh mi sandwiches on April 30 has been closed for investigation since May 1.\n\nLast year, nearly 300 people had food poisoning after eating banh mi sandwiches at the well-known Madam Phuong Bakery shop in Hoi An Province.\n\nThe Vietnamese banh mi baguette, filled with cold meats, p\u00e2t\u00e9, and

At the bottom of the valley is the best of the French army. The valley is surrounded by mountains. And we are there and the French will never get out.\"\n\nJust by that simple way Uncle Ho was able to rally all the people, and that was how Vietnam won the battle, Burchett said.\n\nThe wide anti-war movements then also had an important role to play in completing annihilation of the French aggressive expeditionary force, he said, and that the global imperialist power with the strongest army and support from its ally could not overpower the Vietnamese people's great will and desire for unification, independence and freedom.\n\nShowing us a picture of his father in Vietnamese outfit visiting a revolutionary base in the north, he said international peace-lovers like his father contributed their voice, calling for the world to support Vietnam.\n\n\"Right after the meeting with President Ho Chi Minh, my father sent his first cable to the world, in which he expressed his firm belief that Vietnam would win the Dien Bien Phu battle\" Burchett said.\n\n\"The action now taking place at Dien Bien Phu is the most tragic failure for French arms in the whole disastrous fiasco of the Navarre Plan to crush the people of Vietnam\", George read his father's lines.\n\nMy father felt very proud to be part of the world's movement to support Vietnam to win the heroic battle for independence, liberty and union.\n\nPeople's war key to Dien Bien Phu victory: scholars\n\nIn a similar vein, Carl Thayer, Emeritus Professor at the University of New South Wales (Canberra), told Vietnam News Agency that the Dien Bien Phu campaign proved the efficacy of the people's war through mobilisation of the whole population to oppose foreign aggression.\n\nIn his letter sent to soldiers on March 11, 1954, then President Ho Chi Minh said the fighting against French was very difficult but also very glorious. He expressed his firm belief that the soldiers would bring into play all the accumulated will and strength to overcome hardship and fulfill their glorious duty to the nation.\n\nDuring the Dien Bien Phu Campaign, tens of thousands of people engaged in transporting food supplies to the front or building the road for moving the artillery to the battle. Thayer said a regular armed forces supported by military assistance from fraternal countries was also a very important factor in Vietnam's Dien Bien Phu victory.\n\nTens of thousands of people engage in transporting food supplies to the front or building the road for moving the artillery to the battle. (File Photo)\n\nMeanwhile, in an interview with Vietnam News Agency, Professor Piere Aselin from Hawaii Pacific University, USA held that the Dien Bien Phu Campaign from March 13 to May 7, 1954 demonstrated the importance of working together and acting together to gain independence.\n\n\"As a historian, I see one of the keys to victory was the leadership and the organisation. There was always a very high level of discipline within the Communist Party and the armed forces\".\n\nIt is not easy to get men, women, ethnic minority groups, Catholics and Buddhists to come together but the Vietnamese Party and President Ho Chi Minh were able to do so very well, he said.\n\nAselin said General Vo Nguyen Giap was a military genius and that his strategic ability and astute tactics helped Vietnam win the war against the invader whose resources were much bigger than those of his peasant army. Giap changed the theme of the Dien Bien Phu contest when the battle had already begun.\n\n\"At first, it had been his intention to get it over quickly and orders were issued accordingly. However, he thought it through, decided he could not afford to take chances, rapid attack would not guarantee complete success, and that's why he shifted the guiding principle to \"advance cautiously, strike surely\".\n\nToday in Vietnam, you talk a lot about bamboo diplomacy and I really think General Giap applied his bamboo strategy in the battle that helped the peasant army defeat the colonists.\n\nSeventy years have passed, Vietnam has shone bright as a country of peace, bliss and robust development. It has carved out significant achievements with its bamboo diplomacy, in which it stays steadfast and unyielding on basic principles but flexible in the ways and means to achieve strategic objectives, Professor Thayer said.\n\nAs for painter Burchett, who is half Australian and half Bulgarian but always identifies himself as Vietnamese, he has chosen living for good in Vietnam, the place where he was born.

What the Vietnamese people did and the victories they achieved were truly extraordinary.\n\nHe affirmed that the Dien Bien Phu Victory of Vietnam contributed to awakening other peoples who were submerged by colonialism by proving that the power of colonialism could be completely defeated, that if a nation is determined to achieve the goal of self-liberation, it can achieve that goal. The colonised peoples at that time admired the Dien Bien Phu Victory and loved the Vietnamese people very much, he stated.\n\nLamoudi underlined that the Dien Bien Phu Victory inspired colonial countries by opening up hope to other peoples, especially countries colonised by France such as Algeria and those in Southern Africa, West Africa and Central Africa. Immediately after the Dien Bien Phu Victory, the Algerian revolution started on November 1, 1954 with inspiration and experience learnt from Vietnam's revolution, he noted. The Vietnamese and Algerian revolutions sparked national liberation movements in Africa and other countries around the world.\n\nAccording to the FLN official, the revolutions of Vietnam and Algeria share the same goal to fight against colonialism to liberate the nation.\n\nAt that time, when people mentioned Indochina, they immediately thought of the three words \"Dien Bien Phu\" as an action slogan. People used the slogan \"Dien Bien Phu\" to remind themselves that they could win, said Lamoudi. \"I think Dien Bien Phu is a turning point in colonial history on the world map. That history was divided into two periods of before Dien Bien Phu and after Dien Bien Phu,\" stated Lamoudi.\n\nThe Dien Bien Phu Victory shattered the dogma of the invincibility of colonial powers, proving that oppressed countries can still make miracles against the power of colonial empires, he said, stressing that Algeria received that message.\n\nIn Africa, especially French-speaking countries, they talk about the Dien Bien Phu Victory with pride. This international victory helped unite colonial peoples, becoming the common victory of oppressed, said Lamoudi./.\n\nVNA", "source": {"uri": "en.vietnamplus.vn", "dataType": "news", "title": "VietnamPlus"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/\u0110i\u1ec7n_Bi\u00ean_Ph\u1ee7", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "\u0110i\u1ec7n Bi\u00ean Ph\u1ee7"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "\u0110i\u1ec7n Bi\u00ean Ph\u1ee7"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Vietnam"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Liberation_Front_(Algeria)", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "National Liberation Front (Algeria)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vietnam", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Vietnam"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Vietnam"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algeria", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Algeria"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Algeria"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vietnamese_people", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Vietnamese people"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colonialism", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Colonialism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/French_colonial_empire", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "French colonial empire"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algiers", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Algiers"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Algiers"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Algeria"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_Africa", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Central Africa"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Southern_Africa", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Southern Africa"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algerian_War", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Algerian War"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/West_Africa", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "West Africa"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/France", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "France"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mainland_Southeast_Asia", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Mainland Southeast Asia"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wars_of_national_liberation", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Wars of national liberation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vietnam_News_Agency", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Vietnam News Agency"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colonial_empire", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Colonial empire"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/French_language", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "French language"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Africa", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Africa"}, "location": null}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Territorial_Disputes", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Territorial Disputes", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Micronations", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Micronations", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 46}], "image": "https://imagev3-lang.vietnamplus.vn/1200x630/Uploaded/2024/gtntzt/2024_05_06/dien-bien-phu-victory-5005.jpg.webp", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9538399", "eventUri": "eng-9538399", "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Algiers"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Algeria"}}}, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.3490196078431373, "wgt": 218, "relevance": 1}

At the bottom of the valley is the best of the French army. The valley is surrounded by mountains. And we are there and the French will never get out.\"\n\nJust by that simple way Uncle Ho was able to rally all the people, and that was how Vietnam won the battle, Burchett said.\n\nThe wide anti-war movements then also had an important role to play in completing annihilation of the French aggressive expeditionary force, he said, and that the global imperialist power with the strongest army and support from its ally could not overpower the Vietnamese people's great will and desire for unification, independence and freedom.\n\nShowing us a picture of his father in Vietnamese outfit visiting a revolutionary base in the north, he said international peace-lovers like his father contributed their voice, calling for the world to support Vietnam.\n\n\"Right after the meeting with President Ho Chi Minh, my father sent his first cable to the world, in which he expressed his firm belief that Vietnam would win the Dien Bien Phu battle\" Burchett said.\n\n\"The action now taking place at Dien Bien Phu is the most tragic failure for French arms in the whole disastrous fiasco of the Navarre Plan to crush the people of Vietnam\", George read his father's lines.\n\nPeople's war key to Dien Bien Phu victory: scholars\n\nIn a similar vein, Carl Thayer, Emeritus Professor at the University of New South Wales (Canberra), told Vietnam News Agency that the Dien Bien Phu campaign proved the efficacy of the people's war through mobilisation of the whole population to oppose foreign aggression.\n\nIn his letter sent to soldiers on March 11, 1954, then President Ho Chi Minh said the fighting against French was very difficult but also very glorious. He expressed his firm belief that the soldiers would bring into play all the accumulated will and strength to overcome hardship and fulfill their glorious duty to the nation.\n\nDuring the Dien Bien Phu Campaign, tens of thousands of people engaged in transporting food supplies to the front or building the road for moving the artillery to the battle. Thayer said a regular armed forces supported by military assistance from fraternal countries was also a very important factor in Vietnam's Dien Bien Phu victory.\n\nMeanwhile, in an interview with Vietnam News Agency, Professor Piere Aselin from Hawaii Pacific University, USA held that the Dien Bien Phu Campaign from March 13 to May 7, 1954 demonstrated the importance of working together and acting together to gain independence.\n\n\"As a historian, I see one of the keys to victory was the leadership and the organisation. There was always a very high level of discipline within the Communist Party and the armed forces\".\n\nIt is not easy to get men, women, ethnic minority groups, Catholics and Buddhists to come together but the Vietnamese Party and President Ho Chi Minh were able to do so very well, he said.\n\nAselin said General Vo Nguyen Giap was a military genius and that his strategic ability and astute tactics helped Vietnam win the war against the invader whose resources were much bigger than those of his peasant army. Giap changed the theme of the Dien Bien Phu contest when the battle had already begun.\n\n\"At first, it had been his intention to get it over quickly and orders were issued accordingly. However, he thought it through, decided he could not afford to take chances, rapid attack would not guarantee complete success, and that's why he shifted the guiding principle to \"advance cautiously, strike surely\".\n\nToday in Vietnam, you talk a lot about bamboo diplomacy and I really think General Giap applied his bamboo strategy in the battle that helped the peasant army defeat the colonists.\n\nSeventy years have passed, Vietnam has shone bright as a country of peace, bliss and robust development. It has carved out significant achievements with its bamboo diplomacy, in which it stays steadfast and unyielding on basic principles but flexible in the ways and means to achieve strategic objectives, Professor Thayer said.\n\nAs for painter Burchett, who is half Australian and half Bulgarian but always identifies himself as Vietnamese, he has chosen living for good in Vietnam, the place where he was born. He's busy with digitalising and archiving his father's journalistic stories, photos and documentaries because he knows it's so important for future generations to learn about the wars and the historic victories of Vietnam./.

Seven decades later, the echo of Dien Bien Phu's triumph continues to resonate, etching an indelible mark on the annals of 20th-century heroism, he wrote.\n\nThe author, who is also the President of the Mexican Journalists' Association, explicitly pointed out that one of the decisive factors of the Dien Bien Phu Victory was the solidarity spirit of the Vietnamese people.\n\nIn an article published in the special issue of the Latin American news agency Prensa Latina, former Director of International Relations of the Venezuelan President's Office Dr. Sergio Rodr\u00edguez Gelfenstein described the Dien Bien Phu Victory as an incomparable symbol of bravery and a bright star for the national liberation movement, signaling the downfall of colonialism worldwide.\n\nHe affirmed that the Dien Bien Phu Victory and the signing of the Geneva Accords marked the complete failure of French colonialism in Indochina, thwarting its plans to expand colonial rule in Southeast Asia. Furthermore, it inspired oppressed colonial peoples worldwide to rise up and struggle for independence.\n\nMeanwhile Pasaxon (The People), the official newspaper of the Lao People's Revolutionary Party, and the Lao National Radio also published articles praising the victory that \"resounded across the five continents and shook the globe\".\n\nThey affirmed that it was not only the victory and pride of the fraternal Vietnamese people but also all peace-loving nations worldwide./.VNA", "source": {"uri": "vietnamnet.vn", "dataType": "news", "title": "VietNamNet News"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/\u0110i\u1ec7n_Bi\u00ean_Ph\u1ee7", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "\u0110i\u1ec7n Bi\u00ean Ph\u1ee7"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "\u0110i\u1ec7n Bi\u00ean Ph\u1ee7"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Vietnam"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vietnam", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Vietnam"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Vietnam"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/V\u00f5_Nguy\u00ean_Gi\u00e1p", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "V\u00f5 Nguy\u00ean Gi\u00e1p"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newspaper", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Newspaper"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mexico", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Mexico"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Mexico"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mainland_Southeast_Asia", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Mainland Southeast Asia"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/French_colonial_empire", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "French colonial empire"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ho_Chi_Minh", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Ho Chi Minh"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pasaxon", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Pasaxon"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lao_National_Radio", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Lao National Radio"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lao_People's_Revolutionary_Party", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Lao People's Revolutionary Party"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/President_of_Venezuela", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "President of Venezuela"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indonesian_National_Revolution", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Indonesian National Revolution"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wars_of_national_liberation", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Wars of national liberation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vietnamese_people", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Vietnamese people"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vietnam_News_Agency", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Vietnam News Agency"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Southeast_Asia", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Southeast Asia"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colonialism", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Colonialism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_relations", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "International relations"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hispanic_and_Latino_Americans", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Hispanic and Latino Americans"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Latin_America", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Latin America"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Continent", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Continent"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geneva", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Geneva"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Geneva"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Switzerland"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Territorial_Disputes", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Territorial Disputes", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 57}], "image": "https://static-images.vnncdn.net/files/publish/2024/5/6/foreign-media-spotlights-vietnams-dien-bien-phu-victory-23.webp", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9538399", "eventUri": "eng-9538399", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-05-07", "textStart": 93, "textEnd": 98, "freq": 2}], "sentiment": 0.08235294117647052, "wgt": 207, "relevance": 1}

After 56 days and nights, the Vietnamese army and people achieved the glorious victory, forcing France to sign the Geneva Accords on ceasefire and peace restoration in Indochina. The article underscored the far-reaching impact of this triumph, crediting it with laying the foundation and groundwork for Vietnam's eventual reunification in 1975.\n\nIt characterised the Dien Bien Phu Victory as a \"source of immense pride\" for the Vietnamese people and a landmark event in the global struggle against colonialism. Highlighting the victory's global impact, the article described it as a moment that \"resounded across the five continents and shook the globe\", inspiring independence movements worldwide.\n\nAnother article, published on May 2, hailed the Dien Bien Phu Victory as \"a glorious milestone in the Vietnamese history of liberation struggle and a great contributor to the progress of humanity\".\n\nThis victory has proven a truth to oppressed and invaded nations that with steadfast will, a spirit of solidarity in fighting for justice, and a correct strategy, a small nation can defeat a great power, it said.\n\nThe article also acknowledged the leadership of the Communist Party of Vietnam, President Ho Chi Minh, and General Vo Nguyen Giap in leading the nation to victory.\n\nA May 1 article by journalist Sergio Rodr\u00edguez Gelfenstein delved deeper, analysing the broader implications of the Dien Bien Phu Victory and the subsequent Geneva Accords. Gelfenstein argued that these events marked the definitive end of French colonialism in Indochina, shattering their plans for regional expansion, and serving as a powerful catalyst for independence movements across the globe. It was also the first time a Western colonial power had suffered a complete military defeat in one of its colonies.\n\nThe Dien Bien Phu Victory is a timeless symbol of courage and a beacon of hope for national liberation movements. Even 70 years have passed by, the values and historical significance of this victory continue to resonate in the modern world, he concluded /.\n\nVNA", "source": {"uri": "en.vietnamplus.vn",

Part of the documents were decoded in 2015 while others just last year. Some have yet to be publicised.\n\nThe documentary features French military figures who directly engaged in the Dien Bien Phu battle, many researchers and historians of France, along with war veterans of both countries.\n\nIt mentions the causes and mistakes leading to the French military's loss in the Dien Bien Phu battle while highlighting the undaunted spirit and ingenuity of the Vietnamese army and people in the face of the powerful French military in this battle.\n\nThe documentary was produced in four months, from late December 2023, and filmed in Vietnam and fourth cities of France, namely Paris, Montpellier, Toulon, and Marseille, said journalist Thu Ha, deputy head of the TV department for foreign services at VTV.\n\nIt will be aired at 8:05pm on May 7 on VTV1 and VTV4 channels.\n\nThe Dien Bien Phu Victory on May 7, 1954 forced the French colonialists to sit down at the negotiation table to discuss and sign the Geneva Accords on ending the war and restoring peace in Indochina in July 1954, putting an end to the prolonged French colonial rule and heralding a new stage for the revolution in Indochina. This was a great and extremely significant victory in the history of Vietnam.\n\nUnder the Geneva Accords, for the first time, the French Government and each state participating in the Geneva Conference pledged to respect the sovereignty, independence, and territorial integrity of Vietnam and absolutely not to intervene in the country's internal affairs. The French troops must withdraw while North Vietnam was completely liberated, embarking on the building of socialism and becoming a large and firm rear for people in the South to push ahead with the struggle for national liberation and reunification./.\n\nVNA", "source": {"uri": "en.vietnamplus.vn", "dataType": "news", "title": "VietnamPlus"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_Dien_Bien_Phu", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Battle of Dien Bien Phu"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vietnam_Television", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Vietnam Television"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/France", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "France"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/French_Parliament", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "French Parliament"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/French_Armed_Forces", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "French Armed Forces"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hanoi", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Hanoi"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Hanoi"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Vietnam"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vietnam", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Vietnam"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Vietnam"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/French_Indochina", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "French Indochina"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marseille", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Marseille"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Marseille"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Montpellier", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Montpellier"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Montpellier"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toulon", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Toulon"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Toulon"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paris", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geneva", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Geneva"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Geneva"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Switzerland"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/VTV1", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "VTV1"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_Vietnam", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "History of Vietnam"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wars_of_national_liberation", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Wars of national liberation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_Vietnam", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "North Vietnam"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vietnam_News_Agency", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Vietnam News Agency"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/French_colonial_empire", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "French colonial empire"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Government_of_France", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Government of France"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Independence", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Independence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/German_reunification", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "German reunification"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sovereignty", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Sovereignty"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Socialism", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Socialism"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 61}], "image": "https://imagev3-lang.vietnamplus.vn/1200x630/Uploaded/2024/aobfuau/2024_05_04/pierre-flamen-8201.png.webp", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9538399", "eventUri": "eng-9538399", "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Hanoi"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Vietnam"}}}, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-05-07", "textStart": 269, "textEnd": 274, "freq": 2}], "sentiment": 0.003921568627450966, "wgt": 200, "relevance": 1}

This decision, described by General Vo Nguyen Giap as the most challenging one of his military career, proved to be a crucial turning point in the course of the war.\n\nIn the opening lines of his article, author Mouris Salloum George vividly recounted the 56 days and nights of relentless struggle that unfolded at Dien Bien Phu.\n\nAmid the towering mountains and makeshift shelters, the Vietnamese army and people defied all odds to conquer the most formidable stronghold of the French colonialists in Indochina under the leadership of the Party and President Ho Chi Minh. Seven decades later, the echo of Dien Bien Phu's triumph continues to resonate, etching an indelible mark on the annals of 20th-century heroism, he wrote.\n\nThe author, who is also the President of the Mexican Journalists' Association, explicitly pointed out that one of the decisive factors of the Dien Bien Phu Victory was the solidarity spirit of the Vietnamese people.\n\nIn an article published in the special issue of the Latin American news agency Prensa Latina, former Director of International Relations of the Venezuelan President's Office Dr. Sergio Rodr\u00edguez Gelfenstein described the Dien Bien Phu Victory as an incomparable symbol of bravery and a bright star for the national liberation movement, signaling the downfall of colonialism worldwide.\n\nHe affirmed that the Dien Bien Phu Victory and the signing of the Geneva Accords marked the complete failure of French colonialism in Indochina, thwarting its plans to expand colonial rule in Southeast Asia. Furthermore, it inspired oppressed colonial peoples worldwide to rise up and struggle for independence.\n\nMeanwhile Pasaxon (The People), the official newspaper of the Lao People's Revolutionary Party, and the Lao National Radio also published articles praising the victory that \"resounded across the five continents and shook the globe\".\n\nThey affirmed that it was not only the victory and pride of the fraternal Vietnamese people but also all peace-loving nations worldwide./.\n\nVNA", "source": {"uri": "en.vietnamplus.vn", "dataType": "news", "title": "VietnamPlus"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/\u0110i\u1ec7n_Bi\u00ean_Ph\u1ee7", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "\u0110i\u1ec7n Bi\u00ean Ph\u1ee7"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "\u0110i\u1ec7n Bi\u00ean Ph\u1ee7"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Vietnam"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vietnam", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Vietnam"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Vietnam"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mexico", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Mexico"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Mexico"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/V\u00f5_Nguy\u00ean_Gi\u00e1p", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "V\u00f5 Nguy\u00ean Gi\u00e1p"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newspaper", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Newspaper"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hanoi", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Hanoi"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Hanoi"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Vietnam"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mainland_Southeast_Asia", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Mainland Southeast Asia"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/French_colonial_empire", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "French colonial empire"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ho_Chi_Minh", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Ho Chi Minh"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pasaxon", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Pasaxon"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lao_National_Radio", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Lao National Radio"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lao_People's_Revolutionary_Party", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Lao People's Revolutionary Party"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/President_of_Venezuela", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "President of Venezuela"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indonesian_National_Revolution", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Indonesian National Revolution"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wars_of_national_liberation", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Wars of national liberation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vietnamese_people", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Vietnamese people"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vietnam_News_Agency", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Vietnam News Agency"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sergio_Rodr\u00edguez", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Sergio Rodr\u00edguez"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Southeast_Asia", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Southeast Asia"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colonialism", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Colonialism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_relations", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "International relations"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Latin_America", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Latin America"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Continent", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Continent"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geneva", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Geneva"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Geneva"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Switzerland"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Territorial_Disputes", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Territorial Disputes", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 57}], "image": "https://imagev3-lang.vietnamplus.vn/1200x630/Uploaded/2024/kg1/2024_05_05/dien-bien-phu-1450.jpg.webp", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9538399", "eventUri": "eng-9538399", "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Hanoi"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Vietnam"}}}, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-05-07", "textStart": 107, "textEnd": 112}], "sentiment": 0.1372549019607843, "wgt": 197, "relevance": 1}

has for the first time been invited to commemorate the battle of Dien Bien Phu, which led to French troops' defeat in Vietnam and marked the country's last stand in colonial Indochina, Paris said Friday.\n\nDefence Minister Sebastien Lecornu will represent France at commemorations marking the 70th anniversary of the battle next week.\n\n\"For the first time in history, the Vietnamese have invited France to this commemoration, a sign of their desire to build a relationship for the future,\" the French defence ministry said on Friday.\n\n\"There is a shared desire to look at the history of the Indochina War in a lucid and open manner,\" the ministry said.\n\nDien Bien Phu in northern Vietnam was the site of an epic battle against Vietnamese communist forces in 1954 that spelt the end of France's colonial empire in Indochina.\n\nThe humiliating fall of the French troops in the Dien Bien Phu valley dented Paris's prestige and fuelled independence movements in other colonies.\n\nVietnamese fighters hemmed in French forces -- equipped with superior weapons -- and bombarded them with heavy artillery.\n\nThe ferocious battle in the rugged, remote valley killed thousands of soldiers on both sides in under two months.\n\nLecornu, who is set to travel to Vietnam on Saturday, will pay tribute \"to the Vietnamese dead at a Vietnamese military cemetery\" on Tuesday, the defence ministry said.\n\nHe will also honour the memory of French soldiers at the French memorial at Dien Bien Phu.\n\nOn Monday, Lecornu is set to meet with Prime Minister Pham Minh Chinh and Defence Minister Phan Van Giang.\n\nThe defence ministry said in March that France was to repatriate from Vietnam the bodies of six soldiers who died in Dien Bien Phu.\n\nFrance is keen to boost cooperation with Hanoi against a backdrop of tensions with China in the Asia-Pacific region.\n\nVietnam's victory over the French at Dien Bien Phu led to the country's division into the communist-ruled north, headed by revolutionary leader Ho Chi Minh, and a pro-US southern regime.\n\nThat set the stage for two decades of war, which eventually ended with the US defeat in the Vietnam War in 1975 and unification.\n\nWhat was once called French Indochina has today become Laos, Cambodia and Vietnam.", "source": {"uri": "bssnews.net", "dataType": "news", "title": "Bangladesh Sangbad

Here, visitors can witness with their own eyes the simple hut that served as the daily residence and workplace of General Vo Nguyen Giap (1911- 2013), and the hut where the General Staff convened meetings to discuss and make the historic decisions regarding the Dien Bien Phu Campaign.\n\nLeaving the Muong Phang forest, we drove motorbikes along Highway 279, with the mountain pass winding on one side and a deep ravine on the other side. This was one of the historic artillery routes during the Dien Bien Phu Campaign. Continuing along Highway 279 to the gateway of Dien Bien Phu City, we visited the Him Lam Hill Relic Site. On the hilltop, dappled with sunlight and shaded by bauhinia blossoms, groups of tourists silently and respectfully lit incense sticks in memory of the hero Phan Dinh Giot and hundreds of soldiers who sacrificed their lives to gain the victory at Him Lam, defeating the strongest fortification cluster of the French.\n\nFrom the Him Lam Hill Relic Site, we traveled along a new road named after General Vo Nguyen Giap. The road runs through the city center and heads straight to the Tay Trang international border gate which borders Laos. Along this route, there are many well known historical sites, namely Dien Bien Phu Victory Monument, May 7th Dien Bien Phu City Square, etc.\n\nAt the A1 Hill Relic Site, groups of visitors pause for long moment beside the massive crater atop the hill. This strategic vantage point played a crucial role in protecting the Muong Thanh center and guarding the entrance to the command bunker of General De Castries (Christian de Castries, 1902-1991).\n\nAfter 39 relentless days and nights of \"cutting through mountains, sleeping in trenches, getting drenched in forests, and eating rice balls\", the Vietnamese soldiers carved a tunnel through the mountain to place about a ton of explosives which demolished a portion of the enemy's defensive strongpoint and captured this key stronghold. This act paved the way for the historical moment when the \"Determined to fight, Determined to win\" flag of the Vietnamese army fluttered atop General De Castries' bunker at 5:30pm on May 7, 1954, marking the complete collapse of the entire so-called \"invincible\" military base of Dien Bien Phu and etching the resounding victory of Dien Bien Phu into the annals of history. Seven decades have passed, and the month of May has once again graced the land with a vibrant tapestry of blooming white Bauhinia flowers, adorning the landscape alongside the remnants of war-torn craters. This ethereal spectacle shows that the ravages of war have receded, giving way to a Dien Bien pulsating with renewed life and vigor.\n\nDien Bien, a land blessed with majestic natural beauty, a salubrious climate, and a rich cultural heritage, stands as a beacon of tourism potential in the northwest region of Vietnam. Its confluence of historical significance, cultural vibrancy, and geographical splendor positions it as a prime destination poised for exponential growth. Capitalizing on these strengths, Dien Bien is set to emerge as a prominent tourism hub within the northwest sub-region, anchored by three key pillars of historical-cultural and spiritual tourism, ecotourism and nature exploration, and wellness and leisure tourism.\n\nThe Muong Thanh Valley, once the epicenter of Dien Bien Phu stronghold complex, has transformed into a cradle for preserving and promoting the Xoe dance of the Thai, captivating thousands of visitors each day.\n\nAs the rhythm of the Xoe dance echoes through the night air, the Thai of Muong Thanh gather in harmonious unity, their voices intertwining in a song that encapsulates the essence of their culture: \"Without Xoe, there is no joy; without Xoe, the rice plants fail to bear grain, the cornstalks yield no cobs, and young men and women remain unpaired\".\n\nLo Thi Buoi, a Thai woman from Phieng Loi Village in Thanh Minh Commune, Dien Bien Phu City, shares her deep connection to the dance, \"We, the Thai, have no recollection of when the Xoe dance originated. We only know that every girl learns to dance Xoe as she grows up. No celebration or festival in Muong Thanh is complete without the graceful movements of the Xoe\". Through generations, the Xoe dances have not only endured but flourished, earning UNESCO recognition as a Masterpiece of the Oral and Intangible Heritage of Humanity in 2021. Today, the Xoe dance stands as a cultural gem, gracing community-based tourism initiatives in Dien Bien.\n\nPreserving and promoting the Xoe dance heritage while simultaneously fostering community-based and agricultural tourism has emerged as a unique approach for Dien Bien Province. From its initial implementation in 2003, encompassing eight pilot community tourism villages, this model has expanded across the province's districts. Villages like Che Can, Phieng Loi, and Na Su stand as exemplary models of this successful approach. Nestled amidst the scenic landscapes of Muong Phang Commune, approximately 30km from the Dien Bien Province center, Che Can Village boasts a close-knit community of nearly 100 households comprising over 430 individuals, all of whom are Thai. The people of Che Can Village are the custodians of a rich cultural heritage, including traditional Black Thai stilt houses, distinctive attire, deeply rooted beliefs, vibrant festivals, and, of course, the captivating Xoe dance. Additionally, the village is home to a thriving tapestry of traditional crafts, including brocade weaving and basketry. Complemented by its breathtaking natural beauty and pleasant climate, Che Can Village has emerged as Dien Bien's most successful community-based tourism model, captivating visitors from both within Vietnam and abroad to experience its cultural treasures and serene ambiance.\n\nDien Bien Province has many popular scenic spots such as Pa Khoang Lake, Huoi Pha Lake, Pa Thom Cave, Kho Chua La Cave, Pe Rang Ky Cave, Muong Nhe Nature Reserve, the hot mineral springs of U Va and Hua Pe, the scenic landscape of the Son La Hydropower Lake, and Pha Din Pass (one of Vietnam's four most treacherous mountain passes - the path for artillery to get to the Dien Bien Phu battlefield).\n\nThe Dien Bien authorities are actively pursuing international and regional cooperation initiatives to strengthen linkages with neighboring provinces in Northern Laos, Northeastern Thailand, and China. This strategic approach aims to develop international and Northwest loop tourism routes, capitalizing on the unique advantages offered by Dien Bien Phu Airport, the sole civilian airport in the Northwest region, which provides direct flights to Hanoi and Ho Chi Minh City.\n\nLeveraging its distinct potential and assets, Dien Bien Province is proudly hosting National Tourism Year 2024, coinciding with the 70th anniversary of the Dien Bien Phu Victory. This momentous occasion will be marked by grand national-level festivals, including the 2024 Bauhinia Flower Festival, the 70th Anniversary of the Dien Bien Phu Victory Commemoration, and the Northwest - Dien Bien Tourism Fair.\n\nAccording to Chairman of the People's Committee of Dien Bien Province, Le Thanh Do, this year, the province aims to welcome 1.3 million tourists, generating a total revenue of approximately 2,200 billion dong (roughly 93 million US dollars). By 2025, Dien Bien aspires to attract over 1.45 million visitors, boosting overall revenue to 2,380 billion dong (approximately 101 million US dollars). These targets are expected to contribute around 10% to the province's average GRDP./.", "source": {"uri": "vietnam.vnanet.vn", "dataType": "news", "title": "vietnam.vnanet.vn"}, "authors": [],

They all played important roles in the Dien Bien Phu Campaign and Vietnam's history.\n\nThose present at the places included Prime Minister Pham Minh Chinh, Acting State President Vo Thi Anh Xuan, Permanent Vice Chairman of the National Assembly Tran Thanh Man, and Permanent member of the Party Central Committee's Secretariat and Chairwoman of the Party Central Committee's Organisation Commission Truong Thi Mai who is also head of the central steering committee for the celebration of major anniversaries and important historical events in 2023 - 2025.\n\nThrough TV videos and stories shared by history witnesses, the programme gave the audience a look back at unforgettable memories about the campaign seven decades ago.\n\nOn this occasion, PM Chinh and officials presented flowers and insignias to the former soldiers, pioneering youths, and frontline workers who used to engage in the Dien Bien Phu Campaign.\n\nThe Dien Bien Phu Victory on May 7, 1954 forced the French colonialists to sit down at the negotiation table to discuss and sign the Geneva Accords on ending the war and restoring peace in Indochina in July 1954, putting an end to the prolonged French colonial rule and heralding a new stage for the revolution in Indochina. This was a great and extremely significant victory in the history of Vietnam.\n\nUnder the Geneva Accords, for the first time, the French Government and each state participating in the Geneva Conference pledged to respect the sovereignty, independence, and territorial integrity of Vietnam and absolutely not to intervene in the country's internal affairs. The French troops must withdraw while North Vietnam was completely liberated, embarking on the building of socialism and becoming a large and firm rear for people in the South to push ahead with the

Thanks to that, the Vietnamese army, from zero, became one securing respect from any enemy.\n\nAnother source of the Vietnamese army's strength was bravery, which could be seen in not only battles but also in the preparations for the campaign from 1953, the Russian scholar noted.\n\nHe said every 10 soldiers on the battlefield needed up to a hundred people working in the rear to provide support to them. Facing tough conditions in the midst of mountains and forests and the request for absolute secrecy, Vietnamese soldiers transported all ammunitions to the battlefield on pack-bikes and their own shoulders during nighttime. Food and the injured were also transported safely.\n\nThis reflected extraordinary preparations for the campaign, he went on.\n\nThe professor held that the Dien Bien Phu Victory created a turning point for the war that resulted in the signing of the 1954 Geneva Accords on the cessation of hostilities in Vietnam, heralding a new chapter in Vietnam's struggle for national liberation and reunification.\n\nWith this victory, Vietnam became an example for many oppressed nations around the world and a source of encouragement for other countries on the path to national liberation, according to Kolotov.\n\nVNA\n\nM\u1eddi qu\u00fd \u0111\u1ed9c gi\u1ea3 theo d\u00f5i VOV.VN tr\u00ean", "source": {"uri": "english.vov.vn", "dataType": "news", "title": "VOV - VOV Online Newspaper"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/V\u00f5_Nguy\u00ean_Gi\u00e1p", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "V\u00f5 Nguy\u00ean Gi\u00e1p"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_Dien_Bien_Phu", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Battle of Dien Bien Phu"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vietnam", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Vietnam"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Vietnam"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russia", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Russia"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Russia"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saint_Petersburg_State_University", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Saint Petersburg State University"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ho_Chi_Minh", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Ho Chi Minh"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/French_colonial_empire", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "French colonial empire"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Victory_over_Japan_Day", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Victory over Japan Day"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wars_of_national_liberation", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Wars of national liberation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vietnam_News_Agency", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Vietnam News Agency"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/German_reunification", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "German reunification"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geneva", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Geneva"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Geneva"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Switzerland"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Military", "label": "dmoz/Society/Military", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Genealogy/Military", "label": "dmoz/Society/Genealogy/Military", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Miniatures/Software", "label": "dmoz/Games/Miniatures/Software", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 49}], "image": "https://vov-media.emitech.vn/sites/default/files/styles/og_image_en/public/2024-05/Screenshot_1.jpg?v=1714739285", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9538399", "eventUri": "eng-9538399", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1686274509803922, "wgt": 191, "relevance": 1}

Even if something is extremely difficult, with the people's support it can be done.\"\n\n\"With its correct analysis of the contradictions of the time both nationally and internationally as well as a thorough understanding of the revolutionary movement in the country, the CPV could lay the foundations not just for the victory of the Vietnamese people over colonialism and imperialism, but also for socialism building,\" the researcher stressed.\n\nHe went on to say that in the past, many revolutionaries of different ideologies tried to rise up and drive away colonialism, yet the movement, one after another, failed to eradicate the colonialist yoke and to mobilise the people.\n\n\"It was only the CPV with Marxism-Leninism at its core, under the leadership of President Ho Chi Minh, that could do this, because it could correctly assess the role of the working class and peasantry, and internal contradictions, and could show the people a clear path to a brighter future,\" said Whittaker.\n\nFor the role of President Ho Chi Minh and General Vo Nguyen Giap in the Dien Bien Phu Campaign and other victories of the Vietnamese revolution, he said the two contributed greatly to not just the Vietnamese revolution but also the ideas of subsequent communist and national liberation movements around the globe.\n\n\"President Ho Chi Minh was the first to creatively adapt Marxism-Leninism to Vietnam's conditions in a correct and complete way. His awareness of the struggles against colonialism around the world, his in-depth knowledge of Marxism-Leninism and the Vietnamese history, his analysis of Vietnam's conditions, and his knowledge of military tactics of several armies gave the Vietnamese revolution strengths,\" he said.\n\n\"The leadership of President Ho Chi Minh, as an outstanding revolutionary, has acted as the guiding light of the CPV to the present day embodying his writings on revolutionary ethics, the People's Army, diplomacy, foreign policy and much more.\"\n\nPraising General Vo Nguyen Giap, Whittaker said he is famous worldwide as one of the best military generals and tacticians in the world history.\n\n\"One only needs to read the General's memoirs to see his careful attention to details, his adaptability to changing battlefields, his deep knowledge of the army, and his dedication to ensuring the People's Army was of the best possible quality, and to ensuring revolutionary ethics and clean living conditions, and political and military training,\" the researcher said.\n\nHe emphasised that the leadership of President Ho Chi Minh and General Vo Nguyen Giap in those decisive moments led up to and culminated in the victory Dien Bien Phu.\n\n\"A small army with not enough guns or ammunition, with most using swords and other weapons, could turn into a people's army that would head on face the French at the battle of Dien Bien Phu, what the French forces thought would be an easy victory,\" Whittaker continued.\n\n\"This showed the determination of the Vietnamese people, the discipline and tactical refinement of the People's Army, and the correct leadership of the Party.\"\n\nHe added that the Dien Bien Phu Victory was thanks to the construction of an army for the people, noting the army has carried on the traditions and its members are ready to provide support for the people.\n\nRegarding proletarian internationalism, Whittaker said it was an element behind the success of the Dien Bien Phu campaign.\n\nThe Vietnamese people and Party and the Laotian and Cambodian people assisted each other in the fight against French colonialism, he said, pointing to the support from the Soviet Union and China during the Dien Bien Phu campaign.\n\nThe British researcher concluded that 70 years have passed and the message of the Dien Bien Phu Victory lives on, and expressed his hope that more books and movies about Vietnamese history and politics will be translated so that more people can learn about Vietnam and its struggle for peace and independence, and socialism building./.",

There were some platoons and squads wiped out entirely in a single day.\n\n\"My comrades fell next to me, their bodies were removed and buried somewhere,\" said the veteran from Le Loi Commune, Gia Loc District, the northern province of Hai Duong, wearing his dark green military uniform decorated with medals.\n\nThe 1954 battle in the rugged, remote valley killed thousands of soldiers on both sides in less than two months, from March 13 to May 7, as Vietnamese fighters hemmed in French forces - equipped with superior weapons - and bombarded them with heavy artillery.\n\nIt cost Vietnam 4,020 dead, 10,130 injured and 792 missing, with up to 3,976 fallen soldiers now resting at three cemeteries near Doc Lap (Independence), Him Lam and A1 hills where they fought, only four of them have been identified so far.\n\n\"I had to face two things, one was the enemy and the other, death,\" the 88-year-old man said, recalling the last attack on the night of May 6 when he and his sleepless comrades had to carry countless wounded soldiers, many of them dead, back to shelter tunnels.\n\nFor Huong, the battle was even more fierce as he was fighting the enemy and getting informed that his little son was killed by French force raids back home.\n\nFierce thirst for independence\n\nDriven by patriotism and a fierce thirst for independence, Huong and Nguyen Duc Noi, now 88, like tens of thousands of youths of their generation, headed to the frontline, fortified by bitter memories of foreign invasions throughout the nation's history.\n\nThey were also buoyed by the call of the nation: \"All for the frontline, all for victory.\"\n\n\"I was the youngest among my hometown boys to volunteer to go to the battle with the support of my mother,\" Noi said, adding that he didn't think much at that time and just wanted to follow his countrymen.\n\nHuong was arrested during a raid by French forces in his village in 1950 and was jailed for one and a half months as he was a member of the National Salvation Youth Union Committee in the locality.\n\nTo get to the Dien Bien Phu battlefront in the northwest, Huong and Noi trudged through forests for half a month from the central province of Thanh Hoa.\n\n\"We slept in jungles during the day and marched about four hours each night, with a gun and a 10-kg backpack on shoulders. Locals gave us rice, vegetables and other foods to survive,\" Huong recalled.\n\nFor Noi, the most dangerous mission was individual reconnaissance, sometimes conducted by a small group of three, without water and food. \"We had to quickly scout out enemy areas and chart maps,\" said Noi, who had never received military training before.\n\nNoi, Huong and all their comrades dug approach trenches and tunnels day and night, preparing for the historic battle at Dien Bien Phu, which was then the strongest fortified entrenched camp in Indochina under the Navarre Plan mapped out by French colonialists and U.S. interventionists in the autumn - winter of 1953.\n\nPeter Macdonald said in his book titled \"The Victor in Vietnam: Giap\", first published in 1993, that \"Perhaps, though, the most astonishing example of their digging ability was that when they took Dominique they did not establish positions on top of the hill, they dug right through it from behind; outwardly, it look as it always had, pock-marked and rugged; inside it was an ant's nest of weapon pits.\"\n\nHeavy but glorious task\n\nNoi said he was proud of joining all the major attacks from 1952 to 1954, notably one on the fortified French camp at Na San, the northwestern province of Son La, in 1952, when he was wounded, and another on the Dien Bien Phu fortress.\n\nBoth the veterans said they had no idea about the much stronger power of the French forces or what were the tactics employed by President Ho Chi Minh and Vo Nguyen Giap in the Dien Bien Phu, but they always trusted and followed the leadership of President Ho Chi Minh and the command of General Vo Nguyen Giap.\n\nThe two veterans shared a firm belief that without the Party and its sound leadership, the globe-shaking victory would not be achieved.\n\nTalking about the tremendous sacrifice of soldiers at Dien Bien Phu, the veterans expressed hope that present youths would carry forward the tradition of patriotism, consolidate their will and enrich their knowledge in order to contribute to national construction and development.\n\nProfessor Carl Thayer from the University of New South Wales said \"Vietnam's schools, universities and mass organizations should conduct educational programmes and conduct field trips to the Dien Bien Phu battlefield to remind the youths of today that Vietnam's self-reliance and independence due to

Each room has a long table where people can gather in groups.\n\nTra My, a staff member from the caf\u00e9, said that on intensely hot days, some customers napped or even spent the whole night there.\n\n24/7 Caf\u00e9 on Xo Viet Nghe Tinh Street arranges mattresses for customers to rest. It can accommodate 350 people and is always packed on hot days or near university exams.\n\nAccording to Tran Minh Tri, the caf\u00e9 owner, many students come there to learn, nap, or sleep.\n\n\"We don't have curtains or doors for the rooms, so it's easy to manage. We see this simply as a place for people to relax and escape the scorching sun in the summer,\" Tri noted.\n\nNguyen Thi Ly, a local student, said that her 10-square-metre rented room lacks air conditioning. So she and her roommate go to coffee shops to escape the heat. They only need to buy a cup of tea or coffee at VND30,000-40,000 and can stay at the coffee shop for many hours.\n\nMost coffee shops permitting customers to nap or stay overnight are near universities.\n\nDoan Hong Quan, 21, from Lien Chieu District, said he often takes his laptop to SeVenTeen Caf\u00e9 on Ngo Thi Nham Street to relax and avoid the sweltering heat in his rented room.\n\nNational television programmes honour \u0110i\u1ec7n Bi\u00ean Ph\u1ee7 Victory\n\nVi\u1ec7t Nam National Television (VTV) will air a series of programme to mark the 70th anniversary of the \u0110i\u1ec7n Bi\u00ean Ph\u1ee7 Victory.\n\nA live broadcast will be aired on channel 1 at 8pm on May 5 from five locations; \u0110i\u1ec7n Bi\u00ean Ph\u1ee7 Victory Monument at Hill D1 in \u0110i\u1ec7n Bi\u00ean Province; Ba \u0110\u00ecnh Square; Lam S\u01a1n Square in Thanh H\u00f3a Provine; Kon Klor Communal House in Central Highland Province of Kon Tum and Th\u1ee7 Ng\u1eef Flagpole Relic Area in HCM City.\n\nThe show will highlight the importance and the role of the victory, pay tribute to the older generation and inspire patriotism among young people.\n\nA theatre will be set up at \u0110i\u1ec7n Bi\u00ean Ph\u1ee7 Victory Monument with 56 stairs symbolising the \"56 days and nights of tunnelling through mountains, seeking refuge in bomb shelters, enduring pouring rain and surviving on rice balls\".\n\n\"Popularising the 70th celebration of \u0110i\u1ec7n Bi\u00ean Ph\u1ee7 Victory is our important mission,\" said \u0110\u1ed7 \u0110\u1ee9c Ho\u00e0ng VTV's deputy-general director at the press release recently in H\u00e0 N\u1ed9i.\n\n\"We have carried out a comprehensive plan early on a large scale with key programmes which will be developed synchronously on the digital platforms.\"\n\nAn art show \u0110i\u1ec7n Bi\u00ean Ph\u1ee7 - M\u1ed1c V\u00e0ng L\u1ecbch S\u1eed (\u0110i\u1ec7n Bi\u00ean Ph\u1ee7 - A Golden Milestone) will be held on May 6 with nearly 1,000 artists and amateurs.

These fields of cooperation receive common attention from business communities of both countries, said Bezdetko.\n\nHe revealed that Russian state owned oil company Zarubezhneft is undertaking a project to develop offshore wind power plants in central and southern Vietnam. Meanwhile, Novatek, Russia's largest liquefied natural gas (LNG) producer, is interested in accessing Vietnam's growing gas market. Negotiations are underway between interested parties towards the construction of joint projects.\n\nIn addition, he said the two countries should ramp up bilateral cooperation in agriculture, finance-banking, science-technology and education.\n\nTH True Milk is operating efficiently with its Russian partners and it is expected that the Vietnamese dairy product company will open a new facility in Kaluga province, said the diplomat.\n\nEducation-training is a traditional field of cooperation between the two countries. Each year the Russian Government reserves 1,000 scholarships for Vietnamese citizens to study at different levels in the Russian Federation. Russia is also ready to consider Vietnam's proposals to diversify the training industry and teaching forms.\n\nScientific and technological cooperation is a major pillar in bilateral relations. The Vietnam - Russia Tropical Center in Hanoi is a large scientific and technological research center, one of the major cooperation agencies of the two countries, that has conducted many research projects in various fields, bringing benefits to the people of the two countries.\n\nThe Vietnam - Russia Committee on Educational, Scientific and Technological Cooperation held the fourth meeting in Hanoi last year, and agreements reached at the meeting are expected to further strengthen bilateral cooperation in this field.\n\nThe ambassador also revealed that the Vietnam Cultural Day will be held in Russia this July as part of activities to mark 74 years of diplomatic ties between the two countries (1950 - 2024).\n\nHo Chi Minh City exhibition highlights Dien Bien Phu Victory milestones\n\nAs many as 97 photographs highlighting the significance, stature, and value of the Dien Bien Phu Victory over French colonialism 70 years ago are on display at an exhibition which opened in Ho Chi Minh City on May 3.\n\nThe exhibition is part of events that are getting underway to mark the 70th anniversary of the Dien Bien Phu Victory (May 7, 1954 - 2024).\n\nAll of the exhibits demonstrate the strength of the great national solidarity bloc, the clear-sighted leadership of the Party, and the growth of the military, all of which are seen as locomotives for the nation's renewal, development and international integration.\n\nThe exhibition is set to run from May 3 to 12 in three venues - Nguyen Hue Street, Dong Khoi Street in District 1, and the area opposite Chi Lang Park.\n\nFurthermore, Dong Khoi street is also hosting a photograph exhibition featuring the culture and tourism of northwestern region.\n\nThrough the event, visitors will have the chance to tour around sightseeing spots which are associated with the Dien Bien Phu Victory, such as Muong Phang Forest, a relic of the Dien Bien Phu Campaign; and Fansipan peak, the roof of Indochina.\n\nOECD should make headway in global cooperation, says Vietnamese diplomat\n\nThe Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) should be at the forefront of promoting global cooperation amid intertwined challenges and opportunities, says Vietnamese Foreign Minister Bui Thanh Son at a plenary session of the OECD Ministerial Council Meeting (MCM) in Paris on May 2.\n\nAddressing the meeting, Son stressed the organization should build a creative global ecosystem that takes good advantage of two parallel trends: green transformation and digital transformation, with a primary focus on innovation, artificial intelligent and just energy transition.\n\nHe suggested that OECD create a mechanism to share experiences and build capacity to help countries maximize human potential, unlock growth drivers and promote inclusive prosperity.\n\nHe called on OECD countries to provide financial, technical and technological support for non-OECD countries to implement strategic breakthroughs, especially in human resources, infrastructure and institutions.\n\nThe diplomat shared Vietnam's development policy and orientations, stressing the country Vietnam does not achieve growth at all costs and it always puts people at the center of development.\n\nAt the meeting, the Ministers discussed measures to create a sustainable and inclusive economy and society, promote free and fair global trade and investment, strengthen solid and self-reliant economic foundations, and foster the transition to a low-emission, circular economy that is favourable to nature, while stepping up AI application and global data management coordination.\n\nThey recommended that countries cautiously deploy monetary policies to facilitate long-term inflation control, ensure balance of payments to increase resources for climate and development goals, strengthen the foundations to increase productivity through science and technology, innovation, and AI application.\n\nThey also stressed the need to strengthen international cooperation, especially in boosting global trade and developing green infrastructure and digital transformation.\n\nThe same day, Vietnamese Foreign Minister Bui Thanh Son attended a ceremony marking 10 years of the OECD Southeast Asia Regional Programme (SEARP). He highly appreciated Japan's initiative on the establishment of the programme, saying after 10 years, the SEARP has become the most successful regional programme of the OECD with many outstanding achievements, including the admission of Indonesia and Thailand into the OECD.\n\nWith an important geostrategic position and dynamically developing economies, Southeast Asian countries will play an increasingly important role, contributing to growth and solving global development challenges, he noted.\n\nHe proposed that in the next 10 years, the SEARP should further promote its role as a bridge for Southeast Asian countries to engage more deeply and substantially in global governance, especially in areas such as green transition, tax and AI cooperation, to become a destination for high-quality investment capital, while promoting reform towards economies with high governance standards, environmentally friendly and social harmony.", "source": {"uri": "vietnamnet.vn", "dataType":

On March 28, the Dakota plane that took her to Dien Bien Phu to pick up wounded soldiers broke down, unable to take off and then destroyed by artillery shells, leaving her stranded in Dien Bien Phu.\n\nAt that time, Genevi\u00e8ve de Galard was the only French woman in the Dien Bien Phu battlefield, because the other female nurses were evacuated as soon as the war began.\n\nShe and two surgeons together took care of wounded French soldiers for more than a month. When the campaign ended, after 17 days of being taken as a prisoner with other French soldiers, on May 24, 1954, she was granted freedom by President Ho Chi Minh and returned to France at the beginning of June.\n\nAt the age of 80, Genevi\u00e8ve de Galard released her memoir named \"Une femme \u00e0 Dien Bien Phu\" (A woman in Dien Bien Phu), featuring her life and special fate in the campaign that shook the world that day. This memoir was evaluated by the French press as being meticulous in every detail and rich in humanity, helping generations of the public better understand a tragic page in the French history.\n\nGenevi\u00e8ve is now living with her husband, Jean de Heaulme, at a nursing centre in Toulouse city./.\n\nVNA", "source": {"uri": "en.vietnamplus.vn", "dataType": "news", "title": "VietnamPlus"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_Dien_Bien_Phu", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Battle of Dien Bien Phu"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paris", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/France", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "France"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genevi\u00e8ve_de_Galard", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Genevi\u00e8ve de Galard"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shell_(projectile)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Shell (projectile)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vietnam_News_Agency", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Vietnam News Agency"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_France", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "History of France"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ho_Chi_Minh", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Ho Chi Minh"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toulouse", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Toulouse"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Toulouse"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Health/Nursing/History", "label": "dmoz/Health/Nursing/History", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://imagev3-lang.vietnamplus.vn/1200x630/Uploaded/2024/fsmap/2024_05_06/only-french-nurse-6496.png.webp", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9538399", "eventUri": "eng-9538399", "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-03-28", "textStart": 401, "textEnd": 409}], "sentiment": -0.04313725490196074, "wgt": 185, "relevance": 1}

There were some platoons and squads wiped out entirely in a single day.\n\nThe 1954 battle in the rugged, remote valley killed thousands of soldiers on both sides in less than two months, from March 13 to May 7, as Vietnamese fighters hemmed in French forces - equipped with superior weapons - and bombarded them with heavy artillery.\n\nIt cost Vietnam 4,020 dead, 10,130 injured and 792 missing, with up to 3,976 fallen soldiers now resting at three cemeteries near Doc Lap (Independence), Him Lam and A1 hills where they fought, only four of them have been identified so far.\n\nI was whimpering looking at dead soldiers all over the battlefield... I kept crying at night, I was only 16 then,\" said Nguyen Duc Noi from Gia Tan commune, Gia Loc district, Hai Duong province.\n\n\"I had to face two things, one was the enemy and the other, death\" the 88-year-old man said, recalling the last attack on the night of May 6 when he and his sleepless comrades had to carry countless wounded soldiers, many of them dead, back to shelter tunnels.\n\nFor Huong, the battle was even more fierce as he was fighting the enemy and getting informed that his little son was killed by French force raids back home.\n\nFierce thirst for independence\n\nDriven by patriotism and a fierce thirst for independence, Huong and Noi, like tens of thousands of youths of their generation, headed to the frontline, fortified by bitter memories of foreign invasions throughout the nation's history.\n\nThey were also buoyed by the call of the nation: \"All for the frontline, all for victory.\"\n\n\"I was the youngest among my hometown boys to volunteer to go to the battle with the support of my mother,\" Noi said, adding that he didn't think much at that time and just wanted to follow his countrymen.\n\nHuong was arrested during a raid by French forces in his village in 1950 and was jailed for one and a half months as he was a member of the National Salvation Youth Union Committee in the locality.\n\nTo get to the Dien Bien Phu battlefront in the Northwest, Huong and Noi trudged through forests for half a month from the central province of Thanh Hoa.\n\n\"We slept in jungles during the day and marched about four hours each night, with a gun and a 10-kg backpack on shoulders. Locals gave us rice, vegetables and other foods to survive,\" Huong recalled.\n\nFor Noi, the most dangerous mission was individual reconnaissance, sometimes conducted by a small group of three, without water and food. \"We had to quickly scout out enemy areas and chart maps,\" said Noi, who had never received military training before.\n\nNoi, Huong and all their comrades dug approach trenches and tunnels day and night, preparing for the historic battle at Dien Bien Phu, which was then the strongest fortified entrenched camp in Indochina under the Navarre Plan mapped out by French colonialists and US interventionists in the autumn - winter of 1953.\n\nPeter Macdonald said in his book titled \"The Victor in Vietnam: Giap\", first published in 1993, that \"Perhaps, though, the most astonishing example of their digging ability was that when they took Dominique they did not establish positions on top of the hill, they dug right through it from behind; outwardly, it look as it always had, pock-marked and rugged; inside it was an ant's nest of weapon pits.\"\n\nHeavy but glorious task\n\nNoi said he was proud of joining all the major attacks from 1952 to 1954, notably one on the fortified French camp at Na San, the northwestern province of Son La, in 1952, when he was wounded, and another on the Dien Bien Phu fortress.\n\nBoth the veterans said they had no idea about the much stronger power of the French forces or what were the tactics employed by President Ho Chi Minh and Vo Nguyen Giap in the Dien Bien Phu, but they always trusted and followed the leadership of President Ho Chi Minh and the command of General Vo Nguyen Giap.\n\nThe two veterans shared a firm belief that without the Party and its sound leadership, the globe-shaking victory would not be achieved.\n\nTalking about the tremendous sacrifice of soldiers at Dien Bien Phu, the veterans expressed hope that present youths would carry forward the tradition of patriotism, consolidate their will and enrich their knowledge in order to contribute to national construction and development.\n\nProfessor Carl Thayer from the University of New South Wales said \"Vietnam's schools, universities and mass organisations should conduct educational programmes and conduct field trips to the Dien Bien Phu battlefield to remind the youths of today that Vietnam's self-reliance and independence due to the sacrifice of those who fell to defeat the French.\"\n\n\"Never was so much owed by so many to so few,\" Thayer cited British statesman Winston Churchill./.VNA", "source": {"uri": "vietnamnet.vn",

The war posture was the combination of measures to organise, arrange, and deploy forces and means to create an advantageous position and maximise strength to win.\n\nIt was implemented widely in all the three Indochinese countries, dividing more than 80% of the French mobile force and creating a favourable position for Vietnam to destroy the enemy at the Dien Bien Phu battlefield, said Oanh.\n\nDuring the campaign, the Vietnamese people contributed 25,560 tonnes of rice, 226 tonnes of salt, 1,909 tonnes of food, 20,991 bicycles, 1,800 bamboo rafts, 756 rudimentary vehicles, 914 pack horses and 3,130 boats. Up to 26,453 individuals joined the campaign as frontline workers.\n\nThe figures demonstrated the extraordinary efforts and the mettle of Vietnam - a poor and backward country that was waging a long resistance war full of hardships and sacrifices.\n\nIn addition, the great help from the international community, first of all from the people of Laos, Cambodia and socialist countries, was both a material source and a source of political and spiritual strength, thus contributing to the victory of the Dien Bien Phu campaign.\n\nExactly 70 years after that historic day, the Dien Bien Phu Victory still leaves valuable lessons and invaluable experiences, including those on promoting the political and spiritual strength of the entire Party, army and people, combining the material with political and spiritual strength, and maximising the spiritual strength at difficult or turning point times to realise goals and bring the revolution to victory./.\n\nVNA", "source": {"uri": "en.vietnamplus.vn", "dataType": "news", "title": "VietnamPlus"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/\u0110i\u1ec7n_Bi\u00ean_Ph\u1ee7", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "\u0110i\u1ec7n Bi\u00ean Ph\u1ee7"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "\u0110i\u1ec7n Bi\u00ean Ph\u1ee7"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Vietnam"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vietnam", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Vietnam"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Vietnam"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ministry_of_Defence_(Vietnam)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Ministry of Defence (Vietnam)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/French_colonial_empire", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "French colonial empire"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tonne", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Tonne"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lieutenant_general", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Lieutenant general"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hanoi", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Hanoi"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Hanoi"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Vietnam"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mainland_Southeast_Asia", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Mainland Southeast Asia"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/People's_war", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "People's war"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vietnamese_people", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Vietnamese people"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/French_language", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "French language"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vietnam_News_Agency", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Vietnam News Agency"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bamboo", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Bamboo"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Socialist_state", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Socialist state"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cambodia", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Cambodia"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Cambodia"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salt", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Salt"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Horse", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Horse"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rice", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Rice"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laos", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Laos"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Laos"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Military", "label": "dmoz/Society/Military", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Peace", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Peace", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Military/Veterans", "label": "dmoz/Society/Military/Veterans", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 57}], "image": "https://imagev3-lang.vietnamplus.vn/1200x630/Uploaded/2024/fsmap/2024_05_06/dien-bien-phu-6819.jpg.webp", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9538399", "eventUri": "eng-9538399", "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Hanoi"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Vietnam"}}}, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.01960784313725494, "wgt": 181, "relevance": 1}

Thanks to that, the Vietnamese army, from zero, became one securing respect from any enemy.\n\nAnother source of the Vietnamese army's strength was bravery, which could be seen in not only battles but also in the preparations for the campaign from 1953, the Russian scholar noted.\n\nHe said every 10 soldiers on the battlefield needed up to a hundred people working in the rear to provide support to them.

But there are corpses here,\" he said, looking down at the old French trenches still visible beside him.\n\nThree French war veterans returned to the site of the bloody conflict ahead of Tuesday's 70th anniversary of the Battle of Dien Bien Phu, which unfolded over weeks in 1954 and ultimately brought an end to the French empire in Indochina.\n\nAlongside them at the commemorations on May 7 will be France's Defence Minister Sebastien Lecornu, marking the first time that Vietnam has invited a government minister from the former colonial power to attend official celebrations.\n\nFrench Secretary of State for Veterans and Remembrance Patricia Miralles will also attend.\n\nThe visit brought back both joyful and difficult memories for Schilardi, Jean-Yves Guinard and Andre Mayer.\n\n\"We've remained very attached to this country,\" 92-year-old Guinard told AFP. \"Because it's a country where the people are clever, brave and hard-working.\"\n\n\"This does not mean we forget. I come in the name of my fallen comrades.\"\n\nThe former colonel insisted on walking to the top of Him Lam hill -- known as Beatrice Hill by the French -- on Monday despite the downpour that turned the path slippery.\n\nSchilardi recalled the knife and bayonet fights in the trenches dug across the hill, stretching almost from top to bottom.\n\nThe walk up the hill had brought back memories and intense flashbacks, he said.\n\n\"In the trenches, I saw corpses... I can't tell you more\", he said, his throat tightening with emotion.\n\nBoth men were helped up the hill by Vietnamese soldiers, who held their arms firmly.\n\n- 'The sobs, the cries' -\n\nBeatrice Hill -- each French strongpoint in Dien Bien Phu bore a female first name -- fell during the first hours of the Viet Minh assault on the mountain outpost in Vietnam's northwest, near the Laos border, launched on March 13, 1954.\n\nThe colonial forces quickly realised they had underestimated the firepower of their enemies: Viet Minh forces had lugged cannon in pieces through hundreds of kilometres of jungle and across mountains.\n\nMore from this section Verstappen takes pole in Miami after sprint race win Steady rain, cooler feel Sunday in New Jersey; warmer start to workweek Canada arrests three over killing of Sikh activist\n\nThe 56 days of shelling and direct clashes left 13,000 dead or missing on both sides. More than 3,000 of them were soldiers of different nationalities fighting under the French flag.\n\n\"This atmosphere of humidity and rain had deeply penetrated us\" by the time of France's surrender, Schilardi recalled.\n\nHe said he could hear \"the sobs, the cries\" of the battle as he climbed the hill.\n\nAlmost 70 percent of the approximately 10,000 men taken prisoner when the French camp fell died as they were marched away from Dien Bien Phu or placed in detention camps.\n\n- 'Remarkable welcome' -\n\nResidents and tourists crowded around the three veterans pushed in wheelchairs outside the Dien Bien Phu Victory Museum in the centre of the city.\n\nA Vietnamese family dressed in the yellow and red of their country's flag posed for a smiling selfie with Guinard.\n\n\"The welcome is remarkable!\" Guinard told AFP.\n\nLe Tien Bo, a 64-year-old Vietnamese former soldier, pushed through the crowd to shake hands with one of the veterans.\n\n\"It's a sign of friendship. They were on the opposite side against us, but it was during war. Today, they are welcome in Vietnam,\" he said.\n\nSchilardi and Guinard said they looked forward to reconciliation with a country they still hold in their hearts.\n\nBoth worked in organisations that tried to build bridges between the youth of the two nations after the war.\n\nBut it was impossible for them to forget those who fell at Dien Bien Phu.\n\n\"It has taken me my whole life to understand what I lived through,\" said Schilardi.\n\n\"It was hell.\"\n\nah-tmh/aph/rbu/pbt", "source": {"uri": "reformer.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Brattleboro Reformer"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_Dien_Bien_Phu", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Battle of Dien Bien Phu"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trench_warfare", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Trench warfare"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/French_language", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "French language"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vietnam", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Vietnam"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Vietnam"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/French_colonial_empire", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "French colonial empire"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/S\u00e9bastien_Lecornu", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "S\u00e9bastien Lecornu"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/French_Indochina", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "French Indochina"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minister_of_Defence_(India)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Minister of Defence (India)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Secretary_of_State", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States Secretary of State"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minister_(government)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Minister (government)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/France", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "France"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vi\u1ec7t_Minh", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Vi\u1ec7t Minh"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bayonet", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Bayonet"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colonel", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Colonel"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laos", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Laos"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Laos"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sikhs", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Sikhs"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flag_of_France", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Flag of France"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hell", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Hell"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cannon", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Cannon"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internment", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Internment"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Humidity", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Humidity"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agence_France-Presse", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Agence France-Presse"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Jersey", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "New Jersey"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "New Jersey"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miami", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Miami"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Miami"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canada", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Canada"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Canada"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Military/POW-MIA", "label": "dmoz/Society/Military/POW-MIA", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://bloximages.newyork1.vip.townnews.com/reformer.com/content/tncms/assets/v3/editorial/d/7a/d7ae5800-d31c-5299-88de-bf8042a49f2f/6638ae2b77a4f.image.jpg?crop=512%2C269%2C0%2C36&resize=438%2C230&order=crop%2Cresize", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9538399", "eventUri": "eng-9538399", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-05-07", "textStart": 769, "textEnd": 774}, {"amb": false, "date": "2013-03-", "textStart": 2212, "textEnd": 2220}], "sentiment": 0.08235294117647052, "wgt": 180, "relevance": 1}

There were some platoons and squads wiped out entirely in a single day.\n\nThe 1954 battle in the rugged, remote valley killed thousands of soldiers on both sides in less than two months, from March 13 to May 7, as Vietnamese fighters hemmed in French forces - equipped with superior weapons - and bombarded them with heavy artillery.\n\nIt cost Vietnam 4,020 dead, 10,130 injured and 792 missing, with up to 3,976 fallen soldiers now resting at three cemeteries near Doc Lap (Independence), Him Lam and A1 hills where they fought, only four of them have been identified so far.\n\nI was whimpering looking at dead soldiers all over the battlefield... I kept crying at night, I was only 16 then,\" said Nguyen Duc Noi from Gia Tan commune, Gia Loc district, Hai Duong province.\n\n\"I had to face two things, one was the enemy and the other, death\" the 88-year-old man said, recalling the last attack on the night of May 6 when he and his sleepless comrades had to carry countless wounded soldiers, many of them dead, back to shelter tunnels.\n\nFor Huong, the battle was even more fierce as he was fighting the enemy and getting informed that his little son was killed by French force raids back home.\n\nFierce thirst for independence\n\nDriven by patriotism and a fierce thirst for independence, Huong and Noi, like tens of thousands of youths of their generation, headed to the frontline, fortified by bitter memories of foreign invasions throughout the nation's history.\n\nThey were also buoyed by the call of the nation: \"All for the frontline, all for victory.\"\n\n\"I was the youngest among my hometown boys to volunteer to go to the battle with the support of my mother,\" Noi said, adding that he didn't think much at that time and just wanted to follow his countrymen.\n\nHuong was arrested during a raid by French forces in his village in 1950 and was jailed for one and a half months as he was a member of the National Salvation Youth Union Committee in the locality.\n\nTo get to the Dien Bien Phu battlefront in the Northwest, Huong and Noi trudged through forests for half a month from the central province of Thanh Hoa.\n\n\"We slept in jungles during the day and marched about four hours each night, with a gun and a 10-kg backpack on shoulders. Locals gave us rice, vegetables and other foods to survive,\" Huong recalled.\n\nFor Noi, the most dangerous mission was individual reconnaissance, sometimes conducted by a small group of three, without water and food. \"We had to quickly scout out enemy areas and chart maps,\" said Noi, who had never received military training before.\n\nNoi, Huong and all their comrades dug approach trenches and tunnels day and night, preparing for the historic battle at Dien Bien Phu, which was then the strongest fortified entrenched camp in Indochina under the Navarre Plan mapped out by French colonialists and US interventionists in the autumn - winter of 1953.\n\nPeter Macdonald said in his book titled \"The Victor in Vietnam: Giap\", first published in 1993, that \"Perhaps, though, the most astonishing example of their digging ability was that when they took Dominique they did not establish positions on top of the hill, they dug right through it from behind; outwardly, it look as it always had, pock-marked and rugged; inside it was an ant's nest of weapon pits.\"\n\nHeavy but glorious task\n\nNoi said he was proud of joining all the major attacks from 1952 to 1954, notably one on the fortified French camp at Na San, the northwestern province of Son La, in 1952, when he was wounded, and another on the Dien Bien Phu fortress.\n\nThe soldiers always trust and follow the leadership of President Ho Chi Minh and the command of General Vo Nguyen Giap. (Photo: VNA)\n\nBoth the veterans said they had no idea about the much stronger power of the French forces or what were the tactics employed by President Ho Chi Minh and Vo Nguyen Giap in the Dien Bien Phu, but they always trusted and followed the leadership of President Ho Chi Minh and the command of General Vo Nguyen Giap.\n\nThe two veterans shared a firm belief that without the Party and its sound leadership, the globe-shaking victory would not be achieved.\n\nTalking about the tremendous sacrifice of soldiers at Dien Bien Phu, the veterans expressed hope that present youths would carry forward the tradition of patriotism, consolidate their will and enrich their knowledge in order to contribute to national construction and development.\n\nProfessor Carl Thayer from the University of New South Wales said \"Vietnam's schools, universities and mass organisations should conduct educational programmes and conduct field trips to the Dien Bien Phu battlefield to remind the youths of today that Vietnam's self-reliance and independence due to the sacrifice of those who fell to defeat the French.\"\n\n\"Never was so much owed by so many to so few,\" Thayer cited British statesman Winston Churchill./.", "source": {"uri": "en.vietnamplus.vn", "dataType": "news", "title": "VietnamPlus"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

We no longer think of conflict or hatred. It's good to shake hands as we all want more friends and less enemies,\" Duong said.\n\n- 'Deaths were normal' -\n\nFrance surrendered to Viet Minh attacks on May 7, 1954, putting an end to 56 days of shelling and hand-to-hand combat.\n\nAround 13,000 people were reported dead or missing during the conflict, including 10,000 from the Viet Minh side.\n\n\"I fired a shot which hit two people, killing one on the spot and the other one with one more shot,\" recalled veteran infantry soldier Hoang Van Bay, 93.\n\n\"Injuries and deaths were normal in the battlefield, nothing to be scared of. We fought for our independence and freedom,\" Bay told AFP, adding he visited his fallen comrades at Dien Bien Phu city's cemetery every year.\n\nThe French expeditionary force -- with some 15,000 men of many nationalities -- had underestimated the firepower of the communist forces, who managed to install cannon on the hills overlooking the French camp.\n\nThe Viet Minh had transported them in pieces hundreds of kilometres through the jungle, sometimes by bicycle.\n\nTheir victory later led to the Geneva Accords on July 21, 1954, which marked the end of almost a century of French domination in Indochina and the partition of Vietnam, a prelude to future American involvement.\n\nRelations between the two former enemies are now cordial, despite the human rights abuses of which the communist government is regularly accused.\n\n- 'More openness' -\n\nThe tree-lined streets of Dien Bien Phu were adorned with communist slogans and banners carrying photos of independence hero Ho Chi Minh and General Vo Nguyen Giap, commander in chief of the Dien Bien Phu campaign, ahead of the celebrations.\n\nThe city was busy with crowds of tourists and a heavy military and police presence.\n\nThe province's battle sites are also undergoing a major facelift, with the Vietnamese authorities keen to turn the area into a tourism hotspot.\n\n\"Twenty years ago, it (the commemoration) was much more discreet. There was a sort of holding back on the Vietnamese side because May 7 is sacred for them,\" said Pierre Journoud, professor of contemporary history at Paul Valery-Montpellier University, who is attending the commemorations.\n\n\"We are seeing more openness today.\"\n\nHe said Vietnam's invitation to Lecornu reflects shared political interests, as tensions simmer between Hanoi and Beijing over their competing territorial claims in the South China Sea.\n\nAfter the United States and China, \"France wants to be a third voice in the Asia-Pacific region, and this is in line with the position of Vietnam, which is caught between two strangleholds,\" he said.\n\nPrime Minister Chinh said on Monday the visit was an effort to \"close the past, overcome differences and head towards the future\", in order to promote a strategic relationship between Vietnam and France.\n\nNinety-two-year-old Jean-Yves Guinard, one of three French veterans who returned to their former camp for the anniversary, told AFP he \"remained very attached to this country\".\n\nThe three were surrounded as they arrived at the Dien Bien Phu Victory Museum by locals and tourists trying to take selfies with the former \"enemy\".", "source": {"uri": "digitaljournal.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Digital Journal"}, "authors": [{"uri": "agence_france_presse@digitaljournal.com", "name": "Agence

There were some platoons and squads wiped out entirely in a single day.\n\nThe 1954 battle in the rugged, remote valley killed thousands of soldiers on both sides in less than two months, from March 13 to May 7, as Vietnamese fighters hemmed in French forces - equipped with superior weapons - and bombarded them with heavy artillery.\n\nIt cost Vietnam 4,020 dead, 10,130 injured and 792 missing, with up to 3,976 fallen soldiers now resting at three cemeteries near Doc Lap (Independence), Him Lam and A1 hills where they fought, only four of them have been identified so far.\n\n\"I was whimpering looking at dead soldiers all over the battlefield... I kept crying at night, I was only 16 then,\" said Nguyen Duc Noi from Gia Tan commune, Gia Loc district, Hai Duong province.\n\n\"I had to face two things, one was the enemy and the other, death\" the 88-year-old man said, recalling the last attack on the night of May 6 when he and his sleepless comrades had to carry countless wounded soldiers, many of them dead, back to shelter tunnels.\n\nFor Huong, the battle was even more fierce as he was fighting the enemy and getting informed that his little son was killed by French force raids back home.\n\nFierce thirst for independence\n\nDriven by patriotism and a fierce thirst for independence, Huong and Noi, like tens of thousands of youths of their generation, headed to the frontline, fortified by bitter memories of foreign invasions throughout the nation's history.\n\nThey were also buoyed by the call of the nation: \"All for the frontline, all for victory.\"\n\n\"I was the youngest among my hometown boys to volunteer to go to the battle with the support of my mother,\" Noi said, adding that he didn't think much at that time and just wanted to follow his countrymen.\n\nHuong was arrested during a raid by French forces in his village in 1950 and was jailed for one and a half months as he was a member of the National Salvation Youth Union Committee in the locality.\n\nTo get to the Dien Bien Phu battlefront in the Northwest, Huong and Noi trudged through forests for half a month from the central province of Thanh Hoa.\n\n\"We slept in jungles during the day and marched about four hours each night, with a gun and a 10-kg backpack on shoulders. Locals gave us rice, vegetables and other foods to survive,\" Huong recalled.\n\nFor Noi, the most dangerous mission was individual reconnaissance, sometimes conducted by a small group of three, without water and food. \"We had to quickly scout out enemy areas and chart maps,\" said Noi, who had never received military training before.\n\nNoi, Huong and all their comrades dug approach trenches and tunnels day and night, preparing for the historic battle at Dien Bien Phu, which was then the strongest fortified entrenched camp in Indochina under the Navarre Plan mapped out by French colonialists and US interventionists in the autumn - winter of 1953.\n\nPeter Macdonald said in his book titled \"The Victor in Vietnam: Giap\", first published in 1993, that \"Perhaps, though, the most astonishing example of their digging ability was that when they took Dominique they did not establish positions on top of the hill, they dug right through it from behind; outwardly, it look as it always had, pock-marked and rugged; inside it was an ant's nest of weapon pits.\"\n\nHeavy but glorious task\n\nNoi said he was proud of joining all the major attacks from 1952 to 1954, notably one on the fortified French camp at Na San, the northwestern province of Son La, in 1952, when he was wounded, and another on the Dien Bien Phu fortress.\n\nBoth the veterans said they had no idea about the much stronger power of the French forces or what were the tactics employed by President Ho Chi Minh and Vo Nguyen Giap in the Dien Bien Phu, but they always trusted and followed the leadership of President Ho Chi Minh and the command of General Vo Nguyen Giap.\n\nThe two veterans shared a firm belief that without the Party and its sound leadership, the globe-shaking victory would not be achieved.\n\nTalking about the tremendous sacrifice of soldiers at Dien Bien Phu, the veterans expressed hope that present youths would carry forward the tradition of patriotism, consolidate their will and enrich their knowledge in order to contribute to national construction and development.\n\nProfessor Carl Thayer from the University of New South Wales said \"Vietnam's schools, universities and mass organisations should conduct educational programmes and conduct field trips to the Dien Bien Phu battlefield to remind the youths of today that Vietnam's self-reliance and independence due to the sacrifice of those who fell to defeat the French.\"\n\n\"Never was so much owed by so many to so few,\" Thayer cited British statesman Winston Churchill./.", "source": {"uri": "vietnam.vnanet.vn",

Even if something is extremely difficult, with the people's support it can be done.\"\n\n\"With its correct analysis of the contradictions of the time both nationally and internationally as well as a thorough understanding of the revolutionary movement in the country, the CPV could lay the foundations not just for the victory of the Vietnamese people over colonialism and imperialism, but also for socialism building,\" the researcher stressed.\n\nHe went on to say that in the past, many revolutionaries of different ideologies tried to rise up and drive away colonialism, yet the movement, one after another, failed to eradicate the colonialist yoke and to mobilise the people.\n\n\"It was only the CPV with Marxism-Leninism at its core, under the leadership of President Ho Chi Minh, that could do this, because it could correctly assess the role of the working class and peasantry, and internal contradictions, and could show the people a clear path to a brighter future,\" said Whittaker.\n\nFor the role of President Ho Chi Minh and General Vo Nguyen Giap in the Dien Bien Phu Campaign and other victories of the Vietnamese revolution, he said the two contributed greatly to not just the Vietnamese revolution but also the ideas of subsequent communist and national liberation movements around the globe.\n\n\"President Ho Chi Minh was the first to creatively adapt Marxism-Leninism to Vietnam's conditions in a correct and complete way. His awareness of the struggles against colonialism around the world, his in-depth knowledge of Marxism-Leninism and the Vietnamese history, his analysis of Vietnam's conditions, and his knowledge of military tactics of several armies gave the Vietnamese revolution strengths,\" he said.\n\n\"The leadership of President Ho Chi Minh, as an outstanding revolutionary, has acted as the guiding light of the CPV to the present day embodying his writings on revolutionary ethics, the People's Army, diplomacy, foreign policy and much more.\"\n\nPraising General Vo Nguyen Giap, Whittaker said he is famous worldwide as one of the best military generals and tacticians in the world history.\n\n\"One only needs to read the General's memoirs to see his careful attention to details, his adaptability to changing battlefields, his deep knowledge of the army, and his dedication to ensuring the People's Army was of the best possible quality, and to ensuring revolutionary ethics and clean living conditions, and political and military training,\" the researcher said.\n\nHe emphasised that the leadership of President Ho Chi Minh and General Vo Nguyen Giap in those decisive moments led up to and culminated in the victory Dien Bien Phu.\n\n\"A small army with not enough guns or ammunition, with most using swords and other weapons, could turn into a people's army that would head on face the French at the battle of Dien Bien Phu, what the French forces thought would be an easy victory,\" Whittaker continued.\n\n\"This showed the determination of the Vietnamese people, the discipline and tactical refinement of the People's Army, and the correct leadership of the Party.\"\n\nHe added that the Dien Bien Phu Victory was thanks to the construction of an army for the people, noting the army has carried on the traditions and its members are ready to provide support for the people.\n\nRegarding proletarian internationalism, Whittaker said it was an element behind the success of the Dien Bien Phu campaign.", "source": {"uri": "vietnam.vnanet.vn", "dataType": "news", "title": "vietnam.vnanet.vn"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

Upon returning to Algeria, they brought invaluable combat experiences gained alongside the Vietnamese army and engaged in Algeria's liberation efforts.\n\nPresident Ho Chi Minh and General Vo Nguyen Giap were revered heroes in Algeria, Tayeb stressed, adding that they were brilliant military strategists whose leadership serves as a shining example not only for Algeria but for the entire world. They proved that anything is achievable with a determination and strategy.\n\nLooking beyond the historical significance of the Dien Bien Phu Victory, he commended Vietnam's continued progress, saying that Vietnam has not stopped moving forward since its victory. The country is experiencing remarkable development and has established strong economic ties with the US and many other nations across the world.\n\nTayeb said the AVFA and successful Algerian entrepreneurs have enjoyed collaborative relations with reliable Vietnamese partners. They established Algeria-Vietnam companies in Hanoi, capitalising on Vietnam's strengths in sectors like construction.\n\nEnvisioning even closer cooperation between the two countries, he said there is immense potential for collaboration in construction, fisheries and aquaculture, food processing, and agriculture.\n\nThe establishment of an Algeria-Vietnam bank and the connectivity of air and sea trade routes would be crucial steps in deploying future projects, he said./.\n\nVNA", "source": {"uri": "en.vietnamplus.vn", "dataType": "news", "title": "VietnamPlus"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/\u0110i\u1ec7n_Bi\u00ean_Ph\u1ee7", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "\u0110i\u1ec7n Bi\u00ean Ph\u1ee7"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "\u0110i\u1ec7n Bi\u00ean Ph\u1ee7"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Vietnam"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Revolutionary", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Revolutionary"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algiers", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Algiers"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Algiers"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Algeria"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vietnam", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Vietnam"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Vietnam"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algeria", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Algeria"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Algeria"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wars_of_national_liberation", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Wars of national liberation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Independence", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Independence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colonialism", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Colonialism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/France", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "France"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Veteran", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Veteran"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Africa", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Africa"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/V\u00f5_Nguy\u00ean_Gi\u00e1p", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "V\u00f5 Nguy\u00ean Gi\u00e1p"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liberation_movement", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Liberation movement"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vietnamese_people", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Vietnamese people"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/French_Army", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "French Army"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ho_Chi_Minh", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Ho Chi Minh"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Kingdom", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Germany", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Germany"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Germany"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vietnam_News_Agency", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Vietnam News Agency"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aquaculture", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Aquaculture"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agriculture", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Agriculture"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hanoi", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Hanoi"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Hanoi"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Vietnam"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Military", "label": "dmoz/Society/Military", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Military/Veterans", "label": "dmoz/Society/Military/Veterans", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Territorial_Disputes", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Territorial Disputes", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 59}], "image": "https://imagev3-lang.vietnamplus.vn/1200x630/Uploaded/2024/kg1/2024_05_04/dien-bien-phu-218.jpg.webp", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9538399", "eventUri": "eng-9538399", "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Algiers"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Algeria"}}}, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.3411764705882352, "wgt": 165, "relevance": 1}

He also vowed to send delegations to all defence and security-related meetings during Laos's tenure as ASEAN Chair 2024.\n\nGiang also wished to welcome his guest and other high-ranking Lao leaders to ceremonies marking the 80th anniversary of the Vietnam People's Army, the 35th anniversary of the All-People's Defence Festival, and the Vietnam International Defence Expo 2024 slated for December 19-22./.\n\nVNA", "source": {"uri": "en.vietnamplus.vn", "dataType": "news", "title": "VietnamPlus"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/\u0110i\u1ec7n_Bi\u00ean_Ph\u1ee7", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "\u0110i\u1ec7n Bi\u00ean Ph\u1ee7"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "\u0110i\u1ec7n Bi\u00ean Ph\u1ee7"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Vietnam"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minister_of_National_Defence_(Canada)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Minister of National Defence (Canada)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vietnam", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Vietnam"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Vietnam"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laos", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Laos"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Laos"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vietnamese_people", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Vietnamese people"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lao_people", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Lao people"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Independence", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Independence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colonialism", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Colonialism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ASEAN", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "ASEAN"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vietnam_International", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Vietnam International"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/People's_Army_of_Vietnam", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "People's Army of Vietnam"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/French_colonial_empire", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "French colonial empire"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Military", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Military"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Military/Veterans", "label": "dmoz/Society/Military/Veterans", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 77}], "image": "https://imagev3-lang.vietnamplus.vn/1200x630/Uploaded/2024/kg1/2024_05_06/vietnam-laos-1953.jpg.webp", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9538399", "eventUri": "eng-9538399", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "date": "-12-19", "dateEnd": "-12-22", "textStart": 2522, "textEnd": 2536}, {"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-05-06", "textStart": 143, "textEnd": 148}, {"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-05-07", "textStart": 318, "textEnd": 323}], "sentiment": 0.7176470588235293, "wgt": 164, "relevance": 1}

I have no regrets, no questions on what happened.\"\n\nVinh was part of an anti-aircraft gun regiment which, together with the infantry, brought down 62 French aircraft during the campaign that ended on May 7, 1954.\n\nThe Dien Bien Phu badge, emblazoned with the red military flag of Vietnam, was given to all those involved in the 56-day campaign.\n\nAS IT IS TODAY ...

We talked and sang to cheer ourselves up.

This laid an important international legal foundation for their people to gradually regain national independence and reunification in each country.\n\nTo uphold the tradition of friendship and solidarity among the people of the three nations, he called for promoting patriotism, the spirit of independence, national pride, self-reliance and determination to overcome challenges.\n\nWith regards to the Vietnam-Laos relationship, the ambassador suggested deepening political ties via the effective implementation of high-level agreements and educational campaigns about the bilateral special relations.\n\nTo expand bilateral economic ties, he said it is crucial to offer all possible support to businesses and people of both nations while fully tapping the benefits of existing free trade agreements to extend markets and draw more capital.\n\nHung further noted the immense sense of pride and inspiration the Dien Bien Phu Victory evokes in Vietnamese citizens, especially the younger generation. He described this victory as a powerful source of motivation, encouraging their active involvement in national development and defence efforts.\n\nThe diplomat concluded by expressing his hope that the people of Vietnam and Laos will continue to build upon their tradition of solidarity and partnership, maintain faith in the leadership of both Parties, and work together to leverage each other's advantages for mutual development./.\n\nVNA", "source": {"uri": "en.vietnamplus.vn", "dataType": "news", "title": "VietnamPlus"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mainland_Southeast_Asia", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Mainland Southeast Asia"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/\u0110i\u1ec7n_Bi\u00ean_Ph\u1ee7", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "\u0110i\u1ec7n Bi\u00ean Ph\u1ee7"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "\u0110i\u1ec7n Bi\u00ean Ph\u1ee7"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Vietnam"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vietnam", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Vietnam"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Vietnam"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laos", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Laos"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Laos"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vientiane", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Vientiane"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Vientiane"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Laos"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wars_of_national_liberation", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Wars of national liberation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Territorial_integrity", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Territorial integrity"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Independence", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Independence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/German_reunification", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "German reunification"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cambodia", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Cambodia"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Cambodia"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sovereignty", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Sovereignty"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Self-determination", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Self-determination"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geneva", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Geneva"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Geneva"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Switzerland"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/France", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "France"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_trade_agreement", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Free trade agreement"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Individualism", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Individualism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diplomat", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Diplomat"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patriotism", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Patriotism"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues", "wgt": 8}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics", "wgt": 8}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Military/Veterans", "label": "dmoz/Society/Military/Veterans", "wgt": 9}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Territorial_Disputes", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Territorial Disputes", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Relationships/Friendship", "label": "dmoz/Society/Relationships/Friendship", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 92}], "image": "https://imagev3-lang.vietnamplus.vn/1200x630/Uploaded/2024/kg1/2024_05_05/vo-nguyen-giap-588.jpg.webp", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9538399", "eventUri": "eng-9538399", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.5607843137254902, "wgt": 156, "relevance": 1}

Northern Vietnam was completely liberated and embarked on socialism building, providing a significant impetus the struggle for the liberation of the South and national reunification.\n\nThe committee described the 1954 Dien Bien Phu Victory as one of the great triumphs of the Vietnamese Party, army and people in the struggle against colonial invasion, a symbol of the combat alliance between the armies and people of Vietnam and Laos, and a tremendous source of strength that led the struggle for national liberation of the Lao Party and people to victory.\n\nThe Lao Party, State, and people express profound gratitude and sincere thanks to the significant, invaluable, effective and timely assistance that the Vietnamese Party, State and people extended to Laos in the past as well as in the current cause of national defence, construction and development.\n\nMeanwhile, the CPP Central Committee wrote that over the past seven decades, the glorious Dien Bien Phu Victory, which resonated across the five continents and shook the globe, has been etched in the hearts of the Vietnamese people and international friends. It served as evidence of the solidarity and shared suffering among the three nations of Vietnam, Cambodia and Laos.\n\nThe CPP expressed its firm belief that under the sound leadership of the CPV led by General Secretary Nguyen Phu Trong, the Vietnamese people will achieve new and even greater accomplishments in realising the Resolution of the 13th National Party Congress.\n\nThe CPP highly values the traditional friendship and comprehensive cooperation between the two countries' Parties, States and people under the motto \"fine neighborliness, traditional friendship, comprehensive cooperation and long-term sustainability\", it said./.\n\nVNA", "source": {"uri": "en.vietnamplus.vn", "dataType": "news", "title": "VietnamPlus"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

I have no regrets, no questions on what happened.\"\n\nVinh was part of an anti-aircraft gun regiment which, together with the infantry, brought down 62 French aircraft during the campaign that ended on May 7, 1954.\n\nThe Dien Bien Phu badge, emblazoned with the red military flag of Vietnam, was given to all those involved in the 56-day campaign.\n\n- 'No one complained' -\n\nHo Chi Minh proclaimed national independence in 1945, prompting a lengthy resistance campaign against French colonialists.\n\nHis Viet Minh forces then made what Vietnam terms a \"strategic decision\" in late 1953 to eliminate France's biggest defence stronghold in Indochina, Dien Bien Phu, appointing general Vo Nguyen Giap as commander in chief of its largest military campaign.\n\nSoldiers, civilian volunteers and frontline workers were mobilised to transport weapons, artillery and other crucial supplies through jungles and across mountains to reach the remote battle site near the border with Laos.\n\nNgo Thi Ngoc Diep, aged just 17 and from Hanoi, was given the \"precious opportunity\" to march through the night for several weeks with soldiers, carrying five kilograms (11 pounds) of rice and a shovel.\n\nShe moved only in darkness, between 5 pm and 2 am each day, to avoid being seen by the enemy.\n\n\"My task was to talk, crack jokes and keep up the spirits of the soldiers,\" Diep, now 86, told AFP.\n\nBetween marches, \"we sang, danced or performed role plays, using mostly patriotic and traditional folk themes\", said Diep, wearing her military uniform and playing a homemade musical instrument built from the lids of cigarette lighters -- a replica of one she used at the time.\n\n\"We did not have enough to eat, not enough warm clothes to wear, not enough blankets, and we slept on rice straw,\" Vinh recalled.\n\n\"But no one complained. We talked and sang to cheer ourselves up. It was really fun.\"\n\nAround 55,000 people, most drawn from Vietnam's elite forces, were directly involved in the fighting, according to official figures.\n\nAnother 260,000 people helped with logistics, including walking 21,000 bicycles loaded with rice, salt, oil and weapons to Dien Bien Phu.\n\n- Bodies scattered -\n\nVietnam says 10,000 soldiers and civilians were killed or went missing fighting for the \"earthshaking\" victory.\n\nFrance says 3,000 of their troops were killed in the battle.\n\nVinh recalled the moment a bomb hit his camp close to Dien Bien Phu.\n\n\"I saw my comrades killed on the spot, their bodies scattered on tree branches,\" he said. \"I hated those that took the lives of my fellow soldiers.\"\n\nThe memories of those bloody months live on for him and Diep, who both survived without a scratch.\n\nEach has visited France with their families, but Vinh said he did not tell anyone about the battle while he was there.\n\n\"Though I am proud of my life, I am no hero. I just performed my service as a military man for my country, an ordinary mission with nothing to show off about, even towards the French.\"\n\nGiven the chance, Diep said she would like to shake hands with French war veterans.\n\n\"We can never forget history, but we should close the past. The painful chapters should be left behind us,\" Diep said.", "source": {"uri": "thestandard.com.hk", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Standard"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_Dien_Bien_Phu", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Battle of Dien Bien Phu"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vinh", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Vinh"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Vinh"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Vietnam"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vietnam", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Vietnam"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Vietnam"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/France", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "France"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mainland_Southeast_Asia", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Mainland Southeast Asia"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vi\u1ec7t_Minh", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Vi\u1ec7t Minh"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/French_colonial_empire", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "French colonial empire"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ho_Chi_Minh", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Ho Chi Minh"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hanoi", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Hanoi"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Hanoi"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Vietnam"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Communism", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Communism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rifle", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Rifle"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metal", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Metal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/V\u00f5_Nguy\u00ean_Gi\u00e1p", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "V\u00f5 Nguy\u00ean Gi\u00e1p"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/War_flag", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "War flag"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Military_campaign", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Military campaign"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jungle", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Jungle"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infantry", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Infantry"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Independence", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Independence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regiment", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Regiment"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artillery", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Artillery"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Self-determination", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Self-determination"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anti-aircraft_warfare", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Anti-aircraft warfare"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commander-in-chief", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Commander-in-chief"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pound_sterling", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Pound sterling"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rice", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Rice"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laos", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Laos"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Laos"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Military_uniform", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Military uniform"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Musical_instrument", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Musical instrument"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Warfare_and_Conflict", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Warfare and Conflict", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Military", "label": "dmoz/Society/Military", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Military/POW-MIA", "label": "dmoz/Society/Military/POW-MIA", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 72}], "image": "https://www.thestandard.com.hk/images/instant_news/20240504/20240504122358contentPhoto1.png", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9538399", "eventUri": "eng-9538399", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.2313725490196078, "wgt": 153, "relevance": 1}

In particular, the Vietnamese people's Dien Bien Phu Victory was a great source of aspirations and encouragement for the revolution and people of Algeria as well as the national liberation movement of colonial nations as a whole.\n\nOn the occasion of the 70th anniversary of the Dien Bien Phu Victory (May 7, 1954 - 2024), Algerian Minister of Mujahideen (War Veterans) and Rights Holders Laid Rebiga granted an interview to VietnamPlus E-newspaper, sharing the significance and similarities in the national liberation movement between the two nations.\n\nTwo nations, one common enemy\n\nReporter: During Algeria's struggle for independence, there were people who were forced by the French army to fight in Indochina, then they left the French army, sided with Vietnam or returned home and joined the forces. Algerian resistance. Can you tell us about the contributions of these people to the fight to liberate Algeria from the French colonialists?\n\nMinister Laid Rebiga: In the beginning, before we answer directly on this topic, let us at least recall the specificity of this year. The year 2024 is a very important year for Algeria and I think it is also important for Vietnam and the Vietnamese people for whom we have a lot of love and appreciation, this year Algeria celebrates the seventieth anniversary of the outbreak of the blessed liberation revolution and also the same thing I think it is the seventieth anniversary celebrated during this year for the Vietnamese people for the eternal battle of \"Dien Bien Phu\", of course there should be a very special relationship between the Vietnamese peoples and the Algerian people on the basis of that common struggle. Those common principles that you share with our Vietnamese brothers in their battle or say their eternal battles against imperialism and against occupation, there are many starting points that unite the two peoples. The Algerian people and the Vietnamese people. I say it was the beginning of a special relationship that brought them together dating back to the stage of the national movement, where there was pioneering work and reference work in our relations with the Vietnamese people, starting from that work within the region of the Commonwealth of Colonial States, which brought together many world leaders and brought together Algerians and Vietnamese, and on top of them, I say from the Algerian side, that founding member who has a history for the Algerian national movement, Sheikh Ali Abdelkader, who met Ho Chi Minh. In their work, many things related to the vision of the movement or carrying out armed action and the need to restore national sovereignty were established within the framework of a participatory approach in which many shared, whether the different colonies of the French occupation or the American occupation.\n\nReporter: Can you share about the feelings of the Algerian people towards Vietnam during the period when the two countries had a common enemy, the French colonialists? Including the anti-war movement in 1947, when the Algerian people prevented French ships carrying weapons to Vietnam?\n\nMinister Laid Rebiga: As we have already said, relations are special and very distinctive relations between the Vietnamese people and the Algerian people on the basis that they who shared the tribulations and pains in the period of colonialism and occupation, it was necessary to harmonize global efforts in the framework of combating the phenomenon of occupation, there are many Algerian leaders, politicians and military who immortalized many positions towards the Vietnamese struggle, especially \"Mohamed Khider\" in 1947 for what he mentioned in many of his positions and meetings the need to expose methods The colonialism practiced against the Vietnamese people, this position of one of the leaders of the blessed revolution, and I also say that many of the Algerian youth who were given the force to be recruited to fight in the ranks of the French army against the Vietnamese people. But all these plans failed and did not succeed because Algeria and the youth, especially those who are aware, whether they fled the ranks of the French soldiers to join the Vietnamese revolution, in addition to many of them who followed the example of those events that took place within the framework of forced recruitment against the Algerian youth, immortalized the positions because they conveyed those successive victories to the Vietnamese, especially in the battle of \"Dien Bien Phu\", they transmitted them to the Algerian people and were used as a base to raise motivation and also to resume and the need to accelerate armed action for the Algerian revolution, these are some of the positions we mention to one of the leaders of the liberation revolution, we mention Mustapha Ben Boulaid and also Karim Belkacem, who were behind the outbreak of the liberation revolution within the framework of coordinated work in Algeria for a group of young people who gathered on those human values that we shared and share with our brothers in Vietnam, these young people whose battle \"Dien Bien Phu\" was one of the main factors in accelerating armed action in Algeria.\n\n\"We are races that do not accept occupation\"\n\nReporter: Speaking of Vietnam's \"Dien Bien Phu Victory\", in your opinion, what impact did that victory have on Algeria's movement to fight for independence? Just like other African countries are also French colonies?\n\nMinister Laid Rebiga: In this context, we say that many of the values that unite the two countries, especially the values of struggle. The values of struggle on which the two revolutions were based, the Vietnamese revolution and the Algerian revolution, based on those values that we shared, were the cause of influencing the liberation movements in the world, especially in Asia and Africa, the battle of Dien Bien Phu and other battles, in addition to Vietnam for Algeria and the outbreak of the blessed revolution that was preceded by the national and popular resistance, are all values that we share, because I say of a race that does not accept occupation, and the proof of this is that tax. The tax of millions of martyrs was paid in order to restore the national sovereignty of the brotherly Vietnamese people or the Algerian people.\n\nReporter: In terms of military, what similarities do we have between Algeria and Vietnam in the fight against French colonialism?\n\nMinister Laid Rebiga: I think that the humanitarian premises are what most unite the two brotherly peoples that require man's love for freedom and emancipation and his hatred of occupation and enslavement, and I think that this is what exists more in the two peoples. Therefore, those common values that we defended were the tax that the Vietnamese people paid nearly more than a million dead and millions wounded. As for Algeria, during the period of the war of liberation, one and a half million martyrs and thousands of wounded, displaced and dead. It was launched by those common human values that we share and the principles of freedom on which the leaders of the revolution and the leaders of Vietnam are based and shared.\n\nReporter: Could you tell us about the love that the Algerian people have for leader Ho Chi Minh and General Vo Nguyen Giap of Vietnam?\n\nMinister Laid Rebiga: First of all, I think that Algeria has respect and appreciation for the Vietnamese people, especially for the leaders, led by Ho Chi Minh and General Giap. Ho Chi Minh is a brilliant politician who was able with his skill and will to change a lot of things for the Vietnamese people, he is also the person who defended the oppressed peoples of the world and supported the liberation movements, so the man was a strong man and had an impact on building Vietnam, in addition to the general \"Giab\" who is known to Algerians and Algeria because he immortalized his famous saying that Algeria is the only country that moved its revolution to the heart of a country The enemy, this saying was preserved by all Algerians from him at the back of the heart. We have great appreciation for Ho Chi Minh, the distinguished politician and General Giap, the man who, through his military acumen, was able to trample the most powerful powers in the world, namely the French and American occupation forces, and he can rightly be called the first to fight imperialism.\n\nReporter: Thank you very much for your interview!\n\nVNA\n\nM\u1eddi qu\u00fd \u0111\u1ed9c gi\u1ea3 theo d\u00f5i VOV.VN tr\u00ean", "source": {"uri": "english.vov.vn", "dataType": "news", "title": "VOV - VOV Online Newspaper"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_Dien_Bien_Phu", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Battle of Dien Bien Phu"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wars_of_national_liberation", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Wars of national liberation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vietnamese_people", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Vietnamese people"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/French_Army", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "French Army"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mujahideen", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Mujahideen"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vietnam", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Vietnam"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Vietnam"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algeria", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Algeria"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Algeria"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/French_colonial_empire", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "French colonial empire"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indonesian_National_Revolution", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Indonesian National Revolution"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/French_Indochina", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "French Indochina"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Revolutionary", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Revolutionary"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colonialism", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Colonialism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/French_Algeria", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "French Algeria"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Occupation_of_Japan", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Occupation of Japan"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anti-war_movement", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Anti-war movement"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Imperialism", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Imperialism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ho_Chi_Minh", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Ho Chi Minh"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colony", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Colony"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nation_state", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Nation state"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/French_language", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "French language"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commonwealth_of_Nations", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Commonwealth of Nations"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algerian_War", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Algerian War"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/V\u00f5_Nguy\u00ean_Gi\u00e1p", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "V\u00f5 Nguy\u00ean Gi\u00e1p"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bangladesh_Liberation_War", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Bangladesh Liberation War"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cuban_Revolution", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Cuban Revolution"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Independence", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Independence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slavery", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Slavery"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asia", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Asia"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Africa", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Africa"}, "location": null}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Territorial_Disputes", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Territorial Disputes", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Labor", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Labor", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 51}], "image": "https://vov-media.emitech.vn/sites/default/files/styles/og_image_en/public/2024-05/Screenshot_1_1.jpg?v=1715004512", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9538399", "eventUri": "eng-9538399", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1215686274509804, "wgt": 146, "relevance": 1}

In particular, the Vietnamese people's Dien Bien Phu Victory was a great source of aspirations and encouragement for the revolution and people of Algeria as well as the national liberation movement of colonial nations as a whole.\n\nOn the occasion of the 70th anniversary of the Dien Bien Phu Victory (May 7, 1954 - 2024), Algerian Minister of Mujahideen (War Veterans) and Rights Holders Laid Rebiga granted an interview to VietnamPlus E-newspaper, sharing the significance and similarities in the national liberation movement between the two nations.\n\nTwo nations, one common enemy\n\nReporter: During Algeria's struggle for independence, there were people who were forced by the French army to fight in Indochina, then they left the French army, sided with Vietnam or returned home and joined the forces. Algerian resistance. Can you tell us about the contributions of these people to the fight to liberate Algeria from the French colonialists?\n\nMinister Laid Rebiga: In the beginning, before we answer directly on this topic, let us at least recall the specificity of this year. The year 2024 is a very important year for Algeria and I think it is also important for Vietnam and the Vietnamese people for whom we have a lot of love and appreciation, this year Algeria celebrates the seventieth anniversary of the outbreak of the blessed liberation revolution and also the same thing I think it is the seventieth anniversary celebrated during this year for the Vietnamese people for the eternal battle of \"Dien Bien Phu\", of course there should be a very special relationship between the Vietnamese peoples and the Algerian people on the basis of that common struggle. Those common principles that you share with our Vietnamese brothers in their battle or say their eternal battles against imperialism and against occupation, there are many starting points that unite the two peoples. The Algerian people and the Vietnamese people. I say it was the beginning of a special relationship that brought them together dating back to the stage of the national movement, where there was pioneering work and reference work in our relations with the Vietnamese people, starting from that work within the region of the Commonwealth of Colonial States, which brought together many world leaders and brought together Algerians and Vietnamese, and on top of them, I say from the Algerian side, that founding member who has a history for the Algerian national movement, Sheikh Ali Abdelkader, who met Ho Chi Minh. In their work, many things related to the vision of the movement or carrying out armed action and the need to restore national sovereignty were established within the framework of a participatory approach in which many shared, whether the different colonies of the French occupation or the American occupation.\n\nReporter: Can you share about the feelings of the Algerian people towards Vietnam during the period when the two countries had a common enemy, the French colonialists? Including the anti-war movement in 1947, when the Algerian people prevented French ships carrying weapons to Vietnam?\n\nMinister Laid Rebiga: As we have already said, relations are special and very distinctive relations between the Vietnamese people and the Algerian people on the basis that they who shared the tribulations and pains in the period of colonialism and occupation, it was necessary to harmonize global efforts in the framework of combating the phenomenon of occupation, there are many Algerian leaders, politicians and military who immortalized many positions towards the Vietnamese struggle, especially \"Mohamed Khider\" in 1947 for what he mentioned in many of his positions and meetings the need to expose methods The colonialism practiced against the Vietnamese people, this position of one of the leaders of the blessed revolution, and I also say that many of the Algerian youth who were given the force to be recruited to fight in the ranks of the French army against the Vietnamese people. But all these plans failed and did not succeed because Algeria and the youth, especially those who are aware, whether they fled the ranks of the French soldiers to join the Vietnamese revolution, in addition to many of them who followed the example of those events that took place within the framework of forced recruitment against the Algerian youth, immortalized the positions because they conveyed those successive victories to the Vietnamese, especially in the battle of \"Dien Bien Phu\", they transmitted them to the Algerian people and were used as a base to raise motivation and also to resume and the need to accelerate armed action for the Algerian revolution, these are some of the positions we mention to one of the leaders of the liberation revolution, we mention Mustapha Ben Boulaid and also Karim Belkacem, who were behind the outbreak of the liberation revolution within the framework of coordinated work in Algeria for a group of young people who gathered on those human values that we shared and share with our brothers in Vietnam, these young people whose battle \"Dien Bien Phu\" was one of the main factors in accelerating armed action in Algeria.\n\n\"We are races that do not accept occupation\"\n\nReporter: Speaking of Vietnam's \"Dien Bien Phu Victory\", in your opinion, what impact did that victory have on Algeria's movement to fight for independence? Just like other African countries are also French colonies?\n\nMinister Laid Rebiga: In this context, we say that many of the values that unite the two countries, especially the values of struggle. The values of struggle on which the two revolutions were based, the Vietnamese revolution and the Algerian revolution, based on those values that we shared, were the cause of influencing the liberation movements in the world, especially in Asia and Africa, the battle of Dien Bien Phu and other battles, in addition to Vietnam for Algeria and the outbreak of the blessed revolution that was preceded by the national and popular resistance, are all values that we share, because I say of a race that does not accept occupation, and the proof of this is that tax. The tax of millions of martyrs was paid in order to restore the national sovereignty of the brotherly Vietnamese people or the Algerian people.\n\nReporter: In terms of military, what similarities do we have between Algeria and Vietnam in the fight against French colonialism?\n\nMinister Laid Rebiga: I think that the humanitarian premises are what most unite the two brotherly peoples that require man's love for freedom and emancipation and his hatred of occupation and enslavement, and I think that this is what exists more in the two peoples. Therefore, those common values that we defended were the tax that the Vietnamese people paid nearly more than a million dead and millions wounded. As for Algeria, during the period of the war of liberation, one and a half million martyrs and thousands of wounded, displaced and dead. It was launched by those common human values that we share and the principles of freedom on which the leaders of the revolution and the leaders of Vietnam are based and shared.\n\nReporter: Could you tell us about the love that the Algerian people have for leader Ho Chi Minh and General Vo Nguyen Giap of Vietnam?\n\nMinister Laid Rebiga: First of all, I think that Algeria has respect and appreciation for the Vietnamese people, especially for the leaders, led by Ho Chi Minh and General Giap. Ho Chi Minh is a brilliant politician who was able with his skill and will to change a lot of things for the Vietnamese people, he is also the person who defended the oppressed peoples of the world and supported the liberation movements, so the man was a strong man and had an impact on building Vietnam, in addition to the general \"Giab\" who is known to Algerians and Algeria because he immortalized his famous saying that Algeria is the only country that moved its revolution to the heart of a country The enemy, this saying was preserved by all Algerians from him at the back of the heart. We have great appreciation for Ho Chi Minh, the distinguished politician and General Giap, the man who, through his military acumen, was able to trample the most powerful powers in the world, namely the French and American occupation forces, and he can rightly be called the first to fight imperialism.\n\nReporter: Thank you very much for your interview!\n\nVNA", "source": {"uri":

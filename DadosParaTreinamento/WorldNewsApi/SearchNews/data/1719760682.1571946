{"id": 225014784, "title": "Bridezilla scammed \u00a320,000 in wedding gifts to buy luxury home \u2013 she didn\u2019' need the money", "text": "When a couple gets married it\u2019s traditional to buy them a gift if you attend their wedding. Some people put together a list of things they want for the house, while others ask for contributions to their honeymoon. However, a disgruntled bridesmaid revealed how her former friend managed to swindle a small fortune out of her bridal party, which she ended up putting towards a luxury home. Sharing all, Tammy* explained that when her friend Kate* got engaged to Carl* she was over the moon for her and immediately accepted when she was asked to be a bridesmaid. Tammy added that Kate\u2019s father had died when she was younger and was very upset that he wouldn\u2019t be at the wedding. Because of this Tammy said she and the other bridesmaids wanted to give her the best time to make her happy. Tammy wrote: \u201cWedding planning was going great and we are planning the bach trip when Kate asks me about having all the bridesmaids chip in to \u2018keep prices as low as possible for her and Carl since business has slowed up\u2019. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t an issue for us to pitch in, we knew we would have to and even offered to help more after finding out that Carl and Kate were struggling. Keeping costs low for a 9-day trip to Hawaii is a stretch but after all, it\u2019s a good time. Kate's birthday would also fall on this trip so it was a bach/birthday celebration for her. \u201cKate messaged our group chat to let us know that we would all split the Airbnb in Hawaii and that we would also be responsible for our dresses, shoes, jewelry, alterations, and the like. Fine\u2026 it\u2019s as expected. About \u00a3480 ($600) for outfit and accessories including the \u00a340 ($50) per person for dress alterations. \u201cKate said we could give her the money for the Airbnb so she could pay with her card and it would be all taken care of. We agreed and asked how much it would be for all of us to split it. (10 people going but I offered to pay for Kate\u2019s portion as a gift to her for the wedding/birthday.) It was going to be \u00a3700 ($900) PER PERSON to stay. That\u2019s a little steep but I figured Kate had picked out the most fabulous of places including a pool, hot tub, sauna.. whatever. I wasn\u2019t thrilled with the price and offered to help her find a cheaper place but she insisted and I gave her the money. Airfare was another \u00a3390 ($500) per person which went on mother-of-bride\u2019s card.\u201d Tammy, Kate and everyone else had a great time on the hen party, which was described as \u201cgorgeous\u201d with a \u201cbeachfront, personal chef, housemaids\u201d. She went on: \u201cWe had so much fun but I noticed like 3 days in that Kate was fake drinking. I only caught it because we\u2019re out and I heard her quietly order a \u2018watered-down cranberry juice\u2019 that looked very similar to drinks she had been having at the house. I didn\u2019t say anything as to alert anyone else. That\u2019s not my news to tell.\u201d Tammy revealed that following the hen party in Hawaii the wedding preparations really ramped up and Kate asked again if she and a few of the other bridesmaids could chip into paying for their rooms at the venues, seeing as they were staying over. She wrote: \u201cWe opted to grab a few hotel rooms that were cheaper nearby. This sent Kate into a spiral of anger because \u2018we weren\u2019t helping enough\u2019. I tried politely explaining that we had already paid a large amount of money and that we had our own things to pay for so we wouldn\u2019t spend all the extra on her wedding and expenses. She stops replying.\u201d Fast forward to the wedding day and Tammy explained that the day was perfect, like \u201ca scene straight from the movies\u201d. She wrote: \u201cWhen it was Kate\u2019s turn to speak she said she had wanted to thank everyone for attending and helping. Kate begins to tear up speaking about her father but states that he had left her the best gift of all\u2026 marrying the man of her dreams ALL EXPENSES PAID. \u201cHe left her a big fat trust in which she could access to pay for her wedding, dress, venue, bachelor/bachelorette trips, catering, the whole nine. The bridal party sat jaws dropped at what we had just heard after supplying actual thousands to support her wedding and bach trip. WHERE DID OUR MONEY GO?! \u201cAll of us too stunned to speak just stared at Kate as she ended her speech and scurried out the back entrance where she and Carl proceeded to leave for their honeymoon (also funded by the trust, might I add.) Everyone was frantically calling and texting Kate and Carl trying to figure out what was happening\u2026 radio silence. \u201cA week after the wedding, I finally received a call from Kate explaining the situation. She claims that she didn\u2019t know the wedding and its festivities were fully funded until a month before the wedding which I didn\u2019t believe. I asked her if we could get our money back and she said that it had already been spent and that she was sorry but it was a gift so she used it as such.\u201d Tammy added that Kate never actually admitted to her what she spent the money on but several weeks later she saw a Facebook post. She revealed: \u201cKate had written, \u2018We are so blessed to announce the best wedding gift of all\u2026 Baby blank coming soon! We also want to take this time to thank all of our wonderful bridesmaids, groomsmen, friends, and family for the gracious gifts that we have put towards our new family home!\u2019 insert photo of ultrasound picture and photo of \u00a3791,000 ($996,000) home here.\" Read more: Sign up to Mirror US's SMS updates for the latest straight from the newsroom For all the latest on news, politics, sports, and showbiz from the USA, go to The Mirror US. \u201cI have since deleted Kate from everything and removed Carl from Facebook. I tried to contact her about all of this and never got a response so I gave up. I got a baby shower invitation in the mail last week and it got me stewing again\u2026 I will not be going or contributing another cent. \u201cAfter speaking with others who paid in and are also still furious, we estimate that we all contributed about \u00a320,000 ($25,000) for them to buy a new house. I also found out that Carl knew the whole time and so did Kate\u2019s mom.\u201d Redditors reading the post were horrified by Kate and Carl's behaviour. One person replied: \"As as soon as I read, 'They are struggling' and 'bach trip of 9 days in Hawaii' my brain hit a speed bump!\" While another user suggested: \"I would post on FB a condensed version of this and then a video of me burning the invitation\u2026 I would also tag all the bridesmaids.\" *Names have been changed.

The co-owners of a coaching centre basement in Delhi's old Rajinder Nagar where three UPSC aspirants drowned have moved a special Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) court seeking bail after the investigation in the case was transferred to the CBI by the High Court.\n\nNew Delhi [India], August 7 (ANI): The co-owners of a coaching centre basement in Delhi's old Rajinder Nagar where three UPSC aspirants drowned have moved a special Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) court seeking bail after the investigation in the case was transferred to the CBI by the High Court.\n\nThe Rouse Avenue court will hear bail pleas today.\n\nAlso Read | Bangladesh Unrest: BSF Asks Troopers To Be Ready To Address Any Adverse Situation Promptly.\n\nPrincipal District and Session judge Anuj Bajaj Chandana on Tuesday listed the matter for hearing on Wednesday.\n\nAccused Harvinder, Tejinder, Parvinder and Sarabjeet have moved bail pleas through Advocates Kaushal Jeet Kait, Daksh Gupta, Jatin Gupta and others.\n\nAlso Read | Government Gives Option To Calculate LTCG Tax on Properties, Pay Lower Tax.\n\nThe accused have been booked under sections 105, 106(1), 115(2), 290, and 3(5) of Bharatiya Nyaya Sanhita (BNS), 2023, in a case registered at Police Station Rajinder Nagar on July 27. The accused were arrested on July 28.\n\nIt is stated that subsequent to the order dated August 2, 2024, of the High Court, the Sessions Court at Tis Hazari, by way of an order dated August 5, 2024, dismissed the bail application with the liberty to approach the appropriate court.\n\nEarlier, their applications were dismissed by the Metropolitan Magistrate on July 31, 2024.\n\nThe court has granted Liberty to accused persons to approach the competent court.\n\nAccused persons have sought bail on grounds that the Metropolitan Magistrate did not consider the fact that the applicant was not named in the FIR and the applicant, alongwith other co-owners, as good Samaritans themselves, went to the police station and was subjected to custody of the Investigating Officer, despite the fact that the IO had not even called them, which clearly shows the bona fide of the applicants.\n\nIt also stated that the trial court did not consider the submissions and material placed on record by the accused persons.\n\nIt is also stated that the magistrate court did not deal with the registered lease deed and its terms, which, in the eyes of law, have judicial sanctity and have a pivotal bearing on the status and locus of the co-owners.\n\nIt is also stated that the court failed to consider and did not appreciate the fact that the applicant had merely given the basement and third floor on lease for running the coaching centre, which is an activity permissible by the norms of MCD.\n\nThe accused persons further stated that while dismissing the bail applications, the court did not consider the fact that invocation of provision as stipulated under section 105 (Culpable homicide not amounting to murder) of the BNS Act does not in any manner attract the attention of the given facts of the case against the applicant and other co-owners, as they never \"intended\" nor had any \"knowledge\" to commit such a crime as alleged by the prosecution and also the fact that the prosecution could not establish and link the applicants with any act, much less the intention and knowledge to commit such a crime and therefore the applicability of Section 105 BNS by the prosecution is a sham and feeble attempts to increase the gravity of the case and also to circumvent the law laid down in the Arnesh Kumar and Satinder Antil judgement by the Hon'ble Supreme Court of India.\n\nOn July 31, while dismissing the bail plea, the court said that the allegations against the accused person are serious in nature. The court has been apprised that the role of other civic agencies are being investigated thoroughly. The investigation is at a very nascent stage. Keeping in view facts and circumstances of the case, the plea of the accused seeking enlargement on bail was dismissed.\n\nAdvocate Amit Chaddha earlier had argued for accused Tejinder, Harvinder, Parvinder and Sarabjeet. They were part owners of the building where the coaching centre was being run.\n\nThey approached the police; they did not abscond. They could abscond, but they went beside the police. It shows their bona fide, Advocate Chadha submitted.\n\nThe entire case is that the place was leased out for some purposes, but it was used for another purpose. It is a violation under MCD rules, he added.\n\nThe library is not as big as in courts or in college. It was a place for study between the classes, Chaddha submitted.\n\nHe further submitted that there was no intention or knowledge. This incident occurred due to desilting and rain. It was an act of God that could be avoided by the authorities.\n\n\"It is an organised crime. You know what is happening in your area and keep your eyes closed,\" Chaddha argued.\n\nDelhi police have invoked sections 106 (death caused by negligence) and 105 (culpable homicide not amounting to murder).\n\nThese sections have been invoked to bypass the judgement of the Supreme Court in Arnesh Kumar and Satender Antil, the counsel argued.\n\nThe counsel for the accused also produced a fire safety certificate, declaring it fit for occupancy and coaching. Other agencies also could do this. It was not my responsibility, he added.\n\nAdditional Public Prosecutor (APP) Atul Srivastava opposed the bail applications. He had submitted This very property in the name of Neelam Vohra. Her husband sold this property to the accused. Neelam Vohra had reconstructed this building. The Completion certificate shows that the basement was for warehouse purposes.\n\nNo contract can override the jurisdiction of the court. Sections 105 and 106 can be invoked together at the same time.\n\nThey are also covered under Section 45 (Abetment Proceedings). Why did not you check why there is so much crowd in the basement? It was meant for warehouse purposes. The abetment is made out against the accused persons. It is a very serious case. It is a very initial stage, APP argued.

Keeping in view facts and circumstances of the case, the plea of the accused seeking enlargement on bail was dismissed.\n\nAdvocate Amit Chaddha earlier had argued for accused Tejinder, Harvinder, Parvinder and Sarabjeet. They were part owners of the building where the coaching centre was being run.\n\nThey approached the police; they did not abscond. They could abscond, but they went beside the police. It shows their bona fide, Advocate Chadha submitted.\n\nThe entire case is that the place was leased out for some purposes, but it was used for another purpose. It is a violation under MCD rules, he added.\n\nThe library is not as big as in courts or in college. It was a place for study between the classes, Chaddha submitted.\n\nHe further submitted that there was no intention or knowledge. This incident occurred due to desilting and rain. It was an act of God that could be avoided by the authorities.\n\n\"It is an organised crime. You know what is happening in your area and keep your eyes closed,\" Chaddha argued.\n\nDelhi police have invoked sections 106 (death caused by negligence) and 105 (culpable homicide not amounting to murder).\n\nThese sections have been invoked to bypass the judgement of the Supreme Court in Arnesh Kumar and Satender Antil, the counsel argued.\n\nThe counsel for the accused also produced a fire safety certificate, declaring it fit for occupancy and coaching. Other agencies also could do this. It was not my responsibility, he added.\n\nAdditional Public Prosecutor (APP) Atul Srivastava opposed the bail applications. He had submitted This very property in the name of Neelam Vohra. Her husband sold this property to the accused. Neelam Vohra had reconstructed this building. The Completion certificate shows that the basement was for warehouse purposes.\n\nNo contract can override the jurisdiction of the court. Sections 105 and 106 can be invoked together at the same time.\n\nThey are also covered under Section 45 (Abetment Proceedings). Why did not you check why there is so much crowd in the basement? It was meant for warehouse purposes. The abetment is made out against the accused persons. It is a very serious case. It is a very initial stage, APP argued.

A senior CBI official stated that the agency has registered an FIR and obtained all investigative documents from the Delhi Police.\n\n\"Following initial formalities, the CBI team will visit the incident site for a comprehensive investigation,\" the official added. On August 2, the Delhi High Court had shifted the investigation to the CBI, expressing dissatisfaction with the Delhi Police's efforts in the case.\n\nEarlier on Wednesday, the Rouse Avenue Court issued a notice to the CBI after hearing bail pleas from four co-owners of the basement. Principal District and Sessions Judge Anuj Bajaj Chandana called for a status report from the CBI, noting that the transfer process instructed by the High Court was incomplete. The co-owners, arrested on July 28, have been booked under various sections of the Bharatiya Nyaya Sanhita, 2023, in an FIR filed at Rajinder Nagar Police Station on July 27.\n\nOn August 5, the Supreme Court took suo motu cognizance of safety concerns in coaching centers. Justices Surya Kant and Ujjal Bhuyan labeled such institutes as \"death chambers\" during a hearing of a petition filed by the Coaching Federation of India. The court criticized recent incidents, including the Old Rajinder Nagar tragedy, and suggested that coaching centers operate online until they comply with the Master Plan of Delhi, 2021, and Unified Building Bye-Laws of Delhi, 2016.", "source": {"uri": "devdiscourse.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Devdiscourse"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_Bureau_of_Investigation", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Central Bureau of Investigation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Union_Public_Service_Commission", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Union Public Service Commission"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Delhi_High_Court", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Delhi High Court"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Delhi", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Delhi"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Delhi"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rajinder_Nagar_Assembly_constituency", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Rajinder Nagar Assembly constituency"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supreme_Court_of_India", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Supreme Court of India"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First_information_report", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "First information report"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Delhi_Police", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Delhi Police"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bail", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Bail"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ujjal_Bhuyan", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Ujjal Bhuyan"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/High_Court_of_Australia", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "High Court of Australia"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sua_sponte", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Sua sponte"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Auto_rickshaw", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Auto rickshaw"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/District", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "District"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/India", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "India"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Law", "label": "dmoz/Society/Law", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Law/Legal_Information", "label": "dmoz/Society/Law/Legal Information", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Crime_and_Justice", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Crime and Justice", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Law/Courts", "label": "dmoz/Society/Law/Courts", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Research", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Research", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 46}], "image": "https://www.devdiscourse.com/remote.axd?https://devdiscourse.blob.core.windows.net/devnews/07_08_2024_13_19_11_9159478.jpg?width=920&format=jpeg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9797008", "eventUri": "eng-9797008", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-08-02", "textStart": 803, "textEnd": 811}, {"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-07-28", "textStart": 1287, "textEnd": 1294}, {"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-07-27", "textStart": 1426, "textEnd": 1433}, {"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-08-05", "textStart": 1439, "textEnd": 1447}], "sentiment": -0.1843137254901961, "wgt": 169, "relevance": 1}

He argued that his clients are just owners of the building and till the time CBI starts the investigation, they should be provided interim bail.\n\nThe court issued notice to the CBI and listed the case for August 9.

The court stated that it would hear the bail plea after the status report is filed.\n\nNotably, the Delhi High Court on August 2 transferred the investigation into the deaths of three UPSC aspirants in Old Rajinder Nagar to the CBI. The court cited the seriousness of the incidents and the potential involvement of corruption by public servants as reasons for this decision.\n\nThe court also castigated the police and Municipal Corporation of Delhi (MCD) over the incident, saying it was unable to fathom how the students could not come out.

This decision follows the Delhi High Court's criticism of the Delhi Police's inability to act against Municipal Corporation of Delhi (MCD) officials.\n\nThe Delhi High Court, expressing dissatisfaction with the Delhi government's infrastructure management, ordered the CBI to investigate the incident.

The flooding led to protests outside the coaching center, prompting police to declare the area a crime scene and seal it off.\n\nProtesters, demanding accountability, blocked the road leading to the Karol Bagh metro station.

The committee, led by an Additional Secretary from the Ministry of Housing and Urban Affairs (MoHUA), includes the Principal Secretary (Home) of Delhi, a Special Commissioner of Police, the Fire Advisor, and a Joint Secretary as the convener. The panel is expected to submit its report within 30 days.\n\nThe CBI's involvement aims to ensure a thorough and unbiased investigation, addressing the concerns raised by the High Court and the public.

No ruling has been issued in response.\n\nDarrell Wilson, a spokesperson for the ship's owner, said Tuesday evening that some crew members are scheduled to leave.\n\n\"A portion of the crew are going home and a portion are remaining here to assist with the investigation,\" he said in a text message.\n\nWilson said he was unable to provide additional details about how many crew members were leaving and when. He also said he wasn't sure when the ship itself would leave Baltimore for Norfolk, Virginia, where it will receive more extensive repairs.\n\nThe hulking container ship remained pinned amid the wreckage of the fallen bridge for almost two months while workers removed thousands and thousands of tons of mangled steel and concrete from the bottom of the Patapsco River at the entrance to Baltimore's harbor.\n\nThe ship's crew remained onboard even when explosives were detonated to break apart fallen bridge trusses and free the vessel from a massive steel span that landed across its bow.\n\nThe ongoing civil litigation began with a petition from the ship's owner and manager, two Singapore-based companies, seeking to limit their legal liability for the deadly disaster.\n\nA National Transportation Safety Board investigation found the ship experienced two power outages in the hours before it left the Port of Baltimore. In the moments before the bridge collapse, it lost power again and veered off course. The agency's investigation is still ongoing to determine what exactly caused the electrical issues.\n\nThe FBI also launched a criminal investigation.\n\nAccording to the emails included in Tuesday's court filings, the eight crew members scheduled to return home have already been interviewed by Department of Justice investigators and that the department doesn't object to their departure. The crew members will fly out of Baltimore \"likely on or about June 20th,\" an attorney for the ship's owner and manager wrote.

Bredar had not responded to the petitions as of 5 p.m.\n\n\"The crew consists entirely of foreign nationals who, of course, have critical knowledge and information about the events giving rise to this litigation,\" wrote Adam J. Levitt, one of the lawyers for the city. \"If they are permitted to leave the United States, Claimants may never have the opportunity to question or depose them.\"\n\nThe petitions ask Bredar to require the crew to stay in the U.S. until they receive further instructions from the court, and an order requiring the ship's lawyers to guarantee the crew's continued availability for depositions.\n\nThe cargo vessel Dali struck the Key Bridge early on the morning of March 26, collapsing the span into the Patapsco River and killing six members of a crew who were doing road work on the bridge.\n\nThe ship's owner and manager, both companies based in Singapore, quickly filed a limitation of liability action in federal court aimed at capping the amount of damages they could be force to pay at about $43 million, roughly the salvage value of the Dali and its cargo.\n\nThe Dali remained pinned under the Key Bridge until last month, when it was refloated and moved to Seagirt Marine Terminal. The massive ship and its crew, who are from Sri Lanka and India, according to Tuesday's petitions, have remained there since.\n\nIn an email included with Tuesday's petitions, the lawyers for the ship owner wrote that they are in the process of arranging for a replacement crew for the Dali.\n\nThe email also advised that the U.S. Coast Guard had given permission for some crew members to return to their home countries but also asked that others stay in the country. The email lists eight crew members who would be allowed to return home.\n\nThose crew members have been interviewed by the U.S. Department of Justice, according to the email, which did not object to their departure. The FBI boarded the ship in April as part of an investigation into the bridge collapse.

Bredar confirmed at a hearing Thursday that the agreement allowing the crew to return home but still be available for depositions was in place.\n\nAttorneys had asked the judge Tuesday to prevent crew members on the cargo ship Dali from returning to their home countries. Eight of the Dali\u00b4s crew members were scheduled to return home, according to emails included in court filings. Those eight were among the roughly two dozen total crew members, all of whom hail from India and Sri Lanka.\n\nIn the court filings, attorneys representing the City of Baltimore said the men should remain in the U.S. so they can be deposed in ongoing civil litigation over who should be held responsible for covering costs and damages resulting from the bridge collapse, which killed six construction workers and temporarily halted most maritime traffic through Baltimore\u00b4s busy port.\n\n\"The crew consists entirely of foreign nationals who, of course, have critical knowledge and information about the events giving rise to this litigation,\" attorneys wrote. \"If they are permitted to leave the United States, Claimants may never have the opportunity to question or depose them.\"\n\nDepartment of Justice attorneys leave the Edward A. Garmatz United States District Courthouse in Baltimore, Thursday, June 20, 2024. (AP Photo/Stephanie Scarbrough)\n\nThe judge asked two attorneys at the hearing - William H. \"Billy\" Murphy Jr. and Jason Foster - why they didn\u00b4t notify him sooner that they had agreed to the deal regarding depositions. The attorneys, who represent a claimant named Damon Davis, withdrew their emergency request for a hearing less than an hour before it started.\n\nThe judge described the litigation as \"very complex\" and said the attorneys \"need to all bring their A-game to this matter or we're going to bog down.\"\n\nAfter the hearing, Murphy said witnesses are typically questioned under oath at depositions that are held after documents are shared with the parties.\n\n\"You don't have the depositions first because you don't have all the material you need to ask intelligent questions and to find out more about what really happened,\" Murphy said.\n\nMurphy said the litigation over the bridge collapse \"may be the most expensive maritime case in the history of the world.\"\n\n\"And so everybody is paying close attention to the details so that we can unravel all aspects of this and come up with a just result,\" he said.\n\nSeven attorneys represented the federal government at the hearing. Two lawyers who represented the Dali's owner ignored a reporter's questions as they left the courthouse.\n\nDarrell Wilson, a spokesperson for the ship\u00b4s owner, said Tuesday evening that some crew members were scheduled to leave and some would remain to assist with the investigation. Wilson said he was unable to provide additional details about how many crew members were leaving and when.\n\nHe also said he wasn\u00b4t sure when the ship itself would leave Baltimore for Norfolk, Virginia, where it will receive more extensive repairs.\n\nThe hulking container ship remained pinned amid the wreckage of the fallen bridge for almost two months while workers removed thousands and thousands of tons of mangled steel and concrete from the bottom of the Patapsco River at the entrance to Baltimore\u00b4s harbor.\n\nThe ship\u00b4s crew remained on board even when explosives were detonated to break apart fallen bridge trusses and free the vessel from a massive steel span that landed across its bow.\n\nThe ongoing civil litigation began with a petition from the ship\u00b4s owner and manager, two Singapore-based companies, seeking to limit their legal liability for the deadly disaster.\n\nA National Transportation Safety Board investigation found the ship experienced two power outages in the hours before it left the Port of Baltimore. In the moments before the bridge collapse, it lost power again and veered off course. The agency\u00b4s investigation is still ongoing to determine what exactly caused the electrical issues.\n\nThe FBI also launched a criminal investigation.\n\nAccording to the emails included in Tuesday\u00b4s court filings, the eight crew members scheduled to return home have already been interviewed by Department of Justice investigators and that the department doesn\u00b4t object to their departure. The crew members will fly out of Baltimore \"likely on or about\" June 20, an attorney for the ship\u00b4s owner and manager wrote.\n\nBrumfield reported from Silver Spring, Maryland.\n\nFILE - The collapsed Francis Scott Key Bridge rests on the container ship Dali, May 12, 2024, in Baltimore, as seen from Riviera Beach, Md.

Now a deal means some could be leaving", "body": "They've been stuck aboard the Dali container ship for more than 12 weeks now: as the vessel crashed into and destroyed the Francis Scott Key Bridge, as divers recovered the bodies of six road workers who were killed while filling potholes on the span, as a massive, floating salvage operation sprang up around them to clear the debris.\n\nThe crew remained on board even as explosives were set off to break up the huge piece of the bridge that had landed on its bow and stranded it in the river and the battered vessel was refloated and tugged back into port a month ago.\n\nNow a deal between attorneys for the city and the ship's owner and manager means eight of the crew members could be heading home as soon as Thursday. The city dropped its objections, filed late Tuesday, to the crew members' departure. A federal judge had scheduled a hearing for 10 a.m. Thursday to weigh whether to keep them here at least for now.\n\nIt's not clear whether that hearing will proceed.\n\nThe eight, including a cook, several seamen, a fitter, an oiler and a general steward, now may be able to fly home.\n\nThe city, which has filed a claim against the Dali's Singapore-based owner and manager for negligence in the bridge collapse, had feared it might lose the opportunity to question crew members as part of the litigation should they leave the country.\n\nBut attorneys for the ship's owner and manager promised it would make those crew members available for depositions at a later date.\n\nThe latest flurry of legal activity comes as the ship is soon to leave Baltimore for Norfolk, Virginia, perhaps as early as Friday, where it will undergo initial repairs.\n\nDarrell Wilson, a spokesman for Synergy Marine Group, the vessel operator, said the plan is to use a replacement crew for the trip to Norfolk, but there is \"no firm timeline\" at the moment.\n\nIn any event, the legal wrangling could have extended the ordeal for crew members, who have not been allowed off the ship since before it set sail in the early morning hours of March 26, only to lose power and careen into the bridge. Attempts to get them shore leave during this time have been unsuccessful.\n\nPreventing crew members who likely had nothing to do with the crash from going home is \"unfair,\" said David Heindel, president of the Seafarers International Union, which represents mariners aboard U.S.-flagged vessels. (The Dali flies under the flag of Singapore and is owned by Grace Ocean Private Ltd. and managed by Synergy Marine Pte Ltd.)\n\n\"There are a lot of crew that have no responsibility for what happened,\" he said.\n\n\"The problem is these things can go on for years,\" added Heindel, whose union is based in Camp Springs, Maryland.\n\nHeindel is among a group of unions representing seafarers around the world who signed a statement last month expressing concern about the treatment of the Dali crew. They said the crew members' morale had dipped and they feared being \"criminalized\" over the incident. They've been questioned as part of the investigation into the collision, and had their phones confiscated by the FBI, which is among the investigating agencies, although they've received replacement devices.\n\nNow it appears they face further questioning as part of the claims seeking damages against the ship for the bridge's loss, which temporarily shut down the since reopened Port of Baltimore. The bridge itself, which is a part of the Baltimore Beltway, likely will take several years to rebuild.\n\nIn court filings, attorneys for the city quoted assurances they had received in April that the crew was going to remain on the vessel for the foreseeable future, and would be given ample notice should that change. But then, at about 10:30 a.m. Tuesday, they wrote, an attorney for Grace and Synergy emailed to say that eight crew members would be flying home \"likely on or about\" Thursday.\n\nThose crew members, the attorney for the ship said, already had been interviewed by the U.S. Department of Justice, which did not object to their departure.\n\nThe email from the ship's attorney, William Bennett, set off the current round of legal activity, with the city and another party seeking to preserve their access to crew members.\n\n\"If they are permitted to leave the United States,\" the city \"may never have the opportunity to question or depose them,\" wrote Adam J. Levitt, one of the lawyers representing Baltimore.\n\nThe crew members' defense attorney, Owen Duffy, who is based in New York, has indicated he would advise the men to invoke their Fifth Amendment privilege against self-incrimination, according to the email from Bennett. Duffy, reached by phone Tuesday evening, declined to comment.\n\nBredar had asked for lawyers who can speak for the Justice Department, Customs and Border Patrol, the National Transportation Safety Board and the Coast Guard to attend Thursday's hearing.\n\nThe Rev. Joshua Messick, who directs the Baltimore International Seafarers' Center, is among those who tried unsuccessfully to get shore leave for the Dali crew. Crews generally travel on visas that allow them in the U.S. while their vessels are docked here, but only for 29 days, a period of time that lapsed while the Dali was stranded in the Patapsco.\n\nMessick said advocates applied for the crew to be allowed to leave the vessel to attend a religious festival at a local temple earlier this month.\n\n\"It went nowhere,\" he said. \"It's been a constant kind of frustration.\"\n\nA CBP spokesman would say only that the Coast Guard requires commercial ships \"to maintain a safe minimum manning level. ... Current crew members who want to disembark, temporarily or to depart the United States permanently, would need to make arrangements with CBP to obtain proper entry documents.\"\n\nThe Coast Guard declined a request from the ship's lawyers to help secure crew members temporary parole through CBP, making it impossible for the men to stay in the country even briefly after leaving the vessel, according to the email from Bennett. It is not clear whether the request was for the crew to stay in Baltimore after the Dali leaves for Norfolk.\n\nThe Coast Guard did not respond to a request for comment Wednesday, which was a federal holiday.\n\nMessick said the aid groups were at least able to bring a bit of home to the crew aboard the Dali on June 9. That was when India played archrival Pakistan in the most hotly anticipated match of the T20 Cricket World Cup.\n\n\"It was a match they'd all been waiting for,\" said Andy Middleton, who runs the Apostleship of the Sea, another group that assists seafarers docked at the port.\n\nMiddleton had brought a laptop to hook up to the ship's TV set, and the crew watched what turned out to be a thriller of a game, with India coming from behind to win.", "source": {"uri": "yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

The city of Baltimore accordingly respectfully requests to withdraw its June 18, 2024 request for an emergency status hearing.\"\n\nLawyers representing the city previously said they were blindsided by an abrupt notice from counsel for Dali's owner saying eight crew members would be allowed to leave on Thursday or Friday.\n\nThe ship's owner, Singapore-based Grace Ocean Private, said replacements would board the ship as it continues to sit in Port at Seagirt.\n\n\"I'm gobsmacked that the crew remains aboard this vessel,\" said John Fulweiler, a maritime lawyer with a nationwide practice.\n\nFulweiler said the parties should have already taken steps to interview the crew.\n\n\"That's preposterous in my opinion, and I would think that's how any layperson might feel given the amount of time since the incident and the fact that crew members are clearly accessible...via Zoom or likely in person to be deposed over these many months since the incident,\" Fulweiler said.\n\nBaltimore and other parties are trying to get payback and fighting claims by Dali's owner and management company to cap damages at $43 million, the salvage value of the ship and its cargo.\n\n\"The deckhands, the crew members, what do they really have in the way of knowledge?\" Fulweiler asked. \"I think it's probably not much. I suspect those depositions wouldn't have to be long, and I question personally why hasn't that testimony already been captured so these folks can return to their families?\"\n\nIn a ruling late Wednesday, however, U.S. District Judge James Bredar said that while he found the proposed deal \"a sensible resolution,\" he would still require the emergency hearing to take place at 10 a.m. Thursday.\n\nMeanwhile, The Justice Department has already interviewed the crew and has no objection to them leaving.\n\nThe government has blocked the crew from doing anything on U.S. soil once they leave the ship, other than heading straight to the airport to travel to their home countries.\n\n\"They have been required to stay aboard while...the executives, the owners, the underwriters, the class society who inspected the vessel-all these folks have continued in their normal lives. I find that personally to be offensive,\" Fulweiler said.\n\nWJZ has spoken several times to charity groups assisting the crew members. The crew for a time lost communications with loved ones after the FBI confiscated their phones.\n\n\"I think they're still trying to figure out how to navigate their current situation,\" said Andrew Middleton, the director of Apostleship of the Sea, a charitable organization assisting the crew. \"For as long as they're here, we're going to be here for them.\"\n\nBaltimore asked for the emergency hearing after receiving an email from the owner of the Dali, saying eight members of the crew would be headed to their home countries on Thursday, and replacements would board the ship as it continues to sit in port at Seagirt.\n\nIn the court filing requesting the emergency hearing, Levitt wrote that \"the crew consists entirely of foreign nationals who...have critical knowledge and information about the events giving rise to this litigation. If they are permitted to leave the United States, claimants may never have the opportunity to question or depose them.\"\n\nThe city of Baltimore and other parties are fighting attempts by the Dali's owner to cap damages from the collapse to $43 million.\n\nSix construction workers were killed when the large container ship struck Key Bridge in the early morning hours of March 26, causing it to collapse.", "source": {"uri": "cbsnews.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "CBS News"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baltimore", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label":

While none of the crew have been charged in connection with the disaster, investigations are underway to determine who might be responsible for the catastrophe. And Baltimore's mayor has announced legal action, vowing to \"hold the wrongdoers responsible.\"\n\nOn Tuesday, attorneys representing the city and a bridge inspector who was nearly killed in the crash filed motions asking the court to intervene after they learned some crew members might fly home this week - before the attorneys had a chance to depose them.\n\n\"The crew consists entirely of foreign nationals who, of course, have critical knowledge and information about the events giving rise to this litigation,\" Adam Levitt, an attorney representing the city, wrote in Tuesday's emergency hearing request. \"If they are permitted to leave the United States, Claimants may never have the opportunity to question or depose them.\"\n\nAs of Wednesday evening, a hearing on the matter still was scheduled for Thursday.\n\nThe request came after Levitt and other counsel received an email from William Bennett, an attorney representing ship owner Grace Ocean and ship manager Synergy Marine.\n\nThe email, which was attached as an exhibit in Tuesday's emergency court filings, said eight crew members were expected to fly home as early as this week.\n\n\"Our clients are in the process of arranging for replacement crew for the DALI,\" Bennett wrote. \"We have been advised that the U.S. Coast Guard will permit certain crew members to return to their home countries but has requested that other crew members remain in the United States.\"\n\nThose seafarers \"will be transported directly from the Vessel to the airport prior to its departure from Baltimore (likely on or about June 20th),\" Bennett wrote Tuesday morning.\n\nBennett's email identifies the eight eligible crew members, which include a cook, a fitter and an oiler. \"All of these crew members have been interviewed by DOJ and DOJ does not object to their departure from the United States,\" Bennett wrote.\n\nCNN has reached out to the Coast Guard and the Department of Justice for comment.\n\nIn response to Tuesday's motions, US District Court Judge James Bredar ordered an emergency hearing for Thursday morning to hear from attorneys for each side of the issue.\n\nBut late Wednesday, attorneys for the ship's owner and manager as well as the city of Baltimore reached a deal on terms for the eight crew members' depositions, according to a new court filing.\n\nAs part of the deal, those crew members will not need to stay in Baltimore. Their depositions \"will be taken in London or elsewhere by written agreement of all parties to the Litigation,\" according to an exhibit attached to Wednesday's court filing.\n\nThose depositions will take place \"no sooner than November 2024,\" the document states.\n\nIn addition to making those seafarers available for depositions, Grace Ocean and Synergy Marine must provide documents including personnel files, employment contracts and training files, according Wednesday's court filing.\n\n\"We agree to (the) conditions mentioned,\" Bennett wrote in an email attached in the court filing.\n\nWith the agreement in place, \"the City of Baltimore is satisfied that the Parties no longer require the Court's intervention to resolve the dispute,\" Levitt wrote in Wednesday's court filing. As a result, he said, the city asked to withdraw its request for an emergency status hearing.\n\nThe judge responded in an order Wednesday evening, saying the hearing would proceed \"because the agreement has not yet been explicitly endorsed by all parties,\" though he noted the deal \"strikes the Court as a sensible resolution to this issue.\"\n\nNo civil lawsuits can get underway because of a pending request by the ship's owner and manager to limit their financial liability, said Jason Foster, an attorney representing the bridge inspector whom he said narrowly escaped and lost six friends in the tragedy.\n\nSix days after the catastrophe, Grace Ocean and Synergy Marine filed a petition in federal court asking for a $43.6 million cap on potential liability payouts.\n\nBut a decision on that request probably won't happen anytime soon, since potential claimants have until September 24 to come forward, Foster told CNN Wednesday afternoon.\n\nAnd due to the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, Foster and other attorneys weren't able depose the crew members until all of the potential claimants have come forward - in other words, possibly September or later.\n\nBut with the new agreement Wednesday night, the eight crew members would be able to leave the country before they're deposed.\n\nDespite months-long separation from their families and uncertainty about their fate, the seafarers are in good spirits, said Darrell Wilson, a spokesperson for the crew's employer, Synergy Marine.\n\nHe said the company \"looks after them on a daily basis,\" helping make sure they have supplies they need. And local seafarers' organizations have \"been tremendous in helping to look after the crew,\" Wilson told CNN on Wednesday.\n\nThe seamen have had pizza and catered foods delivered as well as access to cricket matches broadcast from their home countries - \"you know, small touches that mean a lot to the crew,\" Wilson said.\n\nBut it's still unclear exactly when the eight crew members - and the rest of their colleagues - will be able to leave. CNN has reached out the Singapore-based unions representing the seafarers for comment.\n\nCNN's Mary Kay Mallonee and Jeff Winter contributed to this report.\n\nThe-CNN-Wire\n\n\u2122 & \u00a9 2024 Cable News Network, Inc., a Warner Bros.

The city dropped its objections, filed late Tuesday, to the crew members' departure. A federal judge had scheduled a hearing for 10 a.m. Thursday to weigh whether to keep them here at least for now.\n\nIt's not clear whether that hearing will proceed.\n\nThe eight, including a cook, several seamen, a fitter, an oiler and a general steward, may be able to fly home.\n\nThe city, which has filed a claim against the Dali's Singapore-based owner and manager for negligence in the bridge collapse, had feared it might lose the opportunity to question crew members as part of the litigation should they leave the country.\n\nBut attorneys for the ship's owner and manager promised it would make those crew members available for depositions at a later date.\n\nThe latest flurry of legal activity comes as the ship is soon to leave Baltimore for Norfolk, Virginia, perhaps as early as Friday, where it will undergo initial repairs.\n\nDarrell Wilson, a spokesman for Synergy Marine Group, the vessel operator, said the plan is to use a replacement crew for the trip to Norfolk, but there is \"no firm timeline\" at the moment.\n\nIn any event, the legal wrangling could have extended the ordeal for crew members, who have not been allowed off the ship since before it set sail in the early morning hours of March 26, only to lose power and careen into the bridge. Attempts to get them shore leave have been unsuccessful.\n\nPreventing crew members who likely had nothing to do with the crash from going home is \"unfair,\" said David Heindel, president of the Seafarers International Union, which represents mariners aboard U.S.-flagged vessels. (The Dali flies under the flag of Singapore and is owned by Grace Ocean Private Ltd. and managed by Synergy Marine Pte Ltd.)\n\n\"There are a lot of crew that have no responsibility for what happened,\" he said.\n\n\"The problem is these things can go on for years,\" added Heindel, whose union is based in Camp Springs, Maryland.\n\nHeindel is among a group of unions representing seafarers around the world who signed a statement last month expressing concern about the treatment of the Dali crew. They said the crew members' morale had dipped and they feared being \"criminalized\" over the incident. They've been questioned as part of the investigation into the crash and had their phones confiscated by the FBI, which is among the investigating agencies, although they've received replacement devices.\n\nNow it appears they face further questioning as part of the claims seeking damages against the ship for the bridge's loss, which temporarily shut down the since reopened Port of Baltimore. The bridge itself, which is a part of the Baltimore Beltway, likely will take several years to rebuild.", "source": {"uri": "oregonlive.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Oregon Live"}, "authors":

The email lists eight crew members who would be allowed to return home.\n\nThose crew members have been interviewed by the U.S. Department of Justice, according to the email, which did not object to their departure. The FBI boarded the ship in April as part of an investigation into the bridge collapse. The crew also has obtained criminal counsel, who said he would advise the crew to invoke their right against self-incrimination in depositions, according to the email.\n\nThe ship owner's lawyers also wrote that they asked the Coast Guard to help obtain \"temporary parole from CBP,\" seemingly a reference to Customs and Border Protection, to allow crew members to briefly remain in the United States.

While none of the crew have been charged in connection with the disaster, investigations are underway to determine who might be responsible for the catastrophe. And Baltimore's mayor has announced legal action, vowing to \"hold the wrongdoers responsible.\"\n\nOn Tuesday, attorneys representing the city and a bridge inspector who was nearly killed in the crash filed motions asking the court to intervene after they learned some crew members might fly home this week - before the attorneys had a chance to depose them.\n\n\"The crew consists entirely of foreign nationals who, of course, have critical knowledge and information about the events giving rise to this litigation,\" Adam Levitt, an attorney representing the city, wrote in Tuesday's emergency hearing request. \"If they are permitted to leave the United States, Claimants may never have the opportunity to question or depose them.\"\n\nAs of Wednesday evening, a hearing on the matter still was scheduled for Thursday.\n\nThe request came after Levitt and other counsel received an email from William Bennett, an attorney representing ship owner Grace Ocean and ship manager Synergy Marine.\n\nThe email, which was attached as an exhibit in Tuesday's emergency court filings, said eight crew members were expected to fly home as early as this week.\n\n\"Our clients are in the process of arranging for replacement crew for the DALI,\" Bennett wrote. \"We have been advised that the U.S. Coast Guard will permit certain crew members to return to their home countries but has requested that other crew members remain in the United States.\"\n\nThose seafarers \"will be transported directly from the Vessel to the airport prior to its departure from Baltimore (likely on or about June 20th),\" Bennett wrote Tuesday morning.\n\nBennett's email identifies the eight eligible crew members, which include a cook, a fitter and an oiler. \"All of these crew members have been interviewed by DOJ and DOJ does not object to their departure from the United States,\" Bennett wrote.\n\nCNN has reached out to the Coast Guard and the Department of Justice for comment.\n\nIn response to Tuesday's motions, US District Court Judge James Bredar ordered an emergency hearing for Thursday morning to hear from attorneys for each side of the issue.\n\nBut late Wednesday, attorneys for the ship's owner and manager as well as the city of Baltimore reached a deal on terms for the eight crew members' depositions, according to a new court filing.\n\nAs part of the deal, those crew members will not need to stay in Baltimore. Their depositions \"will be taken in London or elsewhere by written agreement of all parties to the Litigation,\" according to an exhibit attached to Wednesday's court filing.\n\nThose depositions will take place \"no sooner than November 2024,\" the document states.\n\nIn addition to making those seafarers available for depositions, Grace Ocean and Synergy Marine must provide documents including personnel files, employment contracts and training files, according Wednesday's court filing.\n\n\"We agree to (the) conditions mentioned,\" Bennett wrote in an email attached in the court filing.\n\nWith the agreement in place, \"the City of Baltimore is satisfied that the Parties no longer require the Court's intervention to resolve the dispute,\" Levitt wrote in Wednesday's court filing. As a result, he said, the city asked to withdraw its request for an emergency status hearing.\n\nThe judge responded in an order Wednesday evening, saying the hearing would proceed \"because the agreement has not yet been explicitly endorsed by all parties,\" though he noted the deal \"strikes the Court as a sensible resolution to this issue.\"\n\nWhy the crew wasn't deposed earlier\n\nNo civil lawsuits can get underway because of a pending request by the ship's owner and manager to limit their financial liability, said Jason Foster, an attorney representing the bridge inspector whom he said narrowly escaped and lost six friends in the tragedy.\n\nSix days after the catastrophe, Grace Ocean and Synergy Marine filed a petition in federal court asking for a $43.6 million cap on potential liability payouts.\n\nBut a decision on that request probably won't happen anytime soon, since potential claimants have until September 24 to come forward, Foster told CNN Wednesday afternoon.\n\nAnd due to the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, Foster and other attorneys weren't able depose the crew members until all of the potential claimants have come forward - in other words, possibly September or later.\n\nBut with the new agreement Wednesday night, the eight crew members would be able to leave the country before they're deposed.\n\nHow the crew is faring now\n\nDespite months-long separation from their families and uncertainty about their fate, the seafarers are in good spirits, said Darrell Wilson, a spokesperson for the crew's employer, Synergy Marine.\n\nHe said the company \"looks after them on a daily basis,\" helping make sure they have supplies they need. And local seafarers' organizations have \"been tremendous in helping to look after the crew,\" Wilson told CNN on Wednesday.\n\nThe seamen have had pizza and catered foods delivered as well as access to cricket matches broadcast from their home countries - \"you know, small touches that mean a lot to the crew,\" Wilson said.\n\nBut it's still unclear exactly when the eight crew members - and the rest of their colleagues - will be able to leave.

Their depositions \"will be taken in London or elsewhere by written agreement of all parties to the Litigation,\" according to an exhibit attached to Wednesday's court filing.\n\nThose depositions will take place \"no sooner than November 2024,\" the document states.\n\nIn addition to making those seafarers available for depositions, Grace Ocean and Synergy Marine must provide documents including personnel files, employment contracts and training files, according Wednesday's court filing.\n\n\"We agree to (the) conditions mentioned,\" Bennett wrote in an email attached in the court filing.\n\nWith the agreement in place, \"the City of Baltimore is satisfied that the Parties no longer require the Court's intervention to resolve the dispute,\" Levitt wrote in Wednesday's court filing. As a result, he said, the city asked to withdraw its request for an emergency status hearing.\n\nThe judge responded in an order Wednesday evening, saying the hearing would proceed \"because the agreement has not yet been explicitly endorsed by all parties,\" though he noted the deal \"strikes the Court as a sensible resolution to this issue.\"\n\nWhy the crew wasn't deposed earlier\n\nNo civil lawsuits can get underway because of a pending request by the ship's owner and manager to limit their financial liability, said Jason Foster, an attorney representing the bridge inspector whom he said narrowly escaped and lost six friends in the tragedy.\n\nSix days after the catastrophe, Grace Ocean and Synergy Marine filed a petition in federal court asking for a $43.6 million cap on potential liability payouts.\n\nBut a decision on that request probably won't happen anytime soon, since potential claimants have until September 24 to come forward, Foster told CNN Wednesday afternoon.\n\nAnd due to the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, Foster and other attorneys weren't able depose the crew members until all of the potential claimants have come forward - in other words, possibly September or later.\n\nBut with the new agreement Wednesday night, the eight crew members would be able to leave the country before they're deposed.\n\nHow the crew is faring now\n\nDespite months-long separation from their families and uncertainty about their fate, the seafarers are in good spirits, said Darrell Wilson, a spokesperson for the crew's employer, Synergy Marine.\n\nHe said the company \"looks after them on a daily basis,\" helping make sure they have supplies they need. And local seafarers' organizations have \"been tremendous in helping to look after the crew,\" Wilson told CNN on Wednesday.\n\nThe seamen have had pizza and catered foods delivered as well as access to cricket matches broadcast from their home countries - \"you know, small touches that mean a lot to the crew,\" Wilson said.\n\nBut it's still unclear exactly when the eight crew members - and the rest of their colleagues - will be able to leave. CNN has reached out the Singapore-based unions representing the seafarers for comment.\n\nCNN's Mary Kay Mallonee and Jeff Winter contributed to this report.\n\nFor more CNN news and newsletters

Thursday hearing could determine if some leave.", "body": "They've been stuck aboard the Dali container ship for more than 12 weeks now: as the vessel crashed into and destroyed the Francis Scott Key Bridge, as divers recovered the bodies of six road workers who were killed while filling potholes on the span, as a massive, floating salvage operation sprang up around them to clear the debris.\n\nThe crew remained on board even as explosives were set off to break up the huge piece of the bridge that had landed on its bow and stranded it in the river and the battered vessel was refloated and tugged back into port a month ago.\n\nOn Thursday, crew members -- 20 of whom are from India and one from Sri Lanka -- still will be on the ship as a judge weighs their fate at an emergency hearing in federal court in downtown Baltimore.\n\nEight of them were expecting to fly home this week, including a cook, several seamen, a fitter, an oiler and a general steward. But on Tuesday, the city of Baltimore asked Senior U.S. District Judge James K. Bredar to keep them here at least for now.\n\nThe city, which has filed a claim against the Dali's Singapore-based owner and manager for negligence in the bridge collapse, fears it might lose the opportunity to question crew members as part of the litigation should they leave the country.\n\nWhile Bredar expressed reservations, he scheduled a hearing for 10 a.m. to consider it.\n\nThe latest flurry of legal activity comes as the ship is soon to leave Baltimore for Norfolk, perhaps as early as Friday, where it will undergo initial repairs.\n\nHow a ruling by Bredar might affect that is unclear.\n\nDarrell Wilson, a spokesman for Synergy Marine Group, the vessel operator, said the plan is still to use a replacement crew for the trip to Norfolk, but there is \"no firm timeline\" at the moment.\n\nIn any event, the legal wrangling could extend the ordeal for crew members who have not been allowed off the ship since before it set sail in the early morning hours of March 26, only to lose power and careen into the bridge. Attempts to get them shore leave during this time have been unsuccessful.\n\nPreventing crew members who likely had nothing to do with the crash from going home is \"unfair,\" said David Heindel, president of the Seafarers International Union, which represents mariners aboard U.S.-flagged vessels. (The Dali flies under the flag of Singapore and is owned by Grace Ocean Private Ltd. and managed by Synergy Marine Pte Ltd.)\n\n\"There are a lot of crew that have no responsibility for what happened,\" he said. \"To hold them, to me, it's ridiculous.\"\n\nHeindel said he worried how long crew members may be kept from going home given the length of time it can take lawsuits to work their way through the system.\n\n\"The problem is these things can go on for years,\" said Heindel, whose union is based in Camp Springs.\n\nStill, Heindel said he understands the city's position.\n\n\"It has been impacted tremendously,\" he said. \"I don't want to take anything away from that.\"\n\nHeindel is among a group of unions representing seafarers around the world who signed a statement last month expressing concern over the treatment of the Dali crew. They said the crew members' morale had dipped and they feared being \"criminalized\" over the incident. They've been questioned as part of the investigation into the collision, and had their phones confiscated by the FBI, which is among the investigating agencies, although they've received replacement devices.\n\nNow it appears they face further questioning as part of the claims seeking damages against the ship for the bridge's loss, which temporarily shut down the since re-opened Port of Baltimore. The bridge itself, which is a part of the Baltimore Beltway, likely will take several years to rebuild.\n\nIn court filings, attorneys for the city quoted assurances they had received in April that the crew was going to remain on the vessel for the foreseeable future, and would be given ample notice should that change. But then, at about 10:30 a.m. Tuesday, they wrote, an attorney for Grace and Synergy emailed to say that eight crew members would be flying home \"likely on or about\" Thursday.\n\nThose crew members, the attorney for the ship said, already had been interviewed by the U.S. Department of Justice, which did not object to their departure.\n\nThe email from the ship's attorney, William Bennett, set off the current round of legal activity, with the city and another party seeking to preserve their access to crew members.\n\n\"If they are permitted to leave the United States,\" the city \"may never have the opportunity to question or depose them,\" wrote Adam J. Levitt, one of the lawyers representing Baltimore.\n\nAlexander M. Giles, a Baltimore-based maritime attorney, said Bredar appeared to be carefully weighing fairness to those with claims against the ship interests versus the rights of crew members.\n\nThe judge could hold the crew for depositions, Giles said, though he likely would give the claimants a short window to complete their questioning. Should they leave, they may never return, he said.\n\n\"Then, to get their testimony, you're going to India or Sri Lanka and finding them in their home country and conducting a deposition, which obviously can be very expensive,\" Giles said.\n\nBredar also might question why attorneys for the city and other claimants haven't already deposed the crew in the nearly three months they have been stuck aboard the Dali or, more recently, docked at Seagirt Marine Terminal.\n\nThe crew members' defense attorney, Owen Duffy, who is based in New York, has indicated he would advise the men to invoke their 5th Amendment privilege against self incrimination, according to the email from Bennett. Duffy, reached by phone Tuesday evening, declined to comment.\n\nClaimants' attorneys still will want to question crew members, who could decide to ignore their lawyer's advice, according to Giles.\n\n\"There are lots of variables that could happen, and I think Judge Bredar realizes he has to take the least intrusive avenue,\" Giles said.\n\nBredar has asked for lawyers who can speak for the Justice Department, Customs and Border Patrol, the National Transportation Safety Board and the Coast Guard to attend Thursday's hearing.\n\nThe Rev. Joshua Messick, who directs Baltimore International Seafarers' Center, is among those who tried unsuccessfully to get shore leave for the Dali crew. Crews generally travel on visas that allow them in the U.S. while their vessels are docked here, but only for 29 days, a period of time that lapsed while the Dali was stranded in the Patapsco.\n\nMessick said advocates applied for the crew to be allowed to leave the vessel to attend a religious festival at a local temple earlier this month.\n\n\"It went nowhere,\" he said. \"It's been a constant kind of frustration.\"\n\nA CBP spokesman would say only that the Coast Guard requires commercial ships \"to maintain a safe minimum manning level. ... Current crew members who want to disembark, temporarily or to depart the United States permanently, would need to make arrangements with CBP to obtain proper entry documents.\"\n\nThe Coast Guard declined a request from the ship's lawyers to help secure crew members temporary parole through CBP, making it impossible for the men to stay in the country even briefly after leaving the vessel, according to the email from Bennett. It is not clear whether the request was for the crew to stay in Baltimore after the Dali leaves for Norfolk.\n\nThe Coast Guard did not respond to a request for comment Wednesday, which was a federal holiday.\n\nMessick said the aid groups were at least able to bring a bit of home to the crew aboard the Dali on June 9. That was when India played archrival Pakistan in the most hotly anticipated match of the T20 Cricket World Cup.\n\n\"It was a match they'd all been waiting for,\" said Andy Middleton, who runs the Apostleship of the Sea, another group that assists seafarers docked at the port.\n\nMiddleton had brought a laptop to hook up to the ship's TV set, and the crew watched what turned out to be a thriller of a game, with India coming from behind to win.", "source": {"uri": "baltimoresun.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Baltimore Sun"}, "authors": [{"uri": "jean_marbella@baltimoresun.com", "name": "Jean Marbella", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}, {"uri": "madeleine_o_neill@baltimoresun.com", "name": "Madeleine O'Neill", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_K._Bredar", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "James K.

While none of the crew have been charged in connection with the disaster, investigations are underway to determine who might be responsible for the catastrophe. And Baltimore's mayor has announced legal action, vowing to \"hold the wrongdoers responsible.\"\n\nOn Tuesday, attorneys representing the city and a bridge inspector who was nearly killed in the crash filed motions asking the court to intervene after they learned some crew members might fly home this week - before the attorneys had a chance to depose them.\n\n\"The crew consists entirely of foreign nationals who, of course, have critical knowledge and information about the events giving rise to this litigation,\" Adam Levitt, an attorney representing the city, wrote in Tuesday's emergency hearing request. \"If they are permitted to leave the United States, Claimants may never have the opportunity to question or depose them.\"\n\nAs of Wednesday evening, a hearing on the matter still was scheduled for Thursday.\n\nThe request came after Levitt and other counsel received an email from William Bennett, an attorney representing ship owner Grace Ocean and ship manager Synergy Marine.\n\nThe email, which was attached as an exhibit in Tuesday's emergency court filings, said eight crew members were expected to fly home as early as this week.\n\n\"Our clients are in the process of arranging for replacement crew for the DALI,\" wrote William Bennett, one of the attorneys representing the ship's owner, Grace Ocean, and manager, Synergy Marine. \"We have been advised that the U.S. Coast Guard will permit certain crew members to return to their home countries but has requested that other crew members remain in the United States.\"\n\nThose seafarers \"will be transported directly from the Vessel to the airport prior to its departure from Baltimore (likely on or about June 20th),\" Bennett wrote Tuesday morning.\n\nBennett's email identifies the eight eligible crew members, which include a cook, a fitter and an oiler. \"All of these crew members have been interviewed by DOJ and DOJ does not object to their departure from the United States,\" Bennett wrote.\n\nCNN has reached out to the Coast Guard and the Department of Justice for comment.\n\nIn response to Tuesday's motions, US District Court Judge James Bredar ordered an emergency hearing for Thursday morning to hear from attorneys for each side of the issue.\n\nBut late Wednesday, attorneys for the ship's owner and manager as well as the city of Baltimore reached a deal on terms for the eight crew members' depositions, according to a new court filing.\n\nAs part of the deal, those crew members will not need to stay in Baltimore. Their depositions \"will be taken in London or elsewhere by written agreement of all parties to the Litigation,\" according to an exhibit attached to Wednesday's court filing.\n\nThose depositions will take place \"no sooner than November 2024,\" the document states.\n\nIn addition to making those seafarers available for depositions, Grace Ocean and Synergy Marine must provide documents including personnel files, employment contracts and training files, according Wednesday's court filing.\n\n\"We agree to (the) conditions mentioned,\" Bennett wrote in an email attached in the court filing.\n\nWith the agreement in place, \"the City of Baltimore is satisfied that the Parties no longer require the Court's intervention to resolve the dispute,\" Levitt wrote in Wednesday's court filing. As a result, he said, the city asked to withdraw its request for an emergency status hearing.\n\nThe judge responded in an order Wednesday evening, saying the hearing would proceed \"because the agreement has not yet been explicitly endorsed by all parties,\" though he noted the deal \"strikes the Court as a sensible resolution to this issue.\"\n\nWhy the crew wasn't deposed earlier\n\nNo civil lawsuits can get underway because of a pending request by the ship's owner and manager to limit their financial liability, said Jason Foster, an attorney representing the bridge inspector whom he said narrowly escaped and lost six friends in the tragedy.\n\nSix days after the catastrophe, Grace Ocean and Synergy Marine filed a petition in federal court asking for a $43.6 million cap on potential liability payouts.\n\nBut a decision on that request probably won't happen anytime soon, since potential claimants have until September 24 to come forward, Foster told CNN Wednesday afternoon.\n\nAnd due to the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, Foster and other attorneys weren't able depose the crew members until all of the potential claimants have come forward - in other words, possibly September or later.\n\nBut with the new agreement Wednesday night, the eight crew members are able to leave the country before they're deposed.\n\nHow the crew is faring now\n\nDespite months-long separation from their families and uncertainty about their fate, the seafarers are in good spirits, said Darrell Wilson, a spokesperson for the crew's employer, Synergy Marine.\n\nHe said the company \"looks after them on a daily basis,\" helping make sure they have supplies they need. And local seafarers' organizations have \"been tremendous in helping to look after the crew,\" Wilson told CNN on Wednesday.\n\nThe seamen have had pizza and catered foods delivered as well as access to cricket matches broadcast from their home countries - \"you know, small touches that mean a lot to the crew,\" Wilson said.\n\nBut it's still unclear exactly when the eight crew members - and the rest of their colleagues - will be able to leave.

The presiding federal judge said there are legal hurdles to consider.\n\nCourt documents obtained Wednesday morning by 11 News indicate the city learned on Tuesday that eight Dali crew members received permission from the Coast Guard to debark and leave the country as early as Thursday.\n\nIn a letter addressed to U.S. District Judge James K. Bredar, the city's outside counsel indicated the crew members have permission to return to their home country. The almost two dozen crew members aboard the Dali are from India and Sri Lanka.\n\nThere's concern that if the crew members leave, there may not be a future opportunity to question them about the collapse of the Francis Scott Key Bridge. The attorneys said the crew members have critical knowledge and information about the March 26 collision and that litigants need to depose all the crew members as part of ongoing legal actions.\n\nThe attorneys wrote, in part: \"If they are permitted to leave the United States, claimants may never have the opportunity to question or depose them.\"\n\nThe city is seeking a guarantee that all the Dali's crew members will be made available for deposition.\n\nAccording to court motions, lawyers for the Dali's owner, Grace Ocean Private Ltd., and managing company, Synergy Marine Group, point out that the eight crew members have been interviewed by the Department of Justice. Lawyers contend if clients were brought in for depositions, they would advise them to invoke their 5th Amendment rights anyway.\n\n\"Under the circumstances, we see no purpose in convening depositions on an emergency basis to accomplish this formality,\" attorney William Bennett wrote in an email entered into court records.\n\nWBAL-TV 11 News obtained Bredar's memorandum and order, written in response, in which he set a motions hearing in U.S. District Court for 10 a.m. on Thursday, 12 weeks after the bridge collapse.\n\nIn his order, Bredar stated that the city had failed to cite any authority to support the relief it seeks and that the court lacks authority to \"forbid persons from leaving the jurisdiction ... (which) would implicate their liberty interests.\"\n\n\"The court would not take such an action lightly, and in particular, not without assurance that, one, it had the authority to issue such an order, and, two, the crew members' rights would be adequately protected,\" Bredar wrote.\n\nHowever, upon learning of the new information about the eight crew members who might leave this week, the court cited \"this turn of events\" and scheduled a hearing.\n\n\"While the court is not enjoining the crew members' travel, the court will direct petitioners not to facilitate the departure of any crew members prior to the conclusion of the hearing, and will direct the United States not to deport the crew members and to take whatever affirmative action is necessary to ensure the crew members' presence in this jurisdiction through the conclusion of the hearing,\" Bredar wrote.\n\nThe Dali blocked the channel for weeks after the bridge collapse. Though the ship has since been moved in May to Seagirt Marine Terminal, the crew remains on board.\n\nThe Rev. Joshua Messick, port chaplain and executive director of the Baltimore International Seafarers' Center, told 11 News he often provides counseling to the crew.\n\n\"I didn't know the city wanted the entire crew to stay. It doesn't make sense to me. The messmen or the cooks, those types of crew, it doesn't make sense to keep them here,\" Messick told 11 News. \"Some of us who are caring for them, including the unions and the International Transport Federation, have worked to petition for shore leave. It has been denied each time.\"\n\nThe FBI and National Transportation Safety Board continue to investigate the cause of the crash and collapse that killed six construction workers.\n\nA class-action lawsuit was filed in April on behalf of local businesses, and the city is exploring all legal options against the owner and operator of the Dali as Mayor Brandon Scott said he's pushing for accountability.\n\n\"(We're going) to do everything in our power to bring every single piece of information out and every single resource, anything we can do to help Baltimore recover from that tragedy,\" Scott said.\n\nThe Dali has been scheduled to set sail Thursday to Norfolk, Virginia, for repairs. Messick told 11 News the crew members will stay behind, but it not known who would foot the bill.\n\n\"I do know, from speaking with the legal team, that half of the crew was already going to be detained here. They will be put up in apartments or hotels for that time,\" Messick told 11 News.\n\nIn April, Synergy Marine Group and Grace Ocean Private Ltd. took court action seeking protection when it comes to liability.", "source": {"uri": "kion546.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "KION546"}, "authors": [{"uri": "cnn_newsource@kion546.com", "name": "Cnn Newsource", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_K._Bredar", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "James K.

The ship lost electrical power and propulsion again as it neared the bridge, leading to it hitting the bridge and causing sections of the bridge to collapse, blocking the entrance to the Port of Baltimore.\n\nThe city is seeking a jury trial, requesting that the U.S. District Court of Maryland hold the ship's owners fully responsible for the bridge's collapse.\n\nCurrently, the Dali is docked at the Seagirt Marine Terminal, where it was moved after being refloated on May 20.

They were unable to depart the ship because they were considered witnesses and did not have valid visas or shore passes to enter the US.\n\nAccording to local media reports, a deal reached between the city of Baltimore, the ship's owners, and its management company will now allow some sailors to leave the vessel.\n\nBut they will have to be made available for depositions even after they leave the US.\n\nThe number of crew members initially headed home - and their date of departure - is unclear.\n\nWhen contacted by the BBC, Synergy Marine - the ship's management company -spokesperson Darrel Wilson said that the company is \"working to send some crew home\", while \"some will remain to assist with the investigation\".\n\nHe added that the crew is \"doing well\".\n\nAndrew Middleton, who runs Apostleship of Sea - a programme that ministers to ships coming through Baltimore - said there were \"mixed emotions\" on board the ship when he went to meet the sailors on Thursday.\n\n\"The ones that get to go home are happy, relieved\" he said. \"But the ones that are staying are wondering when they will get to go home too. That's added to the mental strain.\"\n\nHe added that he believes some crew members may leave within days.\n\nMr Middleton said that it remains unclear when the remaining sailors will be given shore passes to step off the vessel, or what that will \"look like\" when they are.\n\nSome, he said, could ultimately be housed in hotels while the investigations progress, an experience he said could be \"isolating\" without their fellow crew members.\n\nTwo unions representing the sailors said in May that morale on the ship had \"dipped\" due to \"unfounded fear of personal criminal liability\" and emotional distress.\n\nGrace Ocean Private Ltd, which owns the ship, did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\nIn court documents filed earlier this week, lawyers for Baltimore said they were made aware last-minute that eight of the seafarers were planning to leave the country as early as Wednesday.\n\nMr Middleton also said he believes that eight sailors are expected to leave.\n\nThe city initially called for a judge to intervene to prevent that from happening.\n\nA deal reached late Wednesday, however, includes a guarantee that the \"vessel interests will produce the witness in question for deposition during the discovery phase\" of legal proceedings, court documents show.\n\nBaltimore officials are currently working to determine potential compensation for the incident and have resisted attempts by the Dali's owner to cap damages at $43m (\u00a333.9m).\n\nThe US Justice Department has already interviewed the Dali's crew as part of its own investigation and has no objection to them leaving the country.\n\nAfter months stranded under the metal and steel remnants of the Key Bridge, the 948ft (289m) ship was towed away last month and is now at a local container terminal.\n\nReplacement sailors will be brought in while the ship remains at the terminal, according to CBS, the BBC's news partner.\n\nLast week, the shipping channel outside of Baltimore that had been blocked by the crash was re-opened after 11 weeks of closure.", "source": {"uri": "ca.news.yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

O'Connell wrote in an emergency request that he and other lawyers need more time to conduct depositions of the crew before their return to their home countries, and that allowing them to leave before then \"presents numerous legal and logistical issues that will exacerbate the inherent complexities and difficulties in this matter.\"\n\nO'Connell, alongside outside counsel hired to represent the City of Baltimore, asked the judge for an emergency meeting Tuesday to discuss the matter.\n\nBredar set a hearing for Thursday morning ordering the presence of the lawyers for all civil claimants, the U.S. government, and the Dali's owner Grace Ocean Private Limited and operator Synergy Marine Pte. Ltd.\n\nIn the meantime, Bredar said that Grace Ocean and Synergy Marine cannot help the crew members leave the United States, and the government cannot deport them, before the hearing.\n\nIn the notification email Tuesday morning about the crew's planned departure, attorney William Bennett III, who is representing the ship's owner, said that the U.S. Coast Guard would \"permit\" some crew members to leave the United States, but \"requested\" that other on the vessel remain.\n\nThose permitted to leave, he wrote in the notification email, included the ship's cook, an oiler and several able seamen -- who work on the deck of the Dali.\n\nDarrell Wilson, a spokesman for the ship's owner, confirmed Tuesday that some of the ship's crew had planned to leave, but he said he was not aware of any specific travel plans.\n\nIt has been nearly three months since the Dali crashed into the Key Bridge in the middle of the night, killing six members of a construction crew that was doing roadwork at the time.\n\nThe FBI has opened a criminal investigation focusing on the ship -- a probe that will look at least in part at whether the crew left the port knowing the vessel had serious system problems.\n\nThe Dali suffered two electrical blackouts the day before the collision and experienced two more blackouts that disabled critical equipment, National Transportation Safety Board investigators said in a report released last month.

The crew members who received permission to return to their home countries include a cook, several seamen, a fitter, an oiler and a general steward, now may be able to fly home.\n\nThe exact timeline for their departure remained unclear Thursday morning after two days of legal wrangling.\n\nThursday's hearing included seven government lawyers from various agencies, including the U.S. Department of Justice and the National Transportation Safety Board. None spoke at the hearing, where Senior U.S. District Judge James K. Bredar reaffirmed that an agreement had been reached and asked the lawyers to be as efficient as possible.\n\nThursday's hearing could have been avoided entirely if the lawyers for one of the claimants had withdrawn their emergency motion last night instead of this morning, said Bredar, addressing attorneys William H. \"Billy\" Murphy and Jason P. Foster.\n\n\"How are we going to conduct this very complex and potentially lengthy proceeding in the coming months and years?\" Bredar asked. \"My aspiration is that we're going to do so efficiently and with every lawyer bringing their A-game and being conscious of the fact that the actions they take or don't take have consequences.\"\n\nAfter the hearing, Murphy said he was satisfied the emergency was resolved.\n\n\"We're happy that we were able to file the emergency motion and cause the agreement to be made,\" Murphy said.\n\nHis team filed the withdrawal as quickly as they could, he said, and was still in negotiations as late as this morning.\n\nMurphy's client in the litigation, Damon Davis, has not yet filed his claim against the Dali. Murphy declined to describe his client's connection to the case Thursday, saying Davis is suffering from post-traumatic stress disorder and does not want publicity.\n\nThe vessel struck the Key Bridge early on the morning of March 26, collapsing the span into the Patapsco River and killing six members of a crew who were doing road work on the bridge. The accident closed the Port of Baltimore to all vessel traffic for weeks. It wasn't fully reopened until earlier this month.\n\nThe ship's owner and manager, both companies based in Singapore, quickly filed a limitation of liability action in federal court aimed at capping the amount of damages they could be forced to pay at about $43 million, roughly the salvage value of the Dali and its cargo.\n\nThe Dali remained pinned under the Key Bridge until last month, when it was refloated and moved to Seagirt Marine Terminal. The massive ship and its crew, who are from India and Sri Lanka, have remained there since, though it could be moved to Norfolk, Virginia, for more repairs as early as Friday.", "source": {"uri": "arcamax.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "ArcaMax"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Key_Bridge_(Washington,_D.C.)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Key Bridge (Washington, D.C.)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cargo_ship", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Cargo ship"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baltimore", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Baltimore"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Baltimore"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dali_City", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Dali City"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Dali City"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "China"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_K._Bredar", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "James K.

They were unable to depart the ship because they were considered witnesses and did not have valid visas or shore passes to enter the US.\n\nAccording to local media reports, a deal reached between the city of Baltimore, the ship's owners, and its management company will now allow some sailors to leave the vessel.\n\nThey will have to be made available for depositions even after they leave the US, however.\n\nThe number of crew members initially headed home - and their date of departure - is unclear.\n\nWhen contacted by the BBC, Synergy Marine - the ship's management company -spokesperson Darrel Wilson said that the company is \"working to send some crew home\", while \"some will remain to assist with the investigation\".\n\nHe added that the crew is \"doing well\".\n\nTwo unions representing the sailors said in May that morale on the ship had \"dipped\" due to \"unfounded fear of personal criminal liability\" and emotional distress.\n\nGrace Ocean Private Ltd, which owns the ship, did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\nIn court documents filed earlier this week, lawyers for Baltimore said they were made aware last-minute that eight of the seafarers were planning to leave the country as early as Wednesday.\n\nThe city initially called for a judge to intervene to prevent that from happening.\n\nA deal reached late Wednesday, however, includes a guarantee that the \"vessel interests will produce the witness in question for deposition during the discovery phase\" of legal proceedings, court documents show.\n\nBaltimore officials are currently working to determine potential compensation for the incident and have resisted attempts by the Dali's owner to cap damages at $43m (\u00a333.9m).\n\nThe US Justice Department has already interviewed the Dali's crew as part of its own investigation and has no objection to them leaving the country.\n\nAfter months stranded under the metal and steel remnants of the Key Bridge, the 948ft (289m) ship was towed away last month and is now at a local container terminal.\n\nReplacement sailors will be brought in while the ship remains at the terminal, according to CBS, the BBC's news partner.\n\nLast week, the shipping channel outside of Baltimore that was had been blocked by the crash was re-opened after 11 weeks of closure.", "source": {"uri": "bbc.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "BBC"},

Now a deal means some could be leaving", "body": "They've been stuck aboard the Dali container ship for more than 12 weeks now: as the vessel crashed into and destroyed the Francis Scott Key Bridge, as divers recovered the bodies of six road workers who were killed while filling potholes on the span, as a massive, floating salvage operation sprang up around them to clear the debris.\n\nThe crew remained on board even as explosives were set off to break up the huge piece of the bridge that had landed on its bow and stranded it in the river and the battered vessel was refloated and tugged back into port a month ago.\n\nNow a deal between attorneys for the city and the ship's owner and manager means eight of the crew members could be heading home as soon as Thursday. The city dropped its objections, filed late Tuesday, to the crew members' departure. A federal judge had scheduled a hearing for 10 a.m. Thursday to weigh whether to keep them here at least for now.\n\nIt's not clear whether that hearing will proceed.\n\nThe eight, including a cook, several seamen, a fitter, an oiler and a general steward, now may be able to fly home.\n\nThe city, which has filed a claim against the Dali's Singapore-based owner and manager for negligence in the bridge collapse, had feared it might lose the opportunity to question crew members as part of the litigation should they leave the country.\n\nBut attorneys for the ship's owner and manager promised it would make those crew members available for depositions at a later date.\n\nThe latest flurry of legal activity comes as the ship is soon to leave Baltimore for Norfolk, Virginia, perhaps as early as Friday, where it will undergo initial repairs.\n\nDarrell Wilson, a spokesman for Synergy Marine Group, the vessel operator, said the plan is to use a replacement crew for the trip to Norfolk, but there is \"no firm timeline\" at the moment.\n\nIn any event, the legal wrangling could have extended the ordeal for crew members, who have not been allowed off the ship since before it set sail in the early morning hours of March 26, only to lose power and careen into the bridge. Attempts to get them shore leave during this time have been unsuccessful.\n\n...continued", "source": {"uri": "arcamax.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "ArcaMax"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bow_(watercraft)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Bow (watercraft)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Explosive", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Explosive"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Key_Bridge_(Washington,_D.C.)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Key Bridge (Washington, D.C.)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Container_ship", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Container ship"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bridge", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Bridge"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marine_salvage", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Marine salvage"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chief_steward", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Chief steward"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Machinist", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Machinist"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Replenishment_oiler", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Replenishment oiler"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Negligence", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Negligence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Port", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Port"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_federal_judge", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United States federal judge"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shore_leave", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Shore leave"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deposition_(law)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Deposition (law)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lawsuit", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Lawsuit"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Norfolk,_Virginia", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Norfolk, Virginia"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Norfolk, Virginia"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baltimore", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Baltimore"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Baltimore"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Business/Transportation_and_Logistics/Maritime", "label": "dmoz/Business/Transportation and Logistics/Maritime", "wgt": 24}, {"uri": "dmoz/Science/Technology/Structural_Engineering", "label": "dmoz/Science/Technology/Structural Engineering", "wgt": 23}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Card_Games/Trick_Capturing", "label": "dmoz/Games/Card Games/Trick Capturing", "wgt": 18}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Water_Sports/Rowing", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Water Sports/Rowing", "wgt": 17}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Roads_and_Highways/Bridges_and_Tunnels", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Roads and Highways/Bridges and Tunnels", "wgt": 24}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 57}], "image": "https://resources.arcamax.com/newspics/294/29430/2943077.gif", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9663450", "eventUri": "eng-9663450", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "date": "-03-26", "textStart": 2012, "textEnd": 2020}], "sentiment": -0.1058823529411764, "wgt": 161, "relevance": 1}

The shipping lawyers also agreed to turn over certain records regarding the crew members.\n\nU.S. District Judge James Bredar went ahead with the hearing mostly to upbraid lawyers for the inspector for not withdrawing their emergency motion before Thursday morning, though the deal had been substantially hammered out the day before, he said.\n\nBredar, who said he'd rescheduled two criminal proceedings and called seven U.S. government lawyers to the packed courtroom at taxpayers' expense, expressed his frustration that the lawyers had not gotten things squared away the day before, saying the attorneys needed to \"dot all the I's and cross all the T's.\"\n\nLitigation over the disaster would be long and complex, and he expected lawyers to \"bring their A game,\" Bredar said. He directed his ire primarily at the inspector's lawyers, Jason P. Foster and William H. \"Billy\" Murphy Jr.\n\nFoster declined to comment afterward.

It decimated the structure, knocking over 2,500 feet of bridge into the Patapsco River, killing six construction workers and blocking Baltimore's shipping channel for over two months.\n\nThe ship itself, with its crumpled bow, was stuck in the waterway for 55 days before being towed last month to the port. Since then, crews have worked to ready the vessel for a voyage to Norfolk, Virginia. It is still unknown precisely when the ship will depart, but it could be as early as Friday evening, Coast Guard Cmdr. Baxter Smoak told The Baltimore Sun.\n\nThe Dali has one specific need to be settled before it departs. While most ships can head to a port and simply drop anchor near their destination if they need to wait for a berth, the Dali cannot. It does not have either of its two anchors, so it needs to leave Baltimore and go directly to a berth.\n\n\"They can't go down and anchor off Cape Henry and wait because they don't have anchors, right?\" Smoak said. \"So the movement has to be highly choreographed. They gotta go straight from one terminal to the next.\"\n\nOne of the Dali's anchors was \"completely crushed\" during the bridge collapse, while the other was cut free during the salvage, Smoak said.\n\nWithout anchors and still quite damaged, the Dali will be carefully escorted to Norfolk. It will sail under its own power, but four tugboats will assist it the entire way. A Coast Guard cutter will also form part of the convoy and enforce a \"moving safety zone.\" Another work boat -- from the salvor Resolve Marine -- will also escort. In total, seven vessels, including the Dali, will make the 16- to 20-hour trip.\n\n\"It's another set of eyes to ensure that nothing falls off of the vessel,\" Smoak said of the salvor's boat. \"If something were to fall off the vessel, there's someone there to immediately respond, mark it and recover it.\"\n\nThe Dali's bow has been a mangled mess of crushed cargo containers and bridge pieces since the collapse. While much has been removed, some will remain on the ship during its transit. Crews have secured any loose debris, Smoak added.\n\n\"Anything that was overhanging will be removed before their departure,\" he said, \"but there's still going to be wreckage on the bow of the vessel.\"\n\nAfter being patched up in Norfolk, the Dali will sail to another, still-undetermined shipyard for more extensive repairs, said Darrell Wilson, a spokesperson for the ship's owner, Grace Ocean Private Ltd.\n\nThe Dali's Chesapeake Bay transit comes after crews used explosive devices to cut into a piece of bridge that sat atop the bow. That enabled the ship to be refloated in May and relocated to the Dundalk Marine Terminal.\n\nRemoving the Dali from the shipping channel near Fort McHenry was a key step to freeing the waterway and last week, the 700-foot wide, 50-foot deep channel was entirely re-opened. Commerce into the Port of Baltimore has not returned to precollapse levels, but authorities hope it will this year.\n\nIn the meantime, the Maryland Transportation Authority is making plans to identify a builder for the replacement Key Bridge. The span, which is projected to cost $1.7 billion, is expected to open by October 2028.", "source": {"uri": "baltimoresun.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Baltimore Sun"}, "authors": [{"uri":

The Dali could arrive this week.", "body": "With wreckage still aboard and six vessels assisting it, the cargo ship Dali will soon -- after nearly three months in the area -- depart Baltimore.\n\nThe 984-foot, 124,000-ton ship first left the Port of Baltimore in the early hours of March 26, headed for Sri Lanka, but it lost power almost immediately and crashed into a support pier of the Francis Scott Key Bridge. It decimated the structure, knocking over 2,500 feet of bridge into the Patapsco River, killing six construction workers and blocking Baltimore's shipping channel for over two months.\n\nThe ship itself, with its crumpled bow, was stuck in the waterway for 55 days before being towed last month to the port. Since then, crews have worked to ready the vessel for a voyage to Norfolk, Virginia. It is still unknown precisely when the ship will depart, but it could be as early as Friday evening, Coast Guard Cmdr. Baxter Smoak told The Baltimore Sun.\n\nThe Dali has one specific need to be settled before it departs. While most ships can head to a port and simply drop anchor near their destination if they need to wait for a berth, the Dali cannot. It does not have either of its two anchors, so it needs to leave Baltimore and go directly to a berth.\n\n\"They can't go down and anchor off Cape Henry and wait because they don't have anchors, right?\" Smoak said. \"So the movement has to be highly choreographed. They gotta go straight from one terminal to the next.\"\n\nOne of the Dali's anchors was \"completely crushed\" during the bridge collapse, while the other was cut free during the salvage, Smoak said.\n\nWithout anchors and still quite damaged, the Dali will be carefully escorted to Norfolk. It will sail under its own power, but four tugboats will assist it the entire way. A Coast Guard cutter will also form part of the convoy and enforce a \"moving safety zone.\" Another work boat -- from the salvor Resolve Marine -- will also escort. In total, seven vessels, including the Dali, will make the 16- to 20-hour trip.\n\n\"It's another set of eyes to ensure that nothing falls off of the vessel,\" Smoak said of the salvor's boat. \"If something were to fall off the vessel, there's someone there to immediately respond, mark it and recover it.\"\n\nThe Dali's bow has been a mangled mess of crushed cargo containers and bridge pieces since the collapse. While much has been removed, some will remain on the ship during its transit. Crews have secured any loose debris, Smoak added.\n\n\"Anything that was overhanging will be removed before their departure,\" he said, \"but there's still going to be wreckage on the bow of the vessel.\"\n\nAfter being patched up in Norfolk, the Dali will sail to another, still-undetermined shipyard for more extensive repairs, said Darrell Wilson, a spokesperson for the ship's owner, Grace Ocean Private Ltd.\n\nThe Dali's Chesapeake Bay transit comes after crews used explosive devices to cut into a piece of bridge that sat atop the bow. That enabled the ship to be refloated in May and relocated to the Dundalk Marine Terminal.\n\nRemoving the Dali from the shipping channel near Fort McHenry was a key step to freeing the waterway and last week, the 700-foot wide, 50-foot deep channel was entirely re-opened. Commerce into the Port of Baltimore has not returned to precollapse levels, but authorities hope it will this year.\n\nIn the meantime, the Maryland Transportation Authority is making plans to identify a builder for the replacement Key Bridge. The span, which is projected to cost $1.7 billion, is expected to open by October 2028.", "source": {"uri": "pilotonline.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Virginian Pilot"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cargo_ship", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Cargo ship"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bridge", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Bridge"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Norfolk,_Virginia", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Norfolk, Virginia"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Norfolk, Virginia"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baltimore", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Baltimore"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Baltimore"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dali_City", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Dali City"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Dali City"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "China"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Port", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Port"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Port_of_Baltimore", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Port of Baltimore"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Francis_Scott_Key_Bridge_(Baltimore)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Francis Scott Key Bridge (Baltimore)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patapsco_River", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Patapsco River"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anchor", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Anchor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marine_salvage", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Marine salvage"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pier", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Pier"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sri_Lanka", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Sri Lanka"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Sri Lanka"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cape_Henry", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Cape Henry"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Coast_Guard_Cutter", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United States Coast Guard Cutter"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Coast_Guard", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United States Coast Guard"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Baltimore_Sun", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "The Baltimore Sun"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tugboat", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Tugboat"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Convoy", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Convoy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maryland_Transportation_Authority", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Maryland Transportation Authority"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Key_Bridge_(Washington,_D.C.)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Key Bridge (Washington, D.C.)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fort_McHenry", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Fort McHenry"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chesapeake_Bay", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Chesapeake Bay"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shipyard", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Shipyard"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dundalk", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Dundalk"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Dundalk"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Ireland"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Business/Transportation_and_Logistics/Maritime", "label": "dmoz/Business/Transportation and Logistics/Maritime", "wgt": 29}, {"uri": "dmoz/Science/Technology/Structural_Engineering", "label": "dmoz/Science/Technology/Structural Engineering", "wgt": 20}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Card_Games/Trick_Capturing", "label": "dmoz/Games/Card Games/Trick Capturing", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Genealogy/Emigration_and_Immigration", "label": "dmoz/Society/Genealogy/Emigration and Immigration", "wgt": 17}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Roads_and_Highways/Bridges_and_Tunnels", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Roads and Highways/Bridges and Tunnels", "wgt": 21}], "image": "https://www.dailypress.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/TBS-L-KEYBRIDGEDALI-0619-03.jpg?w=640", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9663450", "eventUri": "eng-9663450", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "date": "-03-26", "textStart": 236, "textEnd": 244}], "sentiment": -0.05098039215686279, "wgt": 131, "relevance": 1}

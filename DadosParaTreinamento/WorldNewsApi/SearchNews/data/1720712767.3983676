She's been re-elected to Limerick City and County Council increasing her vote by almost 30%. And on top of that, it was the anniversary of her wedding to husband Conor O'Brien. The pair married in France back in 2012. The City North councillor, a marketing consultant by profession, secured a vote of 1,782. It came thanks to a generous transfer of 297 from her running mate Richard Delaney, who was eliminated after the 11th count. BREAKING: Labour's Joe Leddin says it's been an 'emotional rollercoaster' as he holds his seat in Limerick City West \"I'm so grateful. I have a lot of unfinished business and I can't wait to get back to work,\" she said. \"I'm elated, tired obviously after the campaign after the weekend. I feel humbled to see all the votes coming in for me. My first preference vote went up almost 30%. That's a really big deal for me. People putting numbeer one beside my name. It's hugely humbling. I'm very grateful. I'm grateful to all my team that put so much into my campaign,\" she said. Unlike her last election in 2019, Cllr O'Sullivan was elected in the middle of the day, as opposed to four o'clock in the morning. She headed off from the count centre to watch Limerick's Munster final game against Clare. Following the 12th count in Limerick City North, the surplus votes of Cllr O'Sllivan and Cllr O'Hanlon - 186 and 32 respectively - are now being checked for impact before any further elimination takes place.", "summary": "<table><tr><td><img src=\"https://www.limerickleader.ie/resizer/300/200/true/2024_06_09/ilim_olivia_o_sullivan_elected_9-6-24-1717953005316.jpg--.jpg?1717953007871\" alt=\"\" align=\"left\" />FINE GAEL councillor Olivia O'Sullivan has two reasons to celebrate this Sunday!

The unrest has intensified following the resignation and subsequent fleeing of Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina to India. Social media is awash with disturbing footage of temples being set ablaze and Hindu homes and businesses being attacked.\n\nDespite the chaos, there are glimmers of hope. Videos have surfaced showing Muslim clerics in Cumilla standing guard to protect a Hindu temple from rioters.\n\nA report by Bangladesh's Daily Star highlighted the extent of the violence, noting that Hindu homes and businesses were attacked and looted in at least 27 districts on Monday.\n\nISKCON Temple Set on Fire, Hindu Councillors Killed\n\nIn one of the most severe incidents, an ISKCON temple in Meherpur, Khulna division, was vandalized and set on fire. ISKCON spokesperson Yudhistir Govinda Das reported that the deities of Lord Jagannath, Baladev, and Subhadra Devi were destroyed, although three devotees managed to escape unharmed.\n\nAdding to the tragedy, Haradhan Roy, a Hindu councillor from Rangpur City Corporation, was killed on Sunday, a day marked by intense clashes and violence that claimed over 100 lives. Another councillor, Kajal Roy, was reportedly lynched.\n\nSanjeev Sanyal, a member of the Economic Advisory Council to the Prime Minister, highlighted the lynching of Haradhan Roy, expressing deep concern as a Bengali Hindu and a descendant of refugees.\n\nVideos shared by Hindu activists depict the severity of the situation, including a girl in distress pleading for help in Pirojpur district and a temple in Navgraha Bari, Chittagong, being set on fire by a mob.\n\nThe Bangladesh Hindu Buddhist Christian Unity Council has documented 54 attacks on Hindu temples, homes, and businesses, including the Indira Gandhi Cultural Centre, which fosters cultural ties between India and Bangladesh.\n\nHistoric and Ongoing Persecution\n\nThe current attacks are the most severe against Hindus in Bangladesh since 2021, when widespread violence erupted following Prime Minister Narendra Modi's visit. At that time, numerous Hindu temples were attacked.\n\nToday, Hindus constitute about 8% of Bangladesh's population, approximately 13.1 million people. This is a significant decline from 1951, when Hindus made up 22% of the population. According to the Hindu American Foundation, over 11 million Hindus fled Bangladesh due to religious persecution between 1964 and 2013.\n\nMonindra Kumar Nath, senior joint general secretary of Oikya Parishad, a Hindu organization, voiced the community's fears. \"Hindus are crying, saying they are being beaten up, and their houses and businesses are being looted. What is our fault? Is it our fault that we are citizens of the country?\" Nath told the Daily Star.\n\nPossible Influx of Hindu Refugees\n\nWith Hasina's departure, there are concerns that the Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP) and Jamaat-e-Islami could gain significant influence, potentially leading to an influx of Hindu refugees into India.\n\nIndia shares a nearly 4,096 km long land and riverine border with Bangladesh. Suvendu Adhikari, Leader of Opposition in West Bengal, has warned the Mamata Banerjee-led government to prepare for a possible influx of one crore Hindu refugees from Bangladesh.\n\nBJP leader Sunil Deodhar stressed the importance of prioritizing the safety of Hindus in Bangladesh. \"Widespread violence against Hindus has been reported. Regardless of the issue, whenever the sentiments of Muslims are ignited, they target only 'Kafirs' in 'their' land,\" Deodhar tweeted.", "source": {"uri": "lagatar24.com", "dataType": "news", "title":

While the agitation began as a student-led protest against the quota system in the country, the political forces turned it into a mass movement against Hasina's rule which climaxed on Sunday when nearly 100 people were killed.

In the past many years, waves of violence against Hindus on festivals have occurred often but Hasina and her government appeared to be making efforts to contain the extremists.

What began as protests against a government job quota system have escalated into a full-blown crisis, leaving the nation's Hindu community vulnerable to attacks.\n\nReports indicate that Hindu temples, homes, and businesses have been targeted in at least 27 districts across Bangladesh. The Bangladesh Hindu Buddhist Christian Unity Council has documented 54 separate attacks on Hindu establishments. An ISKCON temple in Meherpur, situated in Bangladesh's Khulna division, along with a Kali temple, was vandalized and set ablaze. The Indira Gandhi Cultural Centre, which promotes Indo-Bangladesh cultural exchange, was also among the targets.\n\nTragically, Hindu political figures have fallen victim to the violence. Haradhan Roy, a Hindu councillor of the Rangpur City Corporation, was reportedly killed on Sunday, one of the deadliest days since the protests began. Another councillor, Kajal Roy, was also said to have been lynched.\n\nThe scale of the current attacks on Hindus is the most severe since 2021 when similar violence erupted following Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi's visit to Bangladesh. Hindu community leaders express fear of further attacks, with Monindra Kumar Nath, a senior official of the Hindu organization Oikya Parishad, voicing concerns about the safety and future of Hindus in the country.\n\nThe situation in Bangladesh is dire, with a student protest leader who contributed to the downfall of Hasina raising concerns about ongoing violence against Hindus.\n\nIn a DW News interview, student leader Prapti Taposhi stated that the removal of Hasina was only a partial victory since the violence against Hindus persists, and the military, currently governing the country, fails to safeguard the Hindu minority.\n\nThe situation has raised alarms about the long-term safety of Bangladesh's Hindu population, which has declined from 22% in 1951 to about 8% today.

AP\n\nBangladeshi Nobel laureate Muhammad Yunus has been named the chief adviser to the interim government in Bangladesh as announced by the coordinators of the Anti-Discrimination Student Movement on Tuesday. Yunus, celebrated globally for his pioneering work in microfinance, faces a daunting task: guiding a nation fraught with political unrest and religious tension.\n\nYunus has criticised the political climate under Sheikh Hasina's rule comparing it to an authoritarian regime where citizens felt oppressed. In his view, the ousting of Hasina's government marks a new dawn for Bangladesh, bringing a sense of liberation. However, this newfound freedom has been marred by violence, particularly against minority Hindus, revealing deep-seated societal fissures that require immediate attention.\n\nWhile Yunus has spoken of liberation in an interview with The Print, he must recognise that true freedom cannot exist amid lawlessness. His leadership should focus on halting violence against Hindus, restoring their dignity and ensuring their security and equal rights. This is critical, as the recent political upheaval has emboldened extremist factions, exacerbating the plight of Hindus who have long faced persecution in Bangladesh.\n\nThis advisory role becomes even more critical in light of the fact that, while Hasina's government did not fully ensure the safety of the Hindu community, her ouster has significantly worsened their situation. The ensuing political upheaval has emboldened Islamist extremists, leading to violence reminiscent of the October 2013 unrest. This recent outbreak against Hindus highlights a deepening crisis as the country grapples with instability. With Yunus at the helm of the interim government, he is in a unique position to address these challenges and work towards fostering an environment of peace and equality for all communities in Bangladesh.\n\nBreakdown of law and order\n\nReports from various regions paint a dire picture. Hindu homes are systematically targeted, set on fire and looted, while women face abductions. This reflects a total breakdown of law and order with the administration seemingly unable or unwilling to protect its Hindu citizens from escalating violence.\n\nOne of the most egregious incidents occurred at an ISKCON centre in Meherpur, Khulna Division, where attackers reportedly set fire to the premises, including sacred deities of Lord Jagannath, Baladev, and Subhadra Devi. Miraculously, three devotees managed to escape, but the attack has left a lasting scar on the community. Such assaults on religious institutions are frequent, with many Hindu temples, including those dedicated to ISKCON and the Kali temple, being targeted.\n\nEyewitness accounts and ground reality\n\nVideos and eyewitness accounts corroborate the scale and brutality of these atrocities. The attackers exhibit a blatant disregard for human life terrorising civilians left without protection. The Hindu populace is forced to fend for themselves amid growing hostility and fear.\n\nThe targeting of women adds another layer of horror. Eyewitnesses report numerous instances of women being abducted and taken to undisclosed locations, further traumatising families already facing violence and displacement. This targeted violence is part of a broader campaign aimed at demoralising and destabilising the Hindu community.\n\nThe absence of a decisive government response has only emboldened the perpetrators. The lack of intervention has exacerbated the crisis, leaving the Hindu community in a perpetual state of fear for their lives and safety. Reports indicate a systematic assault on Hindu communities and religious sites, signalling a tipping point.\n\nAmid this turmoil, the international community's attention is crucial. The crisis highlights the vulnerability of religious minorities in politically unstable regions and raises questions about the future of secularism and tolerance in Bangladesh. Without intervention, the safety and security of the Hindu community remain precarious with potential long-term ramifications for Bangladesh's social fabric.\n\nIn Bangladesh, the plight of Hindus has been a matter of significant concern for many years. Despite being the second-largest religious group in the country, Hindus often face a range of challenges, including discrimination, violence and marginalisation. The history of atrocities against Hindus in Bangladesh is both tragic and complex, marked by periods of intense violence, forced conversions and systemic discrimination. These incidents underscore the vulnerability of minority communities in a country where religious identity can often become a basis for targeted aggression.\n\nHistorical context\n\nThe Hindu community in Bangladesh traces its roots back thousands of years and has played a significant role in the region's cultural and historical development. However, the partition of India in 1947 and the subsequent creation of Pakistan, which included present-day Bangladesh (then East Pakistan), marked the beginning of a difficult era for Hindus. The partition itself was accompanied by widespread communal violence, which saw thousands of Hindus displaced or killed. The situation worsened during the Bangladesh Liberation War of 1971, where the Pakistani military and its collaborators carried out mass atrocities against Bengali Hindus, resulting in an estimated 2.4 million Hindu deaths. This dark chapter in history left a lasting scar on the Hindu community in Bangladesh.\n\nSince the independence of Bangladesh in 1971, Hindus have continued to face persecution in various forms. Reports of attacks on Hindu temples, properties and individuals have been alarmingly frequent. These incidents often peak during religious festivals or political unrest, indicating a targeted approach to intimidate and oppress the minority community. The destruction of temples, desecration of idols and arson attacks on Hindu homes have become distressingly common. In many cases, these acts of violence are fuelled by land-grabbing motives, where Hindu properties are forcibly taken over by influential groups with little to no legal repercussions.\n\nFor instance, during the nationwide anti-Hindu violence in 2013, numerous Hindu villages were attacked. Homes were burned, temples were vandalised and many Hindus were left homeless. Similar incidents were reported during the communal violence in October 2021, where over 70 Hindu temples were vandalised across Bangladesh following false rumours of the desecration of the Quran. There were falsified images of a copy of the Quran in the lap of Lord Hanuman's idol at a Durga Puja pandal in Comilla district were circulated over the internet by Jamaat-e-Islami members which resulted in massive violence against the Hindus.\n\nSocial and political discrimination\n\nBeyond physical violence, Hindus in Bangladesh face systemic discrimination in various aspects of life, including education, employment and political representation. Many Hindu families feel pressured to leave their ancestral homes due to threats and harassment leading to a significant decline in the Hindu population over the decades. The community's political representation remains disproportionately low, limiting their influence in addressing their grievances and advocating for their rights.\n\nThe Vested Property Act, originally enacted as the Enemy Property Act in 1965, is one of the most significant legal challenges faced by Hindus. This law allowed the government to confiscate properties deemed \"enemy property,\" primarily targeting Hindus who fled to India during times of communal strife. Despite reforms, the legacy of this act continues to affect many Hindu families, who struggle to reclaim their ancestral properties.\n\nDwindling Hindu population in Bangladesh\n\nThe latest census conducted in 2022 highlighted a concerning trend in Bangladesh: a continued decline in the population of minority religions. According to the census, the Hindu population now constitutes 7.95 per cent of the total population. This marks a decrease from the 8.54 per cent recorded in the 2011 census, reflecting a persistent downward trajectory over the past decade.\n\nThe Bangladesh Bureau of Statistics report further revealed that Khulna Division experienced the most pronounced decline in the Hindu population, with a reduction of 1.33 per cent over the past decade. Historically, the proportion of Hindus in Bangladesh has witnessed a steep decline. Prior to the partition in 1941, Hindus made up approximately 28 per cent of the population. This percentage drastically fell to 8.5 per cent by 2011. The reduction in Hindu demographic share is indicative of complex socio-political dynamics that have influenced population patterns over the decades.\n\nThe annual report published by the Bangladesh Jatiya Hindu Mohajote in 2020 presented alarming statistics on violence and persecution against Hindus. Between 2015 and 2020, there was a significant rise in the number of incidents involving Hindus being killed, injured, abducted converted and raped. This trend of increasing violence not only impacts the physical security of the Hindu community but also contributes to their declining numbers as many are forced to flee or convert due to socio-political pressures.\n\nThe political landscape in Bangladesh has often been challenging for minority groups. Systematic persecution including forced conversions and destruction of religious sites further marginalises minority communities and discourages them from maintaining their religious identities.\n\nThe historical context of religious demographics in Bangladesh reveals a long-term trend of declining Hindu populations. This decline is not merely a statistical anomaly but a reflection of the socio-political and cultural challenges faced by the Hindu community in Bangladesh.\n\nYunus's crucial test\n\nWhile Yunus's reputation and vision for a more liberated Bangladesh offer hope, the current crisis facing the Hindu community presents an immediate and grave challenge. As Yunus steps into his role, his success will hinge on his ability to address these critical issues with both strategic acumen and a deep commitment to justice and equality.", "source": {"uri":

The unrest follows the recent ousting of Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina and has resulted in widespread vandalism of Hindu homes, businesses, and temples.\n\nAccording to the Bangladesh Hindu Buddhist Christian Unity Council, violence has spread across 45 of the country's 64 districts. This week's clashes have tragically resulted in the death of a school teacher and injuries to 45 others.\n\nHindus make up around 8% of Bangladesh's 170 million population and have traditionally supported Hasina's Awami League party, which is seen as secular, rather than the opposition bloc that includes a hardline Islamist party.\n\nWith Hasina now taking refuge in India amid mass protests against her rule, tensions between the two nations have risen. Many Hindus living near the Indian border have attempted to cross over, but have faced resistance on both sides.\n\nMohammad Rakibul Hasan, a local government official in Thakurgaon district in northwestern Bangladesh, said around 700-800 Hindus tried to flee to India around Wednesday evening after some of their houses were attacked and looted. \"They returned home after we provided protection,\" Hasan told Reuters. \"Border guard troops are patrolling the area. Everything is fine now with no further reports of violence.\"\n\nEarlier today, about 300 Bangladeshis gathered at a border point near India's Jalpaiguri district but were later dispersed. Indian border troops were seen monitoring the situation.\n\nA Hindu goldsmith in the Narsingdi area, about an hour from Dhaka, who did not want to be named for fear of reprisals, said two youths demanded protection money of 1 million Bangladesh taka ($8,550) and relented only after they agreed to pay 100,000 taka.\n\nNobel Peace laureate Muhammad Yunus, who returned to Bangladesh on Thursday to head an interim government following Hasina's departure, said attacks on minorities could have been part of a conspiracy. He did not say who was behind the conspiracy. \"Our job is to protect all of them,\" he said on arrival in Dhaka from Paris.\n\n\"If you have faith in me and trust me, please ensure no one is attacked in the country. If you cannot listen to me on this, I have no use being here.\"\n\nMeanwhile, India, which has a Hindu majority, has said it was worrying that minorities, their businesses and temples had been attacked in many places. \"It is the responsibility of every government to ensure the wellbeing of all its citizens,\" India's foreign ministry spokesperson, Randhir Jaiswal, told a press conference. \"We hope for the early restoration of law and order in Bangladesh. This is both in the interest of the country itself and the larger region.\"\n\nBangladesh's Hindu community leaders urged other communities to look after the religious minorities. \"I call upon the conscientious people of the country to forget all differences and stand unitedly by the side of the affected people and build social resistance,\" said Moyna Talukdar of the Bangladesh Hindu Law Reform Council.", "source": {"uri": "indianexpress.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Indian Express"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hindus", "type": "loc",

The Bangladesh Hindu Buddhist Christian Unity Council (BHBCUC) reported that 200-300 Hindu properties have been damaged, and 15-20 temples have been attacked. Although there have been no fatalities, at least 40 people have been injured, with many in the Hindu community feeling abandoned and vulnerable due to the lack of government intervention.\n\nIndia has expressed deep concern over the attacks, with External Affairs Minister S. Jaishankar highlighting the severity of the situation. \"What is particularly worrying is that minorities, their businesses, and temples have also come under attack at multiple locations,\" he said. In response to the violence, India has evacuated non-essential staff and their families from its embassy and consulates in Bangladesh. However, all Indian diplomats remain in the country, and the missions continue to function.\n\nThe violence erupted shortly before Sheikh Hasina's resignation, which has plunged Bangladesh into political chaos. As the country grapples with the aftermath, the newly appointed leader of the interim government, Professor Muhammad Yunus, faces international pressure to restore order and protect minority communities.\n\nPrime Minister Narendra Modi, in a statement, emphasized India's commitment to ensuring the safety of Hindus and other minorities in Bangladesh, expressing hope for an early return to normalcy.\n\n\"My best wishes to Professor Muhammad Yunus on the assumption of his new responsibilities. We hope for an early return to normalcy, ensuring the safety and protection of Hindus and all other minority communities,\" he said. \"India remains committed to working with Bangladesh to fulfill the shared aspirations of both our peoples for peace, security, and development,\" wrote PM Modi on X.\n\nDespite appeals for calm from various quarters, including student protesters who led the movement against Hasina, Hindu community leaders report that they are receiving distress calls from people fearing for their lives. Manindra Kumar Nath, a Hindu leader, described the situation as \"horrific,\" noting the lack of support from authorities.\n\nThe viral image of the woman purportedly a Hindu in violence-hit Bangladesh has ignited a broader conversation about the need for self-defense and protection within the community.\n\n\"A Hindu woman in Bangladesh has rightfully decided to pick up a weapon. There is no place for a Pacifist Hindu anymore. The lie about 'Ahimsa Pamo Dharma' and that our freedom was earned through non violence has robbed generations of Hindus of their Kshatra,\" wrote one user on X.\n\nAnother added, \"This photo is from Bangladesh, where a Hindu woman stands bravely to fight against Islamists who came to rape and kill her. Hindus should learn from her how to fight, as you must stand up to survive.\"\n\nA third user, who shared the viral photo, remarked, \"Like Kaali ma!\"", "source": {"uri": "newsable.asianetnews.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Asianet News Network Pvt Ltd"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hindus", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Hindus"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Temple", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Temple"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Narendra_Modi", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Narendra Modi"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_media", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Social media"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/India", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "India"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bangladesh", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Bangladesh"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Bangladesh"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sheikh_Hasina", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Sheikh Hasina"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bangladesh_Hindu_Buddhist_Christian_Unity_Council", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Bangladesh Hindu Buddhist Christian Unity Council"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anti-Hindu_sentiment", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Anti-Hindu sentiment"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Devi", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Devi"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Machete", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Machete"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/S._Jaishankar", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "S.

AP\n\nBeing a Hindu in Bangladesh is a difficult situation. Till the other day, he aroused anger, especially among the people of jihadi kind, for being seen as a collaborator who schemed enough to become a Sheikh Hasina supporter. He indeed was a loyal Hasina supporter. Still, that doesn't guarantee him safety. As per a 2021 human rights report, Bangladesh saw more than 3,600 attacks on Hindus in Bangladesh since 2013. Hasina had been in power since 2009.\n\nMinorities in Bangladesh had been ardent Hasina supporters not because the killing of Hindus, the destruction and looting of their property, including temples, and the wanton discrimination regularly meted out to them had stopped completely. Every now and then, on one pretext or the other, there would be violence where only one particular community would be targeted. The last \"great killing\" took place in 2021 when a copy of the Quran was found at a Durga Puja pandal. It later turned out to be the handiwork of a Muslim man, but the damage was done. As a result, if The Daily Star, the largest-circulating daily English-language newspaper in Bangladesh, is to be believed, \"117 Hindu temples or puja pandals and 301 shops/homes were also damaged\".\n\nThe Hindu-Muslim violence in Bangladesh is starkly different from that in Bharat. One tends to loosely use the term riot to describe it. But then they are not riots. There can never be a riot in a Muslim-majority state. Remember that line from Taslima Nasrin's Lajja, where Suronjon is caught in an argument with his father, Sudhamoy Datta: When the father defends his stay in violence-prone Bangladesh, saying there \"are riots in all countries. Aren't there riots in India?\", the son responds: \"Riots are good, Baba. But here we don't have riots. Here Muslims are killing Hindus!\"\n\nStill Hindus supported Hasina. Because she ensured there was a semblance of order, a sense of normalcy in their lives. They had seen much worse, so much violence that Hasina's 'controlled chaos' was something they grasped with both hands.\n\nBut as the saying goes, 'good' things don't last long. And they ended this Tuesday, August 6, when Sheikh Hasina was given the 45-minute ultimatum to pack her bags and leave the country. The chaos soon descended on the streets of Bangladesh and even the statue of Bangbandhu -- the man who got the country's freedom in 1971 -- was not left alone.\n\nFor Hindus in Bangladesh, the era of a jhatka-type of execution was back in action. One can grasp the seriousness of the situation from the fact that the head of Bharat's Ministry of External Affairs, which is instinctively prone to take a less alarmist position, informed Parliament that \"properties of individuals associated with the (Hasina) regime were torched across the country. What was particularly worrying was that minorities, their businesses and temples also came under attack at multiple locations\".\n\nWithin 24 hours, there were reports of Hindus being attacked, their houses and temples ransacked, and their valuables looted in as many as 27 districts of Bangladesh. Even an ISKCON temple wasn't spared. Orchestrated by Jamaat-led Islamist outfits, one saw the resumption of ethnic cleansing that Sheikh Hasina had put a lid on 15 years ago. One can gauge the scale and nature of violence from a harrowing video in circulation these days when Islamist fundamentalists are seen inspecting the genitals of a lynched man, and expressing happiness that he is a Hindu!\n\nThe othering of Hindus was always normal in Bangladesh. But now, the genie of jihad, which Hasina had kept inside the bottle for 15 years, is out in the open. Unfortunately, at a time when the minorities of Bangladesh deserved care, empathy and support, there is a tendency, especially among Hindu 'liberals', to look the other way, if not completely discount their sufferings. One editor of a New Delhi-based website who carries an American passport, in an interview recently, dismissed the possibility of Hindus being attacked in Bangladesh. Ironically, the same gentleman is never tired of raising the spectre of Hindu fundamentalism and Muslim victimhood in Bharat.\n\nThe said editor is merely the grotesque manifestation of a so-called liberal's innate tendency to submit to the Islamist violence in the name of secularism. These people have chosen to be blind to the deliberate othering of minorities in Islamic states, and Bangladesh is no exception. They don't care to see that Hindu population in Bangladesh has dwindled to a third from 22 per cent in 1952 to less than 8 per cent today. Such is the scale of Hindu decimation in Bangladesh that \"30 years from now, no Hindus will be left in Bangladesh should the current rate of exodus continue\", Dr Abul Barkat, a Dhaka University professor, was quoted as saying by Deep Halder and Avishek Biswas in their 2023 book, Being Hindu in Bangladesh.\n\nIf the current situation in Bangladesh is alarmingly grim, the Hindu reaction in Bharat is hardly reassuring. As in the past, there has been a sense of disconnect, if not disinterest, for what is happening to minorities on the other side of the border. What most of these people fail to comprehend is that while they see no connection with their coreligionists in Bangladesh, the Islamists never fail to miss this civilisational/religious link.\n\nBut then, why just blame the Left-'librals' when, in the deeper analysis, this has long been a failing of Hindu society, whether in Bharat or outside? Nasrin explains this Hindu psyche well in Lajja. In the scene, Suronjon is caught in an argument with a boy named Khaled, who calls him names like \"son of a pig\" and \"bastard\". Suronjoy gives him back in equal measure. Nasrin writes further:\n\nSuronjon thought that 'Hindu' too was a swear word. For quite a few years, he had thought that Hindu was a pejorative, mocking term. It was only when he grew up a bit that he understood that there was a community of people called Hindus and he belonged to that community. After some time, he began to believe that he belonged to the human race and a community called Bengali. The Bengali community had not been created by any religion. He wanted to believe that it was non-communal and inclusive.\n\nTowards the end of the novel, Suronjon's make-believe world shatters as he pleads to his father to migrate to Bharat because \"here (in Bangladesh) Muslims are killing Hindus\". Narsin enacts the drama poignantly:\n\n'You are calling yourself a Hindu?' asked Sudhamoy excitedly. He wanted to jump out of bed.\n\n'We might be atheists and humanists,' said Suronjon, restraining his father, 'but people call us Hindus. They call us infidels.'\n\nIn the end, Sudhamoy relents and the Datta family prepares to \"go away\" to Bharat.\n\nThis is the story of Hindus in Bangladesh. Their tragedy is three-fold. First, they were convinced to stay put in Pakistan and Bangladesh by their own leaders led by Mahatma Gandhi and Jawaharlal Nehru. As for the Hindus of Bangladesh, they faced double jeopardy: Most Hindus who stayed back in Bangladesh after Partition belonged to the outcaste community of Namasudras. Before Independence, these people were politically very active and had a charismatic leader in Jogendranath Mandal who believed in the fa\u00e7ade of Dalit-Muslim unity. Mandal convinced his people not to migrate to Bharat. But when most of the upper caste Hindus migrated from Bangladesh (then East Pakistan), these Dalits came in direct confrontation with Islamists. With their departure, the very raison d'etre of Dalit-Muslim alliance was gone. Things became so bad that Mandal, who was Pakistan's first law minister, had to migrate to Bharat in 1950. His followers, being too poor and downtrodden, were not that lucky.\n\nSecond, Hindus left behind -- like the fictional Sudhmoy of Lajja -- convinced themselves that they were not Hindus: They were Bengalis, humanists, atheists, et al. What they failed to realise was that in the eyes of Islamists, they remained Hindus, kafirs!\n\nThird, to their misfortune, their coreligionists in Bharat, especially the dominant Left-'liberal' brigade, give two hoots to their plight in Bangladesh. They look for explanations, often mischievously inventing them, to explain how all's well with minorities in Bangladesh -- and in Pakistan. Such has been the dubious character of this class of people that they swear by Ambedkar, but work overtime to deny any relief to the children of Ambedkar desperately stuck in Bangladesh and Pakistan. These \"Left-'liberals' have been in the forefront to agitate against the CAA introduced by the current government to help the persecuted Hindus of Afghanistan, Pakistan and Bangladesh get the citizenship of Bharat.\n\nPostscript: The level of Hindu indifference to the plight of minorities can be gauged from the fact that it needed an American activist, Richard L Benkin, to bring out the sufferings of minorities in Bangladesh and Pakistan. In his sentinel book, A Quiet Case of Ethnic Cleansing: The Murder of Bangladesh's Hindus, Benkin recalls an interaction with his mother. He writes:\n\nWhen I was a youngster and began understanding what was done to my people (Jews) by the Nazis, I once asked my mother, 'Mom, why didn't American Jews do something about this?' She responded that 'we really had no idea what was happening'.\n\nLater when I started making these trips to South Asia to stop the murder of Pakistani and Bangladeshi Hindus, she and other loved ones often were concerned for my safety. She asked me if the things happening were really that bad, why we never read about it in our papers or hear about it in the media.\n\n'Good question,' I responded. 'You remember what you said when I asked you why American Jews never did anything to help stop the Holocaust? You said that you just had no idea that it was happening.'\n\n'That's right,' she said. 'We didn't.'\n\n'But that didn't mean the murders weren't happening. Just because the papers never reported, it didn't mean that our families weren't killed, did it? Same thing now.'\n\nThe Jews learnt their lessons during World War II. They never forgot the Holocaust. And they ensured the world never forgets that either. The same can hardly be said about the Hindus -- of Bharat, Pakistan and Bangladesh.", "source": {"uri": "firstpost.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Firstpost"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

This comes as India has voiced concerns about the status of minorities and many have requested New Delhi's intervention in the crisis.\n\nHindus constitute around 8 per cent in Bangladesh's 170 million people and have historically largely supported Hasina's Awami League party, which identifies as largely secular. On the other hand, the opposition bloc led by the Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP) includes a hardline Islamist party that is reputed for a rise in extremism.\n\nThe Bangladesh Hindu Buddhist Christian Unity Council (BHBCUC) told Reuters that 200-300 mainly Hindu homes and businesses had been vandalised since Monday, and 15-20 Hindu temples damaged. Up to 40 people have been injured though not seriously, said its general secretary, Rana Dasgupta. \"The communal atrocities erupted hours before she resigned,\" he said.\n\n\"Although there is no killing, there is injury. Houses and businesses of minorities, especially Hindus, as well as temples, have been targeted, looted, damaged,\" Dasgupta further said, adding that some people threw a brick at his car on Monday in Chattogram. \"The situation is horrific,\" said Manindra Kumar Nath, a Hindu community leader. \"Even today, we are getting calls from people asking us to save their lives, but we are not receiving any support from anywhere.\"\n\nStudents who led the protests against Hasina that have killed over 400 people since July have repeatedly urged people not to target minority communities in the overwhelmingly Muslim country. However, Hindu community leaders said they were feeling vulnerable because of the lack of a functioning government.\n\nAvirup Sarkar, a Dhaka-based development professional, told the BBC that his widowed cousin, who lived 100 km from Dhaka, called him in panic hours after Hasina was ousted. \"She sounded terrified. She said the house had been attacked and plundered by a mob,\" he said. His cousin said the mob of about 100 people, armed with sticks, stormed the house, smashing furniture, TV, bathroom fittings and doors. Before leaving, they took all the cash and jewellery.\n\n\"You people are descendants of the Awami League! This country is in a bad shape because of you. You should leave the country,\" the mob shouted at the residents before leaving with the loot, according to Sarkar. This came as social media was flooded with reports of Hindu properties and temples being attacked by angry mobs.\n\nAn ISKCON temple in Meherpur, located in the Khulna Division of the country, was set ablaze along with the idols of deities including Lord Jagannath, Baladev and Subhadra Devi. Dozens of Hindu houses and temples, including a Kali temple were vandalised by violent protesters and two Hindu councillors have reportedly been shot dead. An unruly mob on Monday also damaged the Indira Gandhi Cultural Centre (IGCC) and the Bangabandhu Memorial Museum located in the Dhanmondi area in the Bangladesh capital, eyewitnesses said.\n\nLocal media reports said Hindu journalist Pradip Kumar Bhowmik of Daily Khoborpatra was killed while covering the protests in Sirajganj on Sunday, taking the number of media workers killed in the unrest to five. A total of 25 journalists were injured in incidents of assaults across the country, The Daily Star reported.\n\nMoreover, a violent mob attacked folk singer Rahul Ananda's house in Dhaka's Dhanmondi 32 on Monday. The attacker barged into the house by breaking the main gate and ransacked the place in minutes, following which they set the house on fire. he house, nearly 140-year-old, served as a vibrant cultural hub for musicians and contained over 3,000 handcrafted musical instruments in it, which are all now destroyed.\n\nIn a welcoming sight among the violence, students and local people came for the protection of temples in some places, according to a Dhaka Tribune correspondent. \"Both Muslim and Hindu neighbours are guarding to protect the temple. Some individuals have used this temple for their own benefit. We acknowledge their efforts in developing it, but they have forcibly removed us from the temple,\" said Raj Ghosh at Dhakeshwari Temple.\n\nRanjan Kumar Das, another resident who was guarding the temple, said, \"Last night, some students and local Muslims who are in the Madrasa and Mosque committee were with us for a while. They provided their contact details for help in case we were attacked. Our Muslim brothers who have stood beside us are setting an example for everyone. If everyone can ensure safety like this, such incidents would not happen.\"\n\nRafid Azad, a student of the Dhaka University Department of Law, said they have been in Ramna Kali Temple since Tuesday afternoon to guard it from attacks, while local students are building networks to protect minorities. Posters saying \"You are our brothers, do not fear\" and \"Bangladesh is for all of us\" were found near the Swami Bagh Temple.\n\nMeanwhile, India has publicly expressed its concerns over the state of minorities in the violence-torn Bangladesh after the ouster of Sheikh Hasina. \"What was particularly worrying was that minorities, their businesses and temples also came under attack at multiple locations... There are reports of initiatives by various groups and organisations to ensure their protection and well-being,\" said External Affairs Minister S Jaishankar in an address to Lok Sabha.\n\nHe further said India remains deeply concerned till law and order is visibly restored and that the border guarding forces have also been instructed to be exceptionally alert in view of this complex situation. Several people have called on the intervention of the Indian government in the crisis to protect Hindus and Sikhs there.\n\nSpiritual Guru and founder of Isha Foundation Sadhguru Jaggi Vasudev on Wednesday sought prompt action by India to protect Hindus in the neighbouring country. \"The atrocities being perpetrated against Hindus is not just an internal matter of #Bangladesh. Bharat cannot be Maha-Bharat if we do not stand up and act at the earliest to ensure the safety of minorities in our neighbourhood. What was part of this Nation unfortunately became neighbourhood, but it is our responsibility to protect these people -who actually belong to this Civilization- from these shocking atrocities,\" the spiritual leader said in an X post.\n\nEarlier, Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS) on Tuesday requested the government\" to ensure safety of the Hindus in neighbouring Bangladesh which is in the midst of political turmoil. There have been reports about the minority Hindu community being targeted, said senior RSS leader Bhaiyyaji Joshi. BJP MP and actress Kangana Ranaut said \"no one is safe in Muslim countries, not even Muslims themselves.\"", "source": {"uri": "indiatvnews.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "India TV News"},

Attacks and hostility are being directed specifically towards Hindu homes and places of worship. Following the violent removal of Sheikh Hasina from office, there have been numerous instances of looting, vandalism, and arson of Hindu homes that have come to light. Hindus have been lynched and the unabated violence has engulfed several Hindu Temples in the country.\n\nHindu temples have been targeted in Natore, Dhamrai in Dhaka, Kalapara in Patuakhali, Shariatpur, and Faridpur, as well as houses in Jessore, Noakhali, Meherpur, Chandpur, and Khulna. Dinajpur saw the vandalisation of 40 Hindu shops.\n\nNow, several Hindu women in Bangladesh have come forward to share their tales of horror at the hands of the rampaging Islamist mob.\n\nIn a video shared by Hindu Voice on August 8, several Hindu women living in different areas of the Pirojpur district in Bangladesh can be heard narrating their plight. One Hindu woman victim, who fell prey to the savagery, is heard saying, \"They came with swords and sharp weapons. They took everything. To save our daughters, we give them everything we had.\"\n\nAnother Hindu woman lamented, \"At night, they came. They vandalised our homes and looted everything. We were hiding. They grabbed my brother-in-law's wife and took her to another room. They raped her. Later, we recovered her; her face was tied with clothes. They wanted to cut her throat. To save her, we gave them all the gold ornaments.\"\n\n\"We were sleeping. At night, they came. They were armed. They warned us saying, 'Fifty of us have surrounded your house, there is no way you can escape.' They looted everything. They grabbed me and took me to bed. They threatened me with murder. I pleaded with them to either spare me or kill me. They kept threatening me not to cry. They asked me to give away whatever valuables we had. I gave them all my ornaments, so they left me,\" said another woman.\n\nEarlier, OpIndia spoke to a few Bangladeshi Hindus who told us that the dire situation is only getting worse for Hindus. Speaking to OpIndia, the Hindus in Bangladesh who spoke to OpIndia said that Jamaat-e-Islami members have been making a list of Hindu businesses and Hindu houses since the fall of Sheikh Hasina.\n\nThe Hindus, on the condition of anonymity due to security concerns also said that many are unable to move to safer locations because the Jamaat-e-Islami groups and other Islamists are roaming the streets with guns, making it impossible for them to move to safer locations.\n\nOn 5th August, it came to light that Jihadis attacked Hindus' houses, shops and temples in Bangladesh in the guise of protests against the Sheikh Hasina government. Despite the resignation by Hasina from the Prime Minister's post, the protests continued and so did the attack on Hindus. Minister of External Affairs Dr S Jaishankar has also expressed concerns over attacks on Hindus and other minorities in Bangladesh.\n\nEarlier, OpIndia reported about the list of several attacks released by the Bangladesh Hindu Buddhist Christian Unity Council and attacks reported by The Daily Star, a Bangladeshi newspaper. Several videos and photos of attacks on Hindus surfaced on social media.", "source": {"uri": "opindia.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "OpIndia"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

While the agitation began as a student-led protest against the quota system in the country, the political forces turned it into a mass movement against Hasina's rule which climaxed on Sunday when nearly 100 people were killed. Earlier on Monday, Hasina resigned as the premier and fled the country for her life.\n\nEven student activists part of the protests have flagged that Bangladesh's Hindu minority is under attack.\n\n2 Hindu Councillors Killed\n\nAt least two Hindu councillors have been killed in Bangladesh in the ongoing wave of violence.\n\nIn Rangpur district, Haradhan Roy of the Parshuram Thana Awami League was shot dead on Sunday, according to The Daily Star.\n\nIn the same city, another councillor identified as Kajal Roy was killed on Sunday, according to The New Indian Express.\n\nSeparately, CNN-News 18 reported that Haradhan's nephew was also lynched by the mob.\n\nHindu Temples & Houses Attacked\n\nReligious centres of the Hindu movement ISKCON and temples of goddess Kali were also attacked, according to reports.\n\nYudhistir Govinda Das, ISKCON's India spokesperson, said in a post on X (formerly Twitter) that the centre in was burnt and the deities were destroyed.\n\nThree people at the centre escaped and survived the attack, said Das.\n\nIn Noakhali district, the mobs attacked Hindu houses, according to CNN-News 18.\n\nCiting the footage of the attack, the report said the mob tried to break into the house and attacked the gate of the house of one Hindu person. We are withholding the name of safety concerns.\n\nStudent Protestor Flags Violence Against Hindus\n\nThe condition in Bangladesh is so grave that even a student protest leader who helped topple Hasina has flagged the violence against Hindus.\n\nIn an interview with DW News, student leader Prapti Taposhi said that Hasina's ouster was only a partial success as violence against Hindus continues to take place and the military, which is in charge of the country for now, is not protecting the minority Hindus.\n\nIf the minority Hindus are not protected, then the protestors would have to return to the streets and resume the movement, said Taposhi.\n\nCalling the military \"inept\", Taposhi said the protection of the Hindus is a must.\n\nThe violence picked up pace after anti-Hasina forces in Bangladesh called upon those opposed to her to pick up sticks and take to the streets.\n\nBangladesh has long been infamous for attacks on minority Hindus. In the past many years, waves of violence against Hindus on festivals have occurred often but Hasina and her government appeared to be making efforts to contain the extremists. With Hasina out of the picture now and extremists of the BNP and Jamaat set to take over the country with the backing of the military, there are concerns that the overt violence and systemic persecution of Hindus could massively increase in Bangladesh.\n\nAgencies\n\nComments", "source": {"uri": "indiandefensenews.in", "dataType": "news", "title": "indiandefensenews.in"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hindus", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Hindus"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sheikh_Hasina", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Sheikh Hasina"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Temple", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Temple"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bangladesh", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Bangladesh"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Bangladesh"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Awami_League", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Awami League"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/India", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "India"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jamaat-e-Islami", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Jamaat-e-Islami"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Looting", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Looting"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Riot", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Riot"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Society_for_Krishna_Consciousness", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "International Society for Krishna Consciousness"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Islamism", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Islamism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Upazila", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Upazila"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_New_Indian_Express", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "The New Indian Express"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hindu_temple", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Hindu temple"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bangladesh_Nationalist_Party", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Bangladesh Nationalist Party"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Daily_Star_(Bangladesh)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "The Daily Star (Bangladesh)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kali", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Kali"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lynching", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Lynching"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deity", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Deity"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twitter", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Twitter"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rangpur_District", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Rangpur District"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Rangpur District"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Bangladesh"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DW_News", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "DW News"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Persecution_of_Hindus", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Persecution of Hindus"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Noakhali_District", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Noakhali District"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Noakhali District"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Bangladesh"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Terrorism", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Terrorism", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Warfare_and_Conflict", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Warfare and Conflict", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Territorial_Disputes", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Territorial Disputes", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Religion_and_Spirituality/Hinduism", "label": "dmoz/Society/Religion and Spirituality/Hinduism", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Religion_and_Spirituality/Sikhism", "label": "dmoz/Society/Religion and Spirituality/Sikhism", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 96}], "image": "https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEhKG45-cUUUokiJvuWR72I0wTgYo-3HctM9Z0MUfXDzw_xg9nvdiQZ-wCQ2VDUB1ty6xINidDWtsZwom6vkGr0otKBfsJkUPZ8zFDGopzk7dDTw2NkaZt_RXv1xqggsqg8A1C30kZvppdkBjM6MdWKMrcbxMphknDE6Pqx4H00tI8OZjQwyn1i0DYFWEMA/w1200-h630-p-k-no-nu/Bangladesh_Protest_1.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9792869", "eventUri": "eng-9792869", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "date": "2007-08-", "textStart": 89, "textEnd": 98}], "sentiment": -0.5450980392156863, "wgt": 182, "relevance": 1}

We welcome that\", S Jaishankar said without naming the groups and organisations.\n\nThe Indian Foreign Minister's acknowledgement of protection provided to Temples and Bangladeshi Hindus is important as a section of the Indian Media, as always, is trying to give communal colour to the anti-government protests in Bangladesh.\n\nThe students' organisations, human rights activists, above all Bangladesh Jatiya Hindu Mohajote, an alliance of 23 small and big Hindu religious organizations of Bangladesh, have condemned the communally charged reporting of the mainstream Indian Media.\n\nThe General Secretary of Bangladesh Jatiya Hindu Mohajote in a statement said temples run by those close to Sheikh Hasina's Awami League and Hindu leaders of the erstwhile government came under the attack as was the case with Muslims who were close to the former ruling establishment.\n\nBangladesh Jatiya Hindu Mohajote also said the leaders of Jamaat-e-Islami and Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP) ensured the safety of their homes and Hindu places of worship.\n\nThe houses of some Hindu leaders of the Awami League who were very active as well as those of some Muslim leaders were attacked\", Advocate Gobinda Pramanik, Secretary General of Bangladesh Jatio Hindu Mohajote, said in a video statement.\n\nRuling out communal attacks on Hindus or the Hindu Temples, Human rights activists and lawyers in a statement said the students' protest has not been against Hindus or other minorities.\n\n\"It is the goal of the next generation to build Bangladesh where it is free for all citizens, especially the minority groups. The student leaders leading the movement have called upon their cadre to form small groups to protect Hindu temples\", Mohammed Rakibul Hakim, Human Rights activist, said.\n\nMeanwhile, photos and videos of Muslims students and clerics guarding the Hindu Temples also went viral on various social media platforms.\n\nIn one social media post, a student leader is seen appealing the masses from the mosque loudspeaker to maintain communal harmony and protect Hindu minorities.\n\nIn another post, a student taking to the social media platform X accused the mainstream Indian media of spreading misinformation and fake news.\n\nHe said contrary to what is being reported by the Indian media, Muslims in Bangladesh are actually protecting Hindus and the Hindu places of worship.\n\nNobel laureate Muhammad Yunus - a longtime political foe of ousted Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina - has been named the leader of the interim government.\n\nThe 84-year-old was appointed a day after Sheikh Hasina fled the country following weeks of deadly protests calling for her resignation.\n\nShe is currently residing at the Hindon Air Force base in Uttar Pradesh's Ghaziabad - around 30 km from the Indian capital, New Delhi.

Should I move to India?\"\n\nIn the aftermath of Hasina's dramatic flight from Bangladesh on August 5, the Hindu community was on edge, with sporadic reports of mobs turning on homes and religious places of minorities.\n\n\"Right now, minorities and those who were associated with Awami League are not safe at all,\" said the government employee from Kurigram. The leaders of Hasina's party Awami League have come under attack in several places, the Bangladesh-based newspaper Prothom Alo reported on Tuesday.\n\nThe Kurigram resident said he had few options if the violence escalates. \"I have only one request to the Indian government - they should open the gates in the states which share a boundary with Bangladesh,\" he said. :A huge number of Hindu Bengalis will go to India right now.\"\n\nAnother resident of Chattogram district told Scroll that his ancestral home had come under attack on Monday night.\n\nTapos Kanti Dutta, the 53-year-old resident of Satkania, and his family were away when a mob of 500 people attacked his ancestral home in Govindpur.\n\nHe alleged that the attackers were members of the radical Islamist group, Jamaat-e-Islami. \"They entered the building with sticks, rods, and daos,\" Dutta told Scroll from Chattogram town. \"They have broken the furniture and destroyed our belongings.\"\n\nAround 50-odd women in the neighbourhood fled their homes after the attack. \"They are still hiding,\" he said.\n\nIn a press release issued on Tuesday, the Bangladesh Hindu Bouddha Christian Oikko Parishad listed nearly 100 incidents of vandalism, loot and arson in Hindu temples, and homes and shops owned by Hindus since Monday. \"Several homes and shops have been vandalised,\" said Dipankar Ghosh, a member of the Parishad. \"Even now the situation is dangerous.\"\n\nHowever, there was no independent verification of the claims. \"We are checking the Oikko Parishad list but there do not seem to be any major attacks,\" the Dhaka-based bureau chief of a foreign news agency told Scroll. \"There are some attacks on Hindu properties and homes, torching and vandalism in many places but we still have not heard of anyone being killed.\"\n\nThe largest number of attacks against Hindus have taken place in Dinajpur, Jessore and Chattogram districts, the Parishad's press release said. At least 11 temples, including five in Dinajpur, have come under attack since Monday, the press release said. The Ramakrishna Mission and Iskcon temples in Netrakona district were attacked on Monday, it said.\n\nAccording to Biren Adhikary, a Dhaka-based professional who took part in the 1971 freedom movement, Hindus are being targeted as they are seen as supporters and voters of the Awami League. \"The attackers think that Hindus are also responsible for the misrule of the outgoing Awami League government,\" Adhikary told Scroll over the phone. He said that most Hindu residents are apprehensive about travelling around in Dhaka.\n\nOther members of the Hindu community were cautious about ascribing communal motives to the attacks. \"Common Hindus have not faced any violence, but there have been some attacks on Hindus who are supporters and functionaries of Awami League,\" said Gobinda Chandra Pramanik, general secretary of Bangladesh Jatiya Hindu Mahajote and an advocate based in Dhaka.\n\nHe said that leaders of the Opposition Bangladesh Nationalist Party and the Jamaat-e-Islami have assured Hindu leaders of their safety. \"Since yesterday evening, BNP and Jamaat functionaries have been guarding major Hindu temples due to which none of them have come under attack,\" Pramanik said. \"They do not want to malign this victory by attacking Hindus.\"\n\nSeveral social media posts about purported attacks on Hindus have also proved to be misinformation. On Tuesday, fact-checker Mohammed Zubair debunked a viral video posted on social media by a Hindutva supporter claiming that a Dalit Hindu woman had been gangraped in Bangladesh. However, Zubair found that the video was of an incident from 2021 where a Bangladeshi woman had been raped in Bengaluru.\n\nIn another viral post, many social media users claimed that the home of Bangladeshi cricketer Liton Das had been set on fire. However, media reports from Bangladesh said that the home shown in these posts belonged to former cricketer Mashrafe Mortaza, who is also an MP of Hasina's party Awami League. A number of other claims, including those about a Hindu temple being burnt and a Hindu man being killed have also been debunked.\n\nTesponding to Zubair, R Jaganathan, the editorial director of pro-government publication Swarajya asked the fact checker on X to confirm what had happened \"instead of just trying to suggest that all stories of attacks on Hindu temples are fake\". Jagannathan also posted a link to a media report on arson in a temple in Khulna district in his tweet.\n\nEven before Hasina's fall, the widespread anti-government protests in the country had left the Hindu community divided. \"The younger generation of Hindus wanted accountability, and then Hasina to resign,\" said a resident, who declined to be identified. \"The older generation wanted a negotiated settlement, and then security.\"\n\nHowever, the atmosphere of uncertainty after the fall of Hasina's government has left many rattled. \"Yesterday, after Hasina resigned, everyone was calling each other checking on their safety, and reporting violence [against Hindus], often in ancestral villages,\" this person said.\n\nMany are locking themselves up in their homes in fear. \"Hindus out in the villages perhaps have it the worst, and Hindus in the cities are worried they will become targets,\" this person said.", "source": {"uri": "scroll.in", "dataType": "news", "title":

Despite a new interim government, there seems to be no halt in rampant attacks on Hindus in the country, fuelled global concern.\n\nAlarming visuals have surfaced on social media showing as Hindu temples and houses are under attack in Dhaka, Chittagong, Cumilla, Thakurgaon, Noakhali, Bagerhat, Nazirpur, Firozepur, Sylhet and Madaripur areas of Bangladesh. As many as 800 Hindus in the Thakurgaon district have been forced to flee their homes in fear of their safety as their houses were looted and burnt.\n\nShocking scenes from Bangladesh\n\nMohammad Rakibul Hasan, a local government official in Thakurgaon district, said around 700-800 Hindus tried to flee to India on Wednesday after some of their houses were attacked and looted. \"They returned home after we provided protection,\" he told Reuters. Early on Thursday, about 300 Bangladeshis had assembled at a border point near West Bengal's Jalpaiguri district but dispersed later. The Indian Border Security Force (BSF) has thwarted multiple infiltration attempts along the border.\n\nIn Sylhet, several houses and temples were vandalised by extremist protesters and Hindus there were forced to vacate their properties. Additionally, the Radha Gobind temple in Umedpur village of Shibchar upazila in Madaripur was burnt to the ground, while a bike showroom was also set ablaze in Comilla. \"Several vehicles were vandalised. It was impossible to venture out of our homes,\" one of the Bangladeshi Hindus told India TV.\n\nMore shockingly, a woman, reported to be a Hindu, was seen being kidnapped by a group of people in broad daylight in Noakhali. The woman was later rescued after military intervention. A Hindu goldsmith in the Narsingdi area said two youths demanded protection money of 1 million Bangladesh taka ($8,550) and relented only after they agreed to pay 100,000 taka.\n\nThe attacks have sparked worldwide concerns, including from India, as the situation in Bangladesh echoed similar patterns observed in Pakistan regarding the state of minorities. The Bangladesh Hindu Buddhist Christian Unity Council said that 45 out of 64 districts in the country had seen the targeting of mostly Hindu homes, businesses or temples this week, causing the death of a school teacher.\n\nWhat did Muhammad Yunus say on Hindus?\n\nThe ongoing situation poses a big challenge for the newly-formed interim government. Nobel Peace laureate Muhammad Yunus, who was sworn in as the chief adviser of the caretaker government on Thursday, said the 'anarchic activities' and attacks on minority communities could have been part of a conspiracy. \"As the first call of duty, we will control the conspirators...who have created an anarchic situation and panic to upset our freedom,\" Yunus said in a televised address shortly after taking oath.\n\nHours before the ceremony, Yunus said, \"We heard that the law and order of the area are not being maintained, people are hurting each other, houses and properties are being burned, officers are being attacked, minorities like Hindus, Buddhists, and Christians are facing attacks too. These are all parts of a conspiracy which does not come under our purview. Our responsibility is to protect the country including each and every person as they are our brothers. Hatred and unruliness are the enemies of democracy.\"\n\n\"Our first order of business should be to restore law and order. Until that is taken care of, we will not be able to proceed to further improve the situation. You have shown faith in me and the students here have reassured me to carry out that duty. I request the residents of Bangladesh to believe in me. If you do that, there will be no attacks at any locations in the country,\" he added. Retired Brig Gen M Sakhawat Hossain, the new interior ministry adviser, said the administration was \"very concerned\" about reports of vandalism and attacks on minorities, adding that some were \"slightly exaggerated\".\n\nIndia's concerns over Bangladeshi Hindus\n\nPrime Minister Narendra Modi on Thursday extended best wishes to Yunus saying India was hoping for an \"early return to normalcy\" in Bangladesh that would also ensure the safety and protection of all Hindus and other minority communities. \" We hope for an early return to normalcy, ensuring the safety and protection of Hindus and all other minority communities,\" he said on X.\n\nThe Ministry of External Affairs said India hoped for the early restoration of law and order in Bangladesh and said the country's interests are foremost for the Indian government. \"We also want to make it clear that it is the responsibility of every government to ensure the well-being of all its citizens. We hope for an early restoration of law and order in Bangladesh. This is both in the interest of the country and for the larger region as a whole,\" said MEA spokesperson Randhir Jaiswal.\n\nWhile the atrocities against Hindus have been reported, there also has been some welcoming reports of students and local people taking it upon themselves to protect Hindu temples and homes. In several places, Muslims stood side by side with their Hindu neighbours stood guard over temples. Student leaders have formed volunteer groups to help guard other sites, as per the Guardian.", "source": {"uri": "indiatvnews.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "India TV News"}, "authors": [{"uri":

The quota demonstration has gotten so violent that the large-scale demonstrators are now pursuing minorities and attacking them.\n\nIt is obvious that Islamists are targeting Hindus in order to capitalize on the bloodshed now occurring in the nation. Extreme violence and anarchy are reported to have been caused by Islamist crowds destroying Hindu homes, setting them on fire, and kidnapping women. These reports come from various parts of the nation.\n\nVideos and eyewitness accounts from the impacted communities depict horrifying images of women being abducted and Hindu homes being plundered and set on fire. The attackers are inciting fear and anguish among the Hindu populace by acting with little regard for the law or for people's safety.\n\nThe Hindu population now lives in daily terror due to the situation's escalation, and the attackers have been emboldened by the government's lack of a robust response. Human rights organizations from around the world have denounced the violence and demanded that the Hindu minority be immediately protected. But because the Bangladeshi government has been dragging its feet, the situation has gotten worse.\n\nApproximately 100 people were killed in violent riots on August 4, one of whom was a Hindu council member. Several Hindus were forced to seek shelter as a result of the deliberate targeting of Hindu residences and temples, including those owned by ISKCON and the Kali temple.\n\nAn unrestricted curfew has been implemented in reaction to the ongoing violence. 101 people have died as a result of the escalating violence between supporters of Sheikh Hasina and demonstrators calling for her removal. The violence, particularly between opponents and activists from the Awami League, Chhatra League, and Jubo League, has continued, prompting the government to impose a statewide curfew and cut off internet access.", "source": {"uri": "ptcnews.tv", "dataType": "news", "title": "PTC News"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hindus", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Hindus"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Islamism", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Islamism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sheikh_Hasina", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Sheikh Hasina"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Hindu", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "The Hindu"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kidnapping", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Kidnapping"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_rights", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Human rights"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Awami_League", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Awami League"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jubo_League", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Jubo League"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Government_of_Bangladesh", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Government of Bangladesh"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kali", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Kali"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Curfew", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Curfew"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Riot", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Riot"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Society_for_Krishna_Consciousness", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "International Society for Krishna Consciousness"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Temple", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Temple"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Terrorism", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Terrorism", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Warfare_and_Conflict", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Warfare and Conflict", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Violence_and_Abuse", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Violence and Abuse", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Theft", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Theft", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 52}], "image": "https://media.ptcnews.tv/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/a92526079f363285b0a8399ea8112955_1280X720.webp", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9792869", "eventUri": "eng-9792869", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-08-04", "textStart": 1364, "textEnd": 1372}], "sentiment": -0.5450980392156863, "wgt": 178, "relevance": 1}

The failure of Congress and the administration to acknowledge and condemn the violence against Hindus and other religious minorities is unacceptable. Two prominent Indian-American lawmakers have called for an immediate end to the ongoing brutal violence against the minority Hindu community in Bangladesh following the ouster of the Sheikh Hasina-led government. The Congressmen have also urged the prime minister-designate of the interim government, Nobel laureate Muhammad Yunus, to uphold the rule of law as he takes over the reins of the interim government.\n\nThe remarks by two influential Congressmen come a day after scores of Hindu American groups met State Department officials amidst the spike in crime against the minority Hindu community and the destruction of Hindu temples in Bangladesh.\n\nThey also said the failure of Congress and the administration to acknowledge and condemn the violence against Hindus and other religious minorities is unacceptable.\n\nSeveral Hindu temples, households and businesses have been vandalised and at least two Hindu leaders affiliated with Hasina's Awami League party were killed in the violence since Monday when Hasina resigned and fled to India.\n\n\"Bangladeshi students had just human rights concerns against PM Hasina. It's good she is gone. But the violence now targeting Hindus is wrong. PM Yunus must uphold the rule of law & prevent the targeting of temples or people of any political party or faith from violence,\" Ro Khanna, Congressman said in a post on X on Thursday.\n\nCongressman Raja Krishnamoorthi said, \"As Bangladesh prepares to swear in its interim government, I urge all government officials, the new administration and police chief, and the people of Bangladesh to do all they can to end the violence that has emerged across the country, including the brutal targeting of the country's Hindu minority, their homes, businesses, and their temples.\"\n\n\"The violence must stop and those responsible must be brought to justice to help the people of Bangladesh move forward as a nation. I will continue to closely monitor developments in Bangladesh in coordination with the US State Department,\" Krishnamoorthi said in a statement on Wednesday.\n\nOn Wednesday, Hindu American Foundation director of Policy Research Anita Joshi, Utsav Chakrabarti of HinduAction, Human Rights Collective for Bangladesh Minorities Executive Director Priya Saha, and geopolitical analyst Jay Kansara met with the US Ambassador for International Religious Freedom (IRF) Rashad Hussein at the US State Department in Washington, DC.\n\nUrging US government action, the group briefed Hussein on the violence directed at Hindus and other religious minorities throughout Bangladesh, sharing documented incidents against Hindus and Hindu temples over 48 hours after Hasina left the country amidst civil unrest.\n\n\"The failure of Congress and this administration to acknowledge and condemn the violence against Hindus and other religious minorities is unacceptable,\" Joshi said.\n\n\"The situation on the ground in Bangladesh is urgent and dire. We implore the State Department to use its clout and resources to put an end to this rampant violence against religious minorities, violence rooted in decades of mistrust and maltreatment of Bangladesh's Hindu minority,\" she said.\n\nIn a separate statement, the Foundation for India and Indian Diaspora Studies (FIIDS) urged the US President, State Department, IRF Ambassador, and presidential candidates to take immediate action to ensure peace is re-established in Bangladesh and that \"minorities are protected, preventing another potential Hindu Genocide.\"\n\nFIIDS also urged the United Nations to deploy observers and peacekeeping forces to contain the situation on the ground in Bangladesh and ensure the protection of vulnerable communities.\n\nIt made similar appeals to Prime Minister Narendra Modi, Defence Minister Rajnath Singh, and External Affairs Minister S Jaishankar.\n\nSince Hasina fled the country on Monday, media reports from Bangladesh have flagged more and more cases of violence against minorities, including the massive vandalism and destruction at popular folk band Joler Gaan's frontman Rahul Ananda's residence on Monday prompting the singer and his family to go into hiding.\n\nHowever, it is not just Hindus that are targeted. At least 232 people were killed in Bangladesh in the incidents of violence that erupted across the country following the fall of the Hasina government on Monday, taking the death toll to 560 since the anti-quota protests first started in mid-July.\n\nMeanwhile, soon after he arrived in Dhaka from Paris, Yunus on Thursday promised to deliver a government which assures safety to its citizens. He is to take oath later in the evening.\n\nEarlier on Tuesday, the US expressed deep concern about the continued violence in Bangladesh including attacks on members of religious or political groups, and said it will be vital for the new government to credibly investigate all such instances and provide justice to victims.\n\n\"We are deeply concerned about continued reports of violence in Bangladesh - including violence directed at members of religious or political groups. We are equally concerned about reports of violence against police and law enforcement,\" a State Department spokesperson told PTI on Tuesday.

Minister of External Affairs Dr S Jaishankar has also expressed concerns over attacks on Hindus and other minorities in Bangladesh.

It's good she is gone. But the violence now targeting Hindus is wrong. PM Yunus must uphold the rule of law & prevent the targeting of temples or people of any political party or faith from violence,\" Ro Khanna, Congressman said in a post on X on Thursday.\n\nCongressman Raja Krishnamoorthi said, \"As Bangladesh prepares to swear in its interim government, I urge all government officials, the new administration and police chief, and the people of Bangladesh to do all they can to end the violence that has emerged across the country, including the brutal targeting of the country's Hindu minority, their homes, businesses, and their temples.\" \"The violence must stop and those responsible must be brought to justice to help the people of Bangladesh move forward as a nation. I will continue to closely monitor developments in Bangladesh in coordination with the US State Department,\" Krishnamoorthi said in a statement on Wednesday.\n\nOn Wednesday, Hindu American Foundation director of Policy Research Anita Joshi, Utsav Chakrabarti of HinduAction, Human Rights Collective for Bangladesh Minorities Executive Director Priya Saha, and geopolitical analyst Jay Kansara met with the US Ambassador for International Religious Freedom (IRF) Rashad Hussein at the US State Department in Washington, DC.\n\nUrging US government action, the group briefed Hussein on the violence directed at Hindus and other religious minorities throughout Bangladesh, sharing documented incidents against Hindus and Hindu temples over 48 hours after Hasina left the country amidst civil unrest.\n\n\"The failure of Congress and this administration to acknowledge and condemn the violence against Hindus and other religious minorities is unacceptable,\" Joshi said.\n\n\"The situation on the ground in Bangladesh is urgent and dire. We implore the State Department to use its clout and resources to put an end to this rampant violence against religious minorities, violence rooted in decades of mistrust and maltreatment of Bangladesh's Hindu minority,\" she said.\n\nIn a separate statement, the Foundation for India and Indian Diaspora Studies (FIIDS) urged the US President, State Department, IRF Ambassador, and presidential candidates to take immediate action to ensure peace is re-established in Bangladesh and that \"minorities are protected, preventing another potential Hindu Genocide.\" FIIDS also urged the United Nations to deploy observers and peacekeeping forces to contain the situation on the ground in Bangladesh and ensure the protection of vulnerable communities.\n\nIt made similar appeals to Prime Minister Narendra Modi, Defence Minister Rajnath Singh, and External Affairs Minister S Jaishankar.\n\nSince Hasina fled the country on Monday, media reports from Bangladesh have flagged more and more cases of violence against minorities, including the massive vandalism and destruction at popular folk band Joler Gaan's frontman Rahul Ananda's residence on Monday prompting the singer and his family to go into hiding.\n\nHowever, it is not just Hindus that are targeted. At least 232 people were killed in Bangladesh in the incidents of violence that erupted across the country following the fall of the Hasina government on Monday, taking the death toll to 560 since the anti-quota protests first started in mid-July.\n\nMeanwhile, soon after he arrived in Dhaka from Paris, Yunus on Thursday promised to deliver a government which assures safety to its citizens. He is to take oath later in the evening.\n\nEarlier on Tuesday, the US expressed deep concern about the continued violence in Bangladesh including attacks on members of religious or political groups, and said it will be vital for the new government to credibly investigate all such instances and provide justice to victims.\n\n\"We are deeply concerned about continued reports of violence in Bangladesh - including violence directed at members of religious or political groups.

It's good she is gone. But the violence now targeting Hindus is wrong. PM Yunus must uphold the rule of law & prevent the targeting of temples or people from any political party or faith,\" Ro Khanna, a Congressman, said in a post on X on Thursday.\n\nCongressman Raja Krishnamoorthi urged all officials and citizens to work toward ending the violence, particularly against the Hindu minority. \"The violence must stop, and those responsible must be brought to justice to help Bangladesh move forward as a nation,\" Krishnamoorthi stated on Wednesday.\n\nOn Wednesday, Hindu American Foundation representatives, including Anita Joshi, met with the US Ambassador for International Religious Freedom, Rashad Hussein, to discuss the violence targeting Hindus in Bangladesh.\n\nUrging US government action, the group shared documented incidents of violence against Hindus and Hindu temples that occurred within 48 hours of Hasina's departure amidst civil unrest.\n\n\"The situation on the ground in Bangladesh is urgent and dire. We implore the State Department to put an end to this rampant violence against religious minorities,\" Joshi said.\n\nThe Foundation for India and Indian Diaspora Studies (FIIDS) also called for immediate action from the US government and United Nations to ensure peace and protect minorities, preventing another potential Hindu Genocide.\n\nSimilar appeals were made to India's Prime Minister Narendra Modi and other top officials.\n\nFollowing Hasina's departure, media reports have flagged increasing cases of violence against minorities, including the vandalism at popular musician Rahul Ananda's residence, forcing him and his family into hiding.\n\nIt is important to note that the violence has not only targeted Hindus. At least 232 people have been killed since the unrest began on Monday, with the death toll reaching 560 since anti-quota protests started in mid-July.\n\nArriving in Dhaka from Paris, Yunus promised a government that assures safety for all citizens.\n\nThe US has expressed deep concern about the continued violence and emphasized the need for credible investigations and justice for victims.",

Up to 40 people have been injured though not seriously, its general secretary, Rana Dasgupta, told Reuters.\n\n\"The communal atrocities erupted hours before she resigned,\" he said. \"Although there is no killing, there is injury. Houses and businesses of minorities, especially Hindus, as well as temples, have been targeted, looted, damaged.\"\n\nDasgupta said some people he could not identify had thrown a brick at his car when he was out on the road on Monday in the southeastern district of Chattogram.\n\n\"I stand against communal atrocities and will not stop,\" he said. \"Until my death, I shall fight for them.

Numerous Hindu temples, homes, and other places that belonged to the Hindu community have been targeted for destruction. Countless Hindus have been victimized by the rampaging Islamists so far. Amid the turmoil, a video depicting Islamists breaking new benchmarks for savagery and hatred towards Hindus has gone viral.\n\nIn the video, Islamists can be seen encircling a dead victim lying on the ground. There's a pool of blood beneath the deceased man's broken head, and his hands are bound in handcuffs. Many men are gathered around him. With the aid of a stick, one man, whose face cannot be seen in the video, strips the deceased person naked and checks the victim's private part for circumcision. Shouting 'Hindu, Hindu' over the corpse, the crowd hovering over the dead body laughs, realizing that the man is a Hindu because he is not circumcised.\n\nNotably, the video in question is being taken down from all social media platforms, therefore we are not sharing it here.\n\nIn Bangladesh, political turmoil ensued over reservations for government jobs. The Islamists seized the opportunity to launch an unbridled attack on the minority Hindus in the country.\n\nOn 5th August, it came to light that Jihadis attacked Hindus' houses, shops and temples in Bangladesh in the guise of protests against the Sheikh Hasina government. Despite the resignation by Hasina from the Prime Minister's post, the protests continued and so did the attack on Hindus. Minister of External Affairs Dr S Jaishankar has also expressed concerns over attacks on Hindus and other minorities in Bangladesh. Earlier, OpIndia reported about the list of 54 attacks released by the Bangladesh Hindu Buddhist Christian Unity Council and attacks reported by The Daily Star, a Bangladeshi newspaper. Several videos and photos of attacks on Hindus surfaced on social media.\n\nAs the day passed by, more details of the attacks with photos and videos surfaced.

However, the opposition bloc, expected to come into power, includes a hardlined Islamic party.\n\nThe BHBCUC claimed that around 200-300 Hindu homes and businesses have been vandalised since Monday, when Hasina fled to neighbouring India after resigning. Around 15-20 Hindu temples across Bangladesh have been damaged, and 40 people from the community have been injured, BHBCUC general secretary Rana Dasgupta told Reuters.\n\n\"The communal atrocities erupted hours before she resigned,\" he said. \"Although there is no killing, there is injury. Houses and businesses of minorities, especially Hindus, as well as temples, have been targeted, looted, damaged.\"\n\nThe minority group chief also said that some unidentified men threw a brick at his car when he was out on Monday, in an act of communal violence.\n\n\"I stand against communal atrocities and will not stop,\" he said. \"Until my death, I shall fight for them. I may not be able to physically protect them, but I can give them courage. I may not be able to resist attacks, but I can protest.\"\n\nManindra Kumar Nath, a Hindu community leader, described the situation in Bangladesh as \"horrific\". He said, \"Even today, we are getting calls from people asking us to save their lives, but we are not receiving any support from anywhere.\"\n\nStudents who led the protests against Hasina that killed nearly 300 people since July, have repeatedly urged people not to target minority communities in the overwhelmingly Muslim country. But Hindu community leaders said they were feeling vulnerable because of the lack of a functioning government.\n\nFormer Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina fled Bangladesh on Monday and landed at the Hindon Air Base in neighbouring India.

Today only a few houses are left. This time even these houses will not be saved.\n\nIn Dupchachiya, Adomdighi, the houses of Hindu families have been attacked since the night before yesterday.\n\nDr Subrata Ghosh of Satkhira, who saved his life by running away from his house during the attack, said, \"I am not able to go home because the rioters can reach anytime. The situation in our area is such that to save their business or house, people are themselves setting it on fire and circulating the video so that the rioters do not reach their house.

Let us not let this slip away because of our mistakes. I fervently appeal to everybody to stay calm. Please refrain from all kinds of violence. I appeal to all students, members of all political parties and non-political people to stay calm. This is our beautiful country with lots of exciting possibilities.\"\n\nHe added: \"Violence is our enemy. Please don't create more enemies. Be calm and get ready to build the country.\"\n\nYunus, widely seen as a stabilising figure, is in France but plans to travel back to Bangladesh on Thursday.\n\nViolence against Hindus appears to have started just hours after Hasina resigned and fled the capital, Dhaka, on Monday.\n\nImages of Hindus being lynched by mobs, temples set on fire, and businesses looted have flooded social media in India, although the full scale of the attacks is unclear.\n\nThere are more than 13 million Hindus in Bangladesh - almost 8% of the predominantly Muslim population - and many are traditionally supporters of Hasina's party, the Awami League.\n\nThe Awami League, which has close ties with India, is secular. Its rival, the Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP) and the hardline Islamist Jamaat e Islami, backed the protests.\n\nHasina remains in India where she sought refuge. In the vacuum left by her hasty exit, groups opposed to Hasina's rule have targeted the Awami League's followers, which include Hindus and Muslims.\n\nTarique Rahman, son of BNP leader Khaleda Zia and acting chair of the party, appealed to Bangladeshis to keep everyone safe.\n\n\"It is our duty to protect all Bangladeshis, irrespective of religion and politics, from discriminatory violence, and not to harass any particular community, create division, or seek vengeance,\" he said in a post on X.\n\nIn the old quarter of Dhaka, Muslims stood side by side with their Hindu neighbours to protect a Hindu temple from a violent mob. Student leaders have formed volunteer groups to help guard other sites.\n\nRelated: Why has Bangladesh's prime minister Sheikh Hasina resigned and fled?\n\nBut alarm is growing in west Bengal, which is the closest Indian state to Bangladesh and shares a 2,200 km-long border. An Indian parliamentarian who belongs to the ruling Bharatiya Janata party said India should prepare to see an influx of Hindu refugees.\n\n\"If this situation doesn't come under control, mentally be prepared to give refuge to 10 million Hindu refugees. If the situation is not controlled there, Jamaat and radicals will take control,\" Suvendu Adhikari told reporters.\n\nIndia's minister for external affairs, Subrahmanyam Jaishankar, told MPs yesterday he was \"deeply concerned\" over the safety of the Hindu minority.\n\nSome right-wing Hindu religious leaders in India have already become vocal, calling for the country to act.\n\nSelf-appointed spiritual leader Sadhguru Jaggi Vasudev said anti-Hindu violence in Bangladesh was not merely an internal matter and that India should \"stand up and act\"to protect Hindus.\n\nIn a post on X, Vasudev said, \"It is our responsibility to protect these people - who actually belong to this civilization - from these shocking atrocities.\"\n\nFormer diplomat Neelam Deo told the Guardian that any possible influx of Hindus into India depended on how widespread the violence became and how close the affected areas were to the border with India.\n\nShe said that, if news reports were true that violence had broken out in 27 of Bangladesh's 64 districts, the violence was already widespread.\n\n\"The army will have to take action and show that attackers will not get any impunity. But it's also important for people in Bangladesh to stop demonising the Awami League. If that continues, then both its Muslim leaders are vulnerable and so, of course, are its Hindu supporters,\" Deo said.\n\nLocal media in India has reported that the country had brought 190 non-essential staff at its high commission in Dhaka home on a special flight. Indian diplomats and other staff, though, remain in the country, in Dhaka and in Indian consulates in four other cities.\n\nIndia is watching the upheaval in Bangladesh, with which it has had very close relations under Hasina, very carefully. The two countries have maintained close security, trade, investments and defence cooperation.\n\nNew Delhi fears that an unstable neighbour, in which the Jamaat-e-Islami might have a greater role, will allow rivals China and Pakistan more influence in its affairs.", "source": {"uri": "ca.news.yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hindus", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Hindus"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Provisional_government", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Provisional government"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hindu_temple", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Hindu temple"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muhammad_Yunus", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Muhammad Yunus"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sheikh_Hasina", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Sheikh Hasina"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dhaka", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Dhaka"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Dhaka"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Bangladesh"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/India", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "India"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bangladesh", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Bangladesh"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Bangladesh"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Awami_League", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Awami League"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muslims", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Muslims"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prime_minister", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Prime minister"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bangladesh_Nationalist_Party", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Bangladesh Nationalist Party"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bangladesh_Liberation_War", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Bangladesh Liberation War"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nobel_Prize_in_Literature", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Nobel Prize in Literature"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Political_party", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Political party"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/London", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "London"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "London"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Delhi", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "New Delhi"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "New Delhi"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jamaat-e-Islami", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Jamaat-e-Islami"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tarique_Rahman", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Tarique Rahman"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Khaleda_Zia", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Khaleda Zia"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lynching", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Lynching"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secularism", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Secularism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Islamism", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Islamism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Religion", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Religion"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Refugee", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Refugee"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_media", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Social media"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/France", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "France"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sadhguru", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Sadhguru"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/S._Jaishankar", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "S.

Islamist extremists are unleashing violence in Bangladesh, exploiting the political vacuum. The world must wake up before it's too late\n\nToday, Bangladesh faces a critical juncture as Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina has resigned amidst escalating unrest, with an interim government now set to take charge under the military's supervision. This comes as the country is engulfed in violence, with Hindus and other minority communities bearing the brunt of what is rapidly becoming a genocide of unimaginable proportions. As the world watches Bangladesh in horror, a systematic campaign of terror is being fuelled by Islamist extremists targeting Hindu homes, businesses, temples, and lives.\n\nThe unrest that began in June over a government job quota system has spiralled out of control. Initially seen as a movement for fairness, the protests quickly devolved into a pretext for Islamist factions, including Jamaat-e-Islami, Hefazat-e-Islam, and Jamaat Shibir, to launch brutal attacks against Hindus and other minority communities.\n\nThe violence has been widespread and systematic: in Moulvibazar, the Notun Kali Temple was desecrated, and Hindu homes were set ablaze, displacing many families. In Chittagong's Hajari Goli, the Sri Krishna Temple was attacked, and mobs attempted to break into Hindu homes, specifically targeting families with young girls. These are not isolated incidents but part of a coordinated effort to annihilate Hindus in Bangladesh.\n\nStrikingly, the violence against Hindus in Bangladesh bears the hallmark of genocide under international law. Genocide is defined as acts committed with the intent to destroy, in whole or in part, a national, ethnic, racial, or religious group. The targeted killings, such as the murder of Hindu police constable Suman Kumar and the lynching of Hindu Awami League leader Haradhan Roy and his nephew, are clear indicators of a calculated effort to eliminate this minority group.\n\nFurthermore, systematic attacks on religious sites, including ISKCON and Kali temples, and the destruction of Hindu homes and businesses point to an organised campaign with genocidal intent. This is not random violence; the sheer number of incidents reflects a deliberate and coordinated effort to eradicate Hindus from Bangladesh.\n\nIt is pertinent that the international community recognise these signs and act before it is too late. For those closely monitoring events in Bangladesh, the rapid spread of violence against Hindus following the military takeover comes as no surprise. The Bangladesh Army Chief held meetings with Jamaat-e-Islami and Hefazat-e-Islam leaders, yet there's not a word on the organised targeting of Hindus. The message is unequivocally clear: Hindus in Bangladesh are now under siege.\n\nIn Feni Bash, the Parsta Hindu Temple was attacked, while riots have engulfed Hindu areas nationwide. In the last two days, Islamists murdered two Hindus in Rangpur town, and three more were killed by Jamaat Shibir protesters. Entire families have been wiped out, leaving survivors in fear and despair as Hindu temples, homes, and businesses are systematically destroyed. The international community cannot remain passive while an entire population is being targeted for destruction.\n\nMoreover, Pakistan and China's involvement in this crisis adds a dangerous dimension to the violence. Both nations have a vested interest in destabilising Bangladesh, and by backing Islamist factions like Jamaat-e-Islami, Hefazat-e-Islam, and Jamaat Shibir, they are advancing their geopolitical agendas while exacerbating the humanitarian crisis. Pakistan, notorious for supporting Islamist extremism and terrorism, has reportedly provided financial and logistical support to these extremist groups. China, leveraging its influence in the region, has further destabilised the situation, turning a blind eye to the atrocities committed against the Hindu population.\n\nThis geopolitical strategy has made the situation far more complex, demanding urgent global attention. The violence in Bangladesh is not merely an internal issue; it is part of a broader strategy that threatens the lives of millions of innocent people. The international community must scrutinise the involvement of these two nations and investigate their role in this unfolding tragedy.\n\nThe global community, including the United Nations, human rights organisations, and nations that believe in democracy - especially India, the regional superpower - must take immediate action to prevent further atrocities. Diplomatic pressure should be applied to ensure the protection of Bangladeshi citizens, and an independent investigation into the crimes against Hindus must be initiated.\n\nThe world has witnessed too many genocides; we cannot afford to let history repeat itself. Immediate action is needed to halt the bloodshed and ensure justice for the victims of these heinous crimes. The time to act is now, before the situation escalates further and another dark chapter is written in the history of human rights violations.", "source": {"uri": "news18.com", "dataType": "news",

Homes, shops and temples of Hindus have become easy targets for Islamic fundamentalists. An interim government is yet to be formed with Nobel Laureate economist Prof Mohammed Yunus expected to arrive in Dhaka from Dubai on Thursday afternoon. Parliament has been dissolved by the President and former PM Begum Khaleda Zia and 245 leaders of her party have been released from jail. In a major reshuffle, one Major General in the army was sacked and six others were transferred, while new heads were appointed for other paramilitary outfits. Anti-social elements are on a looting and arson spree, targeting Awami League politicians and their homes.\n\nTwo Hindu councillors have been killed, four temples have been set on fire and homes and shops of Hindus in 39 districts have been looted and vandalized. The Indian government has expressed concern over the atrocities on Hindus in Bangladesh. The largest organisation of minorities in Bangladesh, Hindu Bouddha Christian Oikya Parishad has alleged that incidents of looting and arson in the homes and temples of Hindus are still continuing. The Indian government is worried about safe passage for several thousand Indian citizens stuck in Bangladesh and also for the security of Hindus living in the neighbouring country. Looting, arson and killing of Hindus have been reported from several places in Dhaka, and other cities like Chattogram, Narsinghdi, Meherpur, Khulna, Rajshahi, Barisal and Sylhet. Rioters are going around identifying Hindu homes and shops and setting them on fire after looting. In several cities, Hindu temples were attacked, idols smashed and gold ornaments of idols were looted. Islamic fundamentalist party Jamaat-e-Islami and its students' wing Islamic Chhatra Shibir are targeting Hindus, while police and security personnel have become mute spectators.\n\nSumohan Das, director of ISKCON temple in Dhaka, said that he has received reports of attacks on several temples in the districts. In Narsinghdi, a Kali temple was attacked by rioters in the presence of police, while in Chattogram city, rioters went around Hazari Goli locality vandalizing homes and shops of Hindus. One Kali temple was set on fire. Hindus, numbering nearly 1.3 crore, account for nearly 8 per cent of the total population in Bangladesh. In 1951 after Partition, Hindus accounted for 22 pc of the population in East Pakistan. Over 1.1 crore Hindus fled Bangladesh due to religious persecution between 1964 and 2013, according to Hindu American Foundation. Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh leader Bhaiyyaji Joshi has appealed to the Centre to take immediate steps to ensure safety of Hindus in Bangladesh. Yoga guru Swami Ramdev has asked Indians to remain on vigil because of the deteriorating situation in Bangladesh. He said, law and order has completely collapsed in Bangladesh and all Indians should stand united in solidarity with the Hindu minorities in the neighbouring country. Bageshwar Dham preacher Dhirendra Shastri has appealed to the Centre to open its border to allow safe passage to persecuted Hindus to enter India from Bangladesh.\n\nLeader of Opposition in West Bengal Suvendu Adhikari said it has now become clear that the introduction of the Citizenship Amendment Act by Modi government was a step in the right direction for giving citizenship to Hindus who may want to leave Bangladesh because of persecution. There is no doubt that Islamic fundamentalists, particularly Jamaat-e-Islami, are persecuting Hindus in Bangladesh and their supporters are on a spree of loot, arson and murders. Videos of such attacks are really disturbing. The problem now is, Hindus in Bangladesh cannot come out in large numbers to enter India, as rioters are openly moving around in the streets, with no sign of police. Indian politicians who were opposing CAA are now silent. The Centre is in touch with senior army officers of Bangladesh and through diplomatic channels to ensure the safety of Hindus. Since there is no government worth the name in Bangladesh at the moment, rioters are on a maddening spree of loot and arson. Army officials in Bangladesh are trying to ensure rule of law in the country, but at the same time, they have to listen to the demands of Jamaat leaders, who have now gained an upper hand after Sheikh Hasina's sudden departure.", "source": {"uri": "indiatvnews.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "India TV News"}, "authors": [{"uri": "nivedita_dash@indiatvnews.com", "name": "Nivedita Dash", "type":

The Bangladesh Hindu Buddhist Christian Unity Council (BHBCUC) reported that between Monday and Tuesday, a large number of Hindu homes and businesses were vandalised, and numerous temples were damaged.Although no deaths have been reported, the attacks have resulted in dozens of injuries.\n\nRana Dasgupta, the general secretary of BHBCUC, told news agency Reuters that the attacks commenced shortly before Hasina's resignation announcement. \"Although there is no killing, there is injury. Houses and businesses of minorities, especially Hindus, as well as temples, have been targeted, looted, damaged,\" he said. Dasgupta himself fell victim to the unrest when his vehicle was attacked with a brick in Chattogram. Despite the risks, he remains determined to oppose communal violence, declaring, \"I stand against communal atrocities and will not stop. I may not be able to physically protect them, but I can give them courage. I may not be able to resist attacks, but I can protest.\"\n\nThe resignation of Sheikh Hasina comes after weeks of intense student-led protests that have resulted in nearly 300 deaths since July. Hasina fled to India and is expected to seek asylum in the United Kingdom. Her departure has left Bangladesh in a precarious state, with many Hindus feeling increasingly vulnerable amid the lack of a stable government. Manindra Kumar Nath, another Hindu community leader, described the situation as \"horrific,\" citing numerous calls from community members desperate for help as attacks continue unchecked.\n\nTo restore order, Bangladesh's military has been deployed nationwide. Hindus, who constitute approximately 8% of Bangladesh's 170 million population, have traditionally supported Hasina's secular Awami League party.\n\nIskcon, Kali temple vandalised\n\nOn Sunday, local reports suggest that Hindu houses and temples, including Iskconand Kali temples, were specifically targeted, forcing devotees to seek shelter. Kajal Roy, a Hindu councillor from Rangpur, was among the 100 people who lost their lives during the riots.\n\nTargetting of minorities worrying: EAM Jaishankar\n\nExternal affairs minister S Jaishankar on Tuesday told Rajya Sabha that the Indian government is in constant talks with the Bangladesh interim government. He also added that during the protests on Monday, several minorities were targeted in Dhaka.\n\n\"On 4th August, events took a very serious turn. Attacks on police, including police stations and government installations, intensified even as overall levels of violence greatly escalated. Properties of individuals associated with the regime were torched across the country. What was particularly worrying was that minorities, their businesses and temples also came under attack at multiple locations. The full extent of this is still not clear,\" Jaishankar said.\n\nAt TOI World Desk, our dedicated team of seasoned journalists and passionate writers tirelessly sifts through the vast tapestry of global events to bring you the latest news and diverse perspectives round the clock.

Up to 40 people have been injured though not seriously, its general secretary, Rana Dasgupta, told Reuters.\n\n\"The communal atrocities erupted hours before she resigned,\" he said. \"Although there is no killing, there is injury.

I may not be able to physically protect them, but I can give them courage.

Although the leaders of the uprising that overthrew the Awami League government have urged people not to attack the Hindu minority, concerns have been raised about their safety. Thankfully, several voices have emerged in support of Hindus and some temples are being protected by Muslims and Hindus together.\n\nHindus make up about 8 per cent of Bangladesh's 17 crore population, and a significant portion of this community has historically supported Sheikh Hasina's Awami League. This is because of Sheikh Hasina's close ties with India and Awami League's positioning as a predominantly secular force compared to the opposition which consists of extremist groups.\n\nWith the government ousted and the new administration yet to assume power, mobs are causing chaos, targeting police stations, prisons, Awami League leaders' residences and Hindu establishments.\n\nTarique Rahman, BNP leader and son of former PM Khaleda Zia, is one of the main figures who have called for peace.\n\n\"I urge the people of Bangladesh to show restraint and calm during this period of transition on our democratic journey. It is our responsibility to protect all Bangladeshis, regardless of religion and politics, from discriminatory violence, and not to discriminate against any particular community, create divisions, or seek revenge. Muslims, Hindus, Christians, Buddhists, believers, atheists - no one will be neglected or discriminated against in our democratic journey; together, we are all proud Bangladeshis,\" he stated in a post on X.\n\nResidences Raided, Plundered\n\nThe Bangladesh Hindu Buddhist Christian Unity Council informed Reuters that 200-300 homes, mostly belonging to Hindus, and businesses had been targeted since Monday. Around 15-20 Hindu temples had been desecrated and 40 people were injured, although not severely, the organization's general secretary Rana Dasgupta stated.\n\n\"The communal violence erupted hours before she stepped down. While there have been no fatalities, there have been injuries. Homes and businesses of minorities, particularly Hindus, as well as temples, have been attacked, looted, vandalized,\" he remarked.\n\nAvirup Sarkar, a development professional based in Dhaka, recounted to BBC that his relative resides in Netrokona, about 100 km from Dhaka. Shortly after Sheikh Hasina fled the country, she phoned Mr. Sarkar. \"She sounded terrified. She mentioned that the house had been attacked and ransacked by a mob,\" he shared with BBC. Mr. Sarkar's relative disclosed that 100 individuals armed with sticks had invaded the house, destroyed furniture, TV, bathroom fixtures and doors. They also took cash and jewelry. They did not harm anyone in the house.\n\n\"You people are descendants of Awami League. This country is in a bad state because of you. You should leave the country,\" the mob yelled at the residents, according to the BBC report.\n\nReporters, Artists Targeted\n\nPradip Kumar Bhowmik, a journalist with Daily Khoborpatra, passed away after being attacked during a mob assault on Rayganj Press Club in Sirajganj, as reported by local media. Three other journalists sustained injuries. A total of 25 journalists were injured in various assault incidents across the country, The Daily Star reported. Many of them are Muslims.\n\nIn Dhanmondi, a violent mob targeted Bangladeshi singer Rahul Ananda's ancestral house and set fire to his musical instruments and furniture. His family members managed to escape the attack. Folk band Joler Gaan, for which Rahul Ananda sings, shared a video of their final recording in the now charred room, and questioned the \"flames of anger and retribution\".\n\nMuslims Join Hindus In Protecting Temples\n\nAmid reports of minorities and temples being attacked, Dhaka Tribune sent a correspondent to three temples and discovered Hindus and Muslims guarding the places of worship. At Dhakeshwari National Temple, local resident Raj Ghosh mentioned, \"Both Muslim and Hindu neighbors are standing guard to safeguard the temple. Some individuals have utilized this temple for their own gain. We recognize their efforts in developing it, but they have forcibly evicted us from the temple.\"\n\nRanjan Kumar Das, another resident, expressed, \"There is a fear that this temple might be targeted. Last night, some students and local Muslims were with us. They provided their contact information for assistance in case of an attack. Our Muslim brothers who have supported us are setting a positive example.\"\n\nAt Ramna Kali Temple, Dhaka University student Rafid Azad is on duty. He mentioned that groups are taking shifts to guard the temple. When asked who is behind the attacks on temples, he replied, \"We have seen examples in many countries where, when a regime collapses, certain individuals seize an opportunity. We cannot definitively say who is attacking the temples. Whoever is responsible for this is committing a terrible act.\"\n\nHe emphasized that the new government should guarantee fundamental rights, including religious freedom and freedom of expression. \"Certainly, we do not desire a biased government, we desire a government that represents everyone.\"\n\nAt ISKCON Swamibag temple, there are no guards, but two posters read, \"You are our brothers, do not fear\" and \"Bangladesh is for all of us\". ISKCON member Durlav Harinam Das informed Dhaka Tribune, \"In this area, we have good relations with everyone, so there is no reason to be afraid.\"\n\nIndia Is Worried\n\nThe safety of minorities in Bangladesh is a top concern for New Delhi, the government has affirmed. Addressing Parliament on the situation in the neighboring country, External Affairs Minister S Jaishankar declared yesterday that India is \"deeply concerned\" about the situation in Bangladesh, particularly regarding the minority community. \"We are closely monitoring the situation regarding the status of minorities. There are reports of efforts by various groups and organizations to ensure their protection and well-being. We appreciate that, but will naturally remain deeply concerned until law and order is visibly restored,\" he stated.\n\nThe minister mentioned that New Delhi is in \"close and continuous\" contact with the Indian community in Bangladesh through diplomatic missions.\n\nAlso under scrutiny is the safety of Indian nationals currently in Bangladesh. The minister noted that there are approximately 19,000 Indian nationals in Bangladesh, with 9,000 of them being students. Most students have returned following the protests against Sheikh Hasina gaining momentum. Many Indians are now returning. An Air India chartered flight brought back 205 Indians, including six infants, this morning.", "source": {"uri": "pehalnews.in", "dataType": "news", "title": "Pehal News"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hindus", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Hindus"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Awami_League", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Awami League"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muslims", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Muslims"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sheikh_Hasina", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Sheikh Hasina"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Temple", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Temple"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bangladesh", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Bangladesh"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Bangladesh"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hindu_temple", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Hindu temple"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democracy", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Democracy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BBC", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "BBC"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christians", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Christians"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tarique_Rahman", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Tarique Rahman"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Khaleda_Zia", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Khaleda Zia"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bangladesh_Nationalist_Party", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Bangladesh Nationalist Party"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crore", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Crore"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secularism", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Secularism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buddhism", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Buddhism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atheism", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Atheism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Religion", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Religion"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extremism", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Extremism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Delhi", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "New Delhi"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "New Delhi"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dhaka", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Dhaka"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Dhaka"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Bangladesh"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_Secretary_of_the_Chinese_Communist_Party", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "General Secretary of the Chinese Communist Party"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bangladesh_Hindu_Buddhist_Christian_Unity_Council", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Bangladesh Hindu Buddhist Christian Unity Council"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Netrokona_District", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Netrokona District"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Netrokona District"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Bangladesh"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dhaka_Tribune", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Dhaka Tribune"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rana_dynasty", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Rana dynasty"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Daily_Star_(Bangladesh)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "The Daily Star (Bangladesh)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sirajganj_District", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Sirajganj District"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Sirajganj District"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Bangladesh"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/India", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "India"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/S._Jaishankar", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "S.

They all managed to escape unharmed.\n\nThe mob \"took everything from furniture and mirrors to valuables,\" an unidentified family source told The Daily Star. \"After that, they torched the house along with Rahul da's musical instruments.\"\n\nThe singer reportedly kept a collection of over 3,000 handmade musical instruments.\n\nMr Ananda is the frontman of popular folk band Joler Gaan that has performed internationally in Australia and Scotland.\n\nJoler Gaan said Mr Ananda's home is not merely his residence but a cultural hub that has reunited Bangladesh.\n\n\"It was Joler Gaan's official studio. Musical discussions, recording, mixing, editing, everything happened there,\" the group said in a Facebook post.\n\n\"Do the instruments belong to just Joler Gaan? No. They are for all young musicians who believe we can make our own instruments. It is because of these instruments that people of this country can proudly say that these sounds are only heard in Bangladesh. It is this glimpse of a dream that draws another musician from faraway France.\"\n\nThe Bangladesh Hindu Buddhist Christian Unity Council, which represents the country's religious minorities, said mobs have vandalised 200-300 mostly Hindu homes since Monday and damaged 15-20 temples.\n\nThe attacks have left nearly 40 people injured, council general secretary Rana Dasgupta told Reuters.\n\nThe Independent spoke to a few Hindu families in Bangladesh. They fear being attacked because, they noted, Hindus are viewed as being supporters of Ms Hasina's party.\n\nA Hindu resident of Shibpur in Dhaka's Narsingdi district claimed that \"minorities are being brutalised\". \"We were shaken when we learned that my brother's house had been burnt to ashes by a mob,\" the resident, who asked not to be named for fear of his safety, said.\n\nHe and his family are not associated with any political party, he said, but they still face the danger of violence.\n\n\"Many people have suffered torture even without belonging to any political party and we are distressed. The situation is bleak as the rioters do not know the difference between supporters of Hasina and those who stay away from politics,\" he said, adding that some of his relatives have been injured or suffered losses to business or property during the protests.\n\nThe situation remains grim even though many Muslim friends have come to their aid and are trying to protect them from the disturbing elements, he said.\n\nSupriya Bhattacharya, a prominent union leader, said the situation for Hindus is \"very grim\". \"We are constantly worried and living in fear. Anyone can be attacked at any time,\" she told The Independent. \"Disturbing elements are looting temples, burning houses, seizing land, and killing people.\"\n\nShe noted that Hindus face mob violence whenever there is political turmoil in the country. \"But the violence has exceeded all levels this time and we are terrified. If this discrimination against us continues, then we will soon be wiped out from Bangladesh. We need urgent support from the international community,\" she said.\n\nIn many places the violence has prompted Muslims to come out and protect Hindu temples and other places of worship of minorities.\n\nStudent groups leading the protests against Ms Hasina have frequently urged the public not to target any minority community. But Hindu community leaders have said they feel vulnerable due to the absence of a functioning government.\n\nMehedi Hasan Marof, a journalist in Dhaka, said the Hindu community has not been singled out for violence.\n\n\"Those with allegiance to Hasina's ruling party have been subjected to mob fury, no matter their religion,\" he told The Independent.\n\nIndia, Bangladesh's Hindu majority neighbour where Ms Hasina has taken shelter, has expressed concern about the treatment of minorities across the border. \"What was particularly worrying was that minorities, their businesses and temples came under attack at multiple locations. The full extent of this is still not clear,\" S Jaishankar, India's foreign minister, said.\n\nIndia has evacuated most of the staff and their families from its embassy and four consulates in Bangladesh, unnamed government sources told Reuters.\n\nIndia is walking a tightrope on the Bangladesh crisis as New Delhi enjoyed deep ties with Dhaka under Ms Hasina's leadership, but can't afford to antagonise whoever takes power given the economic and strategic imperatives of keeping the neighbouring country in its orbit of influence.\n\nBangladesh is India's largest trading partner in South Asia.", "source": {"uri": "yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joler_Gaan", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Joler Gaan"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hindus", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Hindus"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sheikh_Hasina", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Sheikh Hasina"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bangladesh", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Bangladesh"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Bangladesh"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Folk_music", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Folk music"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dhaka", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Dhaka"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Dhaka"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Bangladesh"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Awami_League", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Awami League"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muslims", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Muslims"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Religious_persecution", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Religious persecution"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Daily_Star_(Bangladesh)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "The Daily Star (Bangladesh)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Hindu", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "The Hindu"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emmanuel_Macron", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Emmanuel Macron"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Asia", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "South Asia"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arson", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Arson"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/President_of_France", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "President of France"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secularism", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Secularism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prime_minister", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Prime minister"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pakistan", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Pakistan"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Pakistan"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_Secretary_of_the_Chinese_Communist_Party", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "General Secretary of the Chinese Communist Party"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bangladesh_Hindu_Buddhist_Christian_Unity_Council", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Bangladesh Hindu Buddhist Christian Unity Council"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rana_dynasty", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Rana dynasty"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Temple", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Temple"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Independent", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "The Independent"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Torture", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Torture"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Political_party", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Political party"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Facebook", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Facebook"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scotland", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Scotland"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Scotland"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/India", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "India"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/France", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "France"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australia", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Australia"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Australia"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/S._Jaishankar", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "S.

Let us not let this slip away because of our mistakes. I fervently appeal to everybody to stay calm. Please refrain from all kinds of violence. I appeal to all students, members of all political parties and non-political people to stay calm. This is our beautiful country with lots of exciting possibilities.\"\n\nHe added: \"Violence is our enemy. Please don't create more enemies. Be calm and get ready to build the country.\"\n\nYunus, widely seen as a stabilising figure, is in France but plans to travel back to Bangladesh on Thursday.\n\nViolence against Hindus appears to have started just hours after Hasina resigned and fled the capital, Dhaka, on Monday.\n\nImages of Hindus being lynched by mobs, temples set on fire, and businesses looted have flooded social media in India, although the full scale of the attacks is unclear.\n\nThere are more than 13 million Hindus in Bangladesh - almost 8% of the predominantly Muslim population - and many are traditionally supporters of Hasina's party, the Awami League.\n\nThe Awami League, which has close ties with India, is secular. Its rival, the Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP) and the hardline Islamist Jamaat e Islami, backed the protests.\n\nHasina remains in India where she sought refuge. In the vacuum left by her hasty exit, groups opposed to Hasina's rule have targeted the Awami League's followers, which include Hindus and Muslims.\n\nTarique Rahman, son of BNP leader Khaleda Zia and acting chair of the party, appealed to Bangladeshis to keep everyone safe.\n\n\"It is our duty to protect all Bangladeshis, irrespective of religion and politics, from discriminatory violence, and not to harass any particular community, create division, or seek vengeance,\" he said in a post on X.\n\nIn the old quarter of Dhaka, Muslims stood side by side with their Hindu neighbours to protect a Hindu temple from a violent mob. Student leaders have formed volunteer groups to help guard other sites.\n\nBut alarm is growing in west Bengal, which is the closest Indian state to Bangladesh and shares a 2,200 km-long border. An Indian parliamentarian who belongs to the ruling Bharatiya Janata party said India should prepare to see an influx of Hindu refugees.\n\n\"If this situation doesn't come under control, mentally be prepared to give refuge to 10 million Hindu refugees. If the situation is not controlled there, Jamaat and radicals will take control,\" Suvendu Adhikari told reporters.\n\nIndia's minister for external affairs, Subrahmanyam Jaishankar, told MPs yesterday he was \"deeply concerned\" over the safety of the Hindu minority.\n\nSome right-wing Hindu religious leaders in India have already become vocal, calling for the country to act.\n\nSelf-appointed spiritual leader Sadhguru Jaggi Vasudev said anti-Hindu violence in Bangladesh was not merely an internal matter and that India should \"stand up and act\"to protect Hindus.\n\nIn a post on X, Vasudev said, \"It is our responsibility to protect these people - who actually belong to this civilization - from these shocking atrocities.\"\n\nFormer diplomat Neelam Deo told the Guardian that any possible influx of Hindus into India depended on how widespread the violence became and how close the affected areas were to the border with India.\n\nShe said that, if news reports were true that violence had broken out in 27 of Bangladesh's 64 districts, the violence was already widespread.\n\n\"The army will have to take action and show that attackers will not get any impunity. But it's also important for people in Bangladesh to stop demonising the Awami League. If that continues, then both its Muslim leaders are vulnerable and so, of course, are its Hindu supporters,\" Deo said.\n\nLocal media in India has reported that the country had brought 190 non-essential staff at its high commission in Dhaka home on a special flight. Indian diplomats and other staff, though, remain in the country, in Dhaka and in Indian consulates in four other cities.\n\nIndia is watching the upheaval in Bangladesh, with which it has had very close relations under Hasina, very carefully.

Even Hindu crematoriums are not being spared and there are attempts to grab Hindu properties as part of 'land jihad',\" said Mohan Salekar, Konkan Prant Mantri of the VHP at a press conference held in Mumbai on Thursday.\n\nSalekar said that Hindus, Christians, Sikhs, Buddhists, and other religious minorities in the country should be allowed to enter India. While the government should give shelter to Hindus who want refuge here, security on the 4,096-kilometer-long India-Bangladeshi border should be strengthened so that criminals do not sneak in.\n\n\"We want a democratic government in Bangladesh which can protect human rights. We are with the Bangladeshi people, but there are groups taking advantage of the situation in that country to attack Hindus. We appeal to the Hindus to have patience,\" said Salekar.\n\nSalekar questioned the silence of the opposition and human rights groups to the violence against Bangladeshi Hindus. \"Contrast this to the hue and cry they raised in incidents like the one in Hathras. Not one so-called secular group has condemned the violence against Hindus in that country,\" said Salekar.\n\nVHP spokesperson Shriraj Nair said that the Hindu population in Bangladesh has fallen from 32% at the time of its independence in 1971 to 8% now. \"A protest by students against the government has turned into an attack against Hindus. They are taxpayers and have a low representation in crime, but whenever there is an event like this Hindus are targeted. ISKCON temples, the Indira Gandhi Cultural Centre have been attacked. There has been violence against Hindu women, but human rights groups and feminist organisations in India have been quiet,\" said Nair.\n\nReplying to questions from representatives of media groups about statements from Indian politicians about the possibility of something similar happening in India, Salekar said, \"We have seen situations like this being created in India, like the Shaheen Baug protests and farmer's agitation, but a situation like Bangladesh will not happen in India.

With even news channels being subjected to violence in Dhaka, organisations working for minorities screamed for help on social media. With a prospect of Bangladesh Nationalist Party's (BNP) return getting real and the prospect of Islamists of Jamat getting a strong foothold in Bangladesh's political sphere -- that Hasina has been able to keep at arm's length, to her credit -- religious places of Bangladeshi Hindus have started getting desecrated.\n\nAn ISKCON temple in Meherpur, in Bangladesh's Khulna division, was vandalised and set on fire by protesters on Monday.\n\nA minority that makes up about 8 per cent of Bangladesh's population, or around 13.1 million people -- Hindus have been at the receiving end of a student agitation metamorphosed into sectarian violence that has got a taste of 'my way or highway'. This is not a report card on Sheikh Hasina's ability to turn Bangladesh into a 'safe-haven' for its minorities. Even under Hasina, attacks on places of worship and forced evacuation from the land were regular for its minorities. But she was able to keep the militant Jamat from unleashing its fire. Today's 8 per cent Hindu population of Bangladesh is a significant decrease from 1947, when Hindus made up 30 per cent of the population, a testament to their fate from now.\n\nProbably one of the first to die was Hindu Awami League leader Haradhan Roy and his nephew, who were lynched by a mob. A grab of a telegram channel that has ever since gone viral, claims \"13 Hindu homes and 3 temples were set on fire\". The phone number disseminating the information on the purported telegram group identified him as 'Bangladesh Islami Chhatro Shibir'. In India, it caught the eye when Sanjeev Sanyal, a member of the Economic Advisory Council of the Prime Minister referred to the gory visuals (albeit in his personal capacity) saying, these are chilling for him particularly \"as a Bengali Hindu and a descendant of refugees\".\n\nIn a separate tweet, Sanyal talked about \"what awaits Bangladeshi Hindus\". Sanyal did not elaborate because, in real-time, Bangladesh is being testament to it. While visuals of jubilation from the former Prime Minister's residence were being beamed on most international news channels, reports suggested Kali temples were vandalised forcing hundreds of devotees to take shelter nearby.\n\nHowever, this is not a sudden phenomenon. In 2022, unidentified miscreants vandalised the idol of a deity at a Hindu temple in Bangladesh's Jhenaidah, while in the same year, 150 perpetrators led by one Haji Shafiullah attacked the ISKCON temple at 22 Lalmohon Saha Street of Wari Thana in Dhaka. But the police launched a manhunt, and Hasina's government reached out to minorities. Now, it's a brazen disregard for any law and order and the absence of any punitive action that has made Bangladesh's minorities the soft targets.\n\n\"My phone is flooded with SOS, videos, and details of Hindus being attacked, and killed in Bangladesh as we speak now. Temples are being attacked at a very large scale. Let me tell you, in Dhaka, even Muslims who supported the Awami League are at life risk now. Cars are being checked. I know a journalist who called me pleading to rescue him to New Delhi. He is a Muslim. Now, imagine the condition of Hindus in Bangladesh. Even as you and I talk, the tolls are mounting in real-time, most of which will go unreported and whose photos will be labelled 'fake news' from a section of even this side of the border,\" said Deep Halder whose book 'Being Hindu in Bangladesh' created ripples in Bangladesh recently.\n\nA purported video showed a lady trying to convince a mob that she was \"on their side\". The video ended with her name and seeking police protection. Another purported video shot by Shantu Chakraborty showed the attacks on houses of the minorities by stick welding youths. He, too, has sought help, calling himself \"helpless\". Meanwhile, another purported video of an attack on a temple in Noakhali showed a mob breaking into the temple gate. Another purported video showed a woman crying while videographing a man setting another house on fire. She was heard saying in Bengali, \"They are deliberately setting it on fire\". Another purported video showed the woman screaming as the mob tried to break the window glass with bricks.\n\nWhile Prime Minister Narendra Modi chaired a meeting of the Cabinet Committee on Security at 7, Lok Kalyan Marg where the members were briefed about the current situation in Bangladesh, in West Bengal BJP's leader of Opposition Suvendu Adhikari sounded the alarm bell.\n\n\"Hindu minority is being killed in Bangladesh. The councillor of Rangpur was killed. In Sirajganj, 13 policemen were killed, out of whom nine were Hindus. Get ready, 1 crore Bangladeshi Hindus will be coming to Bengal,\" said Adhikari asking the CM and Governor Anand Bose to speak to the Centre.\n\nIs it feasible? Halder said much of it is politics. \"Even if it happens, it won't happen overnight. But the death toll of Bangladeshi Hindus is ticking in real time,\" she added.", "source": {"uri": "news18.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "News18"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

AP\n\nHundreds of Bangladeshi Hindus have tried unsuccessfully to flee to India this week after many homes and businesses of the minority community were vandalised following the overthrow of Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina.\n\nThe Bangladesh Hindu Buddhist Christian Unity Council said that 45 out of 64 districts in the country had seen the targeting of mostly Hindu homes, businesses or temples this week. A school teacher had been killed and 45 other people hurt, it said.\n\nHindus make up about 8% of Muslim-majority Bangladesh's 170 million people and have traditionally largely supported Hasina's Awami League party, which identifies as largely secular, instead of the opposition bloc that includes a hardline Islamist party.\n\nHasina has taken refuge in India after fleeing the country on Monday in the face of mass protests against what critics called her authoritarian rule - provoking anger among some Bangladeshis towards their neighbour.\n\nMany living close to India are trying to flee but facing resistance from both sides, local people said. Both countries have said they have stepped up border patrolling since the violence.\n\nMohammad Rakibul Hasan, a local government official in Thakurgaon district in northwestern Bangladesh, said around 700-800 Hindus tried to flee to India around Wednesday evening after some of their houses were attacked and looted.\n\n\"They returned home after we provided protection,\" Hasan told Reuters. \"Border guard troops are patrolling the area. Everything is fine now with no further reports of violence.\"\n\nEarly on Thursday, about 300 Bangladeshis had assembled at a border point near India's Jalpaiguri district but dispersed later. Indian media showed Indian border troops around a group of people there.\n\nA Hindu goldsmith in the Narsingdi area, about an hour from Dhaka, who did not want to be named for fear of reprisals, said two youths demanded protection money of 1 million Bangladesh taka ($8,550) and relented only after they agreed to pay 100,000 taka.\n\nNobel Peace laureate Muhammad Yunus, who returned to Bangladesh on Thursday to head an interim government following Hasina's departure, said attacks on minorities could have been part of a conspiracy. He did not say who was behind the conspiracy.\n\n\"Our job is to protect all of them,\" he said on arrival in Dhaka from Paris.\n\n\"If you have faith in me and trust me, please ensure no one is attacked in the country. If you cannot listen to me on this, I have no use being here.\"\n\nThe two countries have longstanding cultural and business ties and India played a key role in the 1971 war with Pakistan which led to the creation of Bangladesh.\n\nIndia, which has a Hindu majority, has said it was worrying that minorities, their businesses and temples had been attacked in many places.\n\n\"It is the responsibility of every government to ensure the wellbeing of all its citizens,\" India's foreign ministry spokesperson, Randhir Jaiswal, told a press conference.\n\n\"We hope for the early restoration of law and order in Bangladesh. This is both in the interest of the country itself and the larger region.\"\n\nBangladesh's Hindu community leaders urged other communities to look after the religious minorities.\n\n\"I call upon the conscientious people of the country to forget all differences and stand unitedly by the side of the affected people and build social resistance,\" said Moyna Talukdar of the Bangladesh Hindu Law Reform Council.", "source": {"uri": "firstpost.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Firstpost"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hindus", "type": "loc", "score": 5,

It's good she is gone. But the violence now targeting Hindus is wrong. PM Yunus must uphold the rule of law & prevent the targeting of temples or people of any political party or faith from violence,\" Ro Khanna, Congressman said in a post on X on Thursday.\n\nCongressman Raja Krishnamoorthi said, \"As Bangladesh prepares to swear in its interim government, I urge all government officials, the new administration and police chief, and the people of Bangladesh to do all they can to end the violence that has emerged across the country, including the brutal targeting of the country's Hindu minority, their homes, businesses, and their temples.\" \"The violence must stop and those responsible must be brought to justice to help the people of Bangladesh move forward as a nation. I will continue to closely monitor developments in Bangladesh in coordination with the US State Department,\" Krishnamoorthi said in a statement on Wednesday.\n\nOn Wednesday, Hindu American Foundation director of Policy Research Anita Joshi, Utsav Chakrabarti of HinduAction, Human Rights Collective for Bangladesh Minorities Executive Director Priya Saha, and geopolitical analyst Jay Kansara met with the US Ambassador for International Religious Freedom (IRF) Rashad Hussein at the US State Department in Washington, DC.\n\nUrging US government action, the group briefed Hussein on the violence directed at Hindus and other religious minorities throughout Bangladesh, sharing documented incidents against Hindus and Hindu temples over 48 hours after Hasina left the country amidst civil unrest.\n\n\"The failure of Congress and this administration to acknowledge and condemn the violence against Hindus and other religious minorities is unacceptable,\" Joshi said.\n\n\"The situation on the ground in Bangladesh is urgent and dire. We implore the State Department to use its clout and resources to put an end to this rampant violence against religious minorities, violence rooted in decades of mistrust and maltreatment of Bangladesh's Hindu minority,\" she said.\n\nIn a separate statement, the Foundation for India and Indian Diaspora Studies (FIIDS) urged the US President, State Department, IRF Ambassador, and presidential candidates to take immediate action to ensure peace is re-established in Bangladesh and that \"minorities are protected, preventing another potential Hindu Genocide.\" FIIDS also urged the United Nations to deploy observers and peacekeeping forces to contain the situation on the ground in Bangladesh and ensure the protection of vulnerable communities.\n\nIt made similar appeals to Prime Minister Narendra Modi, Defence Minister Rajnath Singh, and External Affairs Minister S Jaishankar.\n\nSince Hasina fled the country on Monday, media reports from Bangladesh have flagged more and more cases of violence against minorities, including the massive vandalism and destruction at popular folk band Joler Gaan's frontman Rahul Ananda's residence on Monday prompting the singer and his family to go into hiding.\n\nHowever, it is not just Hindus that are targeted. At least 232 people were killed in Bangladesh in the incidents of violence that erupted across the country following the fall of the Hasina government on Monday, taking the death toll to 560 since the anti-quota protests first started in mid-July.\n\nMeanwhile, soon after he arrived in Dhaka from Paris, Yunus on Thursday promised to deliver a government which assures safety to its citizens. He is to take oath later in the evening.\n\nEarlier on Tuesday, the US expressed deep concern about the continued violence in Bangladesh including attacks on members of religious or political groups, and said it will be vital for the new government to credibly investigate all such instances and provide justice to victims.\n\n\"We are deeply concerned about continued reports of violence in Bangladesh - including violence directed at members of religious or political groups. We are equally concerned about reports of violence against police and law enforcement,\" a State Department spokesperson told PTI on Tuesday.

While leaders of the movement that toppled the Awami League government have appealed to people not to target the Hindu minority, concerns have been raised about their safety. In a silver lining, several voices have come out in support of Hindus and some temples are being guarded by Muslims and Hindus together.\n\nHindus account for nearly 8 per cent of Bangladesh's 17 crore population, and a large section of this community has traditionally backed Sheikh Hasina's Awami League. This is due to Sheikh Hasina's strong ties with India and Awami League's posturing as a largely secular force as compared to the opposition that comprises hardline forces.\n\nWith the government toppled and the new administration yet to take charge, mobs are running amok, targeting police stations, prisons, Awami League leaders' homes and Hindu establishments.\n\nTarique Rahman, BNP leader and son of former PM Khaleda Zia, is among the key voices that have appealed for calm.\n\n\"I call upon the people of Bangladesh to display restraint and calm in the midst of this transitional moment on our democratic path. It is our duty to protect all Bangladeshis, irrespective of religion and politics, from discriminatory violence, and not to harass any particular community, create division, or seek vengeance. Muslims, Hindus, Christians, Buddhists, believers, atheists - no one will be left behind or be prejudiced on our democratic path; together, we are all proudly Bangladeshis,\" he has said in a post on X.\n\nHomes Stormed, Looted\n\nThe Bangladesh Hindu Buddhist Christian Unity Council has told Reuters that 200-300 homes, mainly those owned by Hindus, and businesses had been targeted since Monday. About 15-20 Hindu temples had been vandalised and 40-odd people injured, though not seriously, the organisation's general secretary Rana Dasgupta said.\n\n\"The communal atrocities erupted hours before she resigned. Although there is no killing, there is injury. Houses and businesses of minorities, especially Hindus, as well as temples, have been targeted, looted, damaged,\" he said.\n\nDhaka-based development professional Avirup Sarkar has told BBC that his cousin lives in Netrokona, about 100 km from Dhaka. Hours after Sheikh Hasina fled the country, she called Mr Sarkar. \"She sounded terrified. She said the house had been attacked and plundered by a mob,\" he has told BBC. Mr Sarkar's cousin told him that 100 people armed with sticks had stormed the house, smashed furniture, TV, bathroom fittings and doors. They had also taken cash and ornaments. They did not assault anyone in the house.\n\n\"You people are descendants of Awami League. This country is in a bad shape because of you. You should leave the country,\" the mob shouted at the residents, according to the BBC report.\n\nJournalists, Artists Targeted\n\nPradip Kumar Bhowmik, a journalist with Daily Khoborpatra, died after being assaulted during a mob attack on Rayganj Press Club in Sirajganj, local media has reported. Three other journalists were injured. A total of 25 journalists were injured in incidents of assaults across the country, The Daily Star reported. Many of them are Muslims.\n\nIn Dhaka's Dhanmondi, a violent mob attacked Bangladeshi singer Rahul Ananda's ancestral house and burned his musical instruments and furniture. His family members managed to escape the attack. Folk band Joler Gaan, which Rahul Ananda sings for, has put up a video of their last recording in the now gutted room, and questioned the \"fire of rage and revenge\".\n\nMuslims Join Hindus In Guarding Temples\n\nAmid reports of minorities and temples being targeted, Dhaka Tribune sent a correspondent to three temples and found Hindus and Muslims guarding the places of worship. At Dhakeshwari National Temple, local resident Raj Ghosh said, \"Both Muslim and Hindu neighbours are guarding to protect the temple. Some individuals have used this temple for their own benefit. We acknowledge their efforts in developing it, but they have forcibly removed us from the temple.\"\n\nRanjan Kumar Das, another resident, said, \"There is fear that this temple could be targeted. Last night, some students and local Muslims were with us. They provided their contact details for help in case we were attacked. Our Muslim brothers who have stood beside us are setting an example.\"\n\nAt Ramna Kali Temple, Dhaka University student Rafid Azad is on guard. He said groups are taking turns to guard the temple. Asked who is behind the attacks on temples, he said, \"We have seen examples of many countries where, when a regime fails, some people spot an opportunity. We can not say clearly who is attacking the temples. Whoever is behind this is doing a horrible thing.\"\n\nHe said the new government should ensure fundamental rights, including religion and freedom of speech. \"Obviously, we do not want a bigoted government, we want a government for everyone.\"\n\nAt ISKCON Swamibag temple, there are no guards, but two posters read, \"You are our brothers, do not fear\" and \"Bangladesh is for all of us\". ISKCON member Durlav Harinam Das told Dhaka Tribune, \"In this area, we have good relations with everyone, so there is no reason for fear.\"\n\nIndia Is Concerned\n\nThe safety of minorities in Bangladesh is high on New Delhi's list of priorities, the government has said. Addressing the Parliament on the situation in the neighbouring country, External Affairs Minister S Jaishankar yesterday said India is \"deeply concerned\" over the situation in Bangladesh, especially about the minority community. \"We are monitoring the situation with regard to the status of minorities. There are reports of initiatives by various groups and organisations to ensure their protection and well-being. We welcome that, but will naturally remain deeply concerned till law and order is visibly restored,\" he said.\n\nPromotedListen to the latest songs, only on JioSaavn.com\n\nThe minister said New Delhi is in \"close and continuous\" touch with the Indian community in Bangladesh through diplomatic missions.\n\nAlso in focus is the safety of Indian nationals currently in Bangladesh. The minister said there are about 19,000 Indian nationals in Bangladesh, 9,000 of them students. Most students have returned after the students protests against Sheikh Hasina gathered steam. Many Indians are now returning. An Air India chartered flight brought back 205 Indians, including six infants, this morning.", "source": {"uri": "ndtv.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "NDTV"}, "authors": [{"uri":

Unfortunately, Biswas is not the only victim of the unbridled religious hatred directed at Hindu community. Students from the Hindu community, whose population has come down to 8% of the Bangladeshi population from 24%, also participated in the demonstration against Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina government.\n\nNotably, the members of the Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP), led by ex-Prime Minister Begum Khaleda Zia, and the outlawed Bangladesh Jamaat-e-Islami also joined forces under the guise of student protests which resulted in the forced resignation of Sheikh Hasina. Ever since, radical Islamists have been relentlessly hunting Hindus, destroying their temples, setting their homes ablaze and violating their women, all in the name of a democratic revolution. The incidents have only intensified since 5th August with alarming reports of multiple attacks on Hindus emerging on social media and news outlets.\n\nHindu students who enthusiastically became a part of the student agitation in Bangladesh are now facing the brunt of the Islamists seeking the blood of the minorities on the streets. The ugly reality has come as a jolt to the Hindu students who are equally alarmed and perplexed by the senseless rioting directed at them.\n\nSheikh Hasina's resignation as prime minister of Bangladesh has left Nilay Kumar Biswas without a full night's sleep. He stated that he felt reasonably safe in Dhaka, but at night he can't sleep because of distress calls from friends and family who live outside Bangladesh's capital. He added that in the days leading up to the establishment of an interim government, Bangladeshi people, particularly Hindus, need to look out for one another. \"Most police stations remain unmanned. As murderous mobs go on a rampage, the ordinary Bangladeshi watches helplessly. The minority Hindu community feels especially helpless at such times because we are easy targets.\" he expressed while talking to The Print.\n\nAccording to Biswas, who received his master's degree in social science from Dhaka University's Department of Mass Communication and Journalism last year, a large number of Hindu students took part in the quota reform demonstrations that led to Sheikh Hasina's exit. \"It was not just Muslims, but many Hindu students wanted the quota system in government jobs to be reformed. They walked with their fellow Muslim students, sang songs of hope, gave slogans against fascism and faced the police's lathi and bullet. Hindu students have spilled blood for a cause that united an entire nation. Today, as anarchy descends on Bangladesh, Hindu temples are being attacked, our houses are being looted, set on fire, our lives are in danger,\" he mentioned as he came to terms with the brutality of their perilous circumstances.\n\nThe nation came to a standstill due to government job reservations, which infuriated thousands of students from Bangladesh's public and private universities as well as other educational establishments. They objected to the government providing a thirty per cent quota for children and grandchildren of freedom fighters in the 1971 Liberation War which saw the formation of Bangladesh.\n\n56% of entry positions in government occupations were set aside for particular \"entitled\" classes under the contentious quota system. This included a 30% reservation for the descendants of those who fought for independence, 10% for women and citizens of impoverished areas, 5% for members of ethnic minorities and 1% for individuals with disabilities. Only 44% of the government jobs in the country were available to general category candidates.\n\nThe district-wise quota, which was first implemented in 1972 for liberation warriors and then extended to their children in 1997 and grandkids in 2010, was abolished in 2018 by the Hasina-led government in response to widespread agitation. The Supreme Court reduced the quota for families of freedom fighters to 5% from 30% on 21st July after the High Court overturned the 2018 order and restored the previous quota system in June of this year. Biswas noted that many students participated in the popular uprising because they believed the system was unfair.\n\n\"Many Hindus were there in the protests. But today, as communal riots have broken out against Hindus everywhere, the Bangladeshi Hindu is asking a simple question to her fellow citizens: Is this not our country also,\" Biswas questioned helplessly.\n\nHe claimed that Hindus have gone to their fellow Muslims at this hour amid reports of attacks on Hindus making headlines worldwide. \"My Muslim friends are standing guard outside temples and Hindu houses to prevent mobs from ransacking and torching them. There are appeals on social media from well-meaning Muslim citizens to not let the country descend into darkness. It is the fellow Muslims who can protect us. Who else do we turn to,\" he asked desperately as what option does the Hindu community have but to accept such tropes at these trying times to provide the marginalized community with a semblance of false comfort.\n\nHowever, Biswas fears that more casualties and destruction could occur if an interim administration is not established quickly and the situation is not brought under control. \"Bangladesh needs a new beginning with Muslims, Hindus and citizens of all other faiths. People are attempting to update the list of districts affected by communal riots. I can only pray that the list does not get any longer. Too much has been lost already,\" he stressed.\n\nLike Biswas, Aaria Bhowmik, a university student, too welcomed Sheikh Hasina's withdrawal from office by posting numerous celebratory photos of herself with Bangladesh's flag with the remark, \"The people of Bengal are free today.\" In another post, she declared, \"I am Hindu and my friends from every religion in Bangladesh are here to protect me. We built this Bnagladesh together. We are united.\"\n\nAaria's misconceptions were promptly dispelled by the radicals. Soon after, she realized the true worth of the life of a Hindu in the Muslim-majority country and appealed, \"In protest, we stand united, irrespective of religion. We have not seen religion, only humanity, and now we, as Hindus, are being attacked. It's time to raise our voices, to make our stance clear and strong against this injustice.\"\n\nHowever, she didn't realise that while it might be true for her, an Islamist views the world through the lens of Islam and the protests were merely a means for them to ruthlessly attack Hindus. Aaria also uploaded screengrabs of multiple news articles detailing the assaults on Hindus, their residences and temples including well-known Bangladeshi musician Rahul Ananda, whose home was set on fire and had his belongings pillaged by an Islamist mob.\n\nThe Hindu students, who considered Bangladesh as their own and stood side by side with their Muslim countrymen in the agitation are now inevitably reduced to begging for the lives and honour of their families, friends and fellow Hindus to be spared and their religious places and properties not to be vandalised and burned.", "source":

A video shared by journalist Aditya Raj Kaul on social media showed the pain of a Hindu identified as Bimal Chandra Dey who recorded the arson attack at his own automobile shop.\n\nAs per the video, Dey owned a bike shop named 'City Bike Centre' in Comilla, Bangladesh which was set ablaze by Islamists yesterday amid the ongoing political crisis in Bangladesh.\n\n\"Has anyone seen that your dreams have been shattered in front of your eyes? I am seeing that. I am seeing how my future is being destroyed. My workplace is burned.

Bangladesh-based Bike Showroom owner Minority Hindu Bimal Chandra Dey records this heartbreaking video after an Islamist mob set ablaze his 'City Bike Centre' in Comilla of Bangladesh. Dreams shattered. Life comes to a standstill. This is how Hindus suffer,\" the journalist said commenting on the video.\n\nHindus in Bangladesh are facing constant attacks at the hands of Islamists after the fall of the Sheikh Hasina-led government in the country. Islamists have left no stone unturned to target Hindu homes, businesses and temples. Several similar incidents have been reported by OpIndia exposing the pain that the Hindus in the country are forced to suffer.\n\nOn 9th August, a video went viral on the social media which a woman could be heard saying, \"They came and looted our house. They took away our money, gold, and whatever valuable that was left with us. They also abducted my 14-year-old boy. I don't even know their identity. They vandalized our house and took everything away. They also beat us severely.\" The woman could be seen continuously crying in the video.\n\nIn another Facebook video, one Hindu woman narrated how her family was targeted overnight by Islamist mobs. She stated that her 15-year-old brother was assaulted at knifepoint. They also stole Tk 3 lakh from the family.\n\n\"Look how they have vandalized our houses...Is this the work of a human? They are claiming that this is an independent country now. See what they have done to my underage brother,\" she narrated the ordeal.\n\n\"It's a curse to be a Sanatani in Bangladesh. I, as a student, am asking why my house is being targeted,\" the Hindu woman continued. She pointed out that 3-4 other Hindu houses were attacked in a similar fashion.\n\n\"Who will give us justice? Who is there to protect us Hindus? Today, they are attacking me. Tomorrow, they will attack you. If we do not stand up to it now, then, we will not be able to survive tomorrow.\"\n\nOn 7th August, a video showed Islamists breaking new benchmarks for savagery and hatred towards Hindus. In the video, Islamists could be seen encircling a dead victim lying on the ground. There was a pool of blood beneath the deceased man's broken head, and his hands were bound in handcuffs. Many men were gathered around him. With the aid of a stick, one man, whose face cannot be seen in the video, strips the deceased person naked and checks the victim's private part for circumcision. Shouting 'Hindu, Hindu' over the corpse, the crowd hovering over the dead body laughs, realizing that the man is a Hindu because he is not circumcised.\n\nOn 5th August, it came to light that Jihadis attacked Hindus' houses, shops and temples in Bangladesh in the guise of protests against the Sheikh Hasina government. Despite the resignation by Hasina from the Prime Minister's post, the protests continued and so did the attack on Hindus. Minister of External Affairs Dr S Jaishankar has also expressed concerns over attacks on Hindus and other minorities in Bangladesh. Earlier, OpIndia reported about the list of 54 attacks released by the Bangladesh Hindu Buddhist Christian Unity Council and attacks reported by The Daily Star, a Bangladeshi newspaper. Several videos and photos of attacks on Hindus surfaced on social media.\n\nAs the day passed by, more details of the attacks with photos and videos surfaced. Apart from the 54 attacks reported earlier, by today, OpIndia has detailed 11 more incidents of targeted violence against Hindus in Bangladesh after the coup against Sheikh Hasina.Details of Islamist attacks against minority Hindus in Bangladesh can be read here.", "source": {"uri": "opindia.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "OpIndia"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hindus", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Hindus"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Islamism", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Islamism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bangladesh", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Bangladesh"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Bangladesh"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sheikh", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Sheikh"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Journalist", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Journalist"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_media", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Social media"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comilla_District", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Comilla District"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Comilla District"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Bangladesh"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arson", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Arson"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OpIndia", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "OpIndia"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Independent_politician", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Independent politician"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Temple", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Temple"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bangladeshi_taka", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Bangladeshi taka"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Facebook", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Facebook"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gold", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Gold"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comilla", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Comilla"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Comilla"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Bangladesh"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/S._Jaishankar", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "S.

In total, 25 journalists were injured in various attacks across the country, The Daily Star reported.\n\nIn Dhaka's Dhanmondi, a mob attacked the ancestral house of Bangladeshi singer Rahul Ananda, burning musical instruments and furniture. His family managed to escape.\n\nCommunity Solidarity\n\nDespite the turmoil, some communities have shown solidarity. Dhaka Tribune reported that Muslims and Hindus are jointly guarding several temples. At Dhakeshwari National Temple, locals of both faiths are standing guard, setting an example of unity.\n\nRafid Azad, a Dhaka University student, emphasized the need for a government that ensures fundamental rights and freedom of speech. Meanwhile, at ISKCON Swamibag temple, posters of unity reassure residents that \"Bangladesh is for all of us.\"\n\nIndia's Response\n\nThe Indian government has expressed deep concern over the situation in Bangladesh, particularly regarding the safety of minorities. External Affairs Minister S. Jaishankar, addressing the Parliament, emphasized that India is closely monitoring the situation and is in continuous contact with the Indian community in Bangladesh.\n\nIndia has also focused on the safety of its nationals in Bangladesh. With about 19,000 Indians residing there, many are now returning. An Air India chartered flight recently brought back 205 Indians, including six infants.\n\nThe political instability in Bangladesh has not only endangered its minorities but also disrupted trade and everyday life. As the country navigates this turbulent period, the hope is for a swift restoration of peace and order.", "source": {"uri": "lagatar24.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Lagatar English"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hindus", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Hindus"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Awami_League", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Awami League"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sheikh_Hasina", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Sheikh Hasina"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bangladesh", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Bangladesh"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Bangladesh"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tarique_Rahman", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Tarique Rahman"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hindu_temple", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Hindu temple"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muslims", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Muslims"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bangladesh_Nationalist_Party", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Bangladesh Nationalist Party"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Temple", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Temple"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secularism", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Secularism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Delhi", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "New Delhi"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "New Delhi"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/India", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "India"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_Secretary_of_the_Chinese_Communist_Party", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "General Secretary of the Chinese Communist Party"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bangladesh_Hindu_Buddhist_Christian_Unity_Council", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Bangladesh Hindu Buddhist Christian Unity Council"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Netrokona_District", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Netrokona District"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Netrokona District"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Bangladesh"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rana_dynasty", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Rana dynasty"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Khaleda_Zia", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Khaleda Zia"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/S._Jaishankar", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "S.

The focus has largely been on the broader geopolitical tensions, with little attention given to the plight of the Hindu minority. CoHNA is calling on US lawmakers to acknowledge this crisis and act to prevent further atrocities.\n\nIn their appeal, CoHNA has urged US Secretary of State Antony Blinken and the US State Department to closely monitor the situation and ensure that the Bangladeshi authorities take immediate steps to protect their Hindu citizens.\n\nThey have called for the perpetrators of the violence to be held accountable and have requested that the US facilitate the resettlement of the most vulnerable Bangladeshi Hindus through the US Refugee Admissions Program (USRAP).\n\n\"We cannot afford to be silent,\" said CoHNA in their statement, adding, \"The United States has a moral responsibility to prevent another genocide and to stand up for the rights of religious minorities. We urge our lawmakers to issue strong public statements condemning the violence and to take concrete actions that will bring international attention to this crisis.\"\n\nCoHNA has also requested an urgent meeting with US lawmakers to discuss both short-term and long-term solutions to the crisis. They emphasized that silence is not an option and that decisive action by the US could make a significant difference in preventing further violence and protecting the Hindu community in Bangladesh.\n\nThe Coalition of Hindus of North America (CoHNA) is an advocacy group dedicated to promoting the rights and well-being of Hindus across the continent. They work to raise awareness of issues affecting the Hindu community and to foster a greater understanding of Hindu culture and values.

A school teacher had been killed and 45 other people hurt, it said.\n\nHindus make up about 8% of Muslim-majority Bangladesh's 170 million people and have traditionally largely supported Hasina's Awami League party, which identifies as largely secular, instead of the opposition bloc that includes a hardline Islamist party.\n\nHasina has taken refuge in India after fleeing the country on Monday in the face of mass protests against what critics called her authoritarian rule - provoking anger among some Bangladeshis towards their neighbour.\n\nMany living close to India are trying to flee but facing resistance from both sides, local people said. Both countries have said they have stepped up border patrolling since the violence.\n\nMohammad Rakibul Hasan, a local government official in Thakurgaon district in northwestern Bangladesh, said around 700-800 Hindus tried to flee to India around Wednesday evening after some of their houses were attacked and looted.\n\n\"They returned home after we provided protection,\" Hasan told Reuters. \"Border guard troops are patrolling the area. Everything is fine now with no further reports of violence.\"\n\nEarly on Thursday, about 300 Bangladeshis had assembled at a border point near India's Jalpaiguri district but dispersed later. Indian media showed Indian border troops around a group of people there.\n\nA Hindu goldsmith in the Narsingdi area, about an hour from Dhaka, who did not want to be named for fear of reprisals, said two youths demanded protection money of 1 million Bangladesh taka ($8,550) and relented only after they agreed to pay 100,000 taka.\n\nNobel Peace laureate Muhammad Yunus, who returned to Bangladesh on Thursday to head an interim government following Hasina's departure, said attacks on minorities could have been part of a conspiracy. He did not say who was behind the conspiracy.\n\n\"Our job is to protect all of them,\" he said on arrival in Dhaka from Paris.\n\n\"If you have faith in me and trust me, please ensure no one is attacked in the country. If you cannot listen to me on this, I have no use being here.\"\n\nThe two countries have longstanding cultural and business ties and India played a key role in the 1971 war with Pakistan which led to the creation of Bangladesh.\n\nIndia, which has a Hindu majority, has said it was worrying that minorities, their businesses and temples had been attacked in many places.\n\n\"It is the responsibility of every government to ensure the wellbeing of all its citizens,\" India's foreign ministry spokesperson, Randhir Jaiswal, told a press conference.\n\n\"We hope for the early restoration of law and order in Bangladesh. This is both in the interest of the country itself and the larger region.\"\n\nBangladesh's Hindu community leaders urged other communities to look after the religious minorities.\n\n\"I call upon the conscientious people of the country to forget all differences and stand unitedly by the side of the affected people and build social resistance,\" said Moyna Talukdar of the Bangladesh Hindu Law

They all managed to escape unharmed.\n\nThe mob \"took everything from furniture and mirrors to valuables,\" an unidentified family source told The Daily Star. \"After that, they torched the house along with Rahul da's musical instruments.\"\n\nThe singer reportedly kept a collection of over 3,000 handmade musical instruments.\n\nMr Ananda is the frontman of popular folk band Joler Gaan that has performed internationally in Australia and Scotland.\n\nJoler Gaan said Mr Ananda's home is not merely his residence but a cultural hub that has reunited Bangladesh.\n\n\"It was Joler Gaan's official studio. Musical discussions, recording, mixing, editing, everything happened there,\" the group said in a Facebook post.\n\n\"Do the instruments belong to just Joler Gaan? No. They are for all young musicians who believe we can make our own instruments. It is because of these instruments that people of this country can proudly say that these sounds are only heard in Bangladesh. It is this glimpse of a dream that draws another musician from faraway France.\"\n\nThe Bangladesh Hindu Buddhist Christian Unity Council, which represents the country's religious minorities, said mobs have vandalised 200-300 mostly Hindu homes since Monday and damaged 15-20 temples.\n\nThe attacks have left nearly 40 people injured, council general secretary Rana Dasgupta told Reuters.\n\nThe Independent spoke to a few Hindu families in Bangladesh. They fear being attacked because, they noted, Hindus are viewed as being supporters of Ms Hasina's party.\n\nA Hindu resident of Shibpur in Dhaka's Narsingdi district claimed that \"minorities are being brutalised\". \"We were shaken when we learned that my brother's house had been burnt to ashes by a mob,\" the resident, who asked not to be named for fear of his safety, said.\n\nHe and his family are not associated with any political party, he said, but they still face the danger of violence.\n\n\"Many people have suffered torture even without belonging to any political party and we are distressed. The situation is bleak as the rioters do not know the difference between supporters of Hasina and those who stay away from politics,\" he said, adding that some of his relatives have been injured or suffered losses to business or property during the protests.\n\nThe situation remains grim even though many Muslim friends have come to their aid and are trying to protect them from the disturbing elements, he said.\n\nSupriya Bhattacharya, a prominent union leader, said the situation for Hindus is \"very grim\". \"We are constantly worried and living in fear. Anyone can be attacked at any time,\" she told The Independent. \"Disturbing elements are looting temples, burning houses, seizing land, and killing people.\"\n\nShe noted that Hindus face mob violence whenever there is political turmoil in the country. \"But the violence has exceeded all levels this time and we are terrified. If this discrimination against us continues, then we will soon be wiped out from Bangladesh. We need urgent support from the international community,\" she said.\n\nIn many places the violence has prompted Muslims to come out and protect Hindu temples and other places of worship of minorities.\n\nStudent groups leading the protests against Ms Hasina have frequently urged the public not to target any minority community. But Hindu community leaders have said they feel vulnerable due to the absence of a functioning government.\n\nMehedi Hasan Marof, a journalist in Dhaka, said the Hindu community has not been singled out for violence.\n\n\"Those with allegiance to Hasina's ruling party have been subjected to mob fury, no matter their religion,\" he told The Independent.\n\nIndia, Bangladesh's Hindu majority neighbour where Ms Hasina has taken shelter, has expressed concern about the treatment of minorities across the border. \"What was particularly worrying was that minorities, their businesses and temples came under attack at multiple locations. The full extent of this is still not clear,\" S Jaishankar, India's foreign minister, said.\n\nIndia has evacuated most of the staff and their families from its embassy and four consulates in Bangladesh, unnamed government sources told Reuters.\n\nIndia is walking a tightrope on the Bangladesh crisis as New Delhi enjoyed deep ties with Dhaka under Ms Hasina's leadership, but can't afford to antagonise whoever takes power given the economic and strategic imperatives of keeping the neighbouring country in its orbit of influence.\n\nBangladesh is India's largest trading partner in South Asia.", "source": {"uri": "independent.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Independent"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joler_Gaan", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Joler Gaan"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hindus", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Hindus"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sheikh_Hasina", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Sheikh Hasina"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bangladesh", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Bangladesh"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Bangladesh"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Folk_music", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Folk music"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Awami_League", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Awami League"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muslims", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Muslims"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Religious_persecution", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Religious persecution"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Hindu", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "The Hindu"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emmanuel_Macron", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Emmanuel Macron"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arson", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Arson"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/President_of_France", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "President of France"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secularism", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Secularism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prime_minister", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Prime minister"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dhaka", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Dhaka"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Dhaka"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Bangladesh"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pakistan", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Pakistan"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Pakistan"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_Secretary_of_the_Chinese_Communist_Party", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "General Secretary of the Chinese Communist Party"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bangladesh_Hindu_Buddhist_Christian_Unity_Council", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Bangladesh Hindu Buddhist Christian Unity Council"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rana_dynasty", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Rana dynasty"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Daily_Star_(Bangladesh)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "The Daily Star (Bangladesh)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Temple", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Temple"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Asia", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "South Asia"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Independent", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "The Independent"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Political_party", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Political party"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Facebook", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Facebook"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scotland", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Scotland"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Scotland"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/India", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "India"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/France", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "France"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australia", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Australia"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Australia"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/S._Jaishankar", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "S.

They criticized the failure of Congress and the administration to acknowledge and condemn the violence against Hindus and other religious minorities as unacceptable.\n\n\"Bangladeshi students had just human rights concerns against PM Hasina. It's good she is gone. But the violence now targeting Hindus is wrong. PM Yunus must uphold the rule of law & prevent the targeting of temples or people of any political party or faith from violence,\" Ro Khanna, Congressman said in a post on X on Thursday.\n\nCongressman Raja Krishnamoorthi said, \"As Bangladesh prepares to swear in its interim government, I urge all government officials, the new administration and police chief, and the people of Bangladesh to do all they can to end the violence that has emerged across the country, including the brutal targeting of the country's Hindu minority, their homes, businesses, and their temples.\"\n\n\"The violence must stop and those responsible must be brought to justice to help the people of Bangladesh move forward as a nation. I will continue to closely monitor developments in Bangladesh in coordination with the US State Department,\" Krishnamoorthi said.\n\nOn Wednesday, representatives from various Hindu American organizations met with the US Ambassador for International Religious Freedom (IRF) Rashad Hussein at the US State Department in Washington, DC. They briefed Hussein on the violence directed at Hindus and other religious minorities throughout Bangladesh, sharing documented incidents against Hindus and Hindu temples over 48 hours after Hasina left the country amidst civil unrest.\n\nThe Foundation for India and Indian Diaspora Studies (FIIDS) urged the US President, State Department, IRF Ambassador, and presidential candidates to take immediate action to ensure peace is re-established in Bangladesh and that minorities are protected, preventing another potential Hindu Genocide. FIIDS also urged the United Nations to deploy observers and peacekeeping forces to contain the situation on the ground in Bangladesh and ensure the protection of vulnerable communities.\n\nSince Hasina fled the country on Monday, media reports from Bangladesh have flagged more and more cases of violence against minorities, including the massive vandalism and destruction at popular folk band Joler Gaan's frontman Rahul Ananda's residence on Monday, prompting the singer and his family to go into hiding.\n\nAt TOI World Desk, our dedicated team of seasoned journalists and passionate writers tirelessly sifts through the vast tapestry of global events to bring you the latest news and diverse perspectives round the clock.

The crisis could spill over to India", "body": "Amid violent protests, popular Bangladeshi folk singer Rahul Ananda's 140-year-old residence in Dhaka, which was also a cultural hub and housed over 3,000 of his instruments, was vandalised, looted and burnt.\n\nThe 135-year-old Maharaja Bir Chandra library in Comilla, too, was vandalised and several historic books and documents were burnt. Several social media handles shared pictures of the vandalised property.\n\nIn another tragic incident, Bangladeshi actor Shanto Khan and his father Salim Khan were lynched by a mob Monday night.\n\nThese incidents of extreme violence have sparked fear among people.\n\nSpeaking to ThePrint, Robin Biswas, a Dhaka-based apparel merchandiser said that his ancestral home in the southwestern district of Patuakhali was targeted by vandals. \"My relative reported that a group of individuals entered our house, looted money, and stole other valuables,\" he said.\n\nBiswas noted that his family has no political ties. \"I don't understand why our home was attacked? According to my relatives, several other homes in the area, both Hindu and Muslim, were also targeted,\" he added.\n\nTalking with ThePrint, Rana Dasgupta, General Secretary of Bangladesh Hindu Buddhist Christian Unity Council, said he received a number of calls over the past few days that a lot of Hindu households across the country are in \"serious terror\" of facing attack from \"fundamentalist Muslim forces.\"\n\nGupta also confirmed that, so far, two Hindus have died after the fall of Hasina's regime, but refuted the notion that only Hindus with a connection to the Awami League were attacked. \"No, families with no political connections were also attacked and they called me for help,\" he said without giving details of those families.\n\nMeanwhile, Bangladesh Jamaat-e-Islami (BJI) Wednesday said they were aware of attacks on religious minorities, which included vandalism, looting, and arson. The party strongly condemned these actions, asserting that the \"ideas of majority and minority are irrelevant\" and emphasised \"that all citizens have equal rights\".\n\nStudent leaders who led the mass protests against former PM Hasina in Bangladesh also urged their supporters to protect Hindu temples and churches.\n\nGobinda Pramanik, President of the Bangladesh National Hindu Grand Alliance, told ThePrint that, to his knowledge, Hindu households not connected to the Awami League were not attacked, adding that the violence was \"politically motivated\".\n\n\"These attacks were politically motivated rather than religiously driven, and the way some Indian media are falsely portraying these incidents as attacks on the Hindu community is concerning,\" he said.\n\nOn Thursday, the Vishwa Hindu Parishad (VHP) appealed to the Indian government to protect Hindus in violence-ridden Bangladesh amid the ongoing unrest and to prevent \"jihadis posing as refugees from entering India.\"\n\nRajesh Jain, Secretary of VHP Madhya Bharat, urged the Indian government to take all necessary steps to safeguard Hindus in Bangladesh, who are facing persecution and whose homes and places of worship are being vandalised. He stressed the importance of ensuring the safety of Hindus, who are particularly vulnerable in the neighbouring country.\n\nMeanwhile, Prime Minister Narendra Modi has extended his best wishes to Muhammad Yunus, who was sworn in as head of the interim government in Bangladesh, and urged him to ensure the safety and protection of Hindus and all other minority communities who have come under attack.\n\nInfiltration attempts\n\nAs the turmoil in Bangladesh continued, attempts to enter India illegally were made at three border outposts in the Border Security Force's (BSF) North Bengal frontier, which shares a border with Bangladesh.\n\nThese border outposts are 'Shubhendu' in Siliguri sector, and 'Mukesh' and 'Moria Ghati' in Kishanganj sector.\n\nThe BSF Wednesday dispersed nearly 500 individuals, presumably of Bangladeshi origin, from the border check posts, and stopped them from entering India illegally. The force even had to resort to firing a round in the air to disperse the crowd.\n\nThePrint reported earlier that India has issued a high alert along the country's 4,096-kilometre border with strife-torn Bangladesh where the Army took control.\n\nAll units of the BSF in the east were asked to intensify patrolling, and more personnel have been deployed in the area to prevent any illegal influx.\n\nStressing that the government in India must take cognizance of the problem, Pradyot Manikya Deb Barma, the leader of Tipra Motha, said that the Centre must ensure the protection of indigenous people residing in Bangladesh.\n\nAlso read: India says 'closely analysing' Bangladesh crisis, including possibility of 'foreign hand'\n\nHe also said that the centre should ensure the protection of its own people in India.\n\n\"Tribal population in the Northeast is small. When people from Bangladesh come to India and become part of the state, it will lead to large scale demographic changes. In Tripura, the tribal population is 30 percent. This situation will instill fear in the minds of people that they may be reduced to a minority in their own state due to the influx of immigrants. The Centre needs to ensure that we first protect our own people,\" he said.\n\nThe Ministry of External Affairs Thursday said it is closely monitoring the situation in Bangladesh with respect to the country's minorities.\n\nMinistry's spokesperson Randhir Jaiswal said, \"This issue was addressed by the EAM in his suo motu statement. We are also monitoring the situation, about the status of the minorities. There are also reports that various initiatives have been taken by groups and organisations to ensure the protection and well-being of minorities.\"\n\n'A threat'\n\nExperts said that the change of guard in Bangladesh may prove to be bad news for India. Sheikh Hasina, an ally to India, worked on controlling terror and radical elements. However, with the release of Begum Khaleda Zia from jail, a possible change of power may not be in India's interests.\n\nSpeaking to ThePrint, Ajay Sahni, Executive Director of the Institute for Conflict Management and South Asia Terrorism Portal, said that while terrorism in Bangladesh was under control during Sheikh Hasina's regime, radicalisation remained a significant challenge and continued to increase. The Jamaat-e-Islami remained strong, which had not been adequately addressed and could now pose a danger to India.\n\n\"Just because the violence was controlled does not mean the potential for violence is less. The potential is enormous,\" he said, adding that this will impact not just the northeastern states but the entire nation.\n\n\"If a Right-wing Islamist-leaning government comes to power in Bangladesh, it will be a problem for India, and this is not just the Northeast but across the country. The extremist groups would want to create trouble in India to destabilise the nation,\" Sahni said.\n\n\"West Bengal and the northeast are extremely vulnerable, and it is uncertain how the situation will play out. If the movement falls into the hands of Jamaat, it will be problematic. Protestors rejecting the possibility of Army rule is a prelude to demands for an Islamic government,\" he added.\n\nA senior officer also said that with turmoil in Bangladesh, it is expected that radical forces would sneak into India leading to increased criminal activity.\n\n\"Besides the role of Jamaat, there could be a resumed push for insurgent outfits like the ULFA as they will get emboldened,\" the officer said.\n\nHe added that the situation at the borders puts India in a \"vulnerable position\"\n\n\"This is not good for India. There is a huge probability that there will be a rise in Islamist movements and radical groups. In this scenario, the safety of Bangladesh's Hindus is a big concern. Even in 1971 the Hindus had suffered and many of them came to India. This border has become extremely vulnerable. Do not forget Pakistan and China on both sides are keeping a track of this. They will take advantage of it the moment there is a chance,\" he said.\n\n(Edited by Zinnia Ray Chaudhari)", "source": {"uri": "theprint.in", "dataType": "news", "title": "ThePrint"}, "authors": [],

Under the circumstances, we have called upon the countrymen as well as the manpower of our organization to play the role of guardians in protecting the properties of the people of all religions.

The attack escalated following the resignation as the Prime Minister and subsequent escape to India by Sheikh Hasina.\n\nMultiple online videos showed temples being set ablaze, and houses and businesses of Hindus being attacked. An ISKCON temple in Meherpur, located in Bangladesh's Khulna division, and a Kali temple were vandalised and torched. Meanwhile, two Hindu councillors were killed amid the protests.\n\nThe Bangladesh Hindu Buddhist Christian Unity Council tweeted that as many as 54 attacks took place on temples, houses and establishments of the Hindu community.

Where and How To Watch Summer's Best 'Shooting Stars'.\n\n\"The situation has drawn disturbing parallels to the atrocities committed during Operation Searchlight in 1971, when Bengali Hindus faced genocide\", CoHNA said in a statement.\n\nThe Coalition fears that the current wave of violence could lead to another catastrophic loss of life if immediate action is not taken.\n\nThe CoHNA's statement highlighted the ongoing persecution of Hindus in Bangladesh, noting that despite comprising less than eight percent of the population today, they continue to face existential threats.\n\nIt added, \"Historical data underscores the gravity of the situation: in 1971, a US State Department report revealed that more than 60 per cent of the Bengali refugees who fled to India were Hindus, despite Hindus making up less than 18 per cent of the population in East Pakistan at the time.\"\n\nThe Coalition is particularly concerned about the lack of media coverage of the targeted nature of this violence. The focus has largely been on the broader geopolitical tensions, with little attention given to the plight of the Hindu minority. CoHNA is calling on US lawmakers to acknowledge this crisis and act to prevent further atrocities.\n\nIn their appeal, CoHNA has urged US Secretary of State Antony Blinken and the US State Department to closely monitor the situation and ensure that the Bangladeshi authorities take immediate steps to protect their Hindu citizens.\n\nThey have called for the perpetrators of the violence to be held accountable and have requested that the US facilitate the resettlement of the most vulnerable Bangladeshi Hindus through the US Refugee Admissions Program (USRAP).\n\n\"We cannot afford to be silent,\" said CoHNA in their statement, adding, \"The United States has a moral responsibility to prevent another genocide and to stand up for the rights of religious minorities. We urge our lawmakers to issue strong public statements condemning the violence and to take concrete actions that will bring international attention to this crisis.\"\n\nCoHNA has also requested an urgent meeting with US lawmakers to discuss both short-term and long-term solutions to the crisis. They emphasized that silence is not an option and that decisive action by the US could make a significant difference in preventing further violence and protecting the Hindu community in Bangladesh.\n\nThe Coalition of Hindus of North America (CoHNA) is an advocacy group dedicated to promoting the rights and well-being of Hindus across the continent. They work to raise awareness of issues affecting the Hindu community and to foster a greater understanding of Hindu culture and values.

A school teacher had been killed and 45 other people hurt, it said.\n\nHindus make up about 8 per cent of Muslim-majority Bangladesh's 170 million people and have traditionally largely supported Ms Hasina's Awami League party, which identifies as largely secular, instead of the opposition bloc that includes a hardline Islamist party.\n\nMs Hasina has taken refuge in India after fleeing the country on Aug 5 in the face of mass protests against what critics called her authoritarian rule - provoking anger among some Bangladeshis towards their neighbour.\n\nMany living close to India are trying to flee but facing resistance from both sides, local people said. Both countries have said they have stepped up border patrolling since the violence.\n\nMr Mohammad Rakibul Hasan, a local government official in Thakurgaon district in northwestern Bangladesh, said around 700-800 Hindus tried to flee to India around Aug 7 evening after some of their houses were attacked and looted.\n\n\"They returned home after we provided protection,\" he said. \"Border guard troops are patrolling the area. Everything is fine now with no further reports of violence.\" & Conditions and Privacy Policy as amended from time to time.\n\nYes, I would also like to receive SPH Media Group's\n\nSPH Media Limited, its related corporations and affiliates as well as their agents and authorised service providers.\n\nmarketing and promotions.\n\nEarly on Aug 8, about 300 Bangladeshis had assembled at a border point near India's Jalpaiguri district but dispersed later. Indian media showed Indian border troops around a group of people there.\n\nA Hindu goldsmith in the Narsingdi area, about an hour from Dhaka, who did not want to be named for fear of reprisals, said two youths demanded protection money of 1 million Bangladesh taka (S$11,300) and relented only after they agreed to pay 100,000 taka.\n\nNobel Peace laureate Muhammad Yunus, who returned to Bangladesh on Aug 8 to head an interim government following Ms Hasina's departure, said attacks on minorities could have been part of a conspiracy. He did not say who was behind the conspiracy.\n\n\"Our job is to protect all of them,\" he said on arrival in Dhaka from Paris.\n\n\"If you have faith in me and trust me, please ensure no one is attacked in the country. If you cannot listen to me on this, I have no use being here.\"\n\nThe two countries have longstanding cultural and business ties and India played a key role in the 1971 war with Pakistan which led to the creation of Bangladesh.\n\nIndia, which has a Hindu majority, has said it was worrying that minorities, their businesses and temples had been attacked in many places.\n\n\"It is the responsibility of every government to ensure the wellbeing of all its citizens,\" India's foreign ministry spokesperson Randhir Jaiswal told a press conference.\n\n\"We hope for the early restoration of law and order in Bangladesh. This is both in the interest of the country itself and the larger region.\"\n\nBangladesh's Hindu community leaders urged other communities to look after the religious minorities.\n\n\"I call upon the conscientious people of the country to forget all differences and stand unitedly by the side of the affected people and build social resistance,\" said Ms Moyna Talukdar of the Bangladesh Hindu Law Reform Council.

Despite assurances from the army, no attempts have been made to save Hindus in Bangladesh. In fact, reports indicate that the army and police are robbing and looting houses too. Hindu families are being assaulted and beaten. A Hindu professor was brutally killed with a hammer. Hindu families have lost everything in Bangladesh and even now, Hindu organisations are afraid to speak openly,\" they said.\n\nThe sources said the attacks were not by radicals but the protest was becoming a terror movement. \"No leadership can control them because this has been going on for many years. There have been more than 4,000 attacks on Hindus since 2013. Saudi money and return of old Bangladeshis from the Gulf with huge money is giving a boost to Islamist groups. The free run to these Islamists by army and police is a clear indication that they are endorsing these goons,\" they said.\n\nThe attacks on Hindus are a major cause of concern for the Indian government. According to reports from local media and functionaries of Hindu minority groups in Dhaka, almost 97 places have been attacked.\n\n\"ISKCON temple and Kali Mandir have been attacked and houses of Hindus damaged. Hindu councillor Haradhan Roy was murdered by protesters in these attacks. The house of celebrated musician Rahul Ananda was vandalised and just a piece of cloth was left behind. In a very systematic way, radicals have burned down the Indira Gandhi Cultural Centre and Bangabandhu Memorial Museum.\"\n\nBangladesh has seen nearly 4,000 attacks against the Hindu community since January 2013. \"These are systematic attacks. The ongoing communal violence after Sheikh Hasina's departure is not spontaneous but deliberate and well-orchestrated. Multiple factors have played an important role in these constant attacks. The inaction of state agencies is because they have decided to let this continue for some time. Now, the Islamist groups have found a reason to attack Hindus, terming Indian policies as anti-Muslim.\"\n\nTop Intelligence sources say the acts of terror were controlled by Hasina so far but now, the attackers have an open agenda which the state will also sponsor so that the international community can be given a handle.\n\n\"This will increase in the days to come because of Saudi pumping in money for radical Islam. Also, a majority of Bangladeshis wenr to Middle East after the oil boom. They are doing good in the Gulf and want radical Islam in Bangladesh. Many of them have come back in old age with huge sums of money and now want religion to spread through radicals,\" they said.\n\nIn the past 15 years, many radical political parties and groups like Ansarullah Bangla Team, Hizb ut-Tahrir, and Jamaat-ul-Mujahideen Bangladesh (JMB) have emerged. \"These groups have attacked secular intellectuals, terrorised the Hindu community, and launched dramatic terrorist attacks, including in Dhaka. The Hasina government wanted a crackdown on them but it was not sufficient to hold them,\" they said.\n\nChaos reigned supreme in Bangladesh after the fall of the Sheikh Hasina government on Monday, with police absent from their duty to keep law and order or manage traffic, local media reports said.\n\nBodies of at least 29 supporters of Hasina's Awami League party were recovered across the country through Tuesday, taking the overall death toll to 469 in almost three weeks since the protest first started in July over a quota system in government jobs.\n\nMeanwhile, Nobel peace prize winner Muhammad Yunus was flying back to Bangladesh on Thursday to lead a caretaker government after the student-led uprising ended the 15-year rule of Sheikh Hasina.\n\nYunus, 84, could be sworn in as the country's new leader as soon as Thursday evening to begin what the army chief has vowed will be a \"beautiful democratic process\".\n\nHasina, 76, who had been in power since 2009, quit on Monday as hundreds of thousands of people flooded the streets of Dhaka. Jubilant crowds later stormed and looted her palace.\n\nMonday's events were the culmination of more than a month of unrest, which began as protests against a plan for quotas in government jobs but morphed into an anti-Hasina movement.\n\nHasina, who was accused of rigging January elections and widespread human rights abuses, deployed security forces to quash the protests.", "source": {"uri":

Up to 40 people have been injured though not seriously, its general secretary, Rana Dasgupta, told Reuters.\n\n\"The communal atrocities erupted hours before she resigned,\" he said. \"Although there is no killing, there is injury. Houses and businesses of minorities, especially Hindus, as well as temples, have been targeted, looted, damaged.\"\n\nDasgupta said some people he could not identify had thrown a brick at his car when he was out on the road on Monday in the southeastern district of Chattogram.\n\n\"I stand against communal atrocities and will not stop,\" he said. \"Until my death, I shall fight for them. I may not be able to physically protect them, but I can give them courage. I may not be able to resist attacks, but I can protest.\"\n\nReuters could not verify the scale of reported incidents amid the post-Hasina turmoil and police officers did not answer calls from Reuters seeking comment after mobs attacked many police stations.\n\n\"The situation is horrific,\" said Manindra Kumar Nath, a Hindu community leader. \"Even today, we are getting calls from people asking us to save their lives, but we are not receiving any support from anywhere.\"\n\nThe military's media office said security forces were helping maintain law and order across the South Asian nation, without specifying any incidents.\n\n\"Everyone's cooperation is highly desired in this regard,\" it said in a statement.\n\nStudents who led the protests against Hasina that have killed nearly 300 people since July have repeatedly urged people not to target minority communities in the overwhelmingly Muslim country. But Hindu community leaders said they were feeling vulnerable because of the lack of a functioning government.\n\nThe army chief has promised an interim government soon, while the students have said they want Nobel Peace laureate Muhammad Yunus as the chief adviser to the interim government.\n\n(Reporting by Ruma Paul in Dhaka and Krishna N.

This act of solidarity took place amid the escalating violence and chaos that followed the sudden departure of former Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina, who fled to India amid growing protests.\n\nThe protests, which began as a reaction to a controversial government job quota system, have spiraled into a broader conflict with a disturbing communal undertone. Reports indicate that extremists have taken advantage of the turmoil, targeting Hindu communities and their places of worship. This includes attacks on Hindu homes, the abduction of women, and the arson of sacred sites, such as ISKCON and Kali temples.\n\nOne particularly poignant moment was captured in Dhaka, where, around 3 am, Muslim community members were seen vigilantly safeguarding the Dhakeshwari Mandir. These images, shared widely on social media platforms like X (formerly known as Twitter), show a glimmer of unity and protection amid the chaos. The actions of these Muslim citizens, alongside student protestors, demonstrate a collective stand against the targeted violence, providing a stark contrast to the extremists' aggression.\n\nThe situation in Bangladesh has been deteriorating since Hasina's resignation and flight. The crisis reached a boiling point when protestors stormed the Gono Bhaban, Hasina's official residence, shortly after her departure. In response, the military, led by General Waker-Uz-Zaman, stepped in, forming an interim government. Despite these efforts, the unrest has continued, particularly against Hindu communities.\n\nAmidst these events, the nation observed a holiday aimed at quelling the unrest. However, the intended calm was short-lived as attacks on Hindus persisted. The violence has claimed several lives, including Haradhan Roy, a Hindu councillor from the Rangpur City Corporation, highlighting the grave consequences of the ongoing strife.\n\nAs Bangladesh navigates this turbulent period, the images of students and community members standing guard outside a Hindu temple symbolize a beacon of hope and resilience. Their actions remind us of the potential for unity in the face of division, even as the country faces its most challenging times.", "source": {"uri": "in.mashable.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Mashable India"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/India", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "India"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bangladesh", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Bangladesh"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Bangladesh"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hindus", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Hindus"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hindu_temple", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Hindu temple"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muslims", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Muslims"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sheikh_Hasina", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Sheikh Hasina"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Islamism", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Islamism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dhakeshwari_Temple", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Dhakeshwari Temple"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kali", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Kali"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Society_for_Krishna_Consciousness", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "International Society for Krishna Consciousness"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arson", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Arson"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kidnapping", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Kidnapping"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twitter", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Twitter"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_media", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Social media"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dhaka", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Dhaka"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Dhaka"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Bangladesh"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rangpur_City_Corporation", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Rangpur City Corporation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Provisional_government", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Provisional government"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Official_residence", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Official residence"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Terrorism", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Terrorism", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Religion_and_Spirituality/Hinduism", "label": "dmoz/Society/Religion and Spirituality/Hinduism", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Religion_and_Spirituality/Sikhism", "label": "dmoz/Society/Religion and Spirituality/Sikhism", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Religion_and_Spirituality/Jainism", "label": "dmoz/Society/Religion and Spirituality/Jainism", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 48}], "image": "https://sm.mashable.com/mashable_in/seo/7/77148/77148_vyzk.png", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9792869", "eventUri": "eng-9792869", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.3098039215686275, "wgt": 157, "relevance": 1}

AP\n\nBangladesh has seen a spate of violent attacks on Hindus, their homes and their places of worship in the political turmoil accompanying Sheikh Hasina's exit, according to several media reports.\n\nTwo Hindu councillors were left dead in Sunday's violence while a number of homes and temples belonging to the community were vandalised.\n\nOn Monday, an Indian cultural centre in Dhaka and four Hindu temples across the country were attacked.\n\nBut what happened exactly? Should India brace for a refugee crisis?\n\nAs per The Daily Star, Haradhan Roy was of the Parshuram Thana Awami League and councillor of Ward 4 in Rangpur city was killed on Sunday.\n\nSanjeev Sanyal, a member of the Economic Advisory Council of the Prime Minister, wrote about Roy's lynching on social media.\n\n\"As a Bengali Hindu and a descendant of refugees, find this particularly chilling,\" he posted on X.\n\nAs per New Indian Express, Kajal Roy, a Hindu councillor from Rangpur, was also among the 100 killed in Sunday's violence.\n\nMeanwhile, homes and temples belonging to Hindus, including ISKCON and Kali temples, were attacked.\n\nOn Monday, the Indira Gandhi Cultural Centre, in Dhaka's Dhanmondi, was vandalised.\n\nThe Centre, formally inaugurated in March 2010, promotes bilateral cultural linkages between India and Bangladesh by organising cultural programmes, cultural seminars, workshops and engaging India based Gurus professionals and trainers for Yoga, Hindi, Indian classical Vocal Music and Indian Dances such as Kathak and Manipuri.\n\nIt also engages high class professionals from Bangladesh who had their training from Indian Gurus or in Indian Universities.\n\nThe Centre, a Cultural Centre of the Indian Council for Cultural Relations of India, has a library with over 21,000 books in the fields of Indian art, culture, politics, economics and fiction.\n\nAs per News18, an ISKCON temple in Bangladesh's Meherpur was set ablaze on Monday.\n\n\"One of our ISKCON centres (rented) in Meherpur was burnt, including the deities of Lord Jagannath, Baladev, and Subhadra Devi. Three devotees who lived in the centre somehow managed to escape and survive,\" ISKCON spokesperson Yudhistir Govinda Das tweeted.\n\nA Kali temple in the same area was also set ablaze.\n\nA number of videos purportedly of Hindus being attacked in Bangladesh have gone viral.\n\nThese include a woman pleading for her life in front of a mob, a temple in Navgraha Bari being set ablaze and another woman screaming while a man sets a house on fire.\n\nFirstpost has not confirmed the authenticity of the videos.\n\nKajol Debnath, leader of the Hindu Buddhist Christian Unity Council, told the Economic Times that the temples suffered minor damage.\n\nBut that will be of little comfort to Hindus, who comprise around eight per cent of Bangladesh's population - around 13 million people.\n\n\"My phone is flooded with SOS, videos, and details of Hindus being attacked, and killed in Bangladesh as we speak now. Temples are being attacked at a very large scale. Let me tell you, in Dhaka, even Muslims who supported the Awami League are at life risk now. Cars are being checked. I know a journalist who called me pleading to rescue him to New Delhi. He is a Muslim. Now, imagine the condition of Hindus in Bangladesh. Even as you and I talk, the tolls are mounting in real-time, most of which will go unreported and whose photos will be labelled 'fake news' from a section of even this side of the border,\" Deep Halder, author of the book Being Hindu in Bangladesh told News18.\n\nMonindra Kumar Nath, senior joint general secretary of Oikya Parishad, told Daily Star the community is frightened.\n\n\"They (Hindus) are crying, saying they are being beaten up, and their houses and businesses are being looted.

How can we console the members of the Hindu community?\" he further said.\n\nShould India brace for a refugee crisis?\n\nThe possibility that the Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP) and Jamaat-e-Islami could come to power has raised fears of a possible refugee crisis in India.\n\nThe two countries share a 4,096-kilometre border along West Bengal, Assam, Meghalaya, Tripura and Mizoram.\n\nAs per Deccan Herald, many are worried about a redux of the situation that Mizoram, Manipur and Nagaland are facing after the Aung San Suu Kyi-led government was overthrown in Myanmar.\n\nOver 35,000 refugees from Myanmar including MPs and ministers remain in Mizoram.\n\nThe crisis was thought to be one of the reasons behind the Meitei-Kuki conflict in Manipur.\n\nIn Assam, the Asom Jatiya Parishad (AJP), in a statement demanded that the Centre take immediate steps to secure the border.\n\n\"Immediate steps must be taken to prevent influx as Assam cannot take further burden of illegal migrants. The BJP-led government has failed to fence the borders, identify and expel the foreigners as agreed in the Assam Accord of 1985. The National Register of Citizens (NRC), which sought to detect all post-1971 immigrants, has still not been implemented. The fear of infiltration has increased after the Narendra Modi government implemented the CAA that seeks to welcome the non-Muslim migrants from Bangladesh, Pakistan and Afghanistan, till 2014,\" AJP general secretary, Lurinjyoti Gogoi wrote.\n\nThe Print quoted sources in the West Bengal government as saying that the Indian Army has been positioned in Bongaon and Cooch Behar along the border.\n\nMeanwhile, Border Security Force (BSF) director-general has also changed his schedule to reach Kolkata.\n\nBSF sources told The Print that the situation along the border remains normal.\n\nSuvendu Adhikari, the Leader of Opposition in the West Bengal Assembly, warned the Mamata Banerjee government in West Bengal to brace itself.\n\n\"If this situation doesn't come under control within three days, mentally, be prepared to give refuge to one crore Hindu refugees. The Centre should inform the (Bengal) Governor and Chief Minister. There is CAA.

Setback for Sheikh Hasina as US Revokes Former Bangladesh PM's Visa: Reports.\n\n\"Hindus are very afraid that they will be attacked anytime. This is because whenever the government falls, minorities are affected. This happens every time,\" he told IANS. Brahmachari also recounted incidents of Hindu temples and houses being \"burnt down\" and families being \"attacked\" following Sheikh Hasina's resignation as the Prime Minister on Monday.\n\nAppealing to the Indian government, he said, \"Since India and Bangladesh share good relations, the Indian government can do something for the Hindu minorities here. We request them to please help us.\" Bangladesh Unrest: Keeping a Close Watch on Situation, Says Centre at All-Party Meet; S Jaishankar Informs About Safety of Indian Nationals.\n\nWhen asked if he plans to seek refuge in India, Brahmachari expressed his commitment to his country but acknowledged the possibility of many Hindus leaving Bangladesh if the situation worsens. \"I am a 'Sadhu' (monk), and this is my country. But if this situation continues, many will leave the country and go to India or any other nation,\" he said.\n\nOn Bangladesh Army chief's announcement to form an interim government soon, he said, \"Yes, the Army said this but we never know what they will do... we are still worried as to how long the Hindu minorities can be safe in this country. If the violent situation is brought under control, we will stay. But if not, people will have to leave.\" \"This is because many Hindu MLAs, businessmen, and their houses were attacked. If this continues, Hindus will not stay here,\" he added.\n\nBrahmachari also highlighted the vulnerability of monks and devotees, who fear attacks while in temples or wearing saffron clothing in public. \"I am safe here for now but I don't know for how long... we have about 150 devotees in this temple but we don't know for how long we can be safe,\" he said. Brahmachari also described the current situation as \"relatively calm\" compared to the violence witnessed on Monday when Hindus and their temples were targeted.\n\n\"Now the situation is okay. No slogans were raised today. I stay in Chattogram, which is the second biggest city in Bangladesh, and this is the largest ISKCON temple in the country. But we still don't know for how long we will be safe,\" he added. He concluded with an appeal to the Indian government, saying, \"I hope and pray to Lord Krishna...

Das\n\nDHAKA/NEW DELHI, Aug 8 (Reuters) - Hundreds of Bangladeshi Hindus have tried unsuccessfully to flee to India this week after many homes and businesses of the minority community were vandalised following the overthrow of Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina.\n\nThe Bangladesh Hindu Buddhist Christian Unity Council said that 45 out of 64 districts in the country had seen the targeting of mostly Hindu homes, businesses or temples this week. A school teacher had been killed and 45 other people hurt, it said.\n\nHindus make up about 8% of Muslim-majority Bangladesh's 170 million people and have traditionally largely supported Hasina's Awami League party, which identifies as largely secular, instead of the opposition bloc that includes a hardline Islamist party.\n\nHasina has taken refuge in India after fleeing the country on Monday in the face of mass protests against what critics called her authoritarian rule - provoking anger among some Bangladeshis towards their neighbour.\n\nMany living close to India are trying to flee but facing resistance from both sides, local people said. Both countries have said they have stepped up border patrolling since the violence.\n\nMohammad Rakibul Hasan, a local government official in Thakurgaon district in northwestern Bangladesh, said around 700-800 Hindus tried to flee to India around Wednesday evening after some of their houses were attacked and looted.\n\n\"They returned home after we provided protection,\" Hasan told Reuters. \"Border guard troops are patrolling the area. Everything is fine now with no further reports of violence.\"\n\nEarly on Thursday, about 300 Bangladeshis had assembled at a border point near India's Jalpaiguri district but dispersed later. Indian media showed Indian border troops around a group of people there.\n\nA Hindu goldsmith in the Narsingdi area, about an hour from Dhaka, who did not want to be named for fear of reprisals, said two youths demanded protection money of 1 million Bangladesh taka ($8,550) and relented only after they agreed to pay 100,000 taka.\n\nNobel Peace laureate Muhammad Yunus, who returned to Bangladesh on Thursday to head an interim government following Hasina's departure, said attacks on minorities could have been part of a conspiracy. He did not say who was behind the conspiracy.\n\n\"Our job is to protect all of them,\" he said on arrival in Dhaka from Paris.\n\n\"If you have faith in me and trust me, please ensure no one is attacked in the country. If you cannot listen to me on this, I have no use being here.\"\n\nThe two countries have longstanding cultural and business ties and India played a key role in the 1971 war with Pakistan which led to the creation of Bangladesh.\n\nIndia, which has a Hindu majority, has said it was worrying that minorities, their businesses and temples had been attacked in many places.\n\n\"It is the responsibility of every government to ensure the wellbeing of all its citizens,\" India's foreign ministry spokesperson, Randhir Jaiswal, told a press conference.\n\n\"We hope for the early restoration of law and order in Bangladesh. This is both in the interest of the country itself and the larger region.\"\n\nBangladesh's Hindu community leaders urged other communities to look after the religious minorities.\n\n\"I call upon the conscientious people of the country to forget all differences and stand unitedly by the side of the affected people and build social resistance,\" said Moyna Talukdar of the Bangladesh Hindu Law Reform Council.\n\n($1 = 117.0000 taka)\n\n(Editing by Angus MacSwan)", "source": {"uri": "dailymail.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "Daily Mail Online"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

Hindus are also being blamed for being Awami League supporters as Hindu councilors affiliated to the party have been targeted.\n\nSocial media is rife with videos of Hindus being thrashed, their homes being ransacked, and their temples vandalised.

Reuters\n\nWhat started as a students'-led 'liberation movement' in Bangladesh leading to Sheikh Hasina's ouster is in danger of losing its legitimacy before the eyes of the world as it appears to have been co-opted, appropriated and hijacked by Islamist fundamentalists who have utilised the ensuing chaos, turbulence, lawlessness and the lack of any governing authority to launch a genocidal campaign against the minority Hindu population.\n\nEver since the Bangladesh prime minister was forced to flee, resulting in a power vacuum in the eighth-most populous country in the world, images, videos and accounts are streaming in of atrocities against the Hindu minority in Bangladesh, whose numbers have dangerously depleted over decades almost to the point of extinction.\n\nThe circumstances are so dire that even India's external affairs minister mentioned the issue during his statement in both Houses of the Parliament. S Jaishankar told the Parliament that attacks on police, including police stations and government installations are being carried out, \"properties of individuals associated with the regime were torched across the country. What was particularly worrying was that minorities, their businesses and temples also came under attack at multiple locations. The full extent of this is still not clear.\" He said India is \"monitoring the situation with regard to the status of the minorities.\"\n\nGiven MEA's proclivity for dry understatements, one can be reasonably certain that the situation is alarming. Led by radical Islamist groups such as the banned Jamaat-e-Islami and its various front organisations and entities, an ethnic cleansing of Hindus is under way across the length and breadth of the country. Hindu temples are being desecrated, business establishment and houses destroyed, torched, and Hindu citizens subjected to targeted killings by murderous mobs going around with 'lists'.\n\nThe Bangladesh Army, now the custodian of all power till a promised interim government led by Nobel laureate Muhammad Yunus takes oath, has been mysteriously missing in action. Law enforcement personnel are absconding, having come under retributive attack from vengeful 'protestors', and in the ensuing free-for-all, Hindu properties and places of worship and women have become prized meat for religious fanatics involved in wanton violence.\n\nHarrowing videos have surfaced on social media that give an indication of the unfathomable cruelty and genocidal nature of the violence being perpetrated on defenceless minorities. One viral video clip shows radical Islamist lunatics inspecting the genitals of a murdered man, possibly lynched to death, and expressing satisfaction that he was a Hindu.\n\nA particularly poignant graphic has been shared on X (formerly Twitter) by Radharamn Das, the vice-president and spokesperson of Iskcon Kolkata, depicting a human figure hanged till death superimposed on the national flag of Bangladesh, with a hashtag #SaveBangladeshiHindus.\n\nAt this hour of crisis, minorities in Bangladesh need all the support they can get. In a final act of travesty, Leftists and 'liberals' in India - who fashion themselves as defenders of minority rights - instead of raising their voice and calling for an end to the persecution and slaughter, are resorting to either false equivalence or blatant denial of the pogrom.\n\nThis motley group, that sheds liberal tears over the 'state of minorities' in India - even though on all parameters minority population is thriving in India - have kept their eyes wide shut on the plight of Hindus across the border, and are busy propagating the myth of a 'secular revolution'.\n\nThese liberal elites, many of whom are Hindu by religion, would rather submit to the street veto of violent Islamists to buy peace. They frame themselves as Islam-adjacent, propagate a faux secularism that places the burden of civil amity solely at the doorstep of Hindus and undermine their own religiosity and culture in the hope of an elusive compact with Islamist radicals.\n\nIn a monstrous act of moral turpitude, liberal elites who still command an outsized narrative control over India's public discourse, are playing down or whitewashing the bigotry of the violent Islamists solely because the victims are Hindu.\n\nThey are twisting themselves into gordian knots to deny the reality that a religiously motivated violence is taking place next door, that has forced even the European Union (EU) to come out with a statement, and liberals' sole motto seems to be to somehow prove that the nature of the 'liberation movement' is still \"secular\".\n\nViolence against Hindus in Bangladesh is baked into the very nature of the country that emerged from the seismic throes of the Partition. According to Minority Rights Group, an NGO, the official 1951 census for East Pakistan put the number of Hindus at 22 per cent of the total population of the province. This number has depleted to 15 per cent in 1991 and in the 2011 census, Hindus dwindled to just 8.5 per cent of Bangladesh population.\n\nDespite a history of ethnic cleansing and sexual violence against Hindu women - exceptionally severely during the Bangladesh Liberation war when the Hindu community was subjected to targeted executions, brutalisation of women in rape camps - it takes brazen hypocrisy to deny the possibility of history repeating itself.\n\nThe anti-Hindu attitude is so ingrained in the psyche of this cabal that their members are ready to reject even overwhelming evidence of atrocities in social and tradition media, preferring instead to bury their collective heads deep into the sands of delusion. In their minds, Hindus cannot be the victims. Muslims, even when they are the aggressors, retain exclusive victimhood rights.\n\nTherefore, Indian TV channels that are airing reports of targeted violence are apparently not trustworthy according to some, while for some they are running fake narratives.\n\nRegardless of their denial, the vengeful violence against Hindus, who are perceived to be supporters of the fallen Sheikha Hasina's Awami League, has got wide coverage in local and international media. The violence started as soon as Hasina fled on Monday and even as protestors were celebrating her ouster.\n\nNews agency AFP quoted Rana Dasgupta, who leads an organisation representing minorities in Bangladesh, as saying that houses and shops of minority people were attacked, vandalised and looted in \"at least 97 places on Monday and Tuesday\" and \"at least 10 Hindu temples\" were attacked by Monday.\n\nAmong the temples targeted, desecrated and burnt to cinders are Iskcon temple in Meherpur, Khulna. Spokesperson Yudhistir Govinda Das was quoted, as saying in Indian media outlets that deities of Lord Jagannath, Baladev, and Subhadra Devi were burnt and three devotees somehow managed to escape.\n\nOthers were not so lucky. Local councillor of Awami League Haradhan Roy and his nephew were lynched to death. The grab from a Telegram channel bearing the name of Islami Chhatra Shibir, the student wing of Jamaat-e-Islami, carried the image of deceased men and a chilling message, relaying that 13 Hindu houses and three temples in Rangpur have been \"set on fire\" and \"even one Hindu child cannot be left out\". The post was shared by Sanjeev Sanyal, the EAC to prime minister of India, albeit in his personal capacity, with a line saying: \"As a Bengali Hindu and a descendant of refugees, find this particularly chilling.\"\n\nAccording to The Daily Star, a Bangladeshi newspaper, Hindu houses and businesses were attacked and looted in 27 districts on Monday, including the sub-districts of Lalmonirhat Sadar, Kaliganj, Hatibandha, Sadar, Dinajpur district, Khansama, Khulna, Barishal, Patuakhali, Sherpur, Narsingdi, Noakhali and Narail, among others.\n\n\"There are no areas or districts left where communal attacks have not taken place. We're continuously getting reports from different parts of the country about attacks on houses and business establishments... They're crying, saying they are being beaten up, and their houses and businesses are being looted. What is our fault? Is it our fault that we are citizens of the country?\", asked a desperate Monindra Kumar Nath, senior joint general secretary of the Oikya Parishad (unity council) in quotes carried by The Daily Star.\n\nReligious persecution of Hindus in Bangladesh is systemic, part of documented history and praxis. The scourge intensified in the last few years. According to 'Ain o Salish Kendra', a human rights group, at least 3,679 attacks took place on the Hindu community between January 2013 and September 2021, including vandalism, arson and targeted violence, reported BBC.\n\nThat the student-led quota agitation will so quickly turn into persecution and pogrom against Hindus should have perhaps been anticipated.\n\nThe warning shots were fired when the Hasina government on August 1 banned Jamaat, a subcontinental version of the Muslim Brotherhood that has an exclusivist Islamist vision for the world, a history of violence against Hindus and secularists, and is singularly responsible for radicalisation of Bangladeshi polity. Jamaat, whose registration was cancelled by the country's Supreme Court in 2013, wasn't going to walk into the sunset.\n\nThe decision to ban the Islamist organization and its student wing, Islami Chhatra Shibir, under anti-terrorism law following weeks of anti-quota stir and violence in which hundreds were killed essentially tipped the scale against the Hasina government.\n\nThere were two reasons. One, Jamaat, believed to be backed by Pakistani intelligence agency, ISI, pulls greater popular weight than its ally, former PM Khaleda Zia's BNP. It had been the driving force behind the orgy of violence that shook Bangladesh since July.\n\nSecond, and a deeper reason was that the student stir, that gave a layer of legitimacy to the so-called 'liberation movement' against Hasina's heavy-handed rule, can be traced back to the key role played by Islami Chhatra Shibir cadres who had managed to infiltrate influential Universities and educational institutions, from where the instigations for a student-led movement against Hasina's Awami League government took off. The movement wasn't as organic as we have been led to believe.\n\nAccording to India Today, \"the main centres of the Islami Chhatra Shibir are Dhaka University, Chittagong University, Jahangir University, Sylhet University, and Rajshahi University. In fact, all the student organisations that won university elections in the last three years won with the support of Islami Chatra Shibir.\"\n\nBangladeshi newspaper The Daily Star reported, quoting campus sources, that \"Shibir members started to take positions at Chattogram Government College and Government Mohsin College on Monday evening, just hours after the government's ouster.\" They were joined by Jatiotabadi Chatra Dal, another front organisation, who took control of Chittagong University halls. The plan was set in motion.\n\nThis partly explains why the celebration over Hasina's ouster quickly turned to anarchy and opportunistic pogrom against the Hindus. First, the cops bore the brunt of retaliatory violence. By evening on Monday, various police stations were set on fire by angry mobs bent on revenge, with several policemen either burnt alive or breathing their last in hospitals. At least 29 police stations were attacked all over the country, arms and ammunitions looted while law enforcement personnel fled for their lives, leaving stations unmanned.\n\nIn this administrative void, horrific violence was unleashed against the Hindu minorities and their places of worship.\n\nThe BBC reported, quoting Avirup Sarkar, a Bangladeshi Hindu, that mobs were making lists of Hindu properties to be attacked. Sarkar's cousin lives in Netrokona, where a \"mob of about 100 people, armed with sticks, stormed the house, smashing furniture, TV, bathroom fittings and doors. Before leaving, they took all the cash and jewellery...\" They left with a warning that \"You people are descendants of the Awami League! This country is in a bad shape because of you. You should leave the country.\"\n\nNew York Times quoted Prionthi Chatterjee, a Hindu student in Dhaka, as saying that \"Muslims had attacked her family at their home in the southern Bagerhat region, killing her father and leaving her mother with head injuries. 'My father was an innocent teacher,' she said in a phone interview, adding that her parents tried to call the army and the police for help but that no one responded.\"<\n\nReuters reported that 200-300 mainly Hindu homes and businesses had been vandalised since Monday, and 15-20 Hindu temples damaged. The nationwide vandalism and that caused destruction to numerous moments, statues, including that of founding father Sheikh Mujibur Rahman, artefacts, and cultural institutions didn't spare even noted personalities.\n\nPopular Bangladeshi folk singer Rahul Anand's residence, a vibrant cultural hub that was visited by French president Emmanuel Macron, was torched, valuable musical instruments burnt to cinders. The singer somehow managed to escape with his family members.\n\nWhat I have painstakingly recounted for you, dear readers, is just a slice. Hindu students who had taken part in the movement against Hasina's 'autocratic rule', now feel betrayed by their colleagues, crying out for help.\n\nThe betrayal cuts deep.\n\nOne Dhaka university ex-student, Nilay Kumar Biswas, a Hindu, was quoted by Deep Halder in The Print, as saying, \"Many Hindus were there in the protests... It was not just about quota reforms then, but an overhaul of the entire system. But today, as communal riots have broken out against Hindus everywhere, the Bangladeshi Hindu is asking a simple question to her fellow citizens: Is this not our country also?\"\n\nEven as I type this column late into Wednesday night/ early Thursday morning, reports from fellow journalists are pouring in on social media of armed robbery at midnight by Islamist thugs. A sense of helplessness and abandonment pervades as no police or army are in sight.\n\nAnd yet amid this desperate tragedy and undeniable evidence of carnage at a mass scale, our liberals are plumbing newer depths of duplicity. Some are posting purported images of Muslims \"guarding\" temples and virtue-signalling over it without caring to explain whom are they \"guarding\" it from.\n\nSome are claiming that attacks on Hindus are \"isolated\", \"exaggerated\", or just a \"spin\" by Hindu right wing in India.\n\nThe liberal anxiety and resultant attempt at coverup of Muslim atrocities against minority Hindus arise from a position of insecurity. Their fear lies in the fact an honest acknowledgement of the truth may lend credibility to the voices of Dharmics and Hindu Nationalists who are pointing to the ethnic cleansing across the border, and that in turn may lead to Hindu political mobilisation in India, which the liberals are desperate to prevent.\n\nTheir political survival and sway over power depend on the fracturing of Hindu unity along the lines of caste and creed - the strategy that has been successfully employed by Congress party, the representative of the ancien r\u00e9gime in the recently concluded general elections. Any political consolidation of Hindu votes, albeit over an issue that originates from across the border, is a further blow to their waning influence. Hence the reflexive need to jump on to any narrative where the Muslim can be portrayed as the victim, and the equally reflexive playing down of atrocities when Hindus are under attack from Islamists.\n\nThe final stamp of liberalism is earned by paying obeisance to an Islamist cause.

She has taken refuge in Hindu-majority India.\n\nIndian intelligence officials said on Tuesday they believe the protests, which were ostensibly about the quota system for government jobs in Bangladesh, were orchestrated by China and Pakistan to install a government more amenable to China's ambitions, and more hostile to India.\n\nThese Indian officials accused Pakistan's infamous ISI intelligence service of working with Islamist groups in Bangladesh, which is about 90 percent Muslim. Islam is the state religion of Bangladesh, which broke away from Pakistan in a revolutionary war in 1971.\n\nHasina hails from a prominent Muslim family but was friendly to India, where she lived during the 1970s. She spent years exiled in India after her father, Sheikh Mujibur Rahman -- the \"father\" and first president of independent Bangladesh -- was assassinated along with most of his family in 1975.\n\nThe BBC on Tuesday regretfully described Hasina as a \"pro-democracy icon who became an autocrat.\" Bangladesh flourished economically under her administration, in no small part due to good relations with India. She signed a major water-sharing deal with India soon after coming to power in a popular uprising against a military junta, and it was unquestionably a boon for Bangladesh, but over time her critics accused her of giving India too much sway over government policies.\n\nHasina unquestionably became more ruthless in dealing with her opponents over the past few years, and they were ruth\n\nless in turn. She waged a bitter feud with rival Khaleda Zia of the Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP), the duo earning the sobriquet of \"battling begums\" - begum being a term for high-ranking Muslim women. Khaleda was actually the first female prime minister of Bangladesh, having won the office in 1991 with the help of Islamic groups.\n\nThe two begums have taken turns tossing each other in jail over the years, and when Khaleda's second term as prime minister was terminated by a military coup in 2006, the junta threw both of them in prison. Each has accused the other of corruption and tyranny.\n\nKhaleda's allies were accused of attempting to assassinate Hasina in 2004 by lobbing hand grenades into a political rally, killing more than 20 people. Khaleda's son was tried in absentia and sentenced to life in prison for organizing the attack.\n\nThe BHBCUC said on Tuesday that Hasina's ouster appears to have unleashed years of simmering Muslim anger at the Hindu minority, most of whom belong to Hasina's political party, the Awami League.\n\n\"The communal atrocities erupted hours before she resigned. Although there is no killing, there is injury. Houses and businesses of minorities, especially Hindus, as well as temples, have been targeted, looted, damaged,\" BHBCUC general secretary Rana Dasgupta said.\n\nDasgupta said he was personally assaulted by an unidentified individual who threw a brick at his car on Monday.\n\n\"I stand against communal atrocities and will not stop. Until my death, I shall fight for them. I may not be able to physically protect them, but I can give them courage. I may not be able to resist attacks, but I can protest,\" he said.\n\n\"The situation is horrific,\" added fellow Hindu community leader Manindra Kumar Nath. \"Even today, we are getting calls from people asking us to save their lives, but we are not receiving any support from anywhere.\"\n\nA Hindu named Avirup Sarkar told the BBC on Tuesday that his cousin in Bangladesh was menaced by a mob that \"attacked\" and \"plundered\" her home.\n\n\"You people are descendants of the Awami League! This country is in a bad shape because of you. You should leave the country!\" Sarkar said the mob shouted at his cousin and other Hindus.\n\nSarkar said some of his family's properties have been spared, apparently because they were not on the revenge lists drafted by Muslim groups in their neighborhood, but dozens of other homes have been attacked and Hindu shops looted.\n\n\"Bangladeshi Hindus are an easy target. Every time the Awami League loses power, they are attacked,\" he said.\n\nSarkar added a note of appreciation for Muslims in Bangladesh who have \"protected Hindu properties\" from the mobs.\n\nBangladeshi folk singer Rahul Ananda said on Wednesday he narrowly escaped injury with his wife and son when his home in Dhaka was sacked and burned by a mob. A source within his family said the mob \"took everything from furniture and mirrors to valuables,\" then \"torched the house\" along with the famed singer's musical instruments.\n\nAnanda's friends and fellow musicians said his home was also his studio, a landmark for Hindus, and a major cultural hub for Bangladesh. They said the musical instruments burned by the mob truly belonged to \"all young musicians\" in Bangladesh.\n\nIndian Foreign Minister S Jaishankar said on Tuesday it was \"particularly worrying\" that \"minorities, their businesses and temples also came under attack at multiple locations.\"\n\nJaishankar said most of the 9,000 Indian exchange students living in Bangladesh have returned home due to the protests. Roughly 19,000 Indian nationals currently live in Bangladesh.\n\nIndia's The Print on Tuesday said Hasina sealed her own fate by submitting to Islamists, granting them \"vast amounts of land and huge sums of wealth to enable the building of more madrassas,\" even as she cultivated an image as a progressive champion opposed to Islamic fundamentalism.\n\nThe Print chided Hasina for allowing \"hundreds of Islamic preachers who were anti-women and anti-Hindus to indoctrinate young people,\" permitting Hindu authors to be \"erased from school textbooks,\" and silencing \"free thinkers\" who \"critically scrutinized Islam.\"\n\nIn short, the argument was that Hasina made too many concessions to Islamists, creating the social and academic environment that would eventually erupt against her, and that could now shift Bangladesh's alignment away from India and toward Pakistan and its ally China.", "source": {"uri": "breitbart.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Breitbart"}, "authors":

As thousands of protesters celebrated her ouster that afternoon, reports began to emerge of retaliation against members of Ms. Hasina's party, the Awami League, and against those seen as her allies, including the Hindu minority.\n\nIn addition to the party's offices and the homes of its members, the rioters targeted Hindus, torching their homes and vandalizing temples, according to witnesses and local media. Fears of more attacks were amplified in the absence of a government and with law enforcement retreating from sight in many parts of the country.\n\nIn addition to the almost 300 people killed during the government crackdown, at least 60 were killed in the violence that erupted on Monday in Muslim-majority Bangladesh. Reliable details about the attackers and victims were not immediately available.\n\nPrionthi Chatterjee, a Hindu student in Dhaka, the capital, said Muslims had attacked her family at their home in the southern Bagerhat region, killing her father and leaving her mother with head injuries.\n\n\"My father was an innocent teacher,\" she said in a phone interview, adding that her parents tried to call the army and the police for help but that no one responded. Details about the episode could not be independently verified.\n\nThere were attacks on the homes of Hindus and their temples in at least four districts of Bangladesh, including villages near Chattogram, the country's second-most-populous city, according to witnesses and the relatives of people whose properties were targeted.\n\nThe student groups that led the protests against Ms. Hasina acknowledged the violence but suggested their supporters were not involved.\n\n\"Temples are being attacked, vandalized and looted,\" Nahid Islam, one of the student leaders, said in a statement on Tuesday, blaming the attacks on those who want to \"destroy\" the student movement.\n\nRana Das Gupta, who leads an organization of Bangladesh's religious minorities, said attacks toward Hindus had resulted in at least two deaths and more than 100 injured.\n\n\"Some of those whose homes were attacked may be directly involved in Awami League politics, but most are ordinary Hindus,\" he said. \"Therefore, this is definitely communal and targeted violence.\"\n\nThe president of Bangladesh, who holds a mostly ceremonial role, on Tuesday appointed the Nobel Peace Prize-winning microfinance pioneer Muhammad Yunus to lead an interim government. Its members are expected to be announced within days.\n\nRestoring law and order will be one of the interim government's immediate challenges.\n\nDuring her 15 years in power, Ms. Hasina packed the police and the military with loyal officers, and public trust in law enforcement appeared to all but vanish during the violent crackdown against the protesters.\n\nOn Wednesday in Dhaka, no police officers were visible on the streets in some of the busiest areas.\n\nMeenakshi Ganguly, the deputy director for Asia at Human Rights Watch, described the reports of violence against Hindus as \"extremely concerning.\"\n\n\"Hindus are apparently being attacked because they traditionally supported her Awami League party. Bangladeshis came out on the streets to demand an end to authoritarianism, and these attacks undermine their just demand for human rights,\" she said in a statement.\n\nTensions between Muslims and Hindus in Bangladesh have boiled over in the past, including violent clashes across the country in 2021.", "source": {"uri": "dnyuz.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "DNyuz"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hindus", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Hindus"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prime_minister", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Prime minister"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bangladesh", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Bangladesh"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Bangladesh"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sheikh_Hasina", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Sheikh Hasina"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Awami_League", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Awami League"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Temple", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Temple"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nazi_Germany", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Nazi Germany"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muslims", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Muslims"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Districts_of_Bangladesh", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Districts of Bangladesh"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bagerhat_District", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Bagerhat District"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Bagerhat District"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Bangladesh"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chittagong", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Chittagong"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Chittagong"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Bangladesh"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dhaka", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Dhaka"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Dhaka"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Bangladesh"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rana_dynasty", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Rana dynasty"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Provisional_government", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Provisional government"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/President_of_Bangladesh", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "President of Bangladesh"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muhammad_Yunus", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Muhammad Yunus"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microfinance", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Microfinance"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_Rights_Watch", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Human Rights Watch"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Authoritarianism", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Authoritarianism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asia", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Asia"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Islam", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Islam"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_rights", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Human rights"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Terrorism", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Terrorism", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Warfare_and_Conflict", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Warfare and Conflict", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Crime_and_Justice", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Crime and Justice", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Victims", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Victims", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Death/Suicide", "label": "dmoz/Society/Death/Suicide", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 70}], "image": "https://dnyuz.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/Hindus-in-Bangladesh-Face-Revenge-Attacks-After-Prime-Ministers-Exit.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9792869", "eventUri": "eng-9792869", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.3098039215686275, "wgt": 154, "relevance": 1}

These have come after the fall of the Sheikh Hasina-led government in Dhaka following months of large scale protests. The country's Hindu population are generally considered to be supporters of Hasina's Awami League - which now faces significant unpopularity in the country. Hindus form the largest minority in the country and make up around 8 percent of Bangladesh's population. Periodic violence against minority groups have been a feature of Bangladesh's politics since its independence in 1971.\n\nThe attacks on Bangladesh's Hindu community have attracted criticism and concern across the political spectrum in India. On Thursday, the Hindu Jagran Manch led a rally in Kolkata to protest the violence\n\n\"We are engaged with authorities in Dhaka. We have an evolving situation before us.

An International Society for Krishna Consciousness (ISCKON) temple in Meherpur, based in Bangladesh's Khulna division was vandalized and set on fire amid the unrest.\n\nAccording to a spokesperson of the ISCKON, not only did the mob vandalize the temple but burnt deities of Lord Jagannath, Baladev, and Subhadra Devi.\n\nMeanwhile, three devotees who lived in the center somehow managed to escape and survived, he added.\n\nKajol Debnath, leader of the Hindu Buddhist Christian Unity Council, told news agency PTI that at least four Hindu temples were targeted on Monday and suffered minor damages.\n\nThe Indira Gandhi cultural centre, located in capital city Dhaka, also came under attack by the unruly mob and was burnt. The cultural centre, named after former Indian Prime Minister Indira Gandhi, promoted cultural exchange between India and Bangladesh.\n\nChaotic scenes were witnessed as the miscreants attacked and burnt the residence of Mashrafe Mortaza, ex-captain of the Bangladesh cricket team, as suggested by The Dhaka Tribune.

In 2021, after the visit of Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi to the country, several Islamist extremists attacked several temples across the country as they accused the former of 'discriminating' against Muslims in India. In addition, former Bangladesh PM Haseena has been accused of being ' extremely close' to India, leading to conflicts and disagreements within the country.\n\nThe 2022 census report suggest that Hindus constitute 7.95% of the total population, as against 8.54% and 9.60% in 2011 and 2001 respectively.\n\nThe attack on Hindus in the neighbouring country also poses a challenge for India as it is highly expected that the people belonging to the Hindu community might seek shelter in India following the violence against them. In the wake of the growing tensions in Bangladesh, the Border Security Force (BSF) in India issued an alert across the bordering villages and localities on Monday.\n\nFormer Prime Minister Sheikh Haseena on Monday resigned from her post and left the country under massive pressure from the protestors. The anti-government protests, which later turned violent, begun as a call for the abolition of the quota system for civil services jobs which provided for 30% reservation to the veterans of the 1971 Bangladesh war.\n\nHaseena arrived in India soon after tendering her resignation. Several reports have suggested that she would be flying to London, UK.\n\nMeanwhile, the Anti-Discrimination Students Movement have recommended an interim government in Bangladesh led by Nobel

becoming victims of persecution in Bangladesh.\n\n\"The RSS expresses deep concern over the incidents of violence against Hindus, Buddhists and other minority communities in Bangladesh amid a movement

on places of worship like temples are intolerable and the RSS strongly condemns these incidents,\" he said.\n\nHosabale said it is expected from the executive government of Bangladesh that it strictly

In the ensuing power vacuum, these extremist groups have intensified their attacks on the Hindu minority, unleashing a wave of terror that includes burning homes, abducting women, and widespread violence. Hasina, who escaped to India aboard a military aircraft, is reportedly contemplating seeking asylum in the United Kingdom. However, her son, Sajeeb Wazed Joy, has dismissed these claims, asserting that she has no intentions of returning to Bangladesh either.\n\n'Getting death threats': Bangladeshi Hindu woman's heart-wrenching video amid genocide claims surfaces | WATCH\n\nMeanwhile, 'All eyes on Bangladesh Hindus' is trending on social media, where netizens are slamming Bollywood celebrities for their silence on attacks on Hindus and temples in Bangladesh. They previously showed their support for Rafah in southern Gaza, where 45 people died and over 200 were left injured after an Israeli airstrike. Celebrities like Priyanka Chopra, Varun Dhawan, Alia Bhatt, Samantha Ruth Prabhu, Tripti Dimri, and Richa Chadha, had posted on their social media, 'All eyes on Rafah'. However, no celebrities have come forward to condemn attacks on Hindus in Bangladesh violence, which is being severely criticised by netizens.\n\nA troubling video went viral showing a Bangladeshi Hindu woman pleading for safety, highlighting the dire situation faced by minority communities in Bangladesh. The emotional footage depicts her distress as she describes her home being vandalized by self-proclaimed revolutionaries and receiving death threats urging her family to escape to India.\n\nSheikh Hasina's ties with India are deeply rooted in her personal history, dating back to the 1975 turmoil in Bangladesh when the Indira Gandhi government provided her with sanctuary after her family, including her father Mujibur Rahman, was tragically assassinated. Given this longstanding connection, forsaking her at this juncture would be a complex decision, taking into account her established rapport with the Indian capital.\n\nOn Sunday, violence reached a tragic peak with clashes causing hundreds of deaths, including that of Haradhan Roy, a Hindu councillor and member of the Parshuram Thana Awami League. The escalating conflict between protesters calling for Hasina's resignation and government supporters has led to the imposition of an indefinite curfew and a suspension of internet connectivity.",

An ISKCON temple, a Kali Mandir, and homes of Hindus are among them.\n\n\"Hindu councillor Haradhan Roy was also murdered by protesters,\" said a source. \"The home of celebrated musician Rahul Ananda was looted and torched. In a very systematic way, radicals have burnt the Indira Gandhi Cultural Centre and Bangabandhu Memorial Museum.\"\n\nFormer Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina fled the country in a military aircraft and landed in India on Monday as the army stepped in to fill the power vacuum after long-running protests against job quotas boiled over.\n\nBangladesh has seen nearly 4,000 attacks against its Hindu community since January 2013, said the sources.\n\n\"These are systematic attacks with one mindset and keeping two things in mind -- attacks on Hindus by Islamists, and Hindus are close to Sheikh Hasina because of her proximity to India. Ongoing communal violence after Hasina's departure is not spontaneous but deliberate and well-orchestrated,\" a source said.\n\nIt has been found, said the sources, that multiple factors have played an important role in these constant attacks.\n\n\"The inaction of the state agencies is because they have decided to let this continue for some time. Now the Islamist groups have found a reason to attack Hindus that Indian policies are anti-Muslim and we have a reason to attack Hindus,\" a source said.\n\nTop intelligence officials believe these attacks are nothing but an act of terror, which was controlled by Hasina.\n\n\"Now these attackers have an open agenda which the state will also sponsor for a long time so that more negotiations can happen or they can give a handle to the international community. This will increase more in the days to come because of Saudi money for radical Islam, and also many Bangladeshis have gone to West Asia after the oil boom.

On Monday, the prime minister fled the country, leaving Bangladesh rudderless.\n\nBut even after successfully overthrowing the regime, the bottled-up anger against the dictatorial Awami League government continues to spill out in violent episodes. This may not come as a complete surprise, since violence of some kind is the inevitable aftermath of any uprising, Bangladesh is no exception.\n\nConsequently, we have witnessed the storming and ransacking of the Ganabhaban, the official residence of the prime minister, arson attacks on Awami League leaders' homes, the vandalisation of public and government properties, and the destruction of statues murals, including those that depict Sheikh Mujibur Rahman, the founding figure of Bangladesh.\n\nOne of the most disconcerting developments is the attacks on minorities, especially Hindus, in more than 27 districts. Hindus are the largest religious minority in Bangladesh, constituting around 8% of the population according to the 2022 census.\n\nMany Hindus in Bangladesh have family in the Indian state of West Bengal. News of attacks on Hindus in Bangladesh have created tension among family and relatives in India, and many seem to believe that with the Awami League gone, radical Islamists have taken control over Bangladesh. In India, the Hindutva propaganda machinery within the sections of Indian media, along with various kinds of rumour and misinformation, has exacerbated this apprehension.\n\nBut why are the Hindus being targeted now?\n\nThere are two very different developments in this regard. While there have been attacks, there have also been several instances in which Muslims have sat guard in front of temples, churches and other places of workshop. Most people do not wish to see violence and they do not wish their minority community brethren to come to any harm.\n\nWe also need to acknowledge that attacks happen and to understand why. There are three interrelated reasons for Hindus and Hindu religious institutions being targeted. First, there are no instances of revolutions without spillovers. Uprisings unfortunately include radical elements that threaten the original intention of the revolution.\n\nThe deliberate massacre of the protesting students by the Hasina government infused unprecedented sympathy for the students and transformed the agitation into a mass movement. As it expanded, contacts and networks of opposition parties such as Bangladesh Nationalist Party and radical Jamaat-e-Islami naturally joined in. Or perhaps they were always part of the movement.\n\nCertainly, their networks and established leaders and activists were instrumental in the later stages of the uprising as evidenced by the fact that they were at the army general's table talking about the country's future a mere hour after Hasina had fled Bangladesh.\n\nThere is little doubt that sections of the Islamists, including Jamaat-e-Islami and Hefazat-e-Islam, and other far-right elements are trying to exploit the opportunity. This is an chance to reassert themselves as being engaged in political movements.\n\nSecond, while worrying reports are pouring in about attacks on Hindus, it is important to remember that most Hindus have long been in favour of the Awami League. They believe that it is more secular than the Bangladesh Nationalist Party, the country's other large party. While only a few Hindus have secured important positions within the Awami League government, including as members of parliament, Hindus in general have come to be marked as a loyal Awami League support base.\n\nConsequently, these Hindus are being targeted by sections of violent mob determined to exterminate anything remotely associated with the Awami League's dictatorial regime.\n\nThird, the Hindus as a group in Bangladesh are vulnerable, in the same way as many other groups are vulnerable: women, tribal, and the poor, those without networks. Although we do not know the background for the individual arson attacks, it is likely that individuals and groups with ambitions, grievances or schemes to take over land use the opportunity of lawlessness that has suddenly arisen to loot for the sake of loot, to intimidate landholders, including temple land, to settle old scores or simply to show who is the boss.\n\nRight now, there is no police and in many places no real authority. Crimes are likely to go unpunished. Hindus in rich neighbourhoods are less likely to be targeted because they are protected by networks and wealth. But those who live in the outskirts or away from the metropolis are less fortunate.\n\nWere Hindus safer during the Awami League regime?\n\nA quick look at facts and reports suggests otherwise. Since assuming power in 2009, Awami League presided over a period marked by numerous incidents against vulnerable minority communities, particularly the Hindus. According to Ain O Salish Kendra, over 3,710 incidents targeting the Hindus were reported between January 2013 and September 2021, with many instances involving the complicity of Awami League leaders in acts of vandalism.\n\nRana Dasgupta, the General Secretary of the Bangladesh Hindu Buddhist Christian Oikya Parishad, told the Daily Star, \"It is unfortunate that the majority of grassroots leaders of the ruling Awami League are also seen joining them in the attacks.\"\n\nLand appropriation from marginalised Hindu communities has been particularly noticeable. In 2016, rights activists and leaders from the Hindu community confirmed that figures affiliated with the Awami League, including party members and ministers, were implicated in the illegal seizure of land belonging to community members.\n\nAt the time of writing, Bangladesh is constitutionally without a government, the police is in hiding and political authority is non-existent in much of the country. Individuals and groups will see this as an opportunity for gain or to settle grievances. But caution is warranted about reading this as an indication of a larger and darker political development in Bangladesh.\n\nNiladri Chatterjee is a historian and researcher, University of Oslo,

Reports of Hindu temples being demolished, and their houses being burnt are coming from Bangladesh. Amid this turmoil in India's neighbourhood, West Bengal BJP leader Suvendu Adhikari has claimed that more than 1 crore Hindus are coming to West Bengal soon amid the violence.\n\nIndia's refugee concern\n\nApart from this, the BJP leader has appealed to both Chief Minister of West Bengal Mamata Banerjee and the Governor CV Anand Bose to talk to the central government in this issue. He said that the Government of India should give citizenship to all these people under CAA.\n\nEven the Tipra Motha founder Pradyot Debbarma expressed concern over reports of attacks on minorities and indigenous tribes in Bangladesh following Hasina's exit. Debbarma hopes that India will take up the issue with whoever takes over the interim government in Bangladesh.\n\nThere is a need to pay heed to Adhikari's warning as the condition of Hindus has been deplorable in Bangladesh and in the last few years the population of Hindus which was about 22 per cent in 1951 has down to about 8.50 per cent. The main reasons for this are religious persecution and economic marginalisation. It may be noted that 7.95 per cent of the population of Bangladesh belongs to the Hindu community and in terms of numbers, there are over one crore, 31 lakh Hindus in the country.\n\nHindus being persecuted in Bangladesh\n\nAfter the coup in Bangladesh the radical Islamic groups have started atrocities in the homes of Hindus and Border Guards Bangladesh (BGB) deployed on the border are lathi-charging Hindus trying to flee to India and pushing them back. Border Security Force (BSF) personnel standing on the Indian border are unable to help them. Amid the chaos in Bangladesh Hindu minority community living in Bangladesh have already started reaching various borders to save their lives but are not being allowed to enter India by BGB. Under these circumstances, India will have to act to save the Hindus from further atrocities in Bangladesh.\n\nMoreover, crisis in Bangladesh has increased India's concern which shares a border of about 4,100 km with Bangladesh and which passes through five states of India. India and Bangladesh have been historically, culturally and economically linked and India even played a major role in the formation of Bangladesh from East Pakistan in 1971. However, Sheikh Hasina's exit will now increase challenges for India as, after massive prosecution, the Hindu population will want to come to India to take refuge.\n\nAdditionally, the influx of refugees will lead to difficulties in West Bengal which shares a border with Bangladesh. Mamata Banarjee is already worried with the possibility of this influx of refugees as she fears that her state might see violence as the refugee impact.\n\nSpeaking about the attack on Hindus, spiritual leader Sadhguru took to X and posted, \"The atrocities being perpetrated against Hindus is not just an internal matter of #Bangladesh. Bharat cannot be Maha-Bharat if we do not stand up and act at the earliest to ensure the safety of minorities in our neighborhood. What was part of this Nation, unfortunately, became neighbourhood, but it is our responsibility to protect these people -who actually belong to this Civilization- from these shocking atrocities.\"\n\nRefugees and related problems\n\nThe crisis means India will have to open its doors for Hindu refugees which in turn lead to economic burden on the states where they are given shelter. A balance will be needed to address the needs of both the refugees and the locals. Then the law and order situation will also be need to be addressed as the locals will not take it easily the influx of refugees as they will have to share their space and also resources with them.\n\nAs far as West Bengal is concerned it has been hosting refugees since a long time and this has even changed its demographic structure. Over the years these refugees have settled in India and some have even got proper Indian IDs for themselves and started calling the shots in our electoral process in states like West Bengal. The TMC government has been very kind to these refugees as it served its purpose as they have become a strong vote bank.\n\nNow with Hindu refugees arriving in West Bengal, the demography will change once again. How the Mamata led TMC takes this will be interesting to watch.\n\nAs for the Modi government, giving refuge to the numerous Hindus who are facing attacks in Bangladesh will be a compulsion as they have nowhere to go. How the government takes up this challenge only time will tell, but before that India will have to see how to settle this vulnerable Hindu population and provide them immediate relief. Another big task for the government will be to see that only the harassed Hindus enter as refugees while the people trying to destabilise India do not get a chance to infiltrate the country in the guise of refugees.", "source": {"uri": "news9live.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "News9live"}, "authors": [{"uri": "kavita_pant@news9live.com", "name": "Kavita Pant", "type": "author", "isAgency":

Earlier, the headline read \"Hindus in Bangladesh Face Revenge Attacks After Prime Minister's Exit\" which attracted heavy criticism on social media.\n\nIn the report, NYT asserted that Hindus were under attack as they were seen as \"allies\" of Sheikh Hasina's political party Awami League. While the media house acknowledged that Hindus were being targeted in the Muslim-dominating country, they attempted to whitewash the communal angle to it by saying Hindus were under attack for supporting Hasina. So much so, they also quoted a student leader Nahid Islam stating the attack on Hindus was being done by those who want to \"destroy\" the student movement.\n\nHuman Rights Watch also pushed the same narrative. Meenakshi Ganguly, deputy director for Asia at Human Rights Watch said, \"Hindus are being attacked because they traditionally supported her Awami League party. Bangladeshis came out on the streets to demand an end to authoritarianism, and these attacks undermine their just demand for human rights.\"\n\nLater the media house quietly changed the headline to \"Hindus in Bangladesh Face Attacks After Prime Minister's Exit\"\n\nThough the title has been changed, the content remained the same, pushing the narrative that Hindus were being targeted as they supported Hasina's political party and not because of communal reasons.\n\nNYT's blatant attempt to push false narrative whitewashing communal angle in attack on Hindus was criticised extensively on social media. Author Abhinav Agarwal said, \"If there is a genocide to whitewash, mass murders to defend, pedophiles to protect, the venerable New York Times can be relied upon.\"\n\nJournalist Swati Goel Sharma wrote on X, \"Imagine what the ground situation must be that even New York Times has published a report today on targeted attacks against Hindus in Bangladesh? Protesters who helped oust Hasina have been quoted saying \"ordinary Hindus\", and not just Awami League leaders, are facing attacks on their lives, homes and temples. This, when daily exodus of Hindus from Bangladesh has only increased over the decades. Shame on everyone who tried to whitewash communal atrocities against Hindus In Bangladesh just because the mobs are also targeting Muslim Awami leaders and policemen. The bloodshed will hopefully end soon, but eradication of Hindus from Bangladesh will not. Like in Pakistan, the world would silently watch.\"\n\nX user Bala said, \"New York Times has reported the Genocide of Bangladeshi Hindus as 'Revenge Attacks.' NYT is trying to whitewash the killings of Hindus as attacks against supporters of Sheikh Hasina.\"\n\nAUthor Abhishek Banerjee said, \"For New York Times, attack on Hindus in Bangladesh is not persecution. It is \"revenge\". Revenge for what? A \"perception\" that Hindus supported Sheikh Hasina in elections... This is 1930s Nazi level stuff from New York Times.\"\n\nX user Anshul Saxena said, \"The New York Times justified the attacks on Hindus in Bangladesh by calling them \"revenge attacks.\" Now, a narrative is being created that Hindus are culprits, so they deserve this, while those carrying out the attacks are being whitewashed. This is international media for you.\"\n\nAdvocate Ishkaran Singh Bhandari said, \"New York Times justification for GENOCIDE OF HINDUS IN BANGLADESH! The Globalist's have no value nor belief in Human Rights for Hindu. That's why CAA, that's why Bharat should do whatever it can to protect.\"\n\nOn 5th August, it came to light that Islamists attacked Hindus' houses, shops and temples in Bangladesh in the guise of protests against the Sheikh Hasina government.

In his message, Modi emphasized the critical need to restore normalcy in the country and protect the Hindu minority community, which has faced increased threats amid recent unrest.\n\nThe recent videos and photos that went viral on the internet depicting the atrocities against Hindus in Bangladesh are heartbreaking. Even the ISKCON temple, which distributed free prasadam daily under the leadership of Srila Prabhupada during Bangladesh's severe crisis, was attacked. Despite their generosity and lack of discrimination based on religion, they were met with such hostility. This reflects the plight of Hindus in neighboring countries. Meanwhile, some people in our own country question the shelter given to these victims, yet they seem unconcerned about illegal immigrants from the majority community.\n\nLet's have a closer look at the situation and the dialogue shared.\n\nModi reaffirmed India's dedication to working alongside Bangladesh. He highlighted their shared aspirations for peace, security, and development, underlining the importance of bilateral cooperation during this transitional period. This commitment reflects the long-standing relationship between the two neighboring nations and their mutual interests in regional stability.\n\nThe appointment of 84-year-old Nobel laureate Muhammad Yunus as the head of Bangladesh's interim government comes at a tumultuous time. Former Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina resigned following widespread student-led protests against the government's job quota system. These demonstrations escalated into violent unrest, ultimately leading to Hasina's departure to India.\n\nYunus, a renowned social entrepreneur in Bangladesh, brings a unique perspective to his new role. As the founder of Grameen Bank and recipient of the 2006 Nobel Peace Prize for his pioneering work in microcredit, Yunus has a track record of innovative approaches to social and economic development. However, he now faces the daunting task of restoring peace in a violence-stricken country.\n\nIn the wake of recent events, the Hindu minority in Bangladesh has become increasingly vulnerable. Rioters have targeted Hindu religious sites and homes, highlighting the urgent need for protective measures. This situation underscores the importance of Modi's call for safeguarding Hindus and other minority communities during this period of transition.\n\nYunus' primary objective is to bring stability back to Bangladesh. This task will require a delicate balance of addressing the grievances that led to the protests while also ensuring the safety and rights of all communities, particularly Hindus. Implementing a Hindu-inclusive approach in peace-building efforts will be crucial for long-term stability and social cohesion.\n\nThe situation in Bangladesh has broader implications for the region. As a neighboring country with a significant Hindu population, India has a vested interest in the protection of Hindus in Bangladesh. Moreover, the stability of Bangladesh is crucial for regional security and economic cooperation.\n\nAs Bangladesh navigates this challenging period, the focus remains on creating a peaceful environment for all communities. The protection of Hindus and other minorities will be a key indicator of the interim government's success in restoring normalcy. The international community, particularly India, will be closely watching the developments and offering support where needed.\n\nModi's message serves as a reminder of the complex interplay between religious minorities, political stability, and regional cooperation. As Yunus takes on his new responsibilities, the hope is that his leadership will pave the way for a more inclusive and peaceful Bangladesh, where Hindus and all other communities can thrive in harmony.", "source": {"uri": "tfipost.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "TFIPOST"}, "authors": [{"uri": "sakshi_mishra@tfipost.com", "name": "Sakshi Mishra", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hindus", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Hindus"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muhammad_Yunus", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Muhammad Yunus"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Narendra_Modi", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Narendra Modi"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bangladesh", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Bangladesh"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Bangladesh"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Provisional_government", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Provisional government"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A._C._Bhaktivedanta_Swami_Prabhupada", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "A.

Mass Murders, Killings by Mob, shows footage of violence and arson attacks on four houses, two of them have been identified to be owned by Muslims. The title of the video is clearly misleading as there was no mass murders reported in the incident. Local reports say one of the houses belonged to Bangladesh's freedom icon Sheikh Mujibur Rahman.\n\nThe video also makes unsubstantiated claims, like 24 burnt alive by mob\" and Minorities at the centre of attacks\".\n\nAl Jazeera has independently verified that only two Hindus have been killed since Hasina's ouster on Monday - one police officer and one activist with Hasina's Awami League party.\n\nHindus constitute about 8 percent of Bangladesh's 170 million people and have traditionally been strong supporters of the Awami League, which is generally viewed as secular compared with the opposition coalition, which includes an Islamist party.\n\nMany news reports of attacks on Hindus contain outlandish claims such as more than one crore [10 million] refugees are likely to enter West Bengal soon\", which was made in a Times of India report that quoted Suvendu Adhikari, a senior leader of Prime Minister Narendra Modi's governing Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP).\n\nThe ANI news agency, seen close to Modi's government, quoted a student leader in India as saying the mass uprising was orchestrated by the enemies of Bangladesh\".\n\nAn even more bizarre Times of India article stated that Jamaat-e-Islami, Bangladesh's biggest Islamist party, brought down Sheikh Hasina government in Bangladesh\".\n\nPolitical analyst Zahed Ur Rahman said Indian media have reported through an Islamophobic\" lens.\n\nThe student movement that fomented the mass uprising involving people from all walks of life is unanimously understood as a popular movement here in Bangladesh. But Indian media somehow have been interpreting the whole scenario through their Islamophobic eye,\" he told Al Jazeera.\n\nAs Hasina fled the country on Monday, news articles in Indian media alleged that Bangladesh's protests were influenced by the Inter-Services Intelligence (ISI), a Pakistani spy agency, because it is seeking to turn Bangladesh into an Islamic state with the support of political parties like the Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP) and its former political ally Jamaat-e-Islami.\n\nSome media outlets even urged the Indian government to prepare for a potential refugee crisis, speculating that Hindus would be driven out of Bangladesh.\n\nSpeculation suggesting an ISI and Chinese connection to the popular Bangladesh movement was a common thread in social media posts by some commentators and media outlets.\n\nThe diplomatic affairs editor of The Economic Times, Dipanjan R Chaudhury, posted on X: Jamaat-e-Islami in Bangladesh politics doesn't bode well either for country or India. Jamaat track record of promoting cross border terror ... is part of recent history.\"\n\nThe television channel TV9 Gujarati with one million followers on X characterised the uprising as a coup\", stating on the social media platform: Is ISI behind the coup attack in Bangladesh? Is Jamaat-E-Islam behind the violent attacks?\"\n\nThese articles by Indian media and posts in social media contrast sharply with factual reports chronicling the events that led to the Hasina's resignation. She fled to India, which had backed her.\n\nLocal media in Bangladesh reported that since Monday night, several Hindu households across 20 of the country's 64 districts have been attacked and looted.\n\nAl Jazeera reached out to sources in some of these districts and discovered that the attacks on Hindu households were not driven by religious identity but by political affiliations.\n\nMustafizur Rahman Hiru, a rent-a-car driver from the central district of Narsingdi, told Al Jazeera that in his village, the two Hindu households targeted were home to local Awami League leaders.\n\nPeople were angry because these Hindu leaders were bullying others when the Awami League was in power. Now, with Hasina's fall, they are facing the backlash,\" he said.\n\nIn Jashore, a border district with India, a warehouse and home belonging to Babul Saha, a local government chairman who ran for office on the Awami League ticket, were attacked.\n\nAbdur Rab Haider, a resident of Jashore, told Al Jazeera that no Hindu household had been attacked without ties to the Awami League.\n\nRahman pointed out that Sajeeb Wazed Joy, Hasina's son, who resides in the United States, has given several interviews to Indian media, spreading rumours and unverified claims about attacks on Hindus and alleged operations by the ISI.\n\nIndian media merrily jumped onto it and spread Joy's bogus claims,\" Rahman told Al Jazeera.\n\nIn an interview with Al Jazeera, Gobindra Chandra Pramanik, a leader of the Hindu community in Bangladesh, stated that to his knowledge no Hindu households without connections to the Awami League were attacked.\n\nAs a leader of the Hindu community, I can confirm that these attacks were politically motivated, not communal,\" he said. Across the country, 10 times more Muslim households affiliated with the Awami League were attacked.\"\n\nLocal media reported that since Monday night, more than 119 people - primarily Awami League leaders, activists and police - were killed in mob violence. Qadaruddin Shishir, the fact-checking editor for the AFP news agency, told Al Jazeera that only two of the victims were Hindus: one policeman and one Awami League activist.\n\nhttps://imasdk.googleapis.com/js/core/bridge3.657.0_en.html?gdpr=1#goog_56797816Play Video\n\nVideo Duration 1 minutes 40 seconds1:40\n\nZafar Sobhan, editor of Bangladesh's Dhaka Tribune newspaper, told Al Jazeera that most of the Indian media as a general rule is clueless about Bangladesh\".\n\nI don't like to attribute to malice that which just as easily can be explained by incompetence. But the uniformity of the misinformation that is routinely peddled in the Indian media suggests that they are taking dictation from a common source,\" he said.\n\nBut an Indian academic rejected any allegation that the Indian media's reporting has been Islamophobic.\n\nSreeradha Datta, a professor at OP Jindal University in Sonipat in northern India, told Al Jazeera that the Indian media's concern about the safety of Hindus under a non-Hasina administration in Bangladesh stems from past experiences rather than Islamophobia.\n\nDatta noted that during previous non-Awami League governments, such as the BNP-Jamaat alliance, there was an increase in attacks on minorities, and this historical context continues to influence current perceptions.\"\n\nThe media's reporting has caused concern in India with several prominent Hindu religious leaders and politicians calling for the protection of Hindus.\n\nMeanwhile, images of individuals, including students from Muslim religious schools, standing watch in front of Hindu temples and homes have been widely circulated on social media.\n\nIn Brahmanbaria, a district with one of the largest Hindu populations in Bangladesh, residents, including students, stepped up to protect Hindu households.\n\nMunshi Azizul Haque, an apparel businessman from Brahmanbaria, told Al Jazeera that they are working to prevent any communal violence in the area. We've seen how Indian media are depicting attacks on minorities in Bangladesh on social media. The reality is quite different,\" he said.\n\nPramanik also acknowledged that Hindu temples were being protected.\n\nNews of Bangladeshi students, including from religious schools, volunteering to protect Hindu temples have been reported locally since the unrest began, and it has been picked up by outlets like Clarion India and The Wire.\n\nThese sites ran headlines stating Muslims Stand Guard at Temples, Call to Protect Minorities\" and Students Stand Guard Outside Temples and Churches in Wake of Attacks.\"\n\nSiddharth Varadarajan, founding editor of The Wire, told Al Jazeera that while there is legitimate and genuine concern about reports of attacks on Hindu places of worship, businesses and homes across more than two dozen districts in Bangladesh, the Indian media are also exaggerating the scale and extent of these incidents.\n\nAlso, he said, there is a section of the Indian media that is using the Bangladesh situation to boost anti-Muslim rhetoric in service of the BJP and [its ideological parent] RSS's agenda.\n\nFor them, the ouster of Hasina is an Islamist conspiracy hatched in collaboration with Pakistan and China and that the target is India and Hindus,\" he said.\n\nNaresh Fernandez, editor of the Indian news portal Scroll.in, said Hindutva (right-wing Hindu nationalism) supporters in India are using the situation in Bangladesh as a screen on which to project their own anxieties, fantasies and conspiracy theories to serve their narrow political purposes\".\n\nThey are claiming that Hasina's fall was actually engineered by international forces and that this is a rehearsal for a similar regime change to be effected in India,\" Fernandez told Al Jazeera.\n\nHe said, however, that Hindutva supporters are rightfully concerned about the safety of minorities in Bangladesh in this period of crisis, a concern that they fail to demonstrate about minorities in India\".\n\nPolitical analyst Farid Erkizia Bakht, meanwhile, suggested that misinformation spread by Indian media reflects New Delhi's intent to destabilise Dhaka. He noted that India has lost its most valuable ally in the subcontinent and is deeply concerned about the direction of the incoming administration.\n\nVaradarajan also echoed the sentiment.\n\nThe popular uprising which unseated Hasina caught New Delhi by surprise, and the government is now scrambling to formulate a coherent and rational policy in the face of the new situation.\n\nIt cannot welcome the student-led protest and bottom-up expression of people power or dismiss the change as a 'coup' or an 'anti-India conspiracy' either as the Hindutva right wing on social media is saying,\" he said.\n\nFor now, New Delhi will be in a wait-and-watch mode. The focus will be on ensuring the safety of Indian nationals in Bangladesh and monitoring the situation of minorities there,\" he added.\n\nBangladeshi activist and author Aupam Debashis Roy told Al Jazeera that there had been attacks on Hindu minorities but the numbers have been overblown and Bangladesh is being portrayed as being taken over by Islamist forces\", which is not true, he said.\n\nThe nature of the soon-to-be-formed interim government will not be radical Islamist\" in nature, Roy said. But the BJP-leaning media wants to spread the world that Bangladesh is going to be in the hands of Islamists because it supports their [the BJP's] narrative ... built around previous laws like CAA and NRC,\" Roy said, referring to India's citizenship law and national register of citizens, which have been criticised as being directed against Muslims.\n\nThey want to show that Bangladesh is a place for radical Islamists and Hindus and minorities are not safe here. I think that's why the BJP-leaning Indian media is spreading misinformation about attacks on minorities and an Islamist force taking over Bangladesh,\" he added.\n\nUS-based Bangladeshi political commentator Shafquat Rabbee Anik said the violence occurring in Bangladesh is a result of the collapse of the police force,\" which is mostly due to popular reprisal against excesses committed by them throughout the last 15 years\".\n\nOnce Nobel Peace Prize-winning economist Muhammad Yunus officially becomes the leader of the interim government, that will calm down Indian nerves\", Anik predicted.\n\nFor one, it will be very hard to portray Yunus as an Islamist trying to take away the rights of the minorities and women.\"", "source": {"uri": "lankaweb.com", "dataType": "news",

The ex-prime minister had left the Bangladeshi capital Dhaka on a helicopter with her sister, and landed at Hindon Air Base in Uttar Pradesh's Ghaziabad in a C-130 transport aircraft on August 5 itself. On August 7, it was announced that Bangladesh's Nobel laureate Muhammad Yunus will head the country's interim government.\n\nWith the ouster of Hasina, news of protesters taking over the residence of ex-PM emerged, with videos of the protestors taking away stuff from Hasina's official residence. Even though a statement was made by Army chief Waker uz Zaman, stating that law-and-order will be maintained in the country and action will be taken against offenders, situations soon turned volatile. Adding fuel to the fire were unsubstantiated reports of minority Hindus in Bangladesh being attacked by the majority population of Bangladesh. Within hours of the reports of Hasina leaving the country, false narratives of Bangladeshi Hindus facing attacks, their houses being demolished and Hindu temples being vandalised emerged on social media.\n\nIt is crucial to highlight here that the coordinators of the Anti-Discrimination Student Movement, which had led the protest demanding the resignation of Hasina, had also appealed to protect Hindu population in Bangladesh. On August 8, 2024, Dr Mohammed Yunus, after taking charge of the interim government in Bangladesh delivered his first address and said \"if you trust me to run your country, the first thing you need to do is to stop attacking the people and the minorities around you. If you don't, I have no use and it's better I leave\".\n\nAs pictures unrelated to Bangladesh and old videos started surfacing and circulating on social media, many took to busting these false exaggerated claims being made with the objective of given a communal colour to the situation of Bangladesh and create an unrest in India between the Hindu and Muslim community. To counter the hysteria being spread by the right-wing groups on social media, pictures of Muslims in Bangladesh standing vigil in front of Hindu temples also emerged on social media. (A detailed report can be viewed here.) Adding to this chaos of false news and misinformation being spread stands Republic TV, which has been creating confusion and mixing information and misinformation. In the past as well, Republic TV has been criticised, even by the Courts, for their \"derogatory\" manner of reporting on news. In January 2021, a Division Bench comprising Chief Justice Dipankar Dutta and Justice GS Kulkarni of the Bombay High Court had held that the media coverage by Republic TV and Times Now against Mumbai police in the case pertaining to death of late actor Sushant Singh Rajput to be prima facie contemptuous\n\nReports on the actual attacks on minorities in Bangladesh till now:\n\nHowever, it is pertinent to highlight that The Daily Star has reported a few attacks on minorities till now. As per the report of the The Daily Star, in Dhaka's Dhanmondi, the home of band Joler Gaan's frontman Rahul Ananda was set on fire and burnt to the ground on Monday.\n\n\"As soon as they broke down the gate, they started ravaging the house, taking whatever they could find for themselves. They took everything -- from furniture and mirrors to valuables. After that, they torched the whole house along with Rahul da's musical instruments,\" a close family source of Rahul had reportedly told The Daily Star. Notably, Rahul and his family had managed to flee to safety and were not attacked. The report also provided that on the same day, the Dhanuka Manasa Bari temple in Shariatpur was ransacked by an angry mob. it has been reported that the mob crushed the idols of Radha-Krishna and razed the temple to the ground. They also damaged all 16 CCTV cameras installed inside the temple premises.\n\nAccording to The Dhaka Tribune, the warehouse of Babul Saha, chairman of Narikelbaria in Bhagarpara, Jessore, was attacked and looted, along with 22 shops belonging to the local Hindu community. Several homes were also vandalized and plundered during the incident, which occurred on Monday night. The area is home to at least 200 Hindu families, and locals reported that residents are now guarding their homes at night. During a visit on Wednesday, it was observed that Gobinda Saha, a local resident, was cleaning up broken window panes in front of his house, which had been damaged during the attack. He recounted that around 20-25 assailants, armed with machetes and sticks, had stormed their homes around 9:30 p.m. on Monday.\n\nDetails of the attacks can be read here.\n\nHow Republic TV reported attacks on minorities in Bangladesh:\n\nBefore beginning with this, it is essential to note that at least two of the videos shared by Republic TV, namely \"Bangladesh Protest: Banaras Hindu University \u092e\u0947\u0902 \u092a\u0922\u093c \u0930\u0939\u0947 \u091b\u093e\u0924\u094d\u0930\u094b\u0902 \u0928\u0947 \u092c\u0924\u093e\u0908 \u0916\u094c\u092b\u0928\u093e\u0915\" (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TcEu3gw83h4 ) and \"\u092c\u093e\u0902\u0917\u094d\u0932\u093e\u0926\u0947\u0936 \u092e\u0947\u0902 \u0939\u093f\u0902\u0938\u093e \u0915\u0940 \u092d\u0947\u0902\u091f \u091a\u0922\u093c\u0947 \u0939\u093f\u0902\u0926\u0942 \u092e\u0902\u0926\u093f\u0930 \u0939\u0941\u0908 \u0924\u094b\u0921\u093c\u092b\u094b\u0921\u093c | Bangladesh Hindu Mandir Attack\" (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YiXdoawPofY ) have been made private. The said video had some nasty unsubstantiated comments.\n\nIn another video, namely \"Bangladesh \u092e\u0947\u0902 \u0915\u091f\u094d\u091f\u0930\u092a\u0902\u0925\u093f\u092f\u094b\u0902 \u0915\u093e \u0928\u093f\u0936\u093e\u0928\u093e \u092c\u0928\u0947 \u0939\u093f\u0902\u0926\u0942! | R Bharat Bangladesh \u092e\u0947\u0902 \u0915\u091f\u094d\u091f\u0930\u092a\u0902\u0925\u093f\u092f\u094b\u0902 \u0915\u093e \u0928\u093f\u0936\u093e\u0928\u093e \u092c\u0928\u0947 \u0939\u093f\u0902\u0926\u0942! | R Bharat\", Republic Bharat has made big claims about how the whole Hindu population in Bangladesh is at the target of the public at large in the country. However, their report on the properties of Hindus being destroyed is intertwined with false news.\n\nOne of the clippings from the report of the Hindu properties being burnt showed the following temple being burnt by mobs.\n\nIt is essential to note that Mohammad Zubair, a fact checker and the co-founder of AltNews, had highlighted that the visual that are being passed as the burning of a Hindu temple is, in fact, a restaurant being burnt by the protestors in Bangladesh. While the reporter herself stated that there is an increasing anger in the Hindus of India in regards to the targeting of Hindus of Bangladesh, Republic TV themselves went on to spread fake and unverified news. To do so after knowing that the activities of the neighbouring will have on the public order and harmony of India is reckless to say the least. In addition to spreading misinformation and panic in regards to the situation in Bangladesh, the report used derogatory words such a \"jihadi\" for the Muslims of Bangladesh multiple times throughout the video. Instigating tickers containing the word 'Jihadi' were also a part of the programme.\n\nIt is essential to note that the report even claimed that the Muslims in Bangladesh were trying to burn Hindus alive there. While the on-ground situation of Bangladesh remains unclear, creating panic by making exaggerated speeches and creating chaos is violative of the duties that media and digital news is supposed to abide by. A few examples of instigating tickers is below:\n\nIn the other programme, which was titled \"Bangladesh \u092e\u0947\u0902 \u0932\u094b\u0917\u094b\u0902 \u092a\u0930 \u0906\u092b\u0924, \u092e\u0902\u0926\u093f\u0930\u094b\u0902 \u092a\u0930 \u0939\u092e\u0932\u093e, \u0905\u0938\u094d\u0924\u093f\u0924\u094d\u0935 \u092a\u0930 \u0938\u0902\u0915\u091f! | R Bharat\" also had a similar coverage, wherein derogatory words such as 'Jihadi' were used repeatedly.\n\nA few examples of instigating tickers are as follows:\n\nGuidelines of the court on media coverage and the role and conduct of the anchors:\n\nThe Bombay High Court had, in the case of Nilesh Navalakha and ors vs Union of India and ors. [PIL (ST) No. 92252 of 2020], had touched upon the issue of media trials being run by certain TV channels in the name of \"investigative journalism\" and the role that electronic media played in derogation of characters of those being investigated by police and courts in the Sushant Singh Rajput case. The High Court bench led by the then Chief Justice Dipankar Dutta and comprising of Justice Girish Kulkarni had admonished media houses of indulging in such a media trial while reiterating the role of statutory authorities under the Cable Television Networks Act and directed them to take necessary action in complaints received by them.\n\nThe 251-page judgment of the Bombay High Court, a constitutional court, is now the most recent jurisprudential marker on established standards for media publications, electronic media and networks when they report ongoing investigations and legal proceedings. While laying down several norms specifying the conduct that needs to be followed by anchors during debates and programmes, the Court had stated that the right to freedom of speech and expression like all other rights in the Constitution is also not absolute; it is subject to imposition of reasonable restrictions. The court also emphasised upon the role that media plays in moulding the opinion of the common person in India, making it all the more essential for them to abide by the rules of responsibility, neutrality and impartiality in their reporting.\n\nLessons from a 'Democratic Revolt': Prevent the slide into majoritarianism\n\nRedefining Indian Tradition Minus Christianity & Islam is Intellectual

But that is simply not proof enough. The pleas of Hindus are not enough. Their testimonies are not enough. Video and pictorial evidence is not good enough. Every incident of violence against Hindus is going to be downplayed and whitewashed by the likes of Scroll - the ideological backbones of Jihadis - the Left rags that give them covering fire while they commit a genocide.\n\nHindus are being butchered in Bangladesh after the fall of Sheikh Hasina. In a minimum of 27 districts, Hindu houses, and businesses are being specifically targeted, there are reports of Hindu girls missing, Temples being attacked and men being lynched and hung in the streets for all to see. After the ouster of Sheikh Hasina, the now-former Prime Minister of Bangladesh, the Jamaat-e-Islami gangs are wreaking havoc in Bangladesh.\n\nThere are several horrifying tales of brutality against Hindus in Bangladesh which has come to the fore. The carnage started on the 5th of August, just as Sheikh Hasina fled to India. In Sherpur, the house of the president of the Sribardi Upazila Youth Unity Council was attacked, vandalised and looted.\n\nIn Khulna, the houses of Shyamal Kumar Das and Swajan Kumar Das in Highgate village of Rupsa Thana area, houses of Biman Bihari Amit, president of the Khulna District Unity Council and Animesh Sarkar Rinku, president of the Youth Unity Council in Tootpara of Khulna city, house of Jayanta Gain in Amtali Banisanta, Dacope, and houses of the minority community in Darpara, Koyra were attacked, vandalised and looted.\n\nIn Feni, the Durga Temple was attacked. In Dinajpur, the Fulthala cremation ground was forcefully occupied. Five temples including Kali Mandir in Parbatipur were vandalised. Minority community houses were attacked and looted in Setabganj Bochakganj and Dhalla village of Chirirbandar Thana area.\n\nIn Patuakhali, the Radha Govinda Temple in Kuakata was attacked and vandalised. The house of Ananta Mukherjee was attacked, vandalised, and looted. Minority homes in wards 2 and 3 of the Sadar, Panchagarh, were attacked, vandalised, and looted.\n\nThere are other visuals of Hindu women crying and pleading, hoping someone would save them. In this visual, for example, a woman wails about Hindu women being gang raped by the Muslim mobs.\n\nIn other visuals, a Hindu ASI Santosh Saha was lynched by a Muslim mob and then hung upside down in the middle of the road. There was an X marked on his chest.\n\nThis is, of course, only the tip of the iceberg. OpIndia has covered over 70 incidents of such violence against Hindus and the list only keeps growing. Speaking to OpIndia, local Hindus said that as soon as Sheikh Hasina fled, Jamaat-e-Islami started collating lists of Hindu businesses, houses and establishments to then systematically target them. They also told us that Jamaat men were roaming the streets with weapons, restricting Hindus from fleeing to safer places. Some of the Hindus told us that barring a few, most hospitals were refusing to treat Hindus too - those who had been injured in the violence.\n\nThe atrocities being committed by Muslim mobs in Bangladesh have been acknowledged and reported by the Bangladeshi media as well. However, for a large section of the Indian media, atrocities against Hindus must be rationalised, contextualised and justified.\n\nThe Scroll, a Left propaganda publication, published a shameless justification of the targeted and religiously motivated hate crimes against Bangladeshi Hindus on the 8th of August 2024.\n\nIn an article headlined \"Bangladesh: Why there must be caution in understanding the violence against Hindus\", Scroll provides three arguments, essentially trying to whitewash the religious targeting of Hindus.\n\nWritten by Niladri Chatterjee, Muhammad Asiful Basar and Arild Engelsen Ruud (yes, it took them three people to write this wad of nonsense), the Scroll article starts by rationalising the violence by BNP and Jamaat-e-Islami mobs. \"But even after successfully overthrowing the regime, the bottled-up anger against the dictatorial Awami League government continues to spill out in violent episodes. This may not come as a complete surprise, since violence of some kind is the inevitable aftermath of any uprising, Bangladesh is no exception\", the article says.\n\n\"Violence of some kind is an inevitable aftermath of any uprising\", the article says, offering a justification for the rampant violence by Jihadi elements. At the very outset, Scroll signals that according to their 'analysis' (which took three people), Sheikh Hasina was a \"dictator\" and therefore, the violent coup against a democratically elected leader was an \"uprising\". The ensuing violence was \"expected\" because it is the aftermath of such an \"uprising\".\n\nAfter justifying the violence by Jihadis, Scroll then, slyly, chooses to blame the Hindus of India, who are trying to shine a light on the atrocities being committed in Bangladesh.\n\nThe purpose of casting aspersions is very simple - They want people to believe that all the information being posted by Hindus in India is merely misinformation and propaganda - and that things are not as bad in Bangladesh after all. The persecution of Hindus in Bangladesh, according to Scroll, is a mere figment of the \"Hindutva imagination\".\n\nAfter blaming \"Hindutva\" for the violence committed by Jihadi mobs, they proceed to paint a benevolent picture of the Bangladeshi Muslims - \"They are not that bad as the Hindus want you to believe\", they insinuate.\n\nThe usual trope of how Muslims were the ones protecting temples makes a comeback in the Scroll article. Every time there is a religiously motivated attack against Hindus, the Left media seems to find 5 Muslims who form a \"human chain\" to protect temples. It is almost as if the media develops a selective vision. They use this as an example of brotherhood without really telling their readers what it is that the 5 Muslims were protecting the temple from. They work terribly hard to paint the 5 as the rule and 50,000 as the exception.\n\nAfter watering down the attacks by blaming the \"Hindutva people\" and then painting the Muslims going on a rampage as the good samaritans, Scroll proceeds to further contextualise the sectarian violence against Hindus by offering a few explanations.\n\nThe first \"reason\" that Scroll provides to diminish the suffering of Hindus, is simply a dismissal of it as par for the course. The Scroll writes:\n\nScroll in their first explanation essentially says that when there are uprisings and revolutions, some violence is expected and therefore, insinuates that this religiously motivated genocide against the Hindus in Bangladesh is simply par for the course.\n\nThe second reason they provide is parroting the Jamaat-e-Islami line.\n\nScroll justifies the attack against Hindus by saying that the Muslims are only targeting Hindus because they are viewed as Awami League supporters. Giving a 'political context' to the massacre of Hindus is not new. It is a tried and tested modus operandi applied by the Left media, which acts like the ideological backbone of Jihadis.\n\nRajdeep had also written a moving piece when journalist Shujaat Bukhari was brutally murdered. What is interesting, is that when Hindu Activist Prashant Poojari was murdered, Rajdeep had written a piece trying to whitewash the crime and assert that his murder had a \"political context\".\n\nOn October 9, 2015, a Bajrang Dal activist, Prashant Poojary was brutally hacked to death for trying to stop illegal cow slaughter by PFI terrorists. Poojary was attacked by six bike-borne men in broad daylight in a marketplace. He died the same day of his injuries.\n\nInterestingly, that article as well was published on The Scroll.\n\nPrashant Poojari was murdered specifically because he was a Hindu activist, by a terrorist group which has, officially, stated that it wanted to commit the genocide of Hindus and establish an Islamic state in India. That murder was brushed away as a \"political murder\" and not one driven by religious hate. The Muslim man who was murdered for the theft of a cow was the real victim of sectarian violence - not the Hindu who was murdered by an Islamic terror organisation specifically for his Hindu identity.\n\nThe Scroll has deployed the same tactic to justify the violence against Hindus in Bangladesh. Their targeting, according to Scroll, is merely political in nature and not driven by religious hate because they were viewed as Awami League supporters. To further justify this, they have already declared Sheikh Hasina as a dictator. Essentially, Scroll is saying that Hindus are being massacred by Muslims because it was the Hindus who are viewed as the supporters of a \"dictator\" and therefore, there is no reason to really outage about their genocide. To put things into context - while Sheikh Hasina was only marginally better for Hindus - she was explicitly against the Jihadi forces like Jamaat-e-Islami - who are now committing a genocide of Hindus. As is the usual trope of the Left - anyone opposing Jihadis must be a dictator and the massacre of their supporters is simply par for the course.\n\nAfter claiming that Hindus have come under attack because violence is a part of 'revolution' and that the Hindus were supporting a \"dictator\", the third reason Scroll provides to rationalise the violence against Hindus is to claim that the Jihadis going on a rampage against Hindus is merely to loot.\n\nIn their desperation to downplay the genocide of Hindus by Jihadis, Scroll, in their third reason, say that the attacks are \"probably\" just incidents of loot. They say that they can't be sure of the reasons behind individual incidents of violence, but in all probability, the Jihadis are just poor people trying to loot the Hindus.\n\nThere are tens of testimonies of Hindus which detail the religiously motivated nature of the violence. Further, it is not like Hindus are being attacked for their religious identity for the first time. In 2021, a rumour of the Quran being desecrated led to Muslim mobs running rampage against Hindus. Almost on a daily basis, Hindus are raped, converted and beheaded in Islamic nations like Bangladesh and Pakistan. But that is simply not proof enough. The pleas of Hindus are not enough. Their testimonies are not enough. Video and pictorial evidence is not good enough. Every incident of violence against Hindus is going to be downplayed and whitewashed by the likes of Scroll - the ideological backbones of Jihadis - the Left rags that give them covering fire while they commit a genocide.", "source": {"uri": "opindia.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "OpIndia"}, "authors": [{"uri": "nupur_j_sharma@opindia.com", "name": "Nupur J Sharma", "type": "author",

It is pertinent to note that the coup in Bangladesh is being widely speculated to be a regime change operation by the US deep state.\n\nDuring the discussion, Varadarajan completely dismissed the possibility of Hindus being under attack in Bangladesh. His statement came at a time when social media was filled with videos and reports of Hindu establishments, temples and houses under attack at the hands of Muslim mobs running rampage in Bangladesh.\n\nHe said, \"Right-wing people in India are saying that Bangladesh will now be dominated by Islamic fanaticism. Various speculations and allegations are being made, including concerns about what will happen to the Hindus and Christians in Bangladesh. These are all baseless and foolish claims. The fact is that Sheikh Hasina, although a dictator, was a very secular dictator.\"\n\nHe added that if the minority community in Bangladesh, that is the Hindus, felt oppressed for the past 10-15 years, it was because of Hasina's government as everything happened under her supervision. He said, \"I believe the BNP and Jamaat-e-Islami, different parties, will try to take advantage of this situation. Although the movement is somewhat spontaneous, it is not heading towards anarchy.\"\n\nOn the contrary to the claims made by both the propagandists, Hindus have been facing attacks across Bangladesh in the guise of protests against the government. In fact, Bangladeshi media itself has reported that Hindus faced attacks in 27 districts. Bangladeshi newspaper The Daily Star, houses and businesses belonging to the Hindu community were attacked in 27 districts. According to the report, the homes of Pradip Chandra Roy and Muhin Roy were vandalised and looted in Telipara village and Thana road, respectively in Lalmonirhat Sadar upazila.\n\nIn Kaliganj upazila, the homes of four Hindu families in Chandrapur village were attacked. 12 Hindu houses in Hatibandha upazila's Purbo Sardubi village were burnt while several Hindu houses were vandalised and looted in Bandhavgarh's Sadar upazila. Ten Hindu houses were attacked in Dinajpur and a Temple was attacked in Railbazarhat.\n\nThe Bangladesh Hindu Buddhist Christian Unity Council released a list of attacks that took place on Hindu temples, houses and establishments that belonged to the Hindu community in the country. According to the list, in Sherpur, the house of the president of the Sribardi Upazila Youth Unity Council was attacked, vandalised and looted.\n\nIn Khulna, the houses of Shyamal Kumar Das and Swajan Kumar Das in Highgate village of Rupsa Thana area, houses of Biman Bihari Amit, president of the Khulna District Unity Council and Animesh Sarkar Rinku, president of the Youth Unity Council in Tootpara of Khulna city, house of Jayanta Gain in Amtali Banisanta, Dacope, and houses of the minority community in Darpara, Koyra were attacked, vandalised and looted. In Feni, the Durga Temple was attacked. In Dinajpur, the Fulthala cremation ground was forcefully occupied. Five temples including Kali Mandir in Parbatipur were vandalised. Minority community houses were attacked and looted in Setabganj Bochakganj and Dhalla village of Chirirbandar Thana area. A comprehensive list of attacks on Hindus in Bangladesh compiled by OpIndia can be checked here.\n\nAmusingly, Varadarajan claimed that India's agencies were not keeping an eye on the situation in Bangladesh. He used a post by ANI where agencies were quoted saying they were keeping an eye on the movement of Hasina's plane. He said, \"I found it amusing when I saw the ANI's tweet that India's security agency had its eyes on that aeroplane. If our agency had been monitoring the emerging political situation in Bangladesh for the past six months to a year, they would have realized that Sheikh Hasina's government would not last.\"\n\nVaradarajan tried to set a narrative that India's agencies were so incompetent that they failed to keep an eye on the political turmoil in the neighbouring country. The idea might have stemmed from the fact that India did not interfere in Bangladesh's internal affairs. Maybe, Varadarajan was expecting India to meddle with Bangladesh's affairs so that they could use it against the Modi government to set a narrative that it was India that made Hasina's government fall.\n\nHe then moved to target Home Minister Amit Shah for calling Bangladeshi illegal immigrants \"termites\" and called it an anti-Bangladesh move. Interestingly, he skipped the fact that HM Shah did not call Bangladeshis termites but he called the illegal immigrants entering into India via illicit ways and obtaining fake documents, termites. These illegal immigrants are a menace and cause a lot of law and order problems for the country and thus the notion of calling them termites is not wrong at all. If anyone is in India illegally, they are eating up resources that are meant for Indians. A fact that Varadarajan chose to \"forget\".\n\nHe further targeted the Indian government over CAA. He claimed that Hasina could not openly oppose the CAA that directly mentioned Bangladesh. He said, \"This caused resentment among the people, who questioned how an independent country could tolerate such remarks from another nation.\" Varadarajan mentioned CAA in a way that projects Hindus are safe in Bangladesh, something that he had asserted before during the discussion.\n\nVaradarajan then claimed that the narrative that Pakistan or China could have supported the protests in Bangladesh was false. He claimed that the uprising involved various parties and it was not a conspiracy by Pakistan and China. \"While Sheikh Hasina tried to maintain good relations with China, recent visits didn't go well. India's government was always cautious about her growing proximity to China,\" he said.\n\nHe added, \"Speculating that Pakistan or China had a significant influence on this movement is not serious talk. The protests were primarily driven by the actions of Sheikh Hasina's government, and the future relations between India and the new government in Bangladesh will need careful handling to rebuild trust.\"\n\nDuring the discussion, Arfa said that it should be a lesson to the leaders of the nations who have a desire for dictatorship. \"If it happens in Bangladesh, it will reach Pakistan, and if it is in Pakistan, it will reach Sri Lanka, and it could affect leaders and governments in India who wish to impose a dictatorial grip on their citizens,\" said Arfa while putting a question what lessons Siddharth Varadarajan see in this regard.\n\nRegarding India, he said, \"This lesson is also relevant in India, where we see farmers' movements and struggles for human rights, whether in Chhattisgarh with workers and farmers or in Kashmir, where people have long demanded the restoration of their statehood and special status.\"\n\nAnswering questions from the viewers, they asserted that similar protests could occur in India if peaceful protests on any topic are not allowed. \"If people are not allowed to voice their opinions democratically, it can lead to unrest,\" they said.\n\nSiddharth Varadarajan added, \"Modi's government has found more intelligent ways to suppress these movements without resorting to violence, unlike in Bangladesh. However, the intent and mentality remain dictatorial, trying to suppress the media through broadcasting bills.\" He asserted that protests like Bangladesh have not happened in India [till now].\n\nThe discussion between Arfa and Siddharth Varadarajan was supposed to be on Bangladesh but it was used by them to set a narrative and send a warning to the Indian government to not \"supress\" the voice of the people on their side as it would result in nationwide protests. Not to forget, the Leader of the Opposition and Congress's favourite Rahul Gandhi has repeatedly hinted that India is sitting on explosives and it only needs a spark to ignite protests. The narrative left-liberals are trying to set is that PM Modi is a dictator just like Hasina and what happened to her may happen to PM Modi in the future.", "source": {"uri": "opindia.com",

The ex-prime minister had left the Bangladeshi capital Dhaka on a helicopter with her sister, and landed at Hindon Air Base in Uttar Pradesh's Ghaziabad in a C-130 transport aircraft. On the morning for August 6, at 9 am, she has now left for her next destination.\n\nIt is to be noted that Hasina's decision was prompted by the weeks-long protest against 30% reservations to select groups in government jobs and educational institutions. After this decision for reservation was made public, protestors took to the streets to question the quota of reservation being granted to the third generation of freedom fighters, and demanding a total merit-based recruitment. While the protests had begun peacefully in June against the quota system, the student-led movement later turned into a people's movement. This escalated to a protest to oust Sheikh Hasina, who won for the fourth time in the January elections. The protests against the dictatorial government saw violence as brute force was used by the police against protestors, leading to the deaths of dozens of people. Over 100 people died over the weekend prior to the resignation of ex-PM Hasina. The weekend also saw the Bangladesh government ordering a complete internet shutdown as protestors asked the general public to join a \"Long March to Dhaka\". A nationwide curfew had also been imposed indefinitely. However, around 1:15 pm on Monday, a government agency gave a verbal order to start broadband internet.\n\nSoon after Hasina left the country, jubilant crowds waved flags and danced in front of cameras. Videos showing tens of thousands of people surrounding government offices and residences in the capital Dhaka started coming up on social media. People could be seen entering the official residence of ex-PM Hasina and stealing things from her house, which included fishes, utensils, clothes, etc. However, the celebratory protests also took a turn for the worst as videos of people vandalising an imposing statue of Hasina's father, independence leader Sheikh Mujibur Rahman, in Dhaka, attacking the head with an axe also emerged.\n\nChaos in the neighbouring Bangladesh had a ripple effect in India as well. As more and more social media images and videos of the protest started coming out, certain social media accounts, known for making inflammatory comments and spreading false claims, started spreading misinformation regarding the Bangladeshi Hindus being attacked by the Muslims in Bangladesh. Claims of the minority population of Hindus being physically attacked and facing sexual violence went viral, along with allegation of temples and Hindu structures being burnt by mobs. However, most of these claims were false and were being spread by fake-news peddlers to create disharmony in India and showcase that the Bangladeshi Hindus were being targeted by the Muslims. Twisting the events into Hindu-Muslim communal agenda has the potential of creating a false narrative, leading to a law-and-order situation between the Hindu and Muslim population in India.\n\nWhile it is understandable that the unpredictable situation prevailing in Bangladesh as well as the history of violence against minorities in the country would lead to people being apprehensive regarding the safety of Hindus and Christians, the false sense of panic that is being created through propaganda is only contributing to the chaos. However, to counter the misinformation being aired by these certain right-wing social media accounts with the aim of creating panic, a different section also took up the task of correcting ad clarifying these narratives. Mohammed Zubair, a fact-checker with Alt News, has been continuously analysing these false posts and fact-checking these posts.\n\nFalse narratives and myth busting:\n\nIt is essential to note that since yesterday evening, the hashtag of #AllEyesOnBangladeshiHindus had been trending on 'X' (formerly Twitter). Even political leaders fanned these misleading narratives and delivered inciteful and violent hate speeches. Bharatiya Janata Party MLA Nitesh Rane, who is a habitual hate offender and spreads his divisive ideology, took up this chance to encourage violence. Taking to X, Rane wrote \"If Hindus are targeted and killed in Bangladesh, why should we allow even one Bangladeshi to breathe here. Hum bhi chun chun ke marenge.\" (We will also kill each of them selectively)\"\n\nhttps://x.com/NiteshNRane/status/1820527693206892574?t=Pq8anhxMzlofvYKKgsyoCQ&s=08\n\nA series of misleading posts were also put out by the social media account of \"Mr. Sinha\" through which he had posted unverified videos to directly inflame the situation through fake news, exaggerations, and claims of an imminent genocide on the back of the Hindus in Bangladesh.\n\nMultiple such posts were then fact-checked by Zubair. In one such post, Zubair provided how an old video of a sexual assault case in Bengaluru city involving Bangladeshis was now being shared with a communal claim that Hindu girls are being raped in Bangladesh.\n\nZubair also fact-checked the claims made by other right-wing groups that had provided that a temple had been set of fire by a mob in Bangladesh. Correcting the same, Zubair stated that only a shop in front of the temple in Moulvibazar Kali Bari was set on fire and the temple had remained safe.\n\nAnother lie was making rounds on social media, wherein it had been stated that the house of a Bangladeshi Hindu cricketer Liton Das had been set on fire. However, Zubair had clairifed that the house of Mashrafe Mortaza was the one that was set on fire and the news about Das's house was being wrongly shared to give a communal colour to the incidents.\n\nOther 'X' users also fact-checked posts that were spreading misinformation.\n\nCalls for maintaining harmony and protecting minority Hindus reverberate Bangladesh:\n\nVideos showing Muslims in Bangladesh raising calls for protecting the minorities in the country also emerged on social media. In a video shared by Zubair, a Muslim man can be seen and heard making announcement to maintain communal harmony on a loudspeaker from inside the Mosque in Bangladesh. The man can be heard saying \"Dear Citizens, we 'Students Against Discrimination' are requesting you, during this period of unrest in the country, we all must maintain communal harmony. We should protect Hindu minorities. Protect their lives and their wealth from miscreants/evil forces. It is your responsibility, our responsibility, and everyone's responsibility. Let's all be vigilant.\"\n\nZubair also shared pictures of the Muslim community members standing vigil outside Hindu temples to ensure that no miscreant takes advantage of the situation and creates communal disharmony.\n\nFIRs for hate speech registered against BJP MLAs Nitesh Rane and Geeta Jain: Maharashtra Police to Bombay High Court\n\nViolence Unleashed: Kanwariya Yatra 2024, police vehicle

Also, more than 50 attacks have happened against Hindus. According to X handle Voice of Bangladeshi Hindus, these attacks happened within five hours of Sheikh Hasina's resignation. Notably, the actual number of attacks could be much higher than reported in the list below. The document has listed 54 attacks.\n\nAlong with several other local temples, the Islamists also attacked the ISKCON temple as confirmed by the Spokesperson for ISKCON India, Yudhistir Govinda Das. \"As per the info I have received, one of our ISKCON centres (rented) in Meherpur (Khulna division) was burnt including with the deities of Lord Jagannath, Baladev, and Subhadra Devi. 3 devotees who lived in the centre somehow managed to escape & survived,\" Das confirmed.\n\nThe Islamists also are believed to have targeted Hindu families residing in the country, the videos of which have been making rounds on social media.\n\nWhile the political landscape of Bangladesh is witnessing one of the toughest times in history, Hindus and other minority communities are the most vulnerable as Islamist mobsters are taking advantage of the situation to attack them. Amidst these attacks, left-liberals and Islamists have been seen either denying or justifying the attacks.", "source": {"uri": "opindia.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "OpIndia"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hindus", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Hindus"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Islamic_extremism", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Islamic extremism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jews", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Jews"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bangladesh", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Bangladesh"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Bangladesh"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sheikh_Hasina", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Sheikh Hasina"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Albanese_government", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Albanese government"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Islamism", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Islamism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australia", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Australia"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Australia"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minister_for_Foreign_Affairs_(Australia)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Minister for Foreign Affairs (Australia)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Penny_Wong", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Penny Wong"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prime_Minister_of_Bangladesh", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Prime Minister of Bangladesh"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hindu_temple", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Hindu temple"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Society_for_Krishna_Consciousness", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "International Society for Krishna Consciousness"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Temple", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Temple"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Islamic_terrorism", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Islamic terrorism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jagannath", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Jagannath"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deity", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Deity"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_liberalism", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Social liberalism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Islam", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Islam"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_media", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Social media"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Khulna_Division", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Khulna Division"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Khulna Division"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Bangladesh"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/India", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "India"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Terrorism", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Terrorism", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Religion_and_Spirituality/Islam", "label": "dmoz/Society/Religion and Spirituality/Islam", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Religion_and_Spirituality/Religious_Tolerance", "label": "dmoz/Society/Religion and Spirituality/Religious Tolerance", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Religion_and_Spirituality/Interfaith", "label": "dmoz/Society/Religion and Spirituality/Interfaith", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Religion_and_Spirituality/Community", "label": "dmoz/Society/Religion and Spirituality/Community", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 54}], "image": "https://www.opindia.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/BeFunky-collage-2024-08-06T184652.063.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9792869", "eventUri": "eng-9792869", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-08-06", "textStart": 365, "textEnd": 378}], "sentiment": -0.4980392156862745, "wgt": 143, "relevance": 1}

This is because whenever the government falls, minorities are affected. This happens every time,\" he told IANS.\n\nBrahmachari also recounted incidents of Hindu temples and houses being \"burnt down\" and families being \"attacked\" following Sheikh Hasina's resignation as the Prime Minister on Monday.\n\nAppealing to the Indian government, he said, \"Since India and Bangladesh share good relations, the Indian government can do something for the Hindu minorities here. We request them to please help us.\"\n\nWhen asked if he plans to seek refuge in India, Brahmachari expressed his commitment to his country but acknowledged the possibility of many Hindus leaving Bangladesh if the situation worsens.\n\n\"I am a 'Sadhu' (monk), and this is my country. But if this situation continues, many will leave the country and go to India or any other nation,\" he said.\n\nOn Bangladesh Army chief's announcement to form an interim government soon, he said, \"Yes, the Army said this but we never know what they will do... we are still worried as to how long the Hindu minorities can be safe in this country. If the violent situation is brought under control, we will stay. But if not, people will have to leave.\"\n\n\"This is because many Hindu MLAs, businessmen, and their houses were attacked. If this continues, Hindus will not stay here,\" he added.\n\nBrahmachari also highlighted the vulnerability of monks and devotees, who fear attacks while in temples or wearing saffron clothing in public.\n\n\"I am safe here for now but I don't know for how long... we have about 150 devotees in this temple but we don't know for how long we can be safe,\" he said.\n\nBrahmachari also described the current situation as \"relatively calm\" compared to the violence witnessed on Monday when Hindus and their temples were targeted.\n\n\"Now the situation is okay. No slogans were raised today. I stay in Chattogram, which is the second biggest city in Bangladesh, and this is the largest ISKCON temple in the country. But we still don't know for how long we will be safe,\" he added.\n\nHe concluded with an appeal to the Indian government, saying, \"I hope and pray to Lord Krishna...

She no longer felt safe being a minority,\" Islam, who works with a private firm in Dhaka, told UCA News.\n\nBangladesh descended into chaos hours before long-reigning Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina of the ruling Awami League (AL) party resigned and fled the country on Aug. 5, following the student-led nationwide protests.\n\nHasina's ouster marked the end of her 15-year authoritarian rule, which survived three allegedly rigged and controversial national elections in 2014, 2018, and 2024.\n\nSince protests turned violent on July 16, at least 439 people, including children and young students, have died in a series of violence, including the firing of police and armed cadres of AL and its collaborators, local media reported.\n\nAt least 114 people, including 14 policemen, were killed on Aug. 5, and another 108 died in clashes the next day, according to leading Bengali daily Prothom Alo (First Light).\n\nAmong those killed were AL leaders and supporters. Since Aug. 5, Hindu villages, temples, and businesses have been targeted as Hindus are seen as AL supporters in this Muslim-majority nation.\n\nAttacks on Hindus\n\nMore than 250 Hindu houses, temples, and businesses were torched, looted, and vandalized in the past two days in 20 districts across the country, according to the minority rights forum, Bangladesh Hindu Buddhist Christian Unity Council (BHBCUC).\n\nAt least five temples were attacked, one cremation ground was occupied, and women were physically assaulted in attacks targeting Hindu villages.\n\n\"The situation is bleak. Minorities are overwhelmed with attacks,\" said Rana Dasgupta, the council's general secretary.\n\nDuring an attack, at least 70 Hindu families fled a Hindu-majority village in the southwestern Bagherhat district. They spent their night under the open sky in a beel, a wetland used for agriculture during the dry season.\n\nAs millions cheered and celebrated the fall of the Hasina government on the streets of Dhaka and in other major cities, a group of people went on a plundering spree.\n\nSocial media audio-visuals showed thousands of people looting and ransacking the residences of former ministers and AL leaders, including Gonobhaban, the official residence of Hasina in Dhaka on Aug. 5. Many also intruded into the National Assembly building and looted whatever they could.\n\nWith no government in place and no police on the streets due to a series of attacks on police stations, many families passed sleepless nights on Aug. 4-5.\n\nThe military chief Waker-Uz-Zaman called on the people to calm down and refrain from anarchy during his address on Aug. 5, shortly after Hasina fled the country.\n\nHe said an interim government would soon be formed based on the consensus of political parties, civil society, and student leaders.\n\nHe added that there was no need to impose an emergency or curfew if people remained patient and followed his instructions.\n\n\"This is the ideal time for the predators to prey,\" Dasgupta said, calling on the army to protect minorities and form the interim government quickly to restore law and order.\n\nHe said many leaders of Bangladesh Puja Udjapan Parishad, the top Hindu religious body that oversees the nationwide Puja festival of Hindus, also came under attack in the past two days.\n\nThe Radhagobinda temple in Kuakata of the southern coastal district of Patuakhali was looted and vandalized.\n\nIn Keshabpur of Jashore, a southwestern district, at least 40 Hindu houses were looted and vandalized.\n\nAbout 50 shops were torched in Chourongibazar of the northern district of Dinajpur, where some Muslims occupied a cremation ground for hours before being driven away.\n\nIn Lohagora of Narail, women were assaulted during an attack on 25 Hindu houses, alleged the BHBCUC.\n\nPeaceful movement turns violent\n\nThe Students Against Discrimination, a movement of university students, began non-violent demonstrations on July 1, demanding reforms in the public service jobs quota system.\n\nIt soon became a nationwide anti-government movement after Hasina and her cabinet ministers made derogatory remarks against the protesters and refused to hold talks with their representatives. Police and ruling party supporters jointly unleashed a brutal crackdown, fanning the fire of students' anger.\n\nThe government imposed nationwide curfew, deployed military and slapped internet blackouts for days to defuse the protests but failed.\n\nAmid the political instability, other minority groups also have faced attacks.\n\nPhilemon Baske, a Catholic and Santal leader of the northern Gaibandha district, said the Christian-majority community came under several attacks since July 18.\n\nIn one case, a group destroyed a tractor worth about 2.7 million taka (US$23,014).\n\nSantal tribal people tried to file a criminal case but failed due to the internet blackout, Baske said.\n\nOn July 25, rice crops in some 1.5 hectares were destroyed by another group.\n\nSince mid-July, local Muslims occupied over 13.35 hectares of land in Bagda farm area of Gainbandha, he said.\n\nSantal people sought police help, but the police were busy handling the protesters, he added.\n\n\"We have lived confined ever since the unrest began. We are so scared,\" said Bichitra Tirkey, president of Jatiya Adivasi Parishad, a tribal rights forum covering northern Bangladesh.\n\nVictimization of minorities\n\nDasgupta said religious and ethnic minorities are often victimized during political movements in Bangladesh.\n\nHe referred to the case of Haradhon Hira, a Hindu AL leader from northern Rangpur district who was killed in a mob violence on Aug. 4.\n\nHira's dead body was carried around Rangpur City and hung from a bridge for two hours before he was taken to the funeral site. During that time, over 50 Hindu houses and temples were attacked and vandalized.\n\nIn some places, the mobs chanted anti-Hindu slogans, asking them to migrate to neighboring Hindu-majority India.\n\nObservers say the targeting of Hindus stems from two reasons - the Indian government's open support for Hasina and AL, and the Bangladeshi Hindus' support for AL.\n\nThe targeting of Hindus brought back memories of the 1991 anti-Hindu riots, allegedly orchestrated by Hussain Muhammad Ershad, who was Bangladesh's president from 1983 to 1990, heading a military dictatorship.\n\nHindus were also targeted after the national election of 2001, which saw the four-party alliance led by the Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP), the second-largest party, and Jamaat-e-Islami, the largest Islamist party, come to power.\n\nThe Awami League regime banned Jamaat on Aug. 1.\n\nBefore 1971, when Bangladesh was part of Pakistan, Hindus were victimized and attacked with state patronage, Dasgupta said.\n\nAbout 90 percent of Bangladesh's estimated 170 people are Muslims, about 8 percent are Hindus, and the rest belong to other faiths, including Christianity and Buddhism.\n\nAttacks on Hindus are common during national elections.", "source": {"uri": "southasiajournal.net", "dataType": "news", "title": "South Asia Journal"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

As thousands of protesters celebrated her ouster that afternoon, reports began to emerge of retaliation against members of Ms. Hasina's party, the Awami League, and against those seen as her allies, including the Hindu minority.\n\nIn addition to the party's offices and the homes of its members, the rioters targeted Hindus, torching their homes and vandalizing temples, according to witnesses and local media. Fears of more attacks were amplified in the absence of a government and with law enforcement retreating from sight in many parts of the country.\n\nIn addition to the almost 300 people killed during the government crackdown, at least 60 were killed in the violence that erupted on Monday in Muslim-majority Bangladesh. Reliable details about the attackers and victims were not immediately available.\n\nPrionthi Chatterjee, a Hindu student in Dhaka, the capital, said Muslims attacked her family at their home in the southern Bagerhat region, killing her father and leaving her mother with head injuries.\n\n\"My father was an innocent teacher,\" she said in a phone interview, adding that her parents tried to call the army and the police for help, but no one responded. Details about the incident could not be independently verified.\n\nThere were attacks on the homes of Hindus and their temples in at least four districts of Bangladesh, including villages near Chattogram, the country's second-most-populous city, according to witnesses and the relatives of people whose properties were targeted.\n\nThe student groups that led the protests against Ms. Hasina acknowledged the violence, but suggested their supporters were not involved.\n\n\"Temples are being attacked, vandalized and looted,\" Nahid Islam, one of the student leaders, said in a statement on Tuesday, blaming the attacks on those who want to \"destroy\" the student movement.\n\nThe president of Bangladesh, who holds a mostly ceremonial role, on Tuesday appointed the Nobel Peace Prize-winning microfinance pioneer Muhammad Yunus, to lead an interim government. Its members are expected to be announced within days.\n\nRestoring law and order will be one of the interim government's immediate challenges.\n\nDuring her 15 years in power, Ms. Hasina packed the police and the military with loyal officers, and public trust in law enforcement appeared to all but vanish during the violent crackdown against the protesters.\n\nOn Wednesday in Dhaka, no police officers were visible on the streets in some of the busiest areas.\n\nMeenakshi Ganguly, the deputy director for Asia at Human Rights Watch, described the reports of violence against Hindus as \"extremely concerning.\"\n\n\"Hindus are apparently being attacked because they traditionally supported her Awami League party. Bangladeshis came out on the streets to demand an end to authoritarianism, and these attacks undermine their just demand for human rights,\" she said in a statement.\n\nTensions between Muslims and Hindus in Bangladesh have boiled over in the past, including violent clashes across the country in 2021.", "source": {"uri": "dnyuz.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "DNyuz"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hindus", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Hindus"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prime_minister", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Prime minister"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bangladesh", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Bangladesh"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Bangladesh"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sheikh_Hasina", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Sheikh Hasina"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Temple", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Temple"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nazi_Germany", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Nazi Germany"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Awami_League", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Awami League"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muslims", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Muslims"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Districts_of_Bangladesh", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Districts of Bangladesh"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bagerhat_District", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Bagerhat District"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Bagerhat District"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Bangladesh"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chittagong", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Chittagong"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Chittagong"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Bangladesh"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dhaka", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Dhaka"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Dhaka"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Bangladesh"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Provisional_government", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Provisional government"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/President_of_Bangladesh", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "President of Bangladesh"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muhammad_Yunus", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Muhammad Yunus"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microfinance", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Microfinance"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_Rights_Watch", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Human Rights Watch"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Authoritarianism", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Authoritarianism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asia", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Asia"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Islam", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Islam"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_rights", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Human rights"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Terrorism", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Terrorism", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Warfare_and_Conflict", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Warfare and Conflict", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Crime_and_Justice", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Crime and Justice", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Victims", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Victims", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Death/Suicide", "label": "dmoz/Society/Death/Suicide", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 63}], "image": "https://dnyuz.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/Hindus-in-Bangladesh-Face-Revenge-Attacks-After-Prime-Ministers-Exit.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9792869", "eventUri": "eng-9792869", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.3098039215686275, "wgt": 142, "relevance": 1}

Mass Murders, Killings by Mob shows footage of violence and arson attacks on four houses, two of them have been identified to be owned by Muslims. The title of the video is clearly misleading as there was no mass murders reported in the incident. Local reports say one of the houses belonged to Bangladesh's freedom icon Sheikh Mujibur Rahman.\n\nThe video also makes unsubstantiated claims like \"24 burnt alive by mob\" and \"Minorities at the centre of attacks\".\n\nAl Jazeera has independently verified that only two Hindus have been killed since Hasina's ouster on Monday - one police officer and one activist with Hasina's Awami League party.\n\nHindus constitute about 8 percent of Bangladesh's 170 million people and have traditionally been strong supporters of the Awami League, which is generally viewed as secular compared with the opposition coalition, which includes an Islamist party.\n\nMany news reports of attacks on Hindus contain outlandish claims such as \"more than one crore [10 million] refugees are likely to enter West Bengal soon\", which was made in a Times of India report that quoted Suvendu Adhikari, a senior leader of Prime Minister Narendra Modi's governing Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP).\n\nThe ANI news agency, seen close to Modi's government, quoted a student leader in India as saying the mass uprising was \"orchestrated by the enemies of Bangladesh\".\n\nAn even more bizarre Times of India article stated that Jamaat-e-Islami, Bangladesh's biggest Islamist party, \"brought down Sheikh Hasina government in Bangladesh\".\n\nPolitical analyst Zahed Ur Rahman said Indian media have reported through an \"Islamophobic\" lens.\n\n\"The student movement that fomented the mass uprising involving people from all walks of life is unanimously understood as a popular movement here in Bangladesh. But Indian media somehow have been interpreting the whole scenario through their Islamophobic eye,\" he told Al Jazeera.\n\nAs Hasina fled the country on Monday, news articles in Indian media alleged that Bangladesh's protests were influenced by the Inter-Services Intelligence (ISI), a Pakistani spy agency, because it is seeking to turn Bangladesh into an Islamic state with the support of political parties like the Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP) and its former political ally Jamaat-e-Islami.\n\nSome media outlets even urged the Indian government to prepare for a potential refugee crisis, speculating that Hindus would be driven out of Bangladesh.\n\nSpeculation suggesting an ISI and Chinese connection to the popular Bangladesh movement was a common thread in social media posts by some commentators and media outlets.\n\nThe diplomatic affairs editor of The Economic Times, Dipanjan R Chaudhury, posted on X: \"Jamaat-e-Islami in Bangladesh politics doesn't bode well either for country or India. Jamaat track record of promoting cross border terror ... is part of recent history.\"\n\nThe television channel TV9 Gujarati with one million followers on X characterised the uprising as a \"coup\", stating on the social media platform: \"Is ISI behind the coup attack in Bangladesh? Is Jamaat-E-Islam behind the violent attacks?\"\n\nThese articles by Indian media and posts in social media contrast sharply with factual reports chronicling the events that led to the Hasina's resignation. She fled to India, which had backed her.\n\nLocal media in Bangladesh reported that since Monday night, several Hindu households across 20 of the country's 64 districts have been attacked and looted.\n\nAl Jazeera reached out to sources in some of these districts and discovered that the attacks on Hindu households were not driven by religious identity but by political affiliations.\n\nMustafizur Rahman Hiru, a rent-a-car driver from the central district of Narsingdi, told Al Jazeera that in his village, the two Hindu households targeted were home to local Awami League leaders.\n\n\"People were angry because these Hindu leaders were bullying others when the Awami League was in power. Now, with Hasina's fall, they are facing the backlash,\" he said.\n\nIn Jashore, a border district with India, a warehouse and home belonging to Babul Saha, a local government chairman who ran for office on the Awami League ticket, were attacked.\n\nAbdur Rab Haider, a resident of Jashore, told Al Jazeera that no Hindu household had been attacked without ties to the Awami League.\n\nRahman pointed out that Sajeeb Wazed Joy, Hasina's son, who resides in the United States, has given several interviews to Indian media, spreading rumors and unverified claims about attacks on Hindus and alleged operations by the ISI.\n\n\"Indian media merrily jumped onto it and spread Joy's bogus claims,\" Rahman told Al Jazeera.\n\nIn an interview with Al Jazeera, Gobindra Chandra Pramanik, a leader of the Hindu community in Bangladesh, stated that to his knowledge no Hindu households without connections to the Awami League were attacked.\n\n\"As a leader of the Hindu community, I can confirm that these attacks were politically motivated, not communal,\" he said. \"Across the country, 10 times more Muslim households affiliated with the Awami League were attacked.\"\n\nLocal media reported that since Monday night, more than 119 people - primarily Awami League leaders, activists and police - were killed in mob violence. Qadaruddin Shishir, the fact-checking editor for the AFP news agency, told Al Jazeera that only two of the victims were Hindus: one policeman and one Awami League activist.\n\nZafar Sobhan, editor of Bangladesh's Dhaka Tribune newspaper, told Al Jazeera that most of the Indian media \"as a general rule is clueless about Bangladesh\".\n\n\"I don't like to attribute to malice that which just as easily can be explained by incompetence. But the uniformity of the misinformation that is routinely peddled in the Indian media suggests that they are taking dictation from a common source,\" he said.\n\nBut an Indian academic rejected any allegation that the Indian media's reporting has been Islamophobic.\n\nSreeradha Datta, a professor at OP Jindal University in Sonipat in northern India, told Al Jazeera that the Indian media's concern about the safety of Hindus under a non-Hasina administration in Bangladesh stems from past experiences rather than Islamophobia.\n\nDatta noted that during previous non-Awami League governments, such as the BNP-Jamaat alliance, \"there was an increase in attacks on minorities, and this historical context continues to influence current perceptions.\"\n\nThe media's reporting has caused concern in India with several prominent Hindu religious leaders and politicians calling for the protection of Hindus.\n\nMeanwhile, images of individuals, including students from Muslim religious schools, standing watch in front of Hindu temples and homes have been widely circulated on social media.\n\nIn Brahmanbaria, a district with one of the largest Hindu populations in Bangladesh, residents, including students, stepped up to protect Hindu households.\n\nMunshi Azizul Haque, an apparel businessman from Brahmanbaria, told Al Jazeera that they are working to prevent any communal violence in the area. \"We've seen how Indian media are depicting attacks on minorities in Bangladesh on social media. The reality is quite different,\" he said.\n\nPramanik also acknowledged that Hindu temples were being protected.\n\nNews of Bangladeshi students, including from religious schools, volunteering to protect Hindu temples have been reported locally since the unrest began, and it has been picked up by outlets like Clarion India and The Wire.\n\nThese sites ran headlines stating \"Muslims Stand Guard at Temples, Call to Protect Minorities\" and \"Students Stand Guard Outside Temples and Churches in Wake of Attacks.\"\n\nSiddharth Varadarajan, founding editor of The Wire, told Al Jazeera that while there is legitimate and genuine concern about reports of attacks on Hindu places of worship, businesses and homes across more than two dozen districts in Bangladesh, the Indian media are also exaggerating the scale and extent of these incidents.\n\nAlso, he said, there is a section of the Indian media that is using the Bangladesh situation to boost anti-Muslim rhetoric \"in service of the BJP and [its ideological parent] RSS's agenda.\n\n\"For them, the ouster of Hasina is an Islamist conspiracy hatched in collaboration with Pakistan and China and that the target is India and Hindus,\" he said.\n\nNaresh Fernandez, editor of the Indian news portal Scroll.in, said Hindutva (right-wing Hindu nationalism) supporters in India are using the situation in Bangladesh \"as a screen on which to project their own anxieties, fantasies and conspiracy theories to serve their narrow political purposes\".\n\n\"They are claiming that Hasina's fall was actually engineered by international forces and that this is a rehearsal for a similar regime change to be effected in India,\" Fernandez told Al Jazeera.\n\nHe said, however, that Hindutva supporters are rightfully concerned about the safety of minorities in Bangladesh in this period of crisis, \"a concern that they fail to demonstrate about minorities in India\".\n\nPolitical analyst Farid Erkizia Bakht, meanwhile, suggested that misinformation spread by Indian media reflects New Delhi's intent to destabilise Dhaka. He noted that India has lost its most valuable ally in the subcontinent and is deeply concerned about the direction of the incoming administration.\n\nVaradarajan also echoed the sentiment.\n\n\"The popular uprising which unseated Hasina caught New Delhi by surprise, and the government is now scrambling to formulate a coherent and rational policy in the face of the new situation.\n\n\"It cannot welcome the student-led protest and bottom-up expression of people power or dismiss the change as a 'coup' or an 'anti-India conspiracy' either as the Hindutva right wing on social media is saying,\" he said.\n\n\"For now, New Delhi will be in a wait-and-watch mode. The focus will be on ensuring the safety of Indian nationals in Bangladesh and monitoring the situation of minorities there,\" he added.\n\nBangladeshi activist and author Aupam Debashis Roy told Al Jazeera that there had been attacks on Hindu minorities but the numbers have been overblown and Bangladesh is being portrayed as being taken over by \"Islamist forces\", which is not true, he said.\n\nThe nature of the soon-to-be-formed interim government will not be \"radical Islamist\" in nature, Roy said. \"But the BJP-leaning media wants to spread the world that Bangladesh is going to be in the hands of Islamists because it supports their [the BJP's] narrative ... built around previous laws like CAA and NRC,\" Roy said, referring to India's citizenship law and national register of citizens, which have been criticised as being directed against Muslims.\n\n\"They want to show that Bangladesh is a place for radical Islamists and Hindus and minorities are not safe here. I think that's why the BJP-leaning Indian media is spreading misinformation about attacks on minorities and an Islamist force taking over Bangladesh,\" he added.\n\nUS-based Bangladeshi political commentator Shafquat Rabbee Anik said the violence occurring in Bangladesh is a result of the \"collapse of the police force,\" which is \"mostly due to popular reprisal against excesses committed by them throughout the last 15 years\".\n\nOnce Nobel Peace Prize-winning economist Muhammad Yunus officially becomes the leader of the interim government, that will calm down \"Indian nerves\", Anik predicted.\n\n\"For one, it will be very hard to portray Yunus as an Islamist trying to take away the rights of the minorities and women.\"", "source": {"uri": "aljazeera.com", "dataType": "news",

Leader of Opposition Rahul Gandhi in a Parliament speech also accused the BJP of spreading fear and inciting violence.\n\nVarious international forums, including the U.S. State Department and European Union, have also flagged attacks on minorities, mosques and churches by the right wing Hindu groups in India.\n\nDespite this, the section of the Indian media, which is twisting the incidents in Bangladesh to suit its political masters back home, never bothered to question the attacks on minorities in India.", "source": {"uri": "ummid.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "https://www.ummid.com/"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hindus", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Hindus"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muslims", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Muslims"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hindu_temple", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Hindu temple"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_media", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Social media"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/India", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "India"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bangladesh", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Bangladesh"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Bangladesh"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2019\u20132020_Hong_Kong_protests", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "2019\u20132020 Hong Kong protests"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/S._Jaishankar", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "S.

Is Hindu Community Being Targeted? Details", "body": "Bangladesh is experiencing extreme turmoil as anti-quota demonstrations escalate into deadly clashes that have claimed over 100 lives and targeted Hindu communities.\n\nBangladesh Unrest: More than 100 people reportedly have died in various incidents during the ongoing anti-quota protests in Bangladesh, making it the deadliest crisis after independence. It has even turned out to be a scene of violent clashes, with the most recent of unrest being in the situation of attacking Hindu communities in the Noakhali district and Rangpur town.\n\nExclusive Footage of Rioters Targeting Hindu Homes\n\nIn Noakhali, where the situation has reached a boiling point, visuals can be seen for the first time of rioters trying to break into the house of Tanusreya Bhatta, a Hindu resident, exclusively accessed by CNN-News18. The video captured the terror of the women inside who were banging the doors and wailing \"bhagwan, bhagwan\" in distress, as the attackers tried to break in. Killing two Hindus, among whom was Hindu Awami League leader Haradhan Roy and his nephew, left the condition worse in Rangpur.\n\nThe situation has attracted massive international concern and Indian government is fully into it, talking to high officials in Bangladesh. \"We are talking to the top brass of the Bangladesh Government. Sheikh Hasina is also listening to our advice, and we are working closely on this issue,\" said an Indian government source. Advisory measures also have been issued to Indians and students in Bangladesh, and evacuation is prepared according to need.\n\nProtests Against Quota Reservations for Government Jobs\n\nThe cause of the unrest is basically rooted in protests against a 30% quota under reservation for government jobs, which was reserved for the families of the 1971 veterans of the war. The demand for the resignation of Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina spiraled despite the Supreme Court verdict that reduced the fixed 30 percent imposed by the government to 5 percent.\n\nThings went even worse when the opposition groups were actively promoting that students and general citizens were to carry arms, and protest against taxes and utility services by refusing to pay the same. According to sources, the army of Bangladesh has further complicated the situation because of its support of the movement with the use of automatic weapons.\n\nRisks of the Bangladesh Crisis Worsening\n\nIf this devastating crisis in Bangladesh remains unchecked, the international community and neighborhood countries need to remain close observers of the emerging scenarios to determine a modus operandi to curb violence and restore normalcy in the region.", "source": {"uri": "dnpindia.in", "dataType": "news", "title": "DNP INDIA"}, "authors": [{"uri": "sparsh_goel@dnpindia.in", "name": "Sparsh Goel", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hindus", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Hindus"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bangladesh", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Bangladesh"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Bangladesh"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Noakhali_District", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Noakhali District"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Noakhali District"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Bangladesh"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rangpur_City", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Rangpur City"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Rangpur City"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Bangladesh"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Partition_of_India", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Partition of India"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Government_of_India", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Government of India"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Awami_League", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Awami League"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cabinet_of_Bangladesh", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Cabinet of Bangladesh"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sheikh_Hasina", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Sheikh Hasina"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supreme_Court_of_India", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Supreme Court of India"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_community", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "International community"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/India", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "India"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Warfare_and_Conflict", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Warfare and Conflict", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Activism", "label": "dmoz/Society/Activism", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Religion_and_Spirituality/Hinduism", "label": "dmoz/Society/Religion and Spirituality/Hinduism", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Government_Operations", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Government Operations", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 82}], "image": "https://www.dnpindia.in/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/Bangladesh-Unrest-1.webp", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9792869", "eventUri": "eng-9792869", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.4274509803921569, "wgt": 141, "relevance": 1}

In this vein, Meenakshi Ganguly, the Deputy Asia Director of Human Rights Watch resorted to whitewashing the crimes against Hindus being committed by Islamists saying that it is due to political reasons and not hatred against Hindus.\n\nTaking to X on 7 August, Meenakshi Ganguly wrote, \"In #Bangladesh, musician Rahul Ananda's house burned in an ugly spree of attacks on Hindu minorities because they traditionally supported Sheikh Hasina's Awami League party. Authorities should ensure rule of law, identify & prosecute perpetrators.\"\n\nAs reported earlier, on the afternoon of 5 August, an Islamist mob reached the house of the singer and frontman of the band Joler Gaan, Rahul Ananda. He was living in a rental house that was attacked. When the attack happened, Rahul, his wife Shukla, his son Tota and other family members were there. Somehow, they managed to escape and took shelter at an unknown location. The house, where Rahul lived, was a 140-year-old place which has now been burnt to ashes with all the memories and history it contained.\n\nNotably, back in 2019, Meenakshi Ganguly had claimed that Kashmiri Pandits were 'asked' to leave the valley, presumably by the Indian State, in 1990.\n\nIt is pertinent to note that Ganguly is not alone in peddling the sinister narrative that Hindus, their temples and properties are not being attacked by Islamists due to their hatred for Hindus but as revenge for their perpetual support for Sheikh Hasina's Awami League. As reported earlier in the day, the New York Times changed the headline of one of its published news reports after facing severe backlash from readers. Earlier, the headline read \"Hindus in Bangladesh Face Revenge Attacks After Prime Minister's Exit\" which attracted heavy criticism on social media. Though the title has been changed, the content remained the same, pushing the narrative that Hindus were being targeted as they supported Hasina's political party and not because of communal reasons.\n\nWhile killing Hindus, and vandalising their houses and temples is not justified even if they supported Sheikh Hasina's political party, let's for argument's sake assume it is indeed the case, would Meenakshi Ganguly, Human Rights Watch, NYT and other Islamist cheerleaders mind explaining how checking a deceased victim's private part determines one's political affiliation? In one such incident Islamists encircled a dead victim lying on the ground while several men were gathered around the deceased. With the aid of a stick, one of the Islamists strips the deceased person naked and checks the victim's private part for circumcision. The happiness of the Islamist had no bounds and he started shouting 'Hindu, Hindu' over the corpse, the crowd hovering over the dead body laughed, realising that the man was a Hindu because he was not circumcised.\n\nIt is opprobrious that so-called human rights defenders are giving the communally motivated anti-Hindu violence a political colour to make sure nobody criticises or questions their Islamist overlords\n\nOn 5th August, it came to light that Islamists attacked Hindus' houses, shops and temples in Bangladesh in the guise of protests against the Sheikh Hasina government.

Hindu temples were targeted in several cities, including Natore, Dhaka, Patuakhali, and Jessore. In response, several students and clerics reportedly gathered in front of the temples to protect them from mob violence.\n\nLike its neighbor India, Bangladesh has a history of religious tensions between its Hindu and Muslim communities. In recent years, the Bangladeshi Hindu minority, which makes up 8% of the population, has been targeted by violent mobs several times. However, many reports about the attacks on Hindu temples and communities by Bangladeshi protesters were not true.\n\nHindu cricketer's house 'set on fire'\n\nClaim: \"Bangladeshi Hindu cricketer Liton Das' house has been set on fire\"\n\nA post on X(formerly Twitter) alleged that the house of Liton Das, a famous Bangladeshi Hindu cricketer, had been set on fire, sharing a collage of two pictures as evidence.\n\nIn one image a young man can be seen sitting next to a Hindu place of worship and the other image shows a burning house. More than a million users have seen the post. The collage was also shared by numerous other accounts with similar claims.\n\nThe man in the picture is indeed Liton Das, and a reverse image search shows that the image was taken from his official account. However, the burning mansion is not his home. A reverse search of that image leads to media reports about former Bangladesh cricket team captain Mashrafe Mortaza's house being set on fire by protesters.\n\nDW also geolocated the house and confirmed it belonged to Mortaza, who became a target due to his political activities and close alliance with Hasina's Awami League party. The Muslim sportsman was a member of parliament, having won a seat for the second consecutive time as an Awami League candidate during the general elections held in Bangladesh earlier this year.\n\nClaims about rape, sexual harassment of Hindu women\n\nThere are many claims circulating on various social media platforms about sexual violence against women from the Hindu minority in Bangladesh. Two have been shared multiple times and viewed thousands of times. But some are old, and some have been proven to be earlier events presented out of context, like this case.\n\nClaim: A video shows Muslim men waving a Hindu woman's underwear\n\nThe post on X says, \"Look carefully at these Bangladeshi Muslims: Hindu girls' bras were removed and then they were raped. Now he is roaming the streets with that bra shamelessly and presenting proof of his manhood.\" As of publication, the post had about 30,000 views.\n\nDW fact check: False\n\nThe 23-second video shows protesters storming the prime minister's official residence. Many pictures and videos have been published online showing rioters looting Hasina's belongings, including her clothes and underwear since she fled the country. In the last seconds of the video, a building with red-brown walls is visible, resembling Ganabhaban, the official residence of the Bangladeshi prime minister.\n\nA comparison of the building in the video and images of Ganabhaban from agency footage shows that the building is indeed the official residence of the former prime minister. In the photo below, the palm trees and window shapes match those seen in the last seconds of the video.\n\nAnother post on X shares a screenshot of a Telegram post with a tilted picture of a woman being restrained, accompanied by Bengali text threatening Hindus and encouraging violence to drive them back to India.\n\nClaim: A Hindu woman was sexually assaulted and gang-raped by a group of Muslim men at the University of Dhaka.\n\nThis post (warning: extreme, graphic violence) was published on August 2, three days before Hasina fled the country. But it has been increasingly shared by numerous other accounts in recent days, to date garnering more than 30,000 views.\n\nThe caption reads: \"The so-called Jamaat-e-Islami quota protesters leaked a video of the gang rape of a Hindu girl to the Islamic army group. If Hasina's government falls, they have threatened to rape all Hindu girls out of their homes.\"\n\nDW fact check: False\n\nA reverse image search of that same screenshot has been shared in past years with claims of rape and sexual abuse, but from different regions. For example, it was attributed to a gang rape in the Indian province of Manipur in 2023, claiming to show Hindu men kidnapping and gang-raping a Christian girl. In 2021, it went viral in Indonesia, claiming to show an Indonesian migrant worker woman tortured and raped by five Bangladeshi citizens.\n\nThe Indian fact-checking platform Boom traced the video back to its origin in East Bengaluru's Ramamurthy Nagar in May 2021, where police arrested 12 Bangladeshi nationals, including three women, for the assault and rape of a 22-year-old.\n\nAI images also used to stir emotions\n\nThe plethora of unverified social posts aimed at heightening ethnic tensions in Bangladesh haven't just used old or manipulated images and videos. Content generated by artificial intelligence has also played a role.\n\nOne AI-generated image is going viral on platforms like X and Facebook. It depicts a massive crowd gathered around a towering flagpole with the Bangladeshi flag waving at the top, under a hazy sky. The scene suggests a large-scale event or demonstration, symbolizing national pride and unity.\n\nThe image exhibits typical signs of AI generation. The figures on the pole have disfigured, abnormal legs and the perspective is off, with the vertical pole and the background crowd view appearing unusual. Additionally, the proportions of the people on the pole and those below do not match. Several pieces of rope seem to float in the air without connection.\n\nModified versions of this graphic have also been used to promote claims of ethnic violence. For instance, one version includes the words \"ALL EYES ON BANGLADESH, SAVE HINDUS.\" Another AI-generated photomaking the rounds shows a burning Hindu temple with the superimposed \"ALL EYES ON BANGLADESH HINDUS\" text. The foreground depicts numerous bodies lying on the ground, with blood and debris, creating a scene of violence and destruction.", "source": {"uri": "cdn.timesofoman.com", "dataType": "news", "title":

The anti-government movement has now started targeting Hindus, leading to deliberate killings, attacks on Hindu homes, looting of shops, vandalism and arson of temples, rapes, and displacement. This has created a climate of fear among the minority Hindus,\" said Shinde.\n\nThe HJS has put forth certain urgent demands, including strict directives to the Bangladesh Army to halt attacks on Hindu and their properties, temples or idol vandalism, stop atrocities on their women, and relocate them to secure areas with security and compensation for the loss of lives and properties.\n\nShinde said the government should raise the matter at the UN level and seek a UN delegation visit to Bangladesh, while the displaced Hindues seeking asylum here should be accommodated under the CAA.\n\nHe called for measures considering the illegal entry of over around five crore Bangladeshis into India and to curb the possibility of increased infiltration in the wake of the current political upheavals there which could fuel fanatical Jihadi terrorists with support of hidden sympathisers.", "source": {"uri": "weeklyvoice.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Weekly Voice"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hindus", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Hindus"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bangladesh", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Bangladesh"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Bangladesh"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Temple", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Temple"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hindu_temple", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Hindu temple"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Narendra_Modi", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Narendra Modi"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mumbai", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Mumbai"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Mumbai"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Citizenship_(Amendment)_Act,_2019", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Citizenship (Amendment) Act, 2019"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anti-Hindu_sentiment", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Anti-Hindu sentiment"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Looting", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Looting"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anarchism", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Anarchism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arson", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Arson"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vandalism", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Vandalism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Right_of_asylum", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Right of asylum"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rape", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Rape"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genocide", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Genocide"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pakistan", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Pakistan"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Pakistan"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bangladesh_Army", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Bangladesh Army"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crore", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Crore"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jihadism", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Jihadism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Nations", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "United Nations"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Terrorism", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Terrorism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Espionage", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Espionage"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/India", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "India"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Warfare_and_Conflict", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Warfare and Conflict", "wgt": 9}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Violence_and_Abuse", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Violence and Abuse", "wgt": 9}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Religion_and_Spirituality/Hinduism", "label": "dmoz/Society/Religion and Spirituality/Hinduism", "wgt": 26}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Government_Operations", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Government Operations", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 71}], "image": "https://weeklyvoice.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/202408073201558.png", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9792869", "eventUri": "eng-9792869", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-08-07", "textStart": 8, "textEnd": 13}], "sentiment": -0.07450980392156858, "wgt": 140, "relevance": 1}

On the 8 of August, the Qatar-funded propaganda portal Al Jazeera attempted to pass off the communally motivated attacks on Hindus as an act of political revenge. While denying the ongoing Hinduphobia as false, the publication then went on to claim that India media houses reporting the attacks on Hindus in Bangladesh is Islamophobic and Alarmist.\n\nAl Jazeera published an article titled \"Islamophobic, alarmist': How some India outlets covered Bangladesh crisis\" by Gurvinder Singh on 9th August. Invoking 'Islamophobia' is the most reliable and effective tactic of Islamist pens for hire to downplay the crimes of Islamist terrorism against non-Muslims and guilt-trip people questioning or criticising Islamists.\n\nThe article claimed that Times Group's Mirror Now ran misleading news that 24 were burnt alive by a mob and \"minorities at the centre of attacks\" to insinuate that Hindus have been burnt alive. However, the said video report neither claimed that all those killed were Hindus nor did it claim that only Hindus were being attacked across the country.\n\nWhile the Al Jazeera report claims that only two people have been killed since Sheikh Hasina's ouster, media reports including reports by Bangladesh media show that many more Hindus have been killed. Moreover, entire Hindu villages are being attacked, leading to hundreds of Hindus trying to enter India.\n\nThe Qatar-funded Islamist propaganda outlet, further alleged that several other Indian media reports made \"outlandish claims\" by quoting some Indian politicians and Muslim student bodies expressing their concerns and apprehensions regarding the unrest in Bangladesh. Exposing its admiration for Islamists, Al Jazeera also targeted the Times of India for its report saying that Jamaat-e-Islami, the biggest Islamist party of Bangladesh \"brought down Sheikh Hasina government in Bangladesh\".\n\nWhile Al Jazeera insinuated that somehow Jamaat-e-Islami had nothing to do with the ongoing violence in Bangladesh, their involvement in exploiting the anti-quota protests to oust the Sheikh Hasina-led government is widely reported. In fact, both, Jamaat-e-Islami (JeI) and the Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP), notorious for their anti-India and extremist views, hijacked the anti-quota protests, using them to undermine the Awami League government. As their supporters joined the fray, the student-led movement was transformed into a larger anti-government campaign.\n\nNotably, initially the anti-quota protestors and the Sheikh Hasina govt were on the same side, and the protest was essentially against a High Court order. The govt had actually abolished 30% for families of freedom fighters, but the High Court restored that quota, leading to protests by the students. Hasina govt had appealed against the order at the Supreme Court, and the student groups also filed similar appeals. But within days, other elements like Jamaat-e-Islami infiltrated the protests, leading to widespread violence.\n\nThis is why the protests continued even after the Supreme Court quashed the High Court order, and removed other reservations too, bringing it down to just 7% from 56%. It is by now clear that anti-quota protestors didn't result in the fall of the Sheikh Hasina govt, it was the movement hijacked by Islamists groups in the country.\n\nAfter invoking the \"Islamophobia\", the Al Jazeera propaganda piece also attempted to hand a clean chit to Pakistan's ISI which has allegedly been involved in fuelling anti-Hasina protests by backing BNP and JeI to turn Bangladesh into an Islamic nation. It is not too difficult to understand that no intelligence agency jumps and claims credit for such regime change operations if they are involved in it. The claims of the involvement of ISI and even the US in Sheikh Hasina's ouster are not completely unsubstantiated since Hasina had repeatedly raised alarms that the US and other foreign elements were conspiring to oust her government and even carve out a separate country.\n\nOpIndia reported how Pakistani social media handles had fueled this social unrest in Bangladesh and how it amplified fake news and anti-government propaganda shared by notorious Bangladeshi handles. Recently, Sheikh Hasina's son Sajeeb Wazed Joy also alleged ISI's involvement in Bangladesh unrest and said, \"I am quite certain given the circumstantial evidence; I suspect Pakistan ISI's involvement. The attacks and protests were very coordinated, meticulously planned, and intentional efforts to keep inflaming the situation through social media. No matter what the government did to control the situation, they kept trying to worsen it.\"\n\nWhile Hindus across Bangladesh are being attacked, their houses being plundered, and temples being vandalised, Al Jazeera attempted to whitewash the communal angle in the ongoing anti-Hindu pogrom by claiming that only those Hindus associated with Sheikh Hasina's Awami League are being targeted. Al Jazeera's disdain for Hindus has reached such an extent that to defend Islamists, the propaganda outlet resorted to demonising Hindu victims.\n\nQuoting a random car driver Mustafizur, the article claimed that Hindus were 'bullying' others when Awami League was in power so now they are facing the backlash.\n\nThe Islamist propaganda outlet quoted Gobind Chandra Pramanik, who served as general secretary of Bangladesh National Hindu Mahajot but was removed from his post, to back its false claim that only Hindus with Awami League connections are being attacked not the rest. It is pertinent to note that Gobind Chandra Pramanik was recently removed from his post by the Mahajot after he made false claims that Hindus were not attacked and their temples were not vandalised after PM Hasina's ouster.\n\nEvidently, Al Jazeera is quoting a person notorious for making false statements and also having pro-BNP views, to whitewash Islamist atrocities against Hindus since Hindu names add more impact and give the impression that \"see, the Hindu leader himself is saying Hindus were not attacked\".\n\nNotably, the New York Times had recently changed the headline of one of its published news reports after facing severe backlash from readers. Earlier, the headline read \"Hindus in Bangladesh Face Revenge Attacks After Prime Minister's Exit\" which attracted heavy criticism on social media. Though the title has been changed to \"Hindus in Bangladesh Face Attacks After Prime Minister's Exit\", the content remained the same, pushing the narrative that Hindus were being targeted as they supported Hasina's political party and not because of communal reasons.\n\nSimilarly, Meenakshi Ganguly, the Deputy Asia Director of Human Rights Watch resorted to whitewashing the crimes against Hindus being committed by Islamists saying that it is due to political reasons and not hatred against Hindus.\n\nOpIndia has reported numerous verified incidents of target attacks by Muslim mobs on Hindu temples and Hindu houses. While there have been incidents wherein the mob targeted Hindu leaders of the Awami League, the attacks are not confined to political rivalries or revenge. While attacks on Hindu temples itself make it evident since temples don't have any political affiliation but are simply the abode of Hindu deities, Hindus regardless of their political leanings have been singled out and attacked.\n\nSpeaking to OpIndia, several Bangladeshi Hindus said that Jamaat-e-Islami members have been making a list of Hindu businesses and Hindu houses since the fall of Sheikh Hasina. In one of the most horrifying incidents, Islamists encircled a dead victim lying on the ground while several men were gathered around the deceased. With the aid of a stick, one of the Islamists strips the deceased person naked and checks the victim's private part for circumcision. The happiness of the Islamist had no bounds and he started shouting 'Hindu, Hindu' over the corpse, the crowd hovering over the dead body laughed, realising that the man was a Hindu because he was not circumcised. Probably, Al-Jazeera would come up with an argument that Islamists were checking the deceased man's private part to determine his political affiliation.\n\nMuch like the \"Muslims forming human to protect Hindu temples\" claims made by AltNews's Mohammed Zubair and others in India to defend the murderous actions of Bangladeshi Islamists, Al Jazeera also claimed that Muslims were protecting Hindu houses in Brahmanbaria, a Hindu majority area. \"News of Bangladeshi students, including from religious schools, volunteering to protect Hindu temples have been reported locally since the unrest began, and it has been picked up by outlets like Clarion India and The Wire,\" the article reads.\n\nIn one same article, Al-Jazeera went from Hindus not being targeted for religious identity to Muslims protecting Hindu houses in an area with large Hindu populations. Most importantly, even if we assume they are protecting Hindu houses, then from whom are protecting them? Islamists or aliens?\n\nQuoting the cheerleaders of Islamists -- the left-liberals -- in India including leftist propaganda portal TheWire's founder editor Siddharth Varadrajan, the Al Jazeera propaganda piece authored by Faisal Mahmud and Saqib Sarker, asserted that the Indian media is exaggerating the anti-Hindu violence in Bangladesh and using them to \"boost anti-Muslim rhetoric \"in service of the BJP and [its ideological parent] RSS's agenda.\"\n\n\"For them, the ouster of Hasina is an Islamist conspiracy hatched in collaboration with Pakistan and China and the target is India and Hindus,\" Varadrajan said.\n\nWhile ISI's hand is suspected to be behind fueling violence in Bangladesh, the BJP-RSS or its supporters have largely and rightly blamed the local Islamist mobs for violence against Hindus. Moreover, much like the concern voiced by World Hindu Federation (Bangladesh)'s secretary General in conversation with OpIndia, that \"if Bangladesh becomes a Hindu-free and Islamic-extremist country, India will be the biggest sufferer\", the Hindus here are concerned about Bangladeshi Hindus and the impact the neighbouring country's unrest will have on India.\n\nMeanwhile, Naresh Fernandez, the editor of the leftist propaganda portal Scroll dragged Hindutva into the context to claim that Hindutva supporters are peddling their conspiracy theories and fantasies including the hand of foreign elements in regime change operations in Bangladesh and potential replication of the same in India. Fernandez said that some of the concerns raised by Hindutva supporters are legitimate but they fail to show the same concern for Indian minorities as Hindus are walking on streets with lethal weapons and carrying out target killings of Muslims and other minority groups just as in Bangladesh.\n\nNotably, OpIndia recently reported how Scroll defended targeted violence against Hindus in Bangladesh by calling it the 'inevitable aftermath of uprising' and even blaming 'Hindutva' alongside claiming the Hindu victims were 'Awami League supporters'.\n\nBy describing the anti-Hindu violence as solely political, propaganda outlets like Al-Jazeera downplay the fundamental religious hatred of BNP and JeI supporting Islamists that underpin these attacks. The targeted destruction of Hindu temples and the assault on Hindus are unmistakable signs of religious persecution, and any attempt to dismiss or mischaracterise these actions as purely political does a disservice to the victims and the greater understanding of the unrest prevailing. However, that's exactly what Al-Jazeera wants to do, they are using 'Islamophobia' as a tool to prevent Hindus and others worldwide from speaking about the ongoing genocide of Hindus in Bangladesh.\n\nSpeaking to OpIndia, Dipan Mitra, the secretary general of the World Hindu Federation (Bangladesh Chapter) said that Islamist sympathising media outlets like Al-Jazeera misleading their readers. When asked about Al Jazeera's claim that only those Hindus who had connections with the Awami League were targeted, Mitra said that this was \"totally wrong\". \"Those attacked are 99 percent Hindus, till now, even on yesterday night, they [Muslim mobs] torched Hindu houses, looted their properties, and burned their shops even in Dhaka,\" he said.\n\nFurthermore, debunking the \"Muslims protecting Hindu temples\" claims, Mitra told us that if it was actually the case, then why are temples across the country being vandalised? \"It is just a stunt. They take photos near Hindu temples, publish them [on social media] and leave. This is just an eyewash for global leaders and people worldwide that oh, see, even Muslims are protecting Hindu temples. But this is totally wrong.\n\nSpeaking about Bangladeshi author Aupam Debasis Roy's claim that the numbers regarding attacks on Hindu minorities in Bangladesh are being overblown and that the country is not being taken over by Islamist forces, Mitra said these sort of 'intellectuals' are maybe taking \"facilities and support\" from Jamaat-e-Islami to speak in favour of them. They [Jamaat] find such people and provide them financial support and other support since most people will believe their lies if a Hindu author or writer says it to spread their propaganda.\n\nOn being asked about leftist-Islamist propaganda portals dismissing the allegations of ISI's involvement in fomenting unrest in Bangladesh, the WHF (Bangladesh) leader said that the answer to this lies in the fact that \"just yesterday Mohammed Yunus who is going to lead the interim government in Bangladesh said that if Bangladesh becomes unstable, India's \"seven sisters\" and West Bengal will not be safe. I ask them why. I believe it. I believe that ISI is behind the turmoil in Bangladesh.\"\n\nHe further pointed out that the opposition parties and political leaders like Mohammed Yunus who always opposed Sheikh Hasina, backed the anti-India campaigns. He added that these parties never support or see India as a friendly country, rather they see India more as an enemy. Mitra also told OpIndia that Mohammed Yunus is a pro-US leader and might act like the US's puppet.", "source": {"uri": "opindia.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "OpIndia"}, "authors": [{"uri":

The focus has largely been on the broader geopolitical tensions, with little attention given to the plight of the Hindu minority. CoHNA is calling on US lawmakers to acknowledge this crisis and act to prevent further atrocities.\n\nIn their appeal, CoHNA has urged US Secretary of State Antony Blinken and the US State Department to closely monitor the situation and ensure that the Bangladeshi authorities take immediate steps to protect their Hindu citizens.\n\nThey have called for the perpetrators of the violence to be held accountable and have requested that the US facilitate the resettlement of the most vulnerable Bangladeshi Hindus through the US Refugee Admissions Program (USRAP).\n\n\"We cannot afford to be silent,\" said CoHNA in their statement, adding, \"The United States has a moral responsibility to prevent another genocide and to stand up for the rights of religious minorities. We urge our lawmakers to issue strong public statements condemning the violence and to take concrete actions that will bring international attention to this crisis.\"\n\nCoHNA has also requested an urgent meeting with US lawmakers to discuss both short-term and long-term solutions to the crisis. They emphasized that silence is not an option and that decisive action by the US could make a significant difference in preventing further violence and protecting the Hindu community in Bangladesh.\n\nThe Coalition of Hindus of North America (CoHNA) is an advocacy group dedicated to promoting the rights and well-being of Hindus across the continent. They work to raise awareness of issues affecting the Hindu community and to foster a greater understanding of Hindu culture and values.\n\nThis report is auto-generated from a syndicated feed\n\nComments", "source": {"uri": "indiandefensenews.in", "dataType": "news", "title": "indiandefensenews.in"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hindus", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Hindus"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coalition_(Australia)", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Coalition (Australia)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_America", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "North America"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bangladesh", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Bangladesh"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Bangladesh"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/India", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "India"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diaspora", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Diaspora"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Temple", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Temple"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sexual_violence", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Sexual violence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vandalism", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Vandalism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Military", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Military"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Department_of_State", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States Department of State"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Washington_(state)", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Washington (state)"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Washington (state)"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operation_Searchlight", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Operation Searchlight"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Persecution_of_Hindus", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Persecution of Hindus"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bengali_Hindus", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Bengali Hindus"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/East_Pakistan", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "East Pakistan"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geopolitics", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Geopolitics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bengali_language", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Bengali language"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genocide", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Genocide"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Refugee", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Refugee"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antony_Blinken", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Antony Blinken"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hinduism", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Hinduism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advocacy_group", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Advocacy group"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Secretary_of_State", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "United States Secretary of State"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Terrorism", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Terrorism", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Warfare_and_Conflict", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Warfare and Conflict", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Immigration", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Immigration", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Theft", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Theft", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 84}], "image": "https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEj2t2S0YxOlD7BhyWt9UMgQW2lr_ZKVwABz5DfrJrKZdIqlV49_cA3wq07mC9RRE7Hwb_qpTuYy49uq1SF7NiAO-bGJ_hgd74ioqghGNFT6T6vqmTry0bBLNRkfVG8-XwjRreIXr1qnTFoa0V82dA3-qZ4Bng6vM-ZowFHR1bdCCBttiA2zZ_qWnge5-0U/w1200-h630-p-k-no-nu/Bangladesh_Protest_1.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9792869", "eventUri": "eng-9792869", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "date": "2008-08-", "textStart": 140, "textEnd": 149}], "sentiment": -0.4196078431372549, "wgt": 137, "relevance": 1}

I may not be able to physically protect them, but I can give them courage.

He attributed the violence to attempts to malign the achievements of the student-led movement against the Hasina regime and argued that such chaos could be used to \"discredit\" their efforts.\n\nWhile he has downplayed the attack on Hindus, it was his employer media house, The Daily Star, that had reported that there were attacks on Hindus in 27 districts across Bangladesh.\n\nInterestingly, The Wire is not the only media house in India that has tried to downplay the attacks on Hindus. The Scroll in a report claimed that the attack on Hindus happened due to their affiliation to Sheikh Hasina's party, Awami League. On the international platform, The New York Times called the attack on Hindus \"revenge attacks\" in the headline of a report and changed it after backlash on social media.\n\nApart from the attack on Hindus, they discussed several other points regarding the regime change in Bangladesh. When asked about the current situation in the country, Sajen Shamsuddoza said that people were feeling uncertain about the future as there was no government for two days and reports of violence including reports of attacks on minorities, vandalism and attacks on people in general came out.\n\nHe further asserted that the protests were not yet over as the demands of students had not been met completely. The students that have been protesting have demanded reforms in the state system and the constitution of the country and only after these demands are addressed, there could be \"hope for the future\". He said, \"The students have proposed a period of three to six years for the interim government to create new political parties and bring changes. There is a common feeling that the people want a new political party rather than the existing ones.\"\n\nSpeaking on the possibility of fundamentalists taking control of the country, Sajen Shamsuddoza said that Islamic parties like Jamaat-e-Islami have never gained more than 5% votes in elections. He further claimed that the student protesters are more focused on restoring democracy than promoting fundamentalism.\n\nInterestingly, despite being a journalist from Bangladesh, he completely ignored the fact that the main opposition party, BNP, is no less than a fundamentalist. BNP leans more towards Pakistan which has pushed the party cadre towards radicalisation. Not to forget, the vice chairperson Tarique Rahman of BNP is a convict in a terror attack that killed 24 people in 2004 and there have been calls to let him come back to Bangladesh by none other than an ex-US Diplomat.", "source": {"uri": "opindia.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "OpIndia"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hindus", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Hindus"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sheikh_Hasina", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Sheikh Hasina"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bangladesh", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Bangladesh"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Bangladesh"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Wire_(India)", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "The Wire (India)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Daily_Star_(Bangladesh)", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "The Daily Star (Bangladesh)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/India", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "India"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Floyd_protests", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "George Floyd protests"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Journalist", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Journalist"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Awami_League", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Awami League"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regime_change", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Regime change"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_New_York_Times", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "The New York Times"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_media", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Social media"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jamaat-e-Islami", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Jamaat-e-Islami"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tarique_Rahman", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Tarique Rahman"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leninism", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Leninism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Provisional_government", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Provisional government"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bangladesh_Nationalist_Party", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Bangladesh Nationalist Party"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Islamic_fundamentalism", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Islamic fundamentalism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democracy", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Democracy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constitution", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Constitution"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fundamentalism", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Fundamentalism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Islam", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Islam"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Political_party", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Political party"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pakistan", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Pakistan"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Pakistan"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Terrorism", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Terrorism", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Warfare_and_Conflict", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Warfare and Conflict", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Activism/Media", "label": "dmoz/Society/Activism/Media", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Territorial_Disputes", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Territorial Disputes", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 99}], "image": "https://www.opindia.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/wire.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9792869", "eventUri": "eng-9792869", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-08-07", "textStart": 228, "textEnd": 238}], "sentiment": -0.6, "wgt": 135, "relevance": 1}

Throughout her tenure, Hasina dealt Islamic fundamentalists with an iron fist, including those from the main opposition party BNP, which has connections to the terror group Al Qaeda. Now that policy could come back to haunt the country's minorities.\n\nImmediately after Bangladesh PM Sheikh Hasina resigned and fled the country, scenes of thousands of violent protesters storming the compound of her residence, stealing her utensils, sarees, undergarments and flashing them as war booty and subsequently scaling the iconic parliament building brought us a glimpse of the ominous times that lies ahead for Bangladesh, another nation where democracy was snuffed out by rampaging Islamists, only to give way for a military rule.\n\nGeneral Waker-Uz-Zaman, the army chief of Bangladesh, announced on Monday that an interim government would assume control. He assured that the military would \"step back\" and commit to initiating an investigation into the fatal crackdown on student protesters.\n\n\"There is a crisis in the country. I have met Opposition leaders, and we have decided to form an interim government to run this country. I take all responsibility and promise to protect your life and property. Your demands will be fulfilled. Please support us and stop the violence. If you work with us, we can move towards a proper solution. We cannot achieve anything through violence,\" he said.\n\nOn Monday, August 5, 2024, Bangladesh PM Sheikh Hasina resigned and fled as ongoing nationwide protests turned violent. Hundreds of protesters stormed her official residence, waving flags and raising slogans against her, shortly after she fled, stealing utensils, sarees, and other belongings from her residence.\n\nAfter resigning as Prime Minister, Sheikh Hasina left Bangladesh and arrived at the Hindon Air Base near Delhi. She was expected to fly to London, reports said.\n\nDue to the unrest in Bangladesh, the BSF issued a high alert along the India-Bangladesh border. As a result, both passenger and freight train services heading towards the border areas have been suspended.\n\nNevertheless, Sheikh Hasina's resignation as Prime Minister of Bangladesh has created a power vacuum that Islamist groups could exploit to gain control. Throughout her tenure, Hasina, a potent symbol of secularism in a country plagued with Islamists, dealt Islamic fundamentalists with an iron fist, including those from the main opposition party BNP, which has connections to the terror group Al Qaeda. While this strategy temporarily consolidated her authority, the students' protests, however, provided an outlet for these extremist groups to harness the growing resentment to dislodge the Sheikh Hasina government and empower themselves, leading to a more significant presence in Bangladesh's political landscape.\n\nAfter Hasina's resignation amid widespread protests, Islamist groups, which played a key role in the demonstrations, are now in a position to gain greater political influence. Forming an interim government in this unstable environment could allow these factions to shape policies and advance their agenda, which would inevitably pivot around religious bigotry and persecution of minorities, which has only accelerated following the exit of Sheikh Hasina.\n\nIn the wake of Sheikh Hasina's ouster, hundreds of protesters pulled down the bust of Sheikh Mujibur Rahman, the founding father of Bangladesh, in Dhaka. The visuals symbolised what lies ahead for Bangladesh as Islamists and fundamentalists seek to wrest control of the country's many institutions and hit the last nail in the coffin of its relatively new democratic journey.\n\nMoreover, Hasina's departure has created a power vacuum that could heighten instability as various political forces, including Islamist groups, compete for control. This situation mirrors a regional trend where Islamist movements exploit political crises to increase their influence, often resulting in substantial changes in national policies and governance structures.\n\nThe Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP) has faced criticism for its religious bigotry and ties with Islamist groups. Historically, the BNP has had a complicated relationship with religion. Founded on Bangladeshi nationalism principles, which included a moderate religious stance, its alliances with Islamist parties like Jamaat-e-Islami have raised concerns, with its members openly subscribing to the puritanical version of Islam and its innate antagonism for non-believers, especially Hindus or idol-worshippers.\n\nFrom 2001 to 2006, the BNP enacted policies favouring Islamist groups and conservative madrassahs, which critics argue increased the influence of Islamist factions in politics, leading to greater religious intolerance and fundamentalism. The BNP's coalition with Jamaat-e-Islami and other Islamist groups strengthened these factions' political power, often resulting in violence against religious minorities, especially the Hindu community, perceived as supporting rival parties like the Awami League.\n\nAdditionally, the BNP's political stance has shifted over time towards more right-wing and conservative positions, moving away from its earlier centrist and liberal positions. This shift has been marked by rhetoric and actions perceived as catering to Islamist sentiments, further alienating religious and ethnic minorities in Bangladesh. The shift would inevitably lead to forced demographic change as witnessed in Pakistan, where Hindus,\n\nAs the turmoil engulfs Bangladesh, Hindus residing in the country were once again subjected to targeted persecution as the Bangladesh Hindu Buddhist Christian Unity Council released a list of attacks that took place on Hindu temples, houses and establishments that belonged to the Hindu community in the country.\n\nThe attacks happened amidst the political turmoil taking place in Bangladesh. According to X handle Voice of Bangladeshi Hindus, these attacks happened within five hours. Notably, the actual number of attacks could be much higher than reported in the list below. The document has listed 54 attacks.\n\nAccording to the list, in Sherpur, the house of the president of the Sribardi Upazila Youth Unity Council was attacked, vandalised and looted.\n\nIn Khulna, the houses of Shyamal Kumar Das and Swajan Kumar Das in Highgate village of Rupsa Thana area, houses of Biman Bihari Amit, president of the Khulna District Unity Council and Animesh Sarkar Rinku, president of the Youth Unity Council in Tootpara of Khulna city, house of Jayanta Gain in Amtali Banisanta, Dacope, and houses of the minority community in Darpara, Koyra were attacked, vandalised and looted.\n\nAt the time of Bangladesh's creation in 1971, pro-Pakistani militias and armed forces killed thousands of Hindus on the pretext of their alleged support for the secession of East Pakistan. Now, over fifty-three years later, as the country faces another churn, with its secular and democratic ethos emphatically shunned, the threat of targeted persecution of Hindus and other minorities has only heightened as Islamists and their cohorts in the BNP seek to undermine secular laws governing the country in their pursuit of establishing a nation ruled by Sharia, where minorities are treated as second-class citizens, a fair game for the rampaging mobs of Islamist bloodhounds, determined to turn it into a homogenous society.", "source": {"uri": "opindia.com", "dataType": "news", "title":

Abu Najm Fernando bin al-Iskandar who lives in the United States, claims to be a PhD student specialising in \"Islamic studies\" and defines himself as an \"indigenous Muslim.\" He has spent more than 20 years researching and teaching 'Islamic sciences' but his primary occupation is to spread hate against Kufar or Kafir (infidels) and harbour illusions about their subjugation or execution at the hands of Muslims.\n\nAfter the resignation of former Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina Wazed and the anti-Hindu violence that has grabbed global headlines, he tweeted his excitement over the devastating developments, advocating for the complete annihilation of Hindus from the country. In his own words, the fact that three of the four schools of jurisprudence for 'Ahl as-Sunnah' (traditions and practices of Prophet Muhammad that constitute a model for Muslims to follow) hold that Hindus should only have two options, embrace Islam or die, provides him with \"great solace.\"\n\nHe added, \"Hindus should be grateful they're dealing with Hanafis and not Malikis, Shafi'ees, or Hanbalis,\" he mocked while taking the names of Sunni Islamic schools of thought, insinuating that they are far more violent and hostile towards non-Muslims and would have treated vulnerable Hindus in Bangladesh with greater brutality.\n\nHe quoted Islamic law from the Hanbali school of jurisprudence, the predominant Sunni school in Saudi Arabia and Qatar which stated, \"Thus, due to this, distinguishing themselves from the Muslims in their hair is required of them (i.e., non-Muslims under a covenant of protection) by shaving the front part of their heads and shearing their hair while not parting it due the fact that the Prophet Muhammad parted his hair,\" to demonstrate how infidels should be met with humiliating treatment as they are inferior to Muslims.\n\nHe also showed his 'generosity' by assuring that he has no problem with Hindus who, while residing in Muslim nations, accept their subservient position, and abandon their faith which he called \"shirk\" (idolatry, polytheism and association with Allah) and live per Islamic laws and regulations. He further hoped that \"Bangladesh gets cleaned of Hindu influence and meddling,\" while referring to the attacks on Bangladeshi minorities as \"Hindu propaganda.\"\n\nThe Islamic scholar also thanked Allah in response to a post about the attack on prominent Bangladeshi singer Rahul Ananda whose house was looted and set ablaze.\n\nHe emphasised that there should be no idols in any Muslim country and added, \"Whoever argues in favour of them, should be exiled to the land of shirk (non-Muslim),\" while reacting to a post of a Hindu Brahmin protecting a deity's idol from the Islamists in Bangladesh.\n\nHe again vented his frustration in another post with the 'liberal' Hanafis and claimed that while they are not obligated to demolish non-Muslim places of worship like other Sunni schools of thought, they are expected to forbid infidels from praying there and convert them into residences. He pointed out, \"It is ridiculous how few scholars in Bangladesh and elsewhere are reminding Muslims of these Islamic laws.\"\n\nHe also added that a deceptive promise of pleasing Allah and the danger of punishment in the hereafter for causing harm to Hindu temples are being used to incentivize people to \"protect\" them. \"Scholars need to step up and tell the truth about these legal rulings. They also need to advise Muslims properly in Bangladesh and other Muslim countries where these legal rulings are being openly violated and condemned,\" he further urged.\n\nHe restated his argument that Hindu temples should be destroyed and wrote that it is a pity that a Hanbali has to inform the millions of Hanafis in Bangladesh about what their authoritative Fiqh (human understanding and practices of the Sharia) texts state regarding Hindu temples and the profound ignorance in \"protecting them,\" which results in the breach of Islamic law within Muslim cities.\n\nDubbing Bangladesh a \"land conquered by Islam\" he lamented that Muslims would be punished by Allah through the return of disbelief and the takeover of Muslim nations by disbelievers if the former would not carry out Islamic law, which requires them to demolish non-Muslim houses of worship in territories they have triumphed. \"This is aside from the punishment in the afterlife for refusing to implement the obligations in Islam,\" he remarked.\n\nIn another tweet, he conveyed his desire for Bangladeshi Hindus to experience \"10 times the humiliation that Muslims in India feel\" and added, \"Anyone calling for any differently should've left with Hasina.\" Interestingly, Hindus in Bangladesh must also want the same, as minorities in India, particularly Muslims, have unprecedented liberties that are constantly compromising the country's law and order without any fear of backlash or retaliation. The Muslim population of India has grown at a rapid pace while that of Bangladeshi Hindus has been steadily declining.\n\nHe denounced Bangladesh's contradictions in yet another lengthy post highlighting, \"What's crazy is that Muslims are talking about the future of Bangladesh being \"more Islamic\" while at the same time calling for good treatment of Hindus,\" noting that infidels have no place in an Islamic state. He further asserted that Muslims and non-Muslims should be subject to different rules since the latter should be treated as lesser beings and made to live as subhumans while forced to pay jizya (tax historically levied on dhimmis, that is, protected non-Muslim subjects of a state governed by Islamic law), citing numerous quotations from Islamic literature to support his claims.\n\nThe anti-quota student protests in Bangladesh have devolved into the massacre of Hindus, particularly since Sheikh Hasina left the country. Islamists have been killing the minority Hindu community, raping their women and destroying as well as looting their temples and properties with impunity. The terrible turn of events has provided jihadis like Abu Najm Fernando bin al-Iskandar with a perfect opportunity to further bay for the blood of already marginalised Hindus and take pleasure in their immense suffering.", "source": {"uri": "opindia.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "OpIndia"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hanbali_school", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Hanbali school"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hanafi_school", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Hanafi school"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hindus", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Hindus"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muslims", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Muslims"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Madhhab", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Madhhab"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kafir", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Kafir"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sharia", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Sharia"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sunni_Islam", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Sunni Islam"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Islam", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Islam"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bangladesh", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Bangladesh"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Bangladesh"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maliki_school", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Maliki school"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Idolatry", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Idolatry"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Allah", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Allah"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muslim_world", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Muslim world"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muhammad", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Muhammad"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shirk_(Islam)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Shirk (Islam)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hindu_temple", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Hindu temple"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sheikh_Hasina", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Sheikh Hasina"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pogrom", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Pogrom"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Islamic_studies", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Islamic studies"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Massacre", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Massacre"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indigenous_peoples", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Indigenous peoples"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Islamism", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Islamism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twitter", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Twitter"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polytheism", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Polytheism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brahmin", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Brahmin"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ulama", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Ulama"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saudi_Arabia", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Saudi Arabia"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Saudi Arabia"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Qatar", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Qatar"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Qatar"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/India", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "India"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Religion_and_Spirituality/Islam", "label": "dmoz/Society/Religion and Spirituality/Islam", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Religion_and_Spirituality/Religious_Tolerance", "label": "dmoz/Society/Religion and Spirituality/Religious Tolerance", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Periods_and_Movements/Islamic", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Periods and Movements/Islamic", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 85}], "image": "https://www.opindia.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/image-700x400-24.png", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9792869", "eventUri": "eng-9792869", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.3333333333333334, "wgt": 133, "relevance": 1}

A DW fact check reveals the truth behind these viral claims.\n\nBangladesh has plunged into chaos following the ouster of Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina on August 5, which came after weeks of riots.\n\nInitially peaceful protests by students escalated into a broader movement demanding an end to Hasina's increasingly authoritarian leadership.\n\nAfter her resignation, crowds stormed the prime minister's palace, vandalizing it along with other state-owned buildings and homes of members of the governing Awami League party.\n\nAccording to Indian and local media, attacks on houses, places of worship and businesses belonging to religious minorities took place across the country. Hindu temples were targeted in several cities, including Natore, Dhaka, Patuakhali, and Jessore. In response, several students and clerics reportedly gathered in front of the temples to protect them from mob violence.\n\nLike its neighbor India, Bangladesh has a history of religious tensions between its Hindu and Muslim communities. In recent years, the Bangladeshi Hindu minority, which makes up 8% of the population, has been targeted by violent mobs several times. However, many reports about the attacks on Hindu temples and communities by Bangladeshi protesters were not true.\n\nA post on X(formerly Twitter) alleged that the house of Liton Das, a famous Bangladeshi Hindu cricketer, had been set on fire, sharing a collage of two pictures as evidence.\n\nIn one image a young man can be seen sitting next to a Hindu place of worship and the other image shows a burning house. More than a million users have seen the post. The collage was also shared by numerous other accounts with similar claims.\n\nDW fact check: False\n\nThe man in the picture is indeed Liton Das, and a reverse image search shows that the image was taken from his official account. However, the burning mansion is not his home. A reverse search of that image leads to media reports about former Bangladesh cricket team captain Mashrafe Mortaza's house being set on fire by protesters.\n\nDW also geolocated the house and confirmed it belonged to Mortaza, who became a target due to his political activities and close alliance with Hasina's Awami League party. The Muslim sportsman was a member of parliament, having won a seat for the second consecutive time as an Awami League candidate during the general elections held in Bangladesh earlier this year.\n\nThere are many claims circulating on various social media platforms about sexual violence against women from the Hindu minority in Bangladesh. Two have been shared multiple times and viewed thousands of times. But some are old, and some have been proven to be earlier events presented out of context, like this case.\n\nClaim: A video shows Muslim men waving a Hindu woman's underwear\n\nThe post on X says, \"Look carefully at these Bangladeshi Muslims: Hindu girls' bras were removed and then they were raped. Now he is roaming the streets with that bra shamelessly and presenting proof of his manhood.\" As of publication, the post had about 30,000 views.\n\nDW fact check: False\n\nThe 23-second video shows protesters storming the prime minister's official residence. Many pictures and videos have been published online showing rioters looting Hasina's belongings, including her clothes and underwear since she fled the country. In the last seconds of the video, a building with red-brown walls is visible, resembling Ganabhaban, the official residence of the Bangladeshi prime minister.\n\nA comparison of the building in the video and images of Ganabhaban from agency footage shows that the building is indeed the official residence of the former prime minister. In the photo below, the palm trees and window shapes match those seen in the last seconds of the video.\n\nAnother post on X shares a screenshot of a Telegram post with a tilted picture of a woman being restrained, accompanied by Bengali text threatening Hindus and encouraging violence to drive them back to India.\n\nClaim: A Hindu woman was sexually assaulted and gang-raped by a group of Muslim men at the University of Dhaka.\n\nThis post (warning: extreme, graphic violence) was published on August 2, three days before Hasina fled the country. But it has been increasingly shared by numerous other accounts in recent days, to date garnering more than 30,000 views.\n\nThe caption reads: \"The so-called Jamaat-e-Islami quota protesters leaked a video of the gang rape of a Hindu girl to the Islamic army group. If Hasina's government falls, they have threatened to rape all Hindu girls out of their homes.\"\n\nDW fact check: False\n\nA reverse image search of that same screenshot has been shared in past years with claims of rape and sexual abuse, but from different regions. For example, it was attributed to a gang rape in the Indian province of Manipur in 2023, claiming to show Hindu men kidnapping and gang-raping a Christian girl. In 2021, it went viral in Indonesia, claiming to show an Indonesian migrant worker woman tortured and raped by five Bangladeshi citizens.\n\nThe Indian fact-checking platform Boom traced the video back to its origin in East Bengaluru's Ramamurthy Nagar in May 2021, where police arrested 12 Bangladeshi nationals, including three women, for the assault and rape of a 22-year-old.\n\nThe plethora of unverified social posts aimed at heightening ethnic tensions in Bangladesh haven't just used old or manipulated images and videos. Content generated by artificial intelligence has also played a role.\n\nOne AI-generated image is going viral on platforms like X and Facebook. It depicts a massive crowd gathered around a towering flagpole with the Bangladeshi flag waving at the top, under a hazy sky. The scene suggests a large-scale event or demonstration, symbolizing national pride and unity.\n\nThe image exhibits typical signs of AI generation. The figures on the pole have disfigured, abnormal legs and the perspective is off, with the vertical pole and the background crowd view appearing unusual. Additionally, the proportions of the people on the pole and those below do not match. Several pieces of rope seem to float in the air without connection.\n\nModified versions of this graphic have also been used to promote claims of ethnic violence. For instance, one version includes the words \"ALL EYES ON BANGLADESH, SAVE HINDUS.\" Another AI-generated photomaking the rounds shows a burning Hindu temple with the superimposed \"ALL EYES ON BANGLADESH HINDUS\" text. The foreground depicts numerous bodies lying on the ground, with blood and debris, creating a scene of violence and destruction.", "source": {"uri": "dw.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Deutsche

Experts answer | Mint", "body": "Bangladesh news: Sheikh Hasina resigned as prime minister on Monday and fled the country after being in power for the past 15 years. This sudden turn of events in neighbouring Bangladesh has created a political vacuum, with Bangladesh's Army Chief General Waker-Uz-Zaman saying he would talk to the President to form an interim government.\n\nPolitical experts from Bangladesh said that Sheikh Hasina's hurried and unceremonious departure may lead to the possibility of former US-leaning bureaucrats and governors taking over next. Though experts said military rule is unlikely, they cannot rule out the possibility of Bangladeshi Hindu nationals migrating to India over time.\n\nQuestions about the possible migration of Hindus to India have erupted after BJP leader Shubhendu Adhikari's comment. \"Get Ready 1 crore Bangladeshi Hindus will be coming to Bengal,\" the leader warned, media reports stated today.\n\nSpeaking to LiveMint on the phone from Dhaka, Pallab Bhattacharya, former PTI special correspondent for Dhaka currently associated with Bangladesh's The Daily Star, said the Hindu population drastically reduced to around nine per cent of the total population from 21 per cent at one point in time, showing how \"powerful the anti-minority forces are in Bangladesh.\"\n\nFollowing the student protests, on August 4, several Hindu temples, including the ISKCON and Kali temples in Bangladesh, were destroyed. While these attacks may not be the immediate cause of migration, as attacks on minorities in Bangladesh have taken place irrespective of the ruling party, there could be a gradual process in play, opined Pallab Bhattacharya.\n\n\"The latest round of attacks on Hindus may not immediately trigger their exodus, but a quiet migration is not ruled out given an uncertain future for them under a non-Awami League regime,\" Bhattacharya told LiveMint.\n\nAnother journalist from Bangladesh shared a similar view. Preferring not to be named, he said, \"The minorities will be oppressed if an extremist party comes into power,\" hinting further towards the potential mass migration.\n\nWhile the Bangladesh military is unlikely to run the country, Pallab Bhattacharya said several names, including former bureaucrats and governors, have been floating around for forming the next government.\n\n\"Among the list of names doing the rounds as the head of an interim government promised by Army chief General Waker-Uz-Zaman are former Bangladesh Bank Governor Salehuddin Ahmed and retired bureaucrat Badiul Alam Mojumder,\" said Pallab Bhattacharya. He added that while people widely respect Ahmed as a non-partisan bureaucrat-economist, Mojumder, on the other hand, is considered close to the West, particularly the US.\n\nThe Bangladeshi journalist hinted that a student-led government could be formed this time. \"Only one or two job quota coordinators have political affiliations, and citizens want a free and fair election,\" he said.\n\nWhile Bhattacharya said the former Bangladesh prime minister's absence could mean a bleak future for millions of dollars worth of infra projects in Bangladesh, which India has funded, the other journalist also confirmed that Bangladesh and India had better ties under the Awami League regime.", "source": {"uri": "livemint.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "mint"}, "authors": [{"uri":

Protests against the Job Quota Scheme have morphed into communal violence, with numerous Hindu temples torched, homes set ablaze, women kidnapped, and several individuals lynched.\n\nIn a recent tragic incident, the house of renowned Bangladeshi singer Rahul Anand was set on fire by an enraged mob. Amid this chaos, a heart-wrenching letter has surfaced on social media platform X, gaining widespread attention.\n\nMajor Pawan Kumar, a Shaurya Chakra recipient, shared the letter on X, revealing its origin from a 12th-grade Hindu girl in Bangladesh.

We are in a very bad situation which I cannot describe in words,' the letter begins. 'Extremist and terrorist groups have started unimaginable torture on us. Women and girls are being raped. They are firing on the houses and temples, looting and vandalizing the businesses of Hindus, extorting lakhs of money, and threatening to kill if not paid.'\n\nShe continued to describe the dire reality, stating, 'The situation is much worse than what everyone is watching on social media. We are being told to leave our country. But WHY? We have the right to live in our country with all our rights, and I don't see any good in leaving it to evil forever. Rather, everyone should come forward to stop all these evil forces forever.'\n\nThe girl's plea concluded with a direct appeal to the Indian Prime Minister: 'Sir, I request you very humbly to do something for us as soon as possible. It's the most important thing that we can live in peace in our country with all rights. I know you all are worried about us. I request you on behalf of all Hindus of Bangladesh to please try your best to help us as soon as possible. And yes, sir, I want to thank you for everything that you are doing for us.

Why is revenge being taken against the poor Hindus? For just existing, isn't it? A powerful reason for revenge, no doubt according to NYT headline writers,\" Sengupta wrote on X.\n\nAlso Read: Indian Wrestler Antim Panghal And Her Team To Be Deported From Paris Olympics For 'Disciplinary Breach': All You Need To Know", "source": {"uri": "swarajyamag.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Swarajyamag"}, "authors": [{"uri": "kuldeep_negi@swarajyamag.com", "name": "Kuldeep Negi", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hindus", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Hindus"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_New_York_Times", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "The New York Times"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bangladesh", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Bangladesh"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Bangladesh"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sheikh_Hasina", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Sheikh Hasina"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kashmiri_Pandits", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Kashmiri Pandits"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Revenge", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Revenge"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Temple", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Temple"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prime_minister", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Prime minister"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_media", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Social media"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/State_religion", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "State religion"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Islam", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Islam"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Refugee", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Refugee"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antim_Panghal", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Antim Panghal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Communal_violence", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Communal violence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rana_dynasty", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Rana dynasty"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Religious_persecution", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Religious persecution"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Riot", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Riot"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deportation", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Deportation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Victim_blaming", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Victim blaming"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paris", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/India", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "India"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Terrorism", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Terrorism", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Warfare_and_Conflict", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Warfare and Conflict", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Violence_and_Abuse", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Violence and Abuse", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Religion_and_Spirituality/Hinduism", "label": "dmoz/Society/Religion and Spirituality/Hinduism", "wgt": 17}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Victims", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Victims", "wgt": 18}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 72}], "image": "https://swarajya.gumlet.io/swarajya%2F2024-08-08%2Fsazdo3vs%2Fnytimes.jpg?w=1200&ar=40%3A21&auto=format%2Ccompress&ogImage=true&mode=crop&enlarge=true&overlay=false&overlay_position=bottom&overlay_width=100", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9792869", "eventUri": "eng-9792869", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.4901960784313726, "wgt": 132, "relevance": 1}

The Bangladeshi Hindus, feeling increasingly vulnerable in their homeland, had hoped for asylum in India, but their pleas for safety were met with violence and rejection.\n\nMeanwhile, the Border Security Force (BSF) on the Indian side appeared powerless to intervene. The BSF as watching helplessly while the BGB drove away the refugees, unable to offer any assistance.\n\nThe sight of families, including women and children, being pushed back by force has sparked outrage and concern among human rights activists.\n\nReports indicated similar incidents occurring across multiple border points between Bangladesh and India, where minority communities, primarily Hindus, have been seeking refuge amidst growing concerns for their safety.\n\nCM reacts\n\nTripura chief minister Dr Manik Saha on Tuesday said, \"We stepped up security along Bangladesh border and shall not allow anybody from Bangladesh.\"\n\nBesides state police and BSF, the state government has been in coordination with all other security agencies and close eyes on development of Bangladesh, Dr Saha stated.\n\n\"I have been in touch with central government; DGP has been directed to monitor the situation and foil any intrusion attempt in the state,\" Dr Saha added.", "source": {"uri":

Despite over 14 centuries of existence, Islam has never had a strong secular-reformist movement.\n\nSo, even if a Muslim-majority country is avowedly \"secular\", the word has no resonance in large parts of Muslim society. Islam has never been secular in content or intent.\n\nThe Muslim intellectuals who disagree with Islamists or fundamentalists are often unwilling to say so in public for fear of reprisals and physical threats.\n\nAt best, they choose to become lapsed Muslims. This is why practically no Indian Muslim liberal was willing to say that the Citizenship Amendment Act was needed to fast-track citizenship to Hindu and other minorities subjected to violence in three neighbouring countries.\n\nNor are they willing to admit that post-Hasina Bangladesh leaves Hindus particularly vulnerable to intimidation and violence, even assuming some of the stories about attacks on temples and Hindus are overblown.\n\nTo understand why, we must understand how Islam has evolved, or refused to evolve, since it was founded by the Prophet in the seventh century CE.\n\nIn the immediate centuries after the Prophet passed, Islamic armies had won victories in large parts of Europe, Africa and Asia. The conquests in Europe brought Muslim intellectuals in contact with Hellenistic ideas and new ways of thinking about god, society and humanity.\n\nBut despite this exposure, by the tenth and eleventh centuries, all the gates to reason (Ijtihad) were closed. The heroic rethink initiated by the likes of Avicenna (Ibn Sina, tenth century CE) and Averroes (Ibn Rushd, twelfth century CE), both highly influenced by Aristotle, was erased by a group called the Asherites, who held on to the traditional view that the Quran is the final, immutable word of god.\n\nThe Mutazilites, or , were defeated by the Asherites, who maintained the more orthodox view that Islam is only about Allah's will. The holy book cannot be understood by reasoning out what god may have intended.\n\nBy the time of Abu Hamid al-Ghazali (al-Ghazali, for short, 1058-1111 CE), Asherite Islam was ready to commit intellectual suicide, as Robert Reilly notes in his book, .\n\nIt is this orthodox and extreme form of Islam, with global domination as the aim, that currently prevails in most Sunni Muslim-majority countries, including Bangladesh.\n\nNotes Reilly: \"The fatal disconnect between the Creator and the mind of his creature is the source of Sunni Islam's most profound woes. This bifurcation, located not in the Koran but in early Islamic theology, ultimately led to the closing of the Muslim mind.\"\n\nEven under Sheikh Hasina's rule, while the state was theoretically secular, large parts of Bangladeshi society were not quite willing to leave it at that. Many Islamist groups could orchestrate street power to the extent where even Hasina had to accommodate their interests in practice. (You can read about this compromise in a book by Deep Halder and Avishek Biswas, )\n\nThese Islamist groups, including the Jaamat-e-Islami and its youth wing, the Chhatra Parishad, which was among the student organisations spearheading the anti-Hasina protests, have the ultimate goal of Islamising Bangladesh and bringing it under Sharia rule. But as Halder and Biswas note in their research, even some Awami League members have in the past participated in anti-Hindu violence.\n\nIslam, as it has been practised after Mohammed, has evolved into a totalitarian ideology, and the thing it most fears is contamination of its core precepts by contact with non-Muslims.\n\nThis is why hardcore Muslims, when they are in a minority, choose to live in ghettoes, and when they are in a majority, believe that their ideology can be protected only by aggressive conversions that include coercion and intimidation of the minorities.\n\nThis is what is subliminally playing out in Bangladesh, where the Hindu population has fallen from over 31 per cent at the time of partition to less than 8 per cent now.\n\nA Dhaka University professor, Abul Barkat, maintains that .\n\nThe de-Hindufication of Bangladesh did not stop during Hasina's rule, nor will it end with her ouster, despite some secular handles tweeting pictures of Muslims standing guard outside temples. These pictures fail to answer a basic question: why do Hindu properties and temples need any kind of special protection at all?\n\nFor India, there are now new challenges post-Hasina. Here are a few things it should focus on.\n\nOne, it must provide protection and sanctuary to Sheikh Hasina as long as she is in this country. The need to focus on a successor regime does not mean abandoning past friends. Who knows, if the political tide turns, she or her party can be sent back to stake a claim to power in Bangladesh.\n\nTwo, India must speak up for Hindus in Bangladesh, if not in public then in private. The demand must be to create safe spaces and autonomous Hindu-majority enclaves within Bangladesh (similar to how we have created tribal autonomous regions in some states), if necessary by moving in Hindus from outside and moving out anti-Hindu elements.\n\nThree, as the only significant Hindu majority country in the world, India must think beyond the CAA. There must be a right to return to India for any persecuted Hindu, Jain, Sikh or Buddhist in any country, whether in the neighbourhood, or elsewhere.\n\nFour, India must launch a global outreach programme to explain our views directly to the media, intellectuals, and ordinary people, so that even the Deep State in America and Western Europe is forced to stop hurting Indian, especially Hindu, interests in India and its neighbourhood.\n\nFive, the activities of Islamic elements in West Bengal and the North East must be monitored aggressively, so that their ability to create chaos is minimised.\n\nMeanwhile, we must prepare for the next administration in Bangladesh and engage with it fully to keep anti-India forces at bay.", "source": {"uri": "swarajyamag.com", "dataType": "news",

The flight, which was arranged on short notice despite significant infrastructure challenges at Dhaka Airport, successfully carried 199 passengers and six infants to safety.\n\nBangladesh has plunged into turmoil following the shock resignation of Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina. Violent protests, which initially erupted over a student-led movement against government quotas, intensified and forced Hasina to flee the country. She sought refuge in India as hundreds of thousands of protesters marched towards 'Ganabhaban', the official residence of the Prime Minister.\n\nIn the wake of Hasina's departure, the Bangladeshi Army announced the formation of an interim government, and the President dissolved Parliament. Nobel laureate Muhammad Yunus, a vocal critic of Hasina, has been appointed as the head of this interim government. The appointment was officially announced by Bangladesh President's Press Secretary, Joynal Abedin.\n\nHowever, the situation has taken a darker turn as the protests have been hijacked by extremist forces, leading to a wave of violence against religious minorities. Since Hasina's resignation, there have been alarming reports of attacks on Hindu homes and religious sites across the country.\n\nThe Opposition Congress Party has expressed serious concerns about the safety of Indian students and the Hindu minority in Bangladesh.\n\nCongress leader KC Venugopal highlighted that the issue has been raised with the Indian government and that the party is closely monitoring the government's response.\n\n\"Yesterday, we already raised concerns about the Indian students and the minorities living in Bangladesh. The government is saying they are looking into it. We are also closely monitoring the actions from the GoI,\" Venugopal stated.\n\nSpiritual leader Yog Guru Baba Ramdev also weighed in on the situation, calling for national unity to protect Hindus living in Bangladesh.

Following the coup that led India's eastern neighbours into chaos, there were speculations that the Hindu community in the country can come under attack from an alien power.\n\nOpIndia can now exclusively report that the threat was from the Eternal-Deviant warlord from the moon Titan, Thanos. Notably, Thanos is recognised as one of the most powerful beings in the entire Universe, and he likes to destroy civilisations, and apparently, Hindu civilisation is on the top of his agenda.\n\nHowever, once Bangladeshi Muslim community members came to know about the evil plans of Thanos, they decided that they will protect Hindus in the country. Bangladeshi Muslims stationed themselves outside 2 temples in the country to make sure none of the Hindu temples in the country are attacked. However, after getting their photos clicked outside those 2 temples, the Bangladeshi Muslim community members disappeared somewhere, we are trying to locate them.\n\nHowever, this photo session didn't go unnoticed, and several prominent citizens lauded them for taking a photo outside those 2 temples to stop Thanos from attacking Hindus in Bangladesh.\n\nSeveral netizens took to X (formerly Twitter) to laud their bravery in conducting a photo-op outside the temples.\n\nThanks to these brave social media warriors, world now knows that Bangladeshi Muslims bravely stepped up to face a camera for a photo-op in order to protect the country's Hindus from the wrath of the mad Titan Thanos.\n\nHowever, not everyone agrees that the Bangladeshi Muslim community was protecting the temples from Thanos. Some were of the opinion that the Hindu temples were being protected from Darth Vader, long enough for Luke Skywalker to destroy the death star and save Bangladeshi Hindu community.\n\nMeanwhile, Bangladesh's leading newspaper Daily Star reported that Hindus and Hindu temples have been attacked in 27 districts of the country, so maybe Thanos couldn't be stopped with a staged photo-op.", "source": {"uri": "opindia.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "OpIndia"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thanos_(Marvel_Cinematic_Universe)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Thanos (Marvel Cinematic Universe)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hindus", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Hindus"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bangladesh", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Bangladesh"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Bangladesh"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Temple", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Temple"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coup_d'\u00e9tat", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Coup d'\u00e9tat"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Provisional_government", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Provisional government"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sheikh_Hasina", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Sheikh Hasina"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ummah", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Ummah"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extraterrestrial_life", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Extraterrestrial life"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/India", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "India"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Islam_in_Bangladesh", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Islam in Bangladesh"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hindu_temple", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Hindu temple"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Warlord", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Warlord"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moon", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Moon"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hinduism_in_Bangladesh", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Hinduism in Bangladesh"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luke_Skywalker", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Luke Skywalker"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Daily_Star_(Bangladesh)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "The Daily Star (Bangladesh)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Darth_Vader", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Darth Vader"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twitter", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Twitter"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_media", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Social media"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Religion_and_Spirituality/Buddhism", "label": "dmoz/Society/Religion and Spirituality/Buddhism", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Religion_and_Spirituality/Hinduism", "label": "dmoz/Society/Religion and Spirituality/Hinduism", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Religion_and_Spirituality/Sikhism", "label": "dmoz/Society/Religion and Spirituality/Sikhism", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Religion_and_Spirituality/Jainism", "label": "dmoz/Society/Religion and Spirituality/Jainism", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 53}], "image": "https://www.opindia.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/image-2-e1722928571330.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9792869", "eventUri": "eng-9792869", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-08-05", "textStart": 195, "textEnd": 203}], "sentiment": -0.0980392156862745, "wgt": 129, "relevance": 1}

He assured that the organisation was completely aware of the fact that the toppling of Hasina presented India with a \"challenging situation\" at its eastern border.Bagra remarked, \"Bharat couldn't turn a blind eye\" to the attacks on Hindus in the neighbouring country and he urged the Indian government to take steps to protect the Bangladeshi minorities.Western Double Standards Called into QuestionFurther, the VHP official pointed out that even though the western countries were vocal in their criticism of Hasina on the question of human rights, they may have little to say when it comes to attacks on Hindus after the fall of the ex-PM government.VHP's concerns on attacks on Western double standards on the issue were echoed by Salah Uddin Shoaib Choudhury, a Dhaka-based counter-terrorism expert, author and editor of Blitz publication. He believes that human rights policy was a pretext to end the regime.Bangladeshi Hindus: The Road AheadGiving a sense of history of persecution of the Hindu minority in Bangladesh, Choudhury noted that such hate crimes had become a \"rogue culture\" in Bangladeshi polity, where power has alternated between Sheikh Hasina-led Awami League and the Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP)-Jamaat-e-Islami (JI) coalition.Often, the BNP-JI coalition has been criticised for fanning radical Islamist ideology for its own political ends in the predominantly Muslim country, which was founded in 1971 on secular ideals by Hasina's father Sheikh Mujibur Rahman.\"Anti-India sentiment\" was systematically spread like a wildfire by opponents of Hasina, the expert said. A situation he cautioned could intensify in coming days.In turn, Bagra also stressed that Hindu minority being \"persecuted\" in Bangladesh was not new, which is why the religious group today constitute around 8%, according to the 2022 Census of the population, as compared to 32% at the time of in the 1940s.While Choudhury hoped that Bangladesh would continue to remain a secular country in coming years, he also expressed apprehension over the current circumstances.", "source": {"uri": "sputniknews.in", "dataType": "news", "title": "Sputnik India"}, "authors": [{"uri": "dhairya_maheshwari@sputniknews.in", "name": "Dhairya Maheshwari", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hindus", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Hindus"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vishva_Hindu_Parishad", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Vishva Hindu Parishad"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sheikh_Hasina", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Sheikh Hasina"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/India", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "India"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bangladesh", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Bangladesh"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Bangladesh"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hinduism_in_Bangladesh", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Hinduism in Bangladesh"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_rights", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Human rights"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Counterterrorism", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Counterterrorism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jamaat-e-Islami", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Jamaat-e-Islami"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salah_Choudhury", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Salah Choudhury"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Government_of_India", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Government of India"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_world", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Western world"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Awami_League", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Awami League"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sheikh_Mujibur_Rahman", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Sheikh Mujibur Rahman"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bangladesh_Nationalist_Party", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Bangladesh Nationalist Party"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Islamic_extremism", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Islamic extremism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secular_state", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Secular state"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hate_crime", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Hate crime"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coalition_government", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Coalition government"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ideology", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Ideology"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muslim_world", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Muslim world"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secularism", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Secularism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sheikh", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Sheikh"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Warfare_and_Conflict", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Warfare and Conflict", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Territorial_Disputes", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Territorial Disputes", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Religion_and_Spirituality/Sikhism", "label": "dmoz/Society/Religion and Spirituality/Sikhism", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 97}], "image": "https://cdn1.img.sputniknews.in/images/sharing/article/eng/7967313.jpg?79694981722954117", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9792869", "eventUri": "eng-9792869", "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.6784313725490196, "wgt": 129, "relevance": 1}

Experts answer | Mint", "body": "Bangladesh protests: Sheikh Hasina resigned as prime minister on Monday and fled the country after being in power for the past 15 years. This sudden turn of events in neighbouring Bangladesh has created a political vacuum, with Bangladesh's Army Chief General Waker-Uz-Zaman talking to the President on Monday, to form an interim government.\n\nPolitical experts said that Sheikh Hasina's hurried and unceremonious departure may lead to the possibility of former US-leaning bureaucrats and governors taking over next. Though experts said military rule is unlikely, they cannot rule out the possibility of Bangladeshi Hindu nationals migrating to India over time.\n\nQuestions about the possible migration of Hindus to India have erupted after BJP leader Suvendu Adhikari's comment. \"Get Ready 1 crore Bangladeshi Hindus will be coming to Bengal,\" the leader warned, media reports stated today.\n\nSpeaking to LiveMint, Pallab Bhattacharya, former PTI special correspondent for Dhaka, who is currently associated with Dhaka's The Daily Star, said the Hindu population drastically reduced to around nine per cent of the total population from 21 per cent at one point in time, showing how \"powerful the anti-minority forces are in Bangladesh.\"\n\nFollowing the student protests, on August 4, several Hindu temples, including the ISKCON and Kali temples in Bangladesh, were destroyed. While these attacks may not be the immediate cause of migration, as attacks on minorities in Bangladesh have taken place irrespective of the ruling party, there could be a gradual process in play, opined Pallab Bhattacharya.\n\n\"The latest round of attacks on Hindus may not immediately trigger their exodus, but a quiet migration is not ruled out given an uncertain future for them under a non-Awami League regime,\" Bhattacharya told LiveMint.\n\nAnother journalist from Bangladesh, Awil Ibrahim, shared a similar view over the phone, from Dhaka. \"Minorities will be oppressed if an extremist party comes to power,\" he told LiveMint, hinting at imminent mass migration.\n\nWhile the Bangladesh military is unlikely to run the country, Pallab Bhattacharya said several names, including those of former bureaucrats and governors, that have been floating around for forming the next government.\n\n\"Among the list of names doing the rounds as the head of an interim government promised by Army chief General Waker-Uz-Zaman are former Bangladesh Bank Governor Salehuddin Ahmed and retired bureaucrat Badiul Alam Mojumder,\" said Pallab Bhattacharya. He added that while people widely respect Ahmed as a non-partisan bureaucrat-economist, Mojumder, on the other hand, is considered close to the West, particularly the US.\n\nMeanwhile, Ibrahim hinted

Hindu temples were targeted in several cities, including Natore, Dhaka, Patuakhali, and Jessore. In response, several students and clerics reportedly gathered in front of the temples to protect them from mob violence.\n\nLike its neighbor India, has a history of religious tensions between its Hindu and Muslim communities. In recent years, the Bangladeshi Hindu minority, which makes up 8% of the population, has been targeted by violent mobs several times. However, many reports about the attacks on Hindu temples and communities by Bangladeshi protesters were not true.\n\nA post on X(formerly Twitter) alleged that the house of Liton Das, a famous Bangladeshi Hindu cricketer, had been set on fire, sharing a collage of two pictures as evidence.\n\nIn one image a young man can be seen sitting next to a Hindu place of worship and the other image shows a burning house. More than a million users have seen the post. The collage was also shared by numerous other accounts with similar claims.\n\nDW fact check: False\n\nThe man in the picture is indeed Liton Das, and a reverse image search shows that the image was taken from his official account. However, the burning mansion is not his home. A reverse search of that image leads to media reports about former Bangladesh cricket team captain Mashrafe Mortaza's house being set on fire by protesters.\n\nDW also geolocated the house and confirmed it belonged to Mortaza, who became a target due to his political activities and close alliance with Hasina's Awami League party. The Muslim sportsman was a member of parliament, having won a seat for the second consecutive time as an Awami League candidate during the general elections held in Bangladesh earlier this year.\n\nThere are many claims circulating on various social media platforms about sexual violence against women from the Hindu minority in Bangladesh. Two have been shared multiple times and viewed thousands of times. But some are old, and some have been proven to be earlier events presented out of context, like this case.\n\nClaim: A video shows Muslim men waving a Hindu woman's underwear\n\nThe post on X says, \"Look carefully at these Bangladeshi Muslims: Hindu girls' bras were removed and then they were raped. Now he is roaming the streets with that bra shamelessly and presenting proof of his manhood.\" As of publication, the post had about 30,000 views.\n\nDW fact check: False\n\nThe 23-second video shows protesters storming the prime minister's official residence. Many pictures and videos have been published online showing rioters looting Hasina's belongings, including her clothes and underwear since she fled the country. In the last seconds of the video, a building with red-brown walls is visible, resembling Ganabhaban, the official residence of the Bangladeshi prime minister.\n\nA comparison of the building in the video and images of Ganabhaban from agency footage shows that the building is indeed the official residence of the former prime minister. In the photo below, the palm trees and window shapes match those seen in the last seconds of the video.\n\nAnother post on X shares a screenshot of a Telegram post with a tilted picture of a woman being restrained, accompanied by Bengali text threatening Hindus and encouraging violence to drive them back to India.\n\nClaim: A Hindu woman was sexually assaulted and gang-raped by a group of Muslim men at the University of Dhaka.\n\nThis post (warning: extreme, graphic violence) was published on August 2, three days before Hasina fled the country. But it has been increasingly shared by numerous other accounts in recent days, to date garnering more than 30,000 views.\n\nThe caption reads: \"The so-called Jamaat-e-Islami quota protesters leaked a video of the gang rape of a Hindu girl to the Islamic army group. If Hasina's government falls, they have threatened to rape all Hindu girls out of their homes.\"\n\nDW fact check: False\n\nA reverse image search of that same screenshot has been shared in past years with claims of rape and sexual abuse, but from different regions. For example, it was attributed to a gang rape in the Indian province of Manipur in 2023, claiming to show Hindu men kidnapping and gang-raping a Christian girl. In 2021, it went viral in Indonesia, claiming to show an Indonesian migrant worker woman tortured and raped by five Bangladeshi citizens.\n\nThe Indian fact-checking platform Boom traced the video back to its origin in East Bengaluru's Ramamurthy Nagar in May 2021, where police arrested 12 Bangladeshi nationals, including three women, for the assault and rape of a 22-year-old.\n\nThe plethora of unverified social posts aimed at heightening ethnic tensions in Bangladesh haven't just used old or manipulated images and videos. Content generated by has also played a role.\n\nOne AI-generated image is going viral on platforms like X and Facebook. It depicts a massive crowd gathered around a towering flagpole with the Bangladeshi flag waving at the top, under a hazy sky. The scene suggests a large-scale event or demonstration, symbolizing national pride and unity.\n\nThe image exhibits typical signs of AI generation. The figures on the pole have disfigured, abnormal legs and the perspective is off, with the vertical pole and the background crowd view appearing unusual. Additionally, the proportions of the people on the pole and those below do not match. Several pieces of rope seem to float in the air without connection.\n\nModified versions of this graphic have also been used to promote claims of ethnic violence. For instance, one version includes the words \"ALL EYES ON BANGLADESH, SAVE HINDUS.\" Another AI-generated photomaking the rounds shows a burning Hindu temple with the superimposed \"ALL EYES ON BANGLADESH HINDUS\" text. The foreground depicts numerous bodies lying on the ground, with blood and debris, creating a scene of violence and destruction.", "source": {"uri": "dnyuz.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "DNyuz"},

The focus has largely been on the broader geopolitical tensions, with little attention given to the plight of the Hindu minority. CoHNA is calling on US lawmakers to acknowledge this crisis and act to prevent further atrocities.\n\nIn their appeal, CoHNA has urged US Secretary of State Antony Blinken and the US State Department to closely monitor the situation and ensure that the Bangladeshi authorities take immediate steps to protect their Hindu citizens.\n\nThey have called for the perpetrators of the violence to be held accountable and have requested that the US facilitate the resettlement of the most vulnerable Bangladeshi Hindus through the US Refugee Admissions Program (USRAP).\n\n\"We cannot afford to be silent,\" said CoHNA in their statement, adding, \"The United States has a moral responsibility to prevent another genocide and to stand up for the rights of religious minorities. We urge our lawmakers to issue strong public statements condemning the violence and to take concrete actions that will bring international attention to this crisis.\"\n\nCoHNA has also requested an urgent meeting with US lawmakers to discuss both short-term and long-term solutions to the crisis. They emphasized that silence is not an option and that decisive action by the US could make a significant difference in preventing further violence and protecting the Hindu community in Bangladesh.\n\nThe Coalition of Hindus of North America (CoHNA) is an advocacy group dedicated to promoting the rights and well-being of Hindus across the continent. They work to raise awareness of issues affecting the Hindu community and to foster a greater understanding of Hindu culture and values.

They have seen so much mayhem in the last few days -- property, houses have been destroyed, looted and temples attacked.\n\nOn August 5-6, there was no police force or administrative order and there were attacks on the Hindu community all over the country. Minorities were attacked in all the 64 districts of our country.\n\nThe families that supported and engaged with the Awami League government were the first to be attacked.\n\nIt was only after midnight on Tuesday after Dr Mohammad Yunus's name was announced as the head of the interim government that things started improving.'\n\nIMAGE: A university student controls traffic on the road in the absence of traffic police, August 7, 2024.

We have been connecting with people in cities, towns and villages to know their problems. We have received so many telephone calls from the interior of the country when they were attacked by Muslim fundamentalists.\n\nFor two full days, there was no police to help, no law and order, unbelievable violence and complete lawlessness. In some areas Muslims stood guard in temples and gave protection.\n\nWe received around 200 reports of attacks and looting from different districts till Tuesday. Both Muslim and Hindu policemen were brutally attacked in certain thanas, but the situation is improving.\n\nHindus faced such attacks even after the 2001 election result.'\n\nIMAGE: People Supporter of BNP join in a rally.

Despite the Awami League Party's leader Sheikh Hasina's promise to revoke the quota, the riots have intensified, fueled by economic discontent and high unemployment among the youth. Reports suggest that the Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP) and Jamaat-e-Islami have grabbed the opportunity to mobilise protesters, heightening government sentiments. The absence of an interim government during recent elections, a deviation from tradition, has further exacerbated tensions.\n\nAmidst the ongoing political upheaval, there has been a rise in violence against Hindu minorities. Hindu homes and temples have specifically been targeted, forcing many to seek shelter. Kajal Roy, a Hindu counselor from Rangpur, was among the approximately 100 people who lost their lives during these riots. Disturbing videos have emerged showing vandalism, looting, and arson in Hindu communities, reflecting deep-seated communal tensions.\n\nThe rise of Jamaat-e-islami, known for its hardline islamist views, has intensified fear among minorities. The preying of Hindus underscores a much broader pattern of violence that includes the befouling of historical sites associated with Bangladesh's founding father, Sheikh Mujibur Rahman.\n\nThe political imbalance in Bangladesh has raised a lot of concerns beyond its borders. Many western countries, including the United States, have always shown interest for Sheikh Hasina's removal, citing demographic deficiencies. However, her political ousting and fleeing presents strategic dilemmas, especially for India, which views the Awami League as a crucial ally.\n\nThe opposition leader Khaleda Zia, is regarded has someone having ties with Pakistani intelligence, further complicating regional dynamics. The anticipated uprise of Jamaat-e-Islami poses additional complications, given its historic animosity toward India and its secular neighbors.\n\nThe predicament of the Hindu community in Bangladesh is a reminder of past traumas during the Liberation War, flagging urgent queries about their future safety and rights. Many fear of history repeating itself, on violence and prompting concerns over potential displacements and human rights violations.\n\nIn a recent meeting between Bangladesh's President and numerous political parties, the absence of the Awami League, underlines the fragile political climate. The decision to release the BNP chairperson Khaleda Zia and other political prisoners, along with the deployment of the army to maintain law and order, reflects efforts to stabilize the situation. However, the ongoing communal violence paints a different picture.\n\nThe rising Anti-Hindu violence in Bangladesh showcases the complex interplay between political unrest and communal tensions.

More than a thousand Bangladeshi Hindus reached the Jalpaiguri border of Bengal and became desperate to enter India. But the BSF stopped them at the border and did not let them enter India, but the crowd of Bangladeshi Hindus is still standing at the border. Now, the questions are -- Will India give shelter to Bangladeshi Hindus? Should India give shelter to Bangladeshi Hindus? How can India help Hindus in Bangladesh?\n\nPeople are asking the question that if India can give shelter to Sheikh Hasina, then why can't it give shelter to Bangladeshi Hindus? BJP leader Ajay Alok has tweeted his opinion on this, saying about Rs 1.35 crore Hindus are being targeted in Bangladesh. Where will the Bangladeshi Hindus go? How will they save their lives? Now the time has come that the Indian government will have to think. They will come to India and we will have to give them citizenship. CAA and NRC were brought so that minorities who are victims of atrocities in other countries and come to India should get citizenship in India.\n\nAccording to BJP leader Ajay Alok, now India will have to prepare to settle those Bangladeshi Hindus who escape and come to India. People are saying that if Rohingyas can be settled in India then why not Bangladeshi Hindus, but the Indian government has not taken any decision yet. However, everyone is expecting from the Indian government that it will do something to save Bangladeshi Hindus. But here the issue is also related to national security.\n\nExperts are definitely giving an idea, according to which relief camps can be built on the India-Bangladesh border. These relief camps should be built on Bangladesh's land by India. Hindus coming to the border should be accommodated in relief camps.\n\nBut this will not happen just by India's wish. For this too, the Bangladesh government's permission will be necessary and now there is an anti-India government in Bangladesh. Therefore, this option of saving Bangladeshi Hindus also does not seem possible. Amidst all this, questions are also being raised on the role of India's Foreign Ministry.\n\nIt is being said that the Indian Foreign Ministry could not properly understand the deteriorating situation in the neighbouring country in time. It is being said that the attacks on Hindus in Bangladesh are a diplomatic failure of the Indian Foreign Ministry. It is being said that the decision to give Sheikh Hasina asylum in India is also a reason for the attack on Bangladeshi Hindus.", "source": {"uri": "dnaindia.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Daily News and Analysis (DNA) India"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hindus", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Hindus"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/India", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "India"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bangladesh", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Bangladesh"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Bangladesh"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Government_of_India", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Government of India"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Border_Security_Force", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Border Security Force"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bengal", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Bengal"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bharatiya_Janata_Party", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Bharatiya Janata Party"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Citizenship", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Citizenship"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jalpaiguri", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Jalpaiguri"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Jalpaiguri"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Register_of_Citizens", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "National Register of Citizens"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Citizenship_(Amendment)_Act,_2019", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Citizenship (Amendment) Act, 2019"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rohingya_people", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Rohingya people"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sheikh_Hasina", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Sheikh Hasina"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indian_rupee", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Indian rupee"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crore", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Crore"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twitter", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Twitter"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bangladesh\u2013India_border", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Bangladesh\u2013India border"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Government_of_Bangladesh", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Government of Bangladesh"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ministry_of_External_Affairs_(India)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Ministry of External Affairs (India)"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Religion_and_Spirituality/Hinduism", "label": "dmoz/Society/Religion and Spirituality/Hinduism", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Religion_and_Spirituality/Sikhism", "label": "dmoz/Society/Religion and Spirituality/Sikhism", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 51}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 46}], "image": "https://cdn.dnaindia.com/sites/default/files/styles/full/public/2024/08/08/2645136-dna-3.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9792869", "eventUri": "eng-9792869", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.0980392156862746, "wgt": 126, "relevance": 1}

Following widespread and violent anti-government protests, Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina stepped down on Monday. Over 300 lives have been lost in the chaos, with shocking visuals of Hindu communities under attack circulating on social media. Amidst this turmoil, Bollywood actor Sonu Sood has voiced his support for the beleaguered Indian population.\n\nSood took to X to amplify a heart-wrenching video posted by a user named Mr. Sinha, showcasing the anguish of a Bangladeshi Hindu woman. \"We should do our best to bring back all our fellow Indians from Bangladesh, so they get a good life here. This is not just the responsibility of our Government which is doing its best but also all of us. Jai Hind,'' he wrote in his post. Meanwhile, images of Muslim clerics shielding a Hindu temple in Comilla offer a glimmer of hope amidst the violence. Reports indicate that Hindu homes, businesses, and places of worship across at least 27 districts were targeted by mobs, leading to widespread looting and destruction.\n\nAmidst widespread civil unrest and the subsequent abrupt departure of Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina, Bangladesh is on the cusp of a political transition. President Mohammed Shahabuddin has announced the dissolution of parliament and the formation of an interim government.\n\nAdding to the dramatic developments, the Anti-Discrimination Student Movement has declared its intention to appoint Nobel laureate Dr. Muhammad Yunus as the chief advisor of this new administration.

Bangladeshi actor Shanto Khan and his father, producer Father Selim Khan, were also brutally mob lynched amid the protests.\n\nHasina resigned following massive protests that initially began as an agitation against a job quota scheme but weeks later they turned into a mass movement demanding her ouster from power.

The New York Times faced criticism on social media platforms after it termed attacks on Hindus in the violence-hit nation as \"revenge attacks\".\n\nLater the news publication changed the headline after it faced backlash on social media. The original headline used by the leading publication, \"Hindus in Bangladesh Face Attacks After Prime Minister's Exit,\" drew flak from Indian social media users for its choice of words.\n\nAn X user Aravind took to the microblogging platform and said that if a small riot breaks out and one minority dies, it would be termed as \"genocide\" by NYT.\n\n\"The NYT at last reports on the violence on Hindus in Bangladesh, but terms it as \"revenge attacks\". In India, if a small riot breaks out and one minority dies, it would be termed as \"genocide\" by NYT. We can rage all about such blatant propaganda and fake news, but unless we invest in infiltrating the deep state like Pak and China, this will continue. They have their people in every major western media house spinning narratives for them,\" he said in a post on X.\n\n\"The world never takes Hindus and Indians seriously because they know we are a fatalist culture. We outrage, we make noise, but in the end we say \"nothing can be done about it\", and move on - whatever be the issue. This is the exact reason why in Bangladesh, from its creation, Hindus have been decimated to less than 8% from more than 20% right next to a Hindu majority India.

On 5th August things took a significant turn as Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina Wazed resigned and departed the nation. She has since landed at the Hindon air base in India, where National Security Advisor (NSA) Ajit Doval met her. The army is now in charge of the neighbouring country and has installed an \"interim government\" composed of judges, doctors and former military personnel as announced by Army Chief Waker-uz-Zaman.\n\nMeanwhile, the extremists backed by Begum Khaleda Zia's Bangladesh Nationalist Party and the outlawed Bangladesh Jamaat-e-Islami have taken over the streets. The agitation, which began under the garb of democratic student rallies, has since degenerated into a violent display of unrest, hatred for minorities, especially Hindus, death and devastation. There is nothing democratic about the current state of affairs in Bangladesh, rather, it is shockingly brutal and provides the fundamentalists carte blanche.\n\nIslamists don't need a reason to target minorities in any country and likewise, they are \"saving democracy\" in Bangladesh by going after the Hindus there with impunity. Their counterparts in the Indian media are also dutifully covering up the former's violent deeds, precisely as they always have. Mohammed Zubair, co-founder of Alt News who has always been at the forefront to assist his ideological and religious brethren, has once again stepped in to defend their murderous actions.\n\nInterestingly, despite his unwavering commitment, he is clearly running out of creative ways to advocate for the Islamic zealots. On 6th August, he posted a long thread about Muslims in Bangladesh allegedly 'protecting Hindus' including the customary \"forming a human chain to safeguard temples.\" Anyone will undoubtedly have a deja vu moment because Islamists and their cheerleaders do this routinely to attempt to manipulate public opinion in their favour by portraying Muslims as peaceful and secular people who guard temples and protect Hindus during critical times while ignoring the violent acts of Islamists. However, they never address the reasons or the individuals from whom the Hindus or their temples needed protection as it would expose their bogus narrative.\n\nMohammed Zubair shared multiple posts showing Muslims standing outside temples, including the prominent Dhakeshwari Temple, to guard them in an effort to downplay the ongoing killings and rapes of Hindus as well as the vandalism of their religious places by Islamists . He also mentioned about an alleged appeal from a group called 'Students Against Discrimination' from a mosque to \"maintain communal harmony\" and \"protect Hindu minorities and their wealth from miscreants and evil forces.\"\n\nThese uploads are reminiscent of similar incidents including the infamous episode when 100 Muslim youths reportedly formed a 'human chain' outside a Hanuman temple located near Shampura main road to protect it from arsonists after Islamists wreaked havoc and specifically assaulted Hindus in Bengaluru in 2020.\n\nStrangely, Mohammad Zubair and his fellow apologists never mention who or what the Hindu temples and homes are being protected from.\n\nThe perpetrators were projected as good guys as their crimes were conveniently excused and whitewashed in the name of a \"human chain\" by Mohammad Zubair, who in his desperation to shield the extremists cited a Bangladeshi Islamist account that referred to Hindu females as bitches after a Hindu woman was attacked by a police official in Dhaka and has been spreading hatred against the community for years.\n\nTaking a cue from the Nazi handbook and Adolf Hitler who once stated, \"All propaganda must be confined to a few bare necessities and then must be expressed in a few stereotyped formulas. Only constant repetition will finally succeed in imprinting an idea upon the memory of a crowd,\" the Liberal-Islamist ecosystem and their affiliate media have aced the art of crafting a straightforward narrative that is laced with deception and falsehoods. It then circulates the same lies repeatedly to discredit the persecution of Hindus or insinuate that their suffering is 'collateral damage' and not a product of Islamic oppression while simultaneously depicting the jihadis as kindhearted people.\n\nMohammad Zubair who unleashed a ruthless Islamists after former Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) spokesperson Nupur Sharma for merely quoting a religious text in response to a jibe on Kashi Vishwanath Temple has a similar habit of whitewashing crimes of bigotry perpetrated by Islamists by selectively amplifying the photo-op good samaritanism.\n\nViolence broke out in the state of Maharashtra in 2021 when protests and rallies were held across the state by some Muslim organizations in the aftermath of claims of attack on mosques in Tripura. Two journalists disseminated false information and alleged that a copy of the Quran had been burned and a mosque had been vandalized in Tripura, which set off a chain of violent incidents. The Muslim community even threw stones and indulged in violence when the BJP organized a nonviolent demonstration. However, the media protected the former and blamed the saffron party as well as the Hindus during the entire ordeal.\n\nSimilarly, in 2020 Muslims claimed that the Prophet Muhammad was disrespected and they marched to the streets, igniting chaos in Bengaluru. Hundreds of Muslims armed with sharp metal objects, sticks, iron rods, and other weapons congregated in the vicinity of Dalit Congress MLA Akhanda Srinivasamurthy's home and stormed inside in reaction to an alleged insulting tweet posted by his relative. They pelted stones and set fire to nearby cars, ATMs (Automated teller machines) and stores as well as burned down a police station amidst chants of \"Allahu Akbar\" and \"Naara e Takbeer.\" Some media posts indicated that the riots were not spontaneous but prearranged. Meanwhile, the media was busy defending the rioters by amplifying a video of Muslim men 'forming a human chain' to protect a temple in the area.\n\nDelhi's anti-Hindu riots were also followed by the same events when news articles surfaced detailing how Muslims in the national capital established human chains in an attempt to \"save temples.\" Such \"human chains\" also appeared during demonstrations against the National Register of Citizens (NRC) and the Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA).\n\nSimilar impressions were created and spread during the communal unrest in Delhi Hauz Qazi after the destruction of a Hindu temple nearby. A manufactured narrative that promoted \"secularism\" and the \"bond of brotherhood\" was published in the media, alleging that Muslims were assisting Hindus in \"installing the idols\" and providing meals. As it happened, the reports were refuted by the Hindu activists in the area, who maintained that Muslims were merely providing food for \"photo-ops.\"\n\nThe Liberal-Islamist ecosystem repeats the same trope every single time to condition the masses to elicit a particular kind of social reaction. The first and foremost is to never blame the Muslims or hold them accountable for the mayhem they cause as they are merely a victim of their circumstances. They never initiate any violence and only respond to the events that are thrust upon them. Even when it occurs at the hands of Muslims, the bloodshed simply unfolds as a result of the situation and they are not responsible for it. Hence, anyone could be blamed including the administration, the state, and even the Hindus who are usually victims during such times, but never the Muslims. Lastly, fabricate tales to demonstrate that the Muslim community was not only innocent but was defending Hindus and their holy places to bend the propaganda to the advantage of the former. Notably, in the scenario, the rioters don't have any religion but the 'human chain' always does.", "source": {"uri": "opindia.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "OpIndia"}, "authors": [{"uri":

In Bengali, he writes that 80% of his extended family members live in Bangladesh while he along with some relatives are in India. After the chaos was reported from Bangladesh, he called his relatives to ask about their safety to which his family in Bangladesh said that if Muslims attack, they'll get a befitting reply.\n\nThe next day Arnob called his family again to learn that Muslims had actually attacked their home. However, they remembered Maa Kali, worshipped her name, and picked up weapons to save themselves. They eventually forced all the Muslims to flee back.\n\nHe said that everyone in his family from 8 to 80 performs animal sacrifice, and therefore his relatives in Bangladesh have several sharp weapons used in sacrifices. He claimed that the family used those weapons, along with knives and machetes used in the kitchen, to chase away the attackers.\n\n\"From a distance, the family understood that the Mu$lims were coming. The total number of family members in the house was 27, and they picked up curved swords (used for balis), big fish cutters, vegetable cutters, axes, grass cutters, etc. As the MusLims arrived everyone charged towards them shouting ~ Joy Ma Joy Ma Joy Ma. Seeing them coming with the weapons, the Muslims fled for their lives. I am proud to be a member of this family. The story will be written in golden letters in my life. Jai Bhabani,\" Das posted on Facebook, an English translation of which was posted by author Monidipa Bose - Dey on X (Twitter) along with a screenshot of the original post.\n\nThe post since then has been making rounds on social media with netizens propagating their belief in Maa Kali. The netizens are claiming that every Hindu citizen must keep weapons handy for their safety.\n\nHowever, at present the post is not accessible on Facebook, as Arnob has locked his profile. The veracity of the claims made in the post could not be verified.\n\n\"Hindus these days need the knowledge of sastra along with that of shastra. Every Hindu home should keep a sastra in their home for Bali. We can't depend upon the govt. For our own safety.Govt. will come and go. But self-preservation if of paramount importance,\" one said.\n\n\"Reminded me of Gopal Patha. Chapters of history we were never told about. I have nothing but respect for the devotees of Maa Kali,\" another commented.\n\nThe Hindu goddess Kali represents the ultimate expression of nature, both destructive and beneficent. She defends her people from evil by going above and beyond for those she cares about. The Indian goddess Kali embodies the power of creation and destruction in one entity. Maa Kali is worshipped the most in West Bengal and other nearby areas by Hindus. It is believed that Maa Kali is Mother Nature, primordial, nurturing, creating, and devouring all at once, always protecting her children from harm.\n\nDas attempted to portray the same belief by sharing his story on social media.\n\nAfter Sheikh Hasina's resignation as the Prime Minister of Bangladesh, several Hindu temples have been attacked at the hands of Muslims. Also, more than 50 attacks have happened against Hindus. According to X handle Voice of Bangladeshi Hindus, these attacks happened within five hours of Sheikh Hasina's resignation. Notably, the actual number of attacks could be much higher than reported in the list below. The document has listed 54 attacks.\n\nAlong with several other local temples, the Islamists also attacked the ISKCON temple as confirmed by the Spokesperson for ISKCON India, Yudhistir Govinda Das. \"As per the info I have received, one of our ISKCON centres (rented) in Meherpur (Khulna division) was burnt including with the deities of Lord Jagannath, Baladev, and Subhadra Devi. 3 devotees who lived in the centre somehow managed to escape & survived,\" Das confirmed.\n\nThe Islamists also are believed to have targeted Hindu families residing in the country, the videos of which have been making rounds on social media.\n\nWhile the political landscape of Bangladesh is witnessing one of the toughest times in history, Hindus and other minority communities are the most vulnerable as Islamist mobsters are taking advantage of the situation to attack them. Amidst these attacks, left-liberals and Islamists have been seen either denying or justifying the attacks.", "source": {"uri": "opindia.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "OpIndia"}, "authors": [],

Will Modi Too Fail To Protect Bangladeshi Hindus?", "body": "A tiny news item in The New York Times from 1947 had this title: \"Quit Noakhali or die, Gandhi Warns Hindus.\"\n\nThis report, barely a few paragraphs, was written many weeks after Mahatma Gandhi's four-month mission to restore peace in riot-torn Noakhali in East Bengal (now Bangladesh) failed.\n\nNoakhali saw a horrendous massacre, rape and forced conversion of minority Hindus in October 1946, but Gandhi's mission ended without any resolution.\n\nOne Bengali Muslim leader of that time, A K Fazlul Haq, even claiming that Gandhi was harming Hindu-Muslim amity by his mere presence. He wondered how Muslims could tolerate him.\n\nOdd, for the same Haq was supported by Netaji Subhash Chandra Bose's Forward Bloc and the Hindu Mahasabha of Syama Prasad Mukherjee in the provincial Bengal Legislative Assembly to form a government during 1941-43.\n\nAt that time, Haq was opposed to the Muslim League and Mohammed Ali Jinnah, but in 1946-47, and especially after the Noakhali riots, he showed where his real loyalties lay.\n\nA couple of days ago, The New York Times produced a tendentious headline while reporting on the recent bout of violence against Hindus and Awami League party officials after the Sheikh Hasina government was ousted and the Prime Minister herself had to flee. \"Hindus in Bangladesh face revenge attacks after Hasina's Ouster\", said the headline.\n\nRevenge? For what? Voting for the allegedly \"secular\" Awami League in elections? And was the Awami League as secular as Indians would like to believe?\n\nIt is time to ask a more basic question: Is Bangladesh going to be any different today from when it was East Pakistan?\n\nApart from the vast swathe of Indian territory separating East and West Pakistan, and differences over language policy (Urdu versus Bengali), why do we need to think of Bangladesh as any different from the old East Pakistan?\n\nLet's talk about Hasina herself first, though we must acknowledge that she was a geopolitical friend of India who did not allow anti-India insurgents to operate from her territory.\n\nFor this alone we must give her temporary sanctuary, just as France gave Ayatollah Khomeini sanctuary when the Shah of Iran was in power. This could change in a post-Hasina scenario. But did Bangladesh itself become less Islamist under her skin-deep secularism?\n\nIn 2021, after Bangladesh was rocked by anti-Hindu riots after a Quran was allegedly desecrated, I made a brief reference to how Hasina's own secularism was something for limited consumption. I at that time, quoting from what she had said in 2014.\n\n\"In 2014, Hasina made her intentions clear when she said that Bangladesh will always be a Muslim majority country and it will be run according to the Medina Charter, which the Prophet drew up when he fled from Mecca and had to lead a mixed community which was half-Jewish. But by the time he left Medina to return to Mecca and claim victory, there were no Jewish tribes left. So, the Medina Charter is no consolation to any kafir.\"\n\n\"A Medina charter in Bangladesh will not protect Hindus, for it still privileges Islam. The Bangladesh Constitution, even though it embraces the four ideals of democracy, socialism, nationalism and secularism, starts with an invocation to Allah, which implies that other religions are not on a par with it. Hasina herself has said that \"There will be no law against the Holy Koran and Sunnah here ever.\" How can any other religion, which may disagree with Islam, then claim equal status? Nobody is asking for any law against the Quran, but if abuse of other religions is fair game, how is the field level or secular? The alleged blasphemy against the Quran, which was used as a ruse to attack Hindus in Bangladesh this time, is clearly part of this one-sidedness in Islam.\"\n\nAs in the case of Haq, the line separating genuinely secular leaders and reality has always been a thin one in Muslim-majority Bangladesh.\n\nThe bitter truth is that despite the Awami League's reputation as the only party Hindus could vote for, the evidence does not suggest that the Awami League was any more secular in practice than the opposition Bangladesh National Party or some of the more Islamist outfits.\n\nThe following are summaries or excerpts from one chapter in a book by Deep Halder and Avishek Biswas, Being Hindu in Bangladesh: An Untold Story.\n\nIn chapter 3, titled \"The DNA of Hate\", the authors tell a nuanced tale of how the Awami League had to make its peace with some Islamists, even while former razakars, pro-Pakistani irregular forces who plotted the genocide of Hindus and Bangladeshi freedom-fighters during the independence struggle, had quietly infiltrated the Awami League.\n\nAn exiled Bangladeshi blogger Asad Noor is quoted in the book as saying:\n\n\"It is true that Awami League did not trade in religion, but after the grenade attack on her in 2004, Sheikh Hasina realised she had to reach out to fundamentalists. Understand her politics. Hasima is perceived in Bangladesh to be close to India and India is a Hindu-majority country. To balance this, she has to give a degree of free hand to Islamic hardliners.\"\n\nTaslima Nasrin, another exiled writer whose fictionalised book, Lajja, dealing with the lived reality of Hindus in Bangladesh, was banned by Begum Khaleda Zia. But even after \"secular\" Hasina came to power, the ban on the book was never lifted.\n\nHalder and Biswas give us another example of how the very same forces that backed Pakistan's genocide during the 1971 war were back in Bangladesh after Sheikh Mujibur Rahman was assassinated in 1975. One case relates to Ghulam Azam, who was Amir of the Jamaat-e-Islami before the war.\n\nHe wanted Bangladesh to remain East Pakistan. When the effort failed, he left for Pakistan. But in 1978 he was back in Bangladesh. Though he was later arrested for war crimes and sentenced to life imprisonment, the fact is such people were allowed to come back to create communal mayhem.\n\nA BBC report at that time by Mahfuz Sadique (quoted from the book) noted that moderately Muslim Bangladesh was steadily turned hardcore Salafist with the entry of Saudi money and the building of fundamentalist madrassas and Islamic charities.\n\nNet result, between 2013 and 2016, 48 people, including secular bloggers, Hindus, Buddhists, and foreigners were killed by fundamentalists, with the nadir being plumbed during the in Dhaka's post locality in July 2016. While the Islamic terrorists were killed by special forces, they managed to kill 22 people, mostly foreigners.\n\nThe simple takeout from the book is that despite its \"secular\" credentials, fundamental Islam has been gaining ground during Hasina's tenure.\n\nWhile the book contains many heart-rending stories of the Hindu and other victims of the fundamentalist tide, I have chosen not to focus on these stories and instead underline the fact that the fundamental religious faultline was never healed by the creation of Bangladesh.\n\nThe book must be read as a whole, for it contains a lot more nuance on what is going on in Bangladesh.\n\nA quote from Anthony Mascarenhas, who was Pakistan correspondent of the Sunday Times, London, during the 1971 war, tells us about the horrors Hindus faced at that time (and continue to face now at a lower intensity). Mascarenhas, who was given a chance by the Pakistani army to see their operations in East Pakistan during the war, wrote:\n\n\"For six days I travelled with the officers of the 9th Division headquartered at Comilla. I witnessed at close quarters the extent of the killing. I saw Hindus, hunted from village to village and door to door, shot off-hand after a cursory short-arm inspection showed they were uncircumcised.\"\n\nThere is no reason to think today's Bangladesh, under a more pronounced Islamist regime after the exit of Hasina, will end the torments of Hindus in Bangladesh.\n\nWhether it was Gandhi in 1947 or Narendra Modi in 2024, the only advice to Hindus in Bangladesh seems to be the dismal one: Prepare to die or flee.\n\nIsn't it time the Modi government abandoned abject silence in favour of a more supportive programme to protect hapless Hindus in Bangladesh?", "source": {"uri": "swarajyamag.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Swarajyamag"}, "authors": [{"uri": "r_jagannathan@swarajyamag.com", "name": "R Jagannathan", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hindus", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Hindus"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Awami_League", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Awami League"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A._K._Fazlul_Huq", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "A.

After facing wrath, the New York Times changed the headline to 'Hindus in Bangladesh Face Attacks After Prime Minister's Exit'\n\nSeveral social media users slammed the American newspaper and also pointed out that it did not apologise or issue any explanation for using such headline. \"So NYT suggests that attacks on Hindus are \"revenge\" .... In other words they must has done something bad to start it and needed to be avenged,\" a user wrote on X.\n\nSwaminathan Gurumurthy, the editor of the Tamil political weekly magazine Thuglak and a pro-Hindu voice, also hit out the New York Times.\n\nSeveral reports suggest that Hindus are subjected to atrocities in violence-hit Bangladesh amid unrest in the neighbouring country following Sheikh Hasina's resignation as prime minister and her exit. External Affairs Minister S Jaishankar said that \"what was particularly worrying was that minorities, their businesses, and temples also came under attack at multiple locations.\"\n\nEarlier today, while responding to a question on attacks on minority communities in Bangladesh, MEA spokesperson Randhir Jaiswal said that India is monitoring the situation in the crisis-hit country.

Referring to BJP's campaign that Modi made efforts for mediation between Russia and Ukraine to stop the ongoing war, he wondered if the prime minister could stop the war in Ukraine, he could certainly do so in India's neighbouring country.\n\n\"If he can stop the war between Ukraine and Russia, then tell Papa to stop this war, too. Papa, atrocities are being done against Hindus in Bangladesh, please do justice to them,\" Thackeray said in a dig at the government alluding to the BJP's Lok Sabha elections campaign advertisement.\n\nReacting to the ouster of Sheikh Hasina from Bangladesh, Uddhav Thackeray raised apprehensions that a similar situation could develop in India. \"Do you think that a similar situation should develop in India?\" he asked.\n\nHe cautioned that there is only one message that the people are supreme and no politician should test their patience. \"If you do, then what a people's court can do was seen in Bangladesh. People's court is supreme. The people's court has given a ruling in Bangladesh,\" he added.\n\nHe compared Sheikh Hussain calling students protesters as Razakers and recalled how protesting farmers in India were called terrorists.\n\n\"The farmers who had come to the national capital to protest were called terrorists. This situation in Bangladesh is a warning for everyone. Nobody should think they are above god. We are all humans,\" Thackeray said.\n\nMeanwhile, Uttar Pradesh Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath alleged that Hindus are being selectively targeted in Bangladesh. Referring to the violence in Bangladesh following Sheikh Hasina's resignation after a months-long anti-government protest, Adityanath said, \"Today, all the neighbours of India are burning. Temples are being demolished. Hindus are being selectively targeted and even then we are not trying to find those layers of history as to why such an unfortunate situation has arisen there.\"", "source": {"uri": "andhrawatch.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Andhrawatch"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hindus", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Hindus"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uddhav_Thackeray", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Uddhav Thackeray"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sheikh_Hasina", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Sheikh Hasina"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Narendra_Modi", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Narendra Modi"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ukraine", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Ukraine"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Ukraine"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/India", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "India"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bangladesh", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Bangladesh"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Bangladesh"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shiv_Sena_(Uddhav_Balasaheb_Thackeray)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Shiv Sena (Uddhav Balasaheb Thackeray)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First_Modi_ministry", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "First Modi ministry"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hindu_temple", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Hindu temple"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russia", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Russia"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Russia"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prime_Minister_of_India", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Prime Minister of India"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lok_Sabha", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Lok Sabha"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yogi_Adityanath", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Yogi Adityanath"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chief_minister", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Chief minister"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sheikh", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Sheikh"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Terrorism", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Terrorism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uttar_Pradesh", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Uttar Pradesh"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Uttar Pradesh"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues", "wgt": 9}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Warfare_and_Conflict", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Warfare and Conflict", "wgt": 9}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Territorial_Disputes", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Territorial Disputes", "wgt": 8}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Religion_and_Spirituality/Hinduism", "label": "dmoz/Society/Religion and Spirituality/Hinduism", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Animation/Stop-Motion", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Animation/Stop-Motion", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 95}], "image": "https://andhrawatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/IMG_Shiv_Sankalp_rally_i_2_1_7RD5A6N7.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9792869", "eventUri": "eng-9792869", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.4509803921568627, "wgt": 118, "relevance": 1}

Recent reports indicate a disturbing rise in attacks, including the killing of dozens of Hindus, vandalism of temples, and targeting of Hindu properties.\n\nThe escalating violence has instilled widespread fear among the Hindu community, both in Bangladesh and within the diaspora in the United States. CoHNA has reported a terrifying scale of aggression, including sexual violence against Hindu women, further exacerbating the community's distress.\n\nDrawing parallels to the atrocities during Operation Searchlight in 1971, CoHNA fears another catastrophic loss of life if immediate measures are not taken. They have highlighted the ongoing persecution, noting the historical and current threats faced by the Hindu minority, which constitutes less than eight percent of Bangladesh's population.\n\nCoHNA has criticized the lack of media coverage on the targeted nature of this violence, arguing that the Hindu minority's plight is overshadowed by broader geopolitical tensions. They have called on US lawmakers, including Secretary of State Antony Blinken, to closely monitor the situation and pressure Bangladeshi authorities to protect Hindu citizens.\n\nThe Coalition demands accountability for the perpetrators and requests the US facilitate the resettlement of vulnerable Hindus through the US Refugee Admissions Program (USRAP). CoHNA emphasized the moral responsibility of the United States to prevent another genocide and to stand up for religious minorities.\n\nAdditionally, CoHNA has sought an urgent meeting with US lawmakers to discuss actionable solutions to the crisis. They stressed that silence is not an option and that decisive US action could significantly help in preventing further violence and protecting the Hindu community in Bangladesh.

Govt isn't stopping them", "body": "Jaishanker attributed the current situation in Bangladesh to \"tensions\" brewing since the January 2024 general elections and \"(the) growing polarisation in Bangladesh politics...that aggravated a student agitation that started in June this year...\" (The Indian Express). At Tuesday's all-party meeting, Jaishanker sidestepped Rahul Gandhi's specific query on the involvement of \"foreign forces\".\n\nFor now, the Indian government has decided to play it safe, naming no names in public reactions on a situation that is volatile, violent and unpredictable -- and where lives are at stake. Discretion and quiet diplomacy are the watchwords.\n\nThen what to make of the \"coup conspiracies\" flooding television news -- channels that usually support the central government and reflect its views? On air, there is an aggressive, no-holds-barred blame game, openly accusing Pakistan, China and the US for the street uprisings in Bangladesh and the ousting of Hasina. All caution has been abandoned.\n\nIt's interesting that the government has not tried to tone down or stop this kind of coverage. This suggests it's happy to allow news channels to play up these plots while it maintains a dignified statesmanlike position in public.\n\nNote also that several news channels identified \"intel sources\" for information in their stories. While lurid details of plans to oust the Hasina government, supposedly being hatched across Europe and Asia, are eye-catching, is this wise? We tend to dismiss television news for its sensationalism and biases but these attacks on foreign countries' governments go beyond the usual hyperbole.\n\nSuch denouncements of the protests on TV news media could turn public opinion against Bangladesh and whoever governs it. And, should countries, especially the US, be pronounced guilty in throwaway phrases by TV news anchors?\n\nAlso read: Indian TV news is showing the brewing political war like it is -- giving all parties airtime\n\nDeep state, coup conspiracy\n\nPerhaps the government has decided to simply turn a blind eye. It must be that, otherwise how else could DD News, the official national broadcaster, take such a strong line on the involvement of a possible foreign hand? On Monday at prime time, anchor Ashok Shrivastav called Bangladesh \"another Islamist\" nation and wondered if students or \"someone else\" was behind the loot and violence. He suggested that Bangladesh's Jamaat-e-Islam, Pakistan's ISI, and China might be involved in the protests.\n\nShrivastav spoke of the attacks on Hindus, and \"200-year-old\" temples. Who is behind it, he asked, adding obscurely that those who supported \"democracy\" were very happy with the turn of events -- why?\n\nPrivate news channels had gone down this route much earlier. No sooner did Hasina land in Hindon, near Delhi, early Monday evening than channels like Zee News talked about \"Pak wala coup\", the \"ISI connection\", and secret meetings in London to draw up plans for the agitation.\n\nTimes Now Navbharat headlined the \"China factor\". Republic Bharat said the \"footprint of extremism\" and the Jamaat-e-Islami were written all over the agitation, while Republic TV asked, \"Global powers behind unrest?\"\n\nAnchor Arnab Goswami went much further: He said China and the US were \"happy\" to see Hasina go; and that India was their \"target\". He said the coup \"had American fingerprints all over it...\" Goswami warned us about the American \"deep state'' and Chinese intelligence \"infiltrating\" our society, to overturn \"the verdict of the people of India\". \"If the Americans wanted to enter our backyard,\" he said, \"we must respond on equal terms.\" Heavy stuff.\n\nOn Times Now, the prime-time anchor asked if \"this was a student protest or an Islamist take over?\" in Bangladesh.\n\nBy Tuesday, we were given details of the \"conspiracy angle\", as NDTV 24\u00d77 called it. India Today said it was \"plotted in London/executed in Dhaka\". Its anchor Gaurav Sawant also referred to the \"deep state,\" the US, China and Pakistan. A reporter elaborated: according to \"exclusive intel sources\", the Opposition Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP) met Pakistani ISI officials in Saudi Arabia. The \"mastermind\" was the Islamist student group, Bangladesh Islami Chhatra Shibir (ICS), which \"brainwashed\" students into protests. There was \"rampant\" anti-India material put out on social media after the January elections, he added, as India was seen as an ally of Hasina's.\n\nIndia TV told a very similar story of how Islamists exploited the students' movement. The objective was a change of government, explained TV 9.\n\nHindus under attack\n\nA fallout of these stratagems was targeting the minority Hindus. News channels were filled with images and videos of fires in homes, shops and temples being vandalised. Priests recounted scary stories of the assaults. The ISKON temple was ransacked and pretty much gutted, said the priest to numerous channels.\n\nIn one video on Times Now Navbharat, a woman (presumably a Hindu) was screaming in fear. The channel said that Hindus were being singled out and attacked. CNN-News 18 saw \"Hindus under attack\". India TV and TV 9 presented a grim picture of the continuously decreasing number of Hindus in Bangladesh, down from 13.5 per cent in 1974 to 7 per cent in 2021, according to India TV. \"Where have they gone?\" demanded the anchor.\n\nTimes Now asked, \"Why are Hindus under attack?\". The question wasn't explored although the inference was that they identified with India. Here is another explanation by the newspaper The Hindu. It called out India for being \"complicit\" in Hasina's actions against the Opposition in Bangladesh \"by failing to advise her of the repercussions\". In \"From hope to despair\", the newspaper wrote, \"(India) failed to engage (the Opposition) losing goodwill on Dhaka's streets.\"\n\nAlso read: Indian TV news declares Trump assassination attempt is a global plot. 'Endangers Modi'\n\nSongs of Bangladesh\n\nLastly, the events in Bangladesh poignantly reminded me of two songs by music stars Joan Baez and George Harrison.\n\nSong of Bangladesh by Joan Baez:\n\n\"The story of Bangladesh\n\nIs an ancient one again made fresh\n\nBy blind men who carry out commands\n\nWhich flow out of the laws upon which nation stands\n\nWhich say to sacrifice a people for a land\"\n\nThe visuals we have seen since 5 August bear out these words only too tragically. Between television news and social media, we have been shown a country in chaos, going up in flames -- \"A country fast gone out of control\" said India Today.", "source": {"uri": "theprint.in",

Nobel laureate Muhammad Yunus, heading the interim government, and the Bangladeshi army must restore order and protect minorities. Immediate actions are needed to prevent further erosion of democracy and instability in the region.Reports of Hindu temples, businesses and homes in Bangladesh being vandalised by mobs running amok after the fall of the Sheikh Hasina government are deeply worrying. The interim government, and the Bangladeshi army, must immediately put a stop to these acts of mindless violence that does no good for the reputation of a rebuilding country. Muhammad Yunus, appointed as head of the interim government, won the Nobel Peace Prize in 2006. That should count for something to push for normalcy and real democracy to settle down in Bangladesh. The powers that be in Dhaka must make restoring law and order - and taking action against perpetrators - a priority.\n\nBritish foreign secretary David Lammy has urged for a UN-led investigation into the violent turn of events in Bangladesh over the past weeks. India should support this and demand that attacks against minorities also be included in such an investigation. With its own sizeable Bangladeshi population - and current outbreak of anti-minority violence - Britain should know the dangers of not standing up to communalism.\n\nThere has been a steady erosion of Bangladesh's minority population over the decades - from 19.8% in 1971 to around 8% in 2022. Not taking clear steps to end the current bout of anti-Hindu attacks will continue to chip away democracy in the country and turn it into a breeding ground for fundamentalist forces the people of Bangladesh, let alone of the region, can do well without. New Delhi should swiftly present itself to the new Dhaka dispensation as a reliable partner in an effort to put a lid on this menace. For this purpose, it could also muster up the critical mass of collectives like Bimstec.

And with the ouster of the Sheikh Hasina-led government, there is a possibility of the influx of Hindu refugees into Bengal, one of the states that shares a border with Bangladesh.\n\nIndia Today TV's sister channel Aaj Tak spoke to some residents in North 24 Parganas's Petrapole border, who shared details of the situation in Bangladesh, and how they managed to return amid the chaos. These residents had gone to the neighbouring nation to meet their family, and said that there was a wave of constant fear due to the violent protests that has caused the deaths of more than 400 people so far.\n\nSince morning, scores of people - who went to Bangladesh to meet their families or for other purposes - are returning to safety in India as the unrest escalates in the neighbouring country. The Dhaka-Kolkata direct bus services remain halted.\n\nKalpana Biswas, who is a resident of New Town in North 24 Parganas, came back to India after her tourist visa expired. However, the timing couldn't have been right because she described the situation in Bangladesh in three words - \"Destruction, looting and arson\".\n\n\"I went to Bagerhat to visit a relative. I saw the mob setting a police van on fire yesterday. No offices or other buildings are there (Bagerhat) any more as everything has been turned to ashes... My relatives, who are still there, are gripped in fear,\" she told Aaj Tak.\n\nAnother Bengal resident from Nadia district, who went to meet his sister in Bangladesh's Gopalganj, returned hastily due to the unrest. Arun Kumar Bala also said people in Bangladesh are living in fear.\n\n\"People are terrified due to the violence,\" he said.\n\nArun Bala said that his sister and niece - who have jobs in Bangladesh - are fine for now, but the situation is very volatile. When asked if there are plans for his sister's family, along with her husband - who recently retired - to flee to India, he said that it was going to be difficult.\n\n\"Their life is there,\" Arun Kumar Bala told Aaj Tak.\n\nHe made a tiring journey of going to Khulna early in the morning, and then took an autorickshaw ride to arrive at the Petrapole border.\n\nAn ISKCON temple in Meherpur, located in Bangladesh's Khulna division, and a Kali temple were vandalised and set on fire.\n\nAnother resident, Beauti Das, also from North 24 Parganas, said she was attacked when a mob ransacked a Hindu site on Tuesday night. She somehow managed to flee and come back to India, though her sisters remain in violence-hit Bangladesh.\n\nHindus have been bearing the mob brunt since Bangladesh unrest escalated in a fresh spell last week. Temples were torched, and two Hindu councillors were killed. On Monday, the 140-year-old house where folk musician Rahul Ananda resided with his family was looted and set ablaze. The musician and his family fled the attack.", "source": {"uri": "indiatoday.in", "dataType": "news", "title": "India Today"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hindus", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Hindus"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bangladesh", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Bangladesh"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Bangladesh"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aaj_Tak", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Aaj Tak"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Looting", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Looting"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/India", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "India"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Citizenship_Amendment_Act_protests", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Citizenship Amendment Act protests"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Petrapole", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Petrapole"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bengal", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Bengal"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/India_Today", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "India Today"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vandalism", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Vandalism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Refugee", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Refugee"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bagerhat_District", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Bagerhat District"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Bagerhat District"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Bangladesh"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Town,_Kolkata", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "New Town, Kolkata"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_24_Parganas_district", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "North 24 Parganas district"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "North 24 Parganas district"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arson", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Arson"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nadia_district", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Nadia district"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Nadia district"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gopalganj_District,_Bangladesh", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Gopalganj District, Bangladesh"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Gopalganj District, Bangladesh"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Bangladesh"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Auto_rickshaw", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Auto rickshaw"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kali", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Kali"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Society_for_Krishna_Consciousness", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "International Society for Krishna Consciousness"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Temple", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Temple"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Folk_music", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Folk music"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Khulna_Division", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Khulna Division"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Khulna Division"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Bangladesh"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meherpur_District", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Meherpur District"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Meherpur District"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Bangladesh"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Religion_and_Spirituality/Hinduism", "label": "dmoz/Society/Religion and Spirituality/Hinduism", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Religion_and_Spirituality/Sikhism", "label": "dmoz/Society/Religion and Spirituality/Sikhism", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Religion_and_Spirituality/Jainism", "label": "dmoz/Society/Religion and Spirituality/Jainism", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 54}], "image": "https://akm-img-a-in.tosshub.com/indiatoday/images/story/202408/bangladesh-bengal-petrapole-border-india-today-aaj-tak-ground-report-student-protests-unrest-075724619-16x9_0.png?VersionId=IcIZl77EbrEBxROFQzNqvE.loNAwNZMK", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9792869", "eventUri": "eng-9792869", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.1529411764705882, "wgt": 112, "relevance": 1}

Hindu minorities, the Awami League supporters and the people of Bangladesh who oppose the current dispensation now fear for their lives. The current situation is not looking in favour of them. In an exclusive interview with Meenakshi Ganguly, deputy director of Human Rights Watch's Asia Division, we decode the situation on the ground and what is next for the Hindu minorities in Bangladesh.\n\n\"So it's very concerning that there have been so many deaths in the last 20 days, over 600 people are dead. Some 400 died before Sheikh Hasina stepped down and then, of course, some 250 people have died since she fled to India\" Ganguly on the situation on the ground.\n\nGanguly further shares, \"And it is unfortunate that the Bangladeshis who are celebrating the end of a very repressive rule, chose to commit abuses and almost replicate some of the abuse they may have suffered\"\n\n\"It is encouraging that political leaders, the people and now Prof. Yunus who have just taken over the new interim government have all called for calm and have said that they will focus on protecting people who are under attack\", she adds.\n\nImmediately after the departure of Sheikh Hasina, a subsequent level of violence erupted in the nation.

Quite aside from the strategic security questions which in due course will need sharper focus , in the fast changing situation after the fall of Sheikh Hasina what should be of utmost concern immediately is the plight of the sizable minority community in the country. In the prevailing chaotic situation, Hindus and Sikhs in Bangladesh are being especially targeted by the marauding mobs. According to reports, their homes and businesses are being looted and burnt down, their women abducted and molested. With the police on mass strike to protest the killings of their own dozens of on-duty colleagues since the start of the student protests, anarchical conditions help the anti-India and pro-Pakistani elements to target Hindus freely. Tens of thousands of Hindus have been forced to flee their homes, with quite a few trekking to the border to escape the orgy of mob violence and torture. Though the military authorities are being prodded 24x7 by the Indian High Commission in Dhaka their hands seem to be full in handling the gigantic crisis. The vacuum created by the fast-changing events has led to a sense of instability at the top of the military and civilian administrations as well. Before the grave situation for the minorities further deteriorates, the Modi government needs to take the initiative to convene an all-party meeting for the passage of a unanimous appeal for an immediate end to the atrocities against Hindus and Sikhs in the neighbouring country and call for an early restoration of normalcy. India, with its longest border stretching over 4,000 kilometers, has a special responsibility to keep a wary eye on the fast-changing events in that country. Every internal unrest has repercussions for this country. Since the Partition when the Hindus in Bangladesh were nearly one-third of the population, their numbers have drastically come down, successive waves of minority repression and rioting prompting them to leave the country of their birth and seek shelter in India. Admittedly, the 15-year rule by the Hasina government was good for communal harmony and peace. But now the return of the pro-ISI Jamaat and elements loyal to the pro-Pakistan BNP poses a fresh threat to the minorities. Revenge attacks on them cannot be ruled out in the near future. Our own people, especially in West Bengal cannot be impervious to the sufferings of minorities in the neighbouring country with whom they feel a close cultural and linguistic affinity and have a shared history. Given that West Bengal itself is now home to tens of thousands of former legal and illegal Bangladeshi immigrants, the atmosphere for the return of Hindu Bengalis from the neighbouring country cannot be uniformly wholesome. Nonetheless, troubled and tormented families leaving Bangladesh should be promptly given shelter and other relief, and if they want to settle in India their citizenship applications should be favourably processed under the Citizenship Amendment Act. After all, Hindus, Sikhs, Jains, Parsis, etc. have no other country to call home other than India. They deserve to be treated with utmost empathy and ready support. It is hoped the interim government in Dhaka can restore order as early as possible and work eventually for a fresh election to restore popular rule in the beleaguered country.\n\nThe dreaded military rule by the generals should be kept at bay by all sane elements, including the stake-holders in Bangladesh's hitherto flourishing readymade garments export industry. Meanwhile, it is set to remain the vain hope of the crude elements in our polity who alluding to the events in our neighbourhood virtually threaten the replication of the situation in India. Issuing threats to the recently-elected government while pointedly referring to the events in Bangladesh doesn't make any sense.", "source": {"uri": "freepressjournal.in", "dataType": "news", "title": "Free Press Journal"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hindus", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Hindus"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/India", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "India"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bangladesh", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Bangladesh"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Bangladesh"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sikhs", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Sikhs"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sheikh_Hasina", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Sheikh Hasina"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_strike", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "General strike"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Riot", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Riot"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anti-Indian_sentiment", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Anti-Indian sentiment"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anarchism", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Anarchism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Torture", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Torture"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Partition_of_India", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Partition of India"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Premiership_of_Narendra_Modi", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Premiership of Narendra Modi"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/West_Bengal", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "West Bengal"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "West Bengal"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dhaka", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Dhaka"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Dhaka"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Bangladesh"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Citizenship_(Amendment)_Act,_2019", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Citizenship (Amendment) Act, 2019"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parsis", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Parsis"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bengalis", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Bengalis"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polity", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Polity"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Provisional_government", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Provisional government"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bangladesh_Nationalist_Party", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Bangladesh Nationalist Party"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Military_dictatorship", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Military dictatorship"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jainism", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Jainism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Language", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Language"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Citizenship", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Citizenship"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immigration", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Immigration"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Warfare_and_Conflict", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Warfare and Conflict", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Territorial_Disputes", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Territorial Disputes", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Religion_and_Spirituality/Sikhism", "label": "dmoz/Society/Religion and Spirituality/Sikhism", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Government_Operations", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Government Operations", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 98}], "image": "https://media.assettype.com/freepressjournal/2024-08-07/nn5q9m9h/Untitled.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9792869", "eventUri": "eng-9792869", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.3019607843137255, "wgt": 105, "relevance": 1}

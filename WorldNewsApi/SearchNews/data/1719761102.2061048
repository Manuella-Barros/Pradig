Days after Donald Trump appeared in New York City\u2019s South Bronx neighborhood in an effort to build support with Black and Hispanic voters, Joe Biden and Kamala Harris will hold a joint rally in Philadelphia this afternoon to launch their own outreach effort, Black Voters for Biden-Harris, targeted at African Americans. It is the latest event by the Democratic duo aimed at re-engaging with the racial group that was crucial to their 2020 election victory, and is expected to be similarly vital to their prospects of winning re-election in November. In recent weeks, Biden has met with the plaintiffs in a landmark desegregation ruling and assailed Trump before a prominent civil rights group \u2013 all signs of a concentrated effort to ensure the allegiance of Black voters with the election less than six months away.And yet, familiar challenges for the president remain. New polling from Gallup released yesterday showed his public approval rating is at 39%, which is not the worst it has ever been, but certainly not good. We\u2019ll tell you more about his campaign\u2019s strategy for turning the situation around later on.Here\u2019s what else is going on today: A Democratic Pac announced a $100m investment in attacking Republicans on abortion in key congressional races that will decide control of the House of Representatives. Samuel Alito, the conservative supreme court justice, is under scrutiny again after a New York Times article cast doubt on his explanations for the controversial flag that flew at his house in Virginia. White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre will hold a brief gaggle with reporters as Biden flies to Philadelphia, sometime after 12.10pm. Donald Trump\u2019s hush-money trial is inching towards its conclusion as jury deliberations are expected to start today. You can follow the latest news in our standalone blog on the trial.

We must take this stand and ensure that genocide is never again on the ballot,\u201d said Rabiul Chowdhury, the campaign\u2019s co-chair.The campaign singled out recent Israeli attacks on the southern Gaza city of Rafah, which the White House yesterday said do not cross the red lines it has set on Israel\u2019s actions.

Follow our live blog for the latest from inside the New York city courtroom:Trump hush-money jury to hear instructions before deliberations begin \u2013 live Read moreThere is no reason to think that Donald Trump will perform particularly well in November in the South Bronx, a diverse and impoverished neighborhood in New York city. But Trump went there anyway last week, in a perhaps quixotic attempt to rally Black and Hispanic supporters. The Guardian\u2019s Ed Pilkington was on the scene:Even for a man known for his bombast, Donald Trump\u2019s foray into one of the poorest, most diverse and staunchly Democratic parts of America, New York city\u2019s South Bronx, on Thursday night was an offensive move of breathtaking audacity.He held his rally in the crucible of hip-hop, where 95% of the population is Black or Hispanic and where 35% live below the poverty line. Being Trump, he declared it a historic success.\u201cWhen I woke up this morning I wondered whether it will be hostile or will it be friendly. It was a lovefest!\u201d he said towards the end of his 90-minute speech.Just a few blocks away from Crotona Park \u2013 the location of Trump\u2019s first campaign rally in New York state since 2016 \u2013 is the congressional district of his nemesis, Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez. Trump notoriously told AOC to \u201cgo back\u201d to the country where she came from \u2013 a bold line to take with a woman born in the Bronx.Yet despite arriving in a New York borough that is home to some of his fiercest critics in the Democratic party, Trump strode onto the platform on a balmy evening as though he were returning to his own personal playground. \u201cRight here in the Bronx, I\u2019m thrilled to be back in the city I grew up in, the city I spent my life in,\u201d he said.\u2018Thrilled to be back\u2019: Trump swaps courtroom for Bronx in play for Hispanic and Black votersRead moreWith Joe Biden and Kamala Harris set to debut their outreach effort to Black voters at a joint rally in Philadelphia today, their re-election campaign accused Donald Trump of merely paying lip service to African Americans.\u201cTo no surprise, the Trump campaign has no real outreach or engagement plan to reach Black voters. Unlike our campaign, Trump believes that he does not need to put in any effort to earn the support of Black America,\u201d the Biden-Harris campaign said in a statement that accused Trump of \u201crunning on an anti-Black agenda\u201d.\u201cTrump used his time in the Oval Office to make life worse for Black America, and if reelected, he will go to enormous lengths to undermine and hurt Black communities by repealing Obamacare and ripping away health care from millions of Black Americans, continue to divide the nation by emboldening white supremacists, and support policy that works to widen the racial wealth gap. And even if he did have a positive agenda for Black Americans, he doesn\u2019t have the resources or support to tell it.\u201dGood morning, US politics blog readers.

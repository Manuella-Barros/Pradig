Then it took them 14 years to return to the Premier League under Marcelo Bielsa. This time it will not be so long and Leeds\u2019 owners, the 49s Enterprises, have ambition to match their cash. They wanted it to happen this season to allow them to start spending and they have plans to redevelop Elland Road. The big question is will they stick with Daniel Farke? Will they rebuild for another promotion tilt under him or will they go for someone else as they are big fans of Graham Potter. They will find it hard to hang on to the Championship Player of the Year, Crysencio Summerville, who was subbed, while loan stars Joe Rodon will return to Tottenham and Connor Roberts to Burnley. Leeds\u2019 thumping of Norwich in the semi-final second-leg masks how poor their run-in has been. That victory was one of only two wins in their last nine games and after powering to the top in March, they ran out of petrol. They were back to their bad-old habits at Wembley and their defending for Adam Armstrong\u2019s goal was woeful. Ethan Ampadu stepped up to give him far too much space to pick his spot to beat Ilan Meslier. Armstrong has four goals in three games against Leeds this season and you would think they would know by now to keep close watch on him. Leeds\u2019 finishing was also woeful and their front four of Summerville, Joel Piroe, Georginio Rutter and Willy Gnonto failed to trouble Alex McCarthy. Dan James replaced Gnonto and his effervescent display begged the question why Farke had not started him? James went closest to scoring for Leeds, first when he cracked the bar and then when he was denied by McCarthy in stoppage time. Several Leeds players fell to the ground when the final whistle blew and Mateo Joseph punched the turf in frustration. It was another hard-luck story for Leeds and they have had too many of those.

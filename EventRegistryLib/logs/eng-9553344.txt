Check out our UFC odds series for our Buckley-Ruziboev prediction.\n\nUFC St. Louis: Derrick Lewis vs. Rodrigo Nascimento continues on the main card with the co-main event in the welterweight division between Joaquin Buckley and Nursulton Ruziboev. Buckley is coming off three consecutive victories since moving down to the welterweight division meanwhile, Ruziboev has now won 10 straight fights and both of his fights inside the Octagon. With that said, check out our UFC odds series for our Buckley-Ruziboev prediction and pick.\n\nJoaquin Buckley (18-6) is coming off the biggest win of his career when he finished Vicente Luque in round two via ground-and-pound. Buckley was campaigning for the main event slot in his hometown of St. Louis but ultimately had to settle for the co-main event. Now, Buckley will look to make big on his golden opportunity in front of his friends and family when he takes on Nursulton Ruziboev this weekend at UFC St. Louis.\n\nNursulton Ruziboev (34-8-2) has been on an absolute tear with 10 straight victories inside round one. Two of those 10 victories came inside the Octagon which both combined for less than five minutes of fight time. Ruziboev will be cutting back down to 170 lbs for the first time since 2021 for the opportunity to face off against the surging Joaquin Buckley this weekend at UFC St. Louis.\n\nHere are the UFC St. Louis Odds, courtesy of BetOnline.\n\nUFC St. Louis Odds: Joaquin Buckley-Nursulton Ruziboev Odds\n\nJoaquin Buckley has looked like a changed fighter ever since he decided to drop in weight from middleweight to welterweight. He is now fighting fighters his size (except for this weekend) while his speed and power have transitioned from middleweight to welterweight. Buckley will be putting his three-fight winning streak on the line when he takes on Nursulton Ruziboev this weekend at UFC St. Louis.\n\nBuckley looked the best he's ever looked against his stiffest competition to date Vicente Luque in his last fight. Albeit it wasn't against a prime Luque nonetheless, it was a very experienced Luque who's fought some of the best fighters in the world and he just outclassed in every possible way. He will now be going against the surging Nursulton Ruziboev who has won 10 straight fights and a winner of two straight inside the Octagon. Ruziboev will be dropping in weight for this matchup after fighting less than two months ago at middleweight.\n\nWhile he was already a big middleweight he is an even bigger welterweight and hasn't made the cut to 170 lbs since 2021. Also, of Ruziboev's eight losses, seven of them have come at 170 lbs. Buckley will have a distinct speed advantage in this fight and he will need to utilize that along with his power in his strikes and leg kicks to hammer away at Ruziboev as long as he can dart in and out without getting touched up he could run away with this fight and make it four in a row in his new weight class.\n\nWhy Nursulton Ruziboev Will Win\n\nNursulton Ruziboev came into his UFC debut riding an eight-fight first-round finish streak and he made the most of his short-notice call-up when he knocked out Brunno Ferreira in less than two minutes. He followed up that knockout with yet another knockout of Sedriques Dumas in his most recent fight back in March. Ruziboev will be looking to make it 3-0 in the UFC in less than a year with the promotion after stepping in on less than two months' notice in the highest-profile fight of his career against Joaquin Buckley this weekend at UFC St. Louis.\n\nRuziboev is a solid fighter will skills to win on the feet and on the mat. He trains out of Marquez Mixed Martial Arts with the Philly boys Joe Pyfer, Sean Brady, and Pat Sabatini just to name a few. While many believe Ruziboev to be a knockout artist due to his recent success on the feet, actually 20 of his 34 victories have come by submission. He is a fighter that is very hard to gameplan against because of his massive height at 6'5'' and his reach of 76'' which surprisingly will not be a factor as it is the identical reach of Buckley. However, his long-range weapons will help keep him out of harm's way against a power puncher like Buckley and if he can keep this fight upright and at his preferred he can potshot and counter his way to victory and get his 11th win in a row and his third win inside the Octagon.\n\nFinal Joaquin Buckley-Nursulton Ruziboev Prediction & Pick\n\nThis fight should be an absolute banger in the co-main event of this fight card. You can expect a ton of heavy artillery thrown on both sides. This is going to be a tough fight for Buckley having to deal with such a tall and long opponent but from the looks of it on his social media, he brought in a ton of tall and long high-level boxers to train against. However, Ruziboev is a tricky fighter that has some grappling skills we have yet to see which could throw Buckley off his game if he elects to go that route.\n\nUltimately, things will be close early on but once Buckley can get his timing down he's going to be too fast and too powerful for Ruziboev who's going to have a rough time trying to counter at range with the speed of Buckley and his cut 170 lbs will certainly not help as well as Buckley goes in there and outworks Ruziboev to a decision victory in front of his home crowd.\n\nClick here for more betting news and predictions", "source": {"uri": "clutchpoints.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "ClutchPoints"}, "authors": [{"uri": "garrett_kerman@clutchpoints.com", "name": "Garrett Kerman", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joaquin_Buckley", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Joaquin Buckley"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Welterweight_(MMA)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Welterweight (MMA)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Middleweight", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Middleweight"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ultimate_Fighting_Championship", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Ultimate Fighting Championship"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/St._Louis", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "St. Louis"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "St. Louis"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vicente_Luque", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Vicente Luque"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Welterweight", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Welterweight"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pound_(mass)", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Pound (mass)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rodrigo_Nascimento", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Rodrigo Nascimento"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Card_(sports)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Card (sports)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mixed_martial_arts", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Mixed martial arts"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knockout", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Knockout"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pat_Sabatini", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Pat Sabatini"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sean_Brady_(fighter)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Sean Brady (fighter)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weight_class", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Weight class"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grappling", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Grappling"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Boxing", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Boxing", "wgt": 8}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Martial_Arts/Submission_Fighting_and_MMA", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Martial Arts/Submission Fighting and MMA", "wgt": 18}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Boxing/Fan_Pages", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Boxing/Fan Pages", "wgt": 9}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Team_Spirit/Fight_Songs", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Team Spirit/Fight Songs", "wgt": 18}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Boxing/Boxers", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Boxing/Boxers", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 99}], "image": "https://wp.clutchpoints.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Joaquin-Buckley-vs.-Nursulton-Ruziboev-prediction-odds-pick-for-UFC-St.-Louis.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9553344", "eventUri": "eng-9553344", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1058823529411765, "wgt": 231, "relevance": 1}

However, there can only be one winner, and this is a tight fight to handicap.\n\nJoaquin Buckley vs. Nursulton Ruziboev serves as the co-main event for this weekend's UFC Fight Night, and one of our premier events for UFC betting.\n\nBuckley believes his time has come for a step up in class, and he's in a position to earn his shot against the dangerous and highly regarded Ruziboev.\n\nUFC odds have Buckley a slight -145 favorite, with Ruziboev coming back at +115. Here are my best free UFC Fight Night: Buckley vs. Ruziboev predictions from the Enterprise Center in St. Louis, Missouri.\n\nAfter three impressive wins since moving down to welterweight, Joaquin Buckley is finally stepping into the spotlight in the co-main event, although his opponent poses a formidable challenge. This will be the fight that separates Buckley from the middle of the pack with a win, or likely grounds him there with a loss.\n\nNursulton Ruziboev has garnered significant hype, particularly after showcasing his destructive prowess in his two UFC fights. However, Buckley represents the toughest test of his career and is performing at his peak. Buckley's athleticism and striking have delivered three consecutive knockout victories since his return to welterweight.\n\nDespite Ruziboev's imposing size and power, Buckley is in peak form and possesses considerable momentum. While Ruziboev boasts solid striking defense and grappling skills, Buckley will need to employ creative tactics to overcome his opponent's physical advantages. However, he must also remain cautious, as Ruziboev's ability to take him down could result in a stoppage on the mat.\n\nRuziboev telegraphing his punches and looking winded after three minutes against Sedriques Dumas in his last fight wasn't exactly encouraging considering he's dropping even lower in weight. While Ruziboev possesses the potential to stop Buckley with a well-placed strike, his effectiveness may be limited to the first round, especially if Buckley employs strategic leg kicks and lateral movement to target his opponent's gas tank.\n\nWhile Ruziboev might have been favored if the fight were at middleweight, the weight cut to welterweight slightly tips the scales in Buckley's favor. It is a tough one to pick, but I'm willing to bet that Buckley is for real, and he will be able to announce his arrival with a win over a tough opponent.\n\nBuckley and Ruziboev are both coming off knockout wins, indicating their shared preference for ending fights early. Ruziboev appears to rely more on powerful single strikes, while Buckley deploys a strategy of darting in and out to create opportunities for his own heavy shots.\n\nThe first round will be crucial, as Ruziboev might exhaust himself pursuing knockouts or Buckley could fall victim to a well-timed punch. Both fighters will undoubtedly pursue a finish if they sense an opportunity, and if Buckley manages to push Ruziboev into the second round, he'll be in uncharted territory.\n\nDepending on Ruziboev's approach and conditioning in the opening round, he may find himself fatigued or close to it by the second. He might resort to his grappling skills, utilizing his long reach and stiff strikes to control Buckley's movement and conserve energy. Meanwhile, Buckley will likely maintain pressure and look for openings to finish the fight once he senses that Ruziboev's stamina is compromised.\n\nWhile predicting a winner is challenging, the fight will likely end by stoppage rather than going the distance. The best bet for the Buckley vs. Ruziboev matchup is that it doesn't reach the final bell.", "source": {"uri": "covers.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Covers.com"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joaquin_Buckley", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Joaquin Buckley"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ultimate_Fighting_Championship", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Ultimate Fighting Championship"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Welterweight", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Welterweight"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knockout", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Knockout"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/St._Louis", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "St. Louis"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "St. Louis"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enterprise,_Nevada", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Enterprise, Nevada"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Enterprise, Nevada"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strike_(attack)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Strike (attack)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grappling", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Grappling"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weight_cutting", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Weight cutting"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Middleweight", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Middleweight"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Boxing", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Boxing", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Boxing/Fan_Pages", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Boxing/Fan Pages", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Home_and_Garden/Packing_and_Shipping_Supplies", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Home and Garden/Packing and Shipping Supplies", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Boxing", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Boxing", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 94}], "image": "https://img.covers.com/cms/covers/672d3853-a26d-49a3-84ba-df78003e1b04.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9553344", "eventUri": "eng-9553344", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.0117647058823529, "wgt": 208, "relevance": 1}

Buckley believes he willed this homecoming into existence by calling for it after he TKO'd Vicente Luque to score the biggest win of his career just six weeks ago.\n\n\"That's just how the universe works. When you speak things out and when you're unafraid and confident and you actually work toward things, the universe will reward you.\" Buckley told reporters at UFC on ESPN 56 media day. \"Dana (White), obviously hearing that I wanted to fight in my hometown city and obviously having someone like me be on the card, he only knew that the numbers were gonna go up. I'm glad he took the opportunity by putting me on the card. Now we're here, let's go.\"\n\nBuckley (18-6 MMA, 8-4 UFC) has been on a roll since he moved down from middleweight to welterweight, winning three in a row, including the finish of Luque that propelled him into the rankings. Buckley is taking a risk against Ruziboev (34-8-2 MMA, 2-0 UFC), a traditional middleweight who is coming down to welterweight.\n\nThing is, all that really seemed to matter to Buckley is fighting in St. Louis.\n\n\"It has nothing to do with the opponent,\" Buckley said. \"Obviously they had to find somebody that wasn't even a welterweight fighter to get on there. So, for me, it was just the opportunity to actually be able to fight. With Nursulton, I don't know if he's gonna make the weight, but it don't even matter. I've already adjusted my mind set that no matter what he steps from the scale as, as long as I've got an opponent, we're good. I'm feeling to knock this boy out. ...\n\n\"Right now having the energy of my hometown, having my family out watching me, and it's been years since they watched me live last time I fought in St. Louis for Bellator back in the day. I feel like now that I get the opportunity to fight in my city, I've got to turn up. I've got to do the most - what people expect, right?

He's fought at welterweight a handful of times in the past, and in speaking with him ahead of this bout, suggested that he doesn't cut much weight to compete at '85, which ups the ante even more.\n\nFREE FIGHT: Joaquin Buckley vs Vicente Luque\n\nThrough two UFC starts, the Philadelphia-based fighter is 2-0 with a pair of first-round stoppage wins; first blasting out Brunno Ferreira last July, and then finishing Dumas in a bout where there were some unfortunate eye pokes that factored into things. He's won 10 straight overall, trains with a great team led by John Marquez, and gets a chance to make an immediate impact in his new surroundings on Saturday.\n\nA St. Louis native, Buckley lobbied for a chance to be on this card and now makes the same quick turnaround as Ruziboev, having earned the biggest win of his career two fights after his new opponent bested Dumas in Atlantic City by stopping Vicente Luque in the second round. The 30-year-old is 3-0 since returning to welterweight himself and his dynamic movements and unquestioned athleticism have helped him become a person of interest in the division, and a second win this year would certainly push him further up the rankings.\n\nThis is a potential breakout moment for Ruziboev -- a co-main event assignment in just his third UFC appearance, against a ranked local favorite no less, and if he can make the transition to welterweight seamlessly, he'll head into the second half of 2024 with a number next to his name and plenty of options when it comes to his next fight.", "source": {"uri": "ufc.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Ultimate Fighting Championship"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joaquin_Buckley", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Joaquin Buckley"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Welterweight_(MMA)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Welterweight (MMA)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Middleweight", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Middleweight"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atlantic_City,_New_Jersey", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Atlantic City, New Jersey"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Atlantic City, New Jersey"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uzbekistan", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Uzbekistan"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Uzbekistan"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vicente_Luque", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Vicente Luque"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Welterweight", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Welterweight"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ultimate_Fighting_Championship", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Ultimate Fighting Championship"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/St._Louis", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "St. Louis"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "St. Louis"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Boxing", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Boxing", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Boxing/Fan_Pages", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Boxing/Fan Pages", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Boxing/Gyms", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Boxing/Gyms", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Boxing/History", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Boxing/History", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 93}], "image": "https://dmxg5wxfqgb4u.cloudfront.net/styles/card/s3/2024-05/GettyImages-2071935608_resized.jpg?itok=6is8-lv8", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9553344", "eventUri": "eng-9553344", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.4509803921568627, "wgt": 181, "relevance": 1}

He's locking horns with Nursulton Ruziboev, a fighter from Uzbekistan, who's looking for his 11 straight win. Still, based on the UFC on ESPN 56 odds, the American fighter is more likely to win.\n\nJoaquin Buckley is 18-6 with 13 wins by KO/TKO. He's never won or lost a fight by submission. The reason for this is that he always seems to manage to turn his fights into striking duels. So far, it's been working great for him.\n\nIt's really no surprise that he likes fighting that way. After all, he's one of the finest kickboxers in the UFC Welterweight Division. This guy lands 4.06 significant strikes per minute, which are also incredibly powerful.\n\nHe's also very fun to watch, the evidence being that he's the man responsible for one of the greatest KO wins in the history of the UFC - the spinning backkick knockout that turned the lights off for Impa Kasanganay.\n\nHis only downside is that he's a relatively short guy. He's 5'8, which isn't too short for a welterweight fighter. However, on May 11, he's fighting against a 6'5 opponent.\n\nNursulton Ruziboev is a 6'5 fighter who's moving down to the Welterweight Division after two wins in the Middleweight Division of the UFC. Both of those wins were by KO/TKO. And before that, he won eight fights straight in order promotions, each time by a finish.\n\nHe's 34-8-2-2 overall with 32 finishes - 20 KO/TKO wins and 12 by submission. He's a decent boxer who lands just under 4 significant strikes a minute in the UFC. What's also interesting is that so far, he's only gotten hit 4 times in the UFC.\n\nWhat's also interesting is that despite his height advantage over most of his opponents, he doesn't mind getting in the clinch or taking the fight to the ground. In fact, we suspect that he might do precisely that on May 11, and try to finish Buckley by submission.\n\nOur prediction for the UFC on ESPN 56 co-main event is that the fight will not last until the final bell. One of these will finish the other one. But who will it be? Even though the Buckley vs. Ruziboev odds favor the St. Louis native, we think the visitor from Uzbekistan will stage an upset.", "source": {"uri": "gamblingnews.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "GamblingNews"}, "authors": [{"uri": "jessie_carter@gamblingnews.com", "name": "Jessie Carter", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joaquin_Buckley", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Joaquin Buckley"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knockout", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Knockout"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ultimate_Fighting_Championship", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Ultimate Fighting Championship"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Welterweight_(MMA)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Welterweight (MMA)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ESPN", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "ESPN"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/St._Louis", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "St. Louis"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "St. Louis"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Impa_Kasanganay", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Impa Kasanganay"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Welterweight", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Welterweight"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uzbekistan", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Uzbekistan"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Uzbekistan"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Middleweight_(MMA)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Middleweight (MMA)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boxing", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Boxing"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Boxing", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Boxing", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Boxing/Fan_Pages", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Boxing/Fan Pages", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Boxing/Gyms", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Boxing/Gyms", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Boxing/History", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Boxing/History", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 95}], "image": "https://www.gamblingnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/ufc-fight-gloves.jpeg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9553344", "eventUri": "eng-9553344", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-05-11", "textStart": 92, "textEnd": 98, "freq": 3}], "sentiment": 0.1686274509803922, "wgt": 176, "relevance": 1}

Ruziboev, who most recently competed at welterweight in February 2022, insists the move back down will be seamless.\n\n\"When I fight at middleweight, I do my weight cut in just one day,\" Ruziboev told MMA Junkie through an interpreter. \"Last day, I do weight (cut), and for me this is easy for 170 right now. Right now, I'm (about 190 pounds) because for me it's easy, 170. Not too much weight cut.\"\n\nLike Khamzat Chimaev did upon signing with the UFC, Ruziboev has plans of competing at both welterweight and middleweight moving forward.\n\n\"Now I have (to) focus on this fight at 170 right now with Buckley, and after this fight, I need to talk with my management,\" Ruziboev said. \"If possible, I want to fight at middleweight and welterweight.\"\n\nRuziboev meets Buckley, who has found great success since moving back down to welterweight himself.

Buckley believes he willed this homecoming into existence by calling for it after he TKO'd Vicente Luque to score the biggest win of his career just six weeks ago.\n\n\"That's just how the universe works. When you speak things out and when you're unafraid and confident and you actually work toward things, the universe will reward you.\" Buckley told reporters at UFC on ESPN 56 media day. \"Dana (White), obviously hearing that I wanted to fight in my hometown city and obviously having someone like me be on the card, he only knew that the numbers were gonna go up. I'm glad he took the opportunity by putting me on the card. Now we're here, let's go.\"\n\nBuckley (18-6 MMA, 8-4 UFC) has been on a roll since he moved down from middleweight to welterweight, winning three in a row, including the finish of Luque that propelled him into the rankings. Buckley is taking a risk against Ruziboev (34-8-2 MMA, 2-0 UFC), a traditional middleweight who is coming down to welterweight.\n\nThing is, all that really seemed to matter to Buckley is fighting in St. Louis.\n\n\"It has nothing to do with the opponent,\" Buckley said. \"Obviously they had to find somebody that wasn't even a welterweight fighter to get on there. So, for me, it was just the opportunity to actually be able to fight. With Nursulton, I don't know if he's gonna make the weight, but it don't even matter. I've already adjusted my mind set that no matter what he steps from the scale as, as long as I've got an opponent, we're good. I'm feeling to knock this boy out. ...\n\n\"Right now having the energy of my hometown, having my family out watching me, and it's been years since they watched me live last time I fought in St. Louis for Bellator back in the day. I feel like now that I get the opportunity to fight in my city, I've got to turn up. I've got to do the most - what people expect, right? They want that viral moment, and I feel like we're gonna get that.\"\n\nThat moment, should it happen, would create quite the scene Saturday night, and Buckley - who owns perhaps the greatest knockout in UFC history - envisions the fight ending in that fashion.\n\n\"It will come to me naturally, but I do have a setup,\" Buckley said. \"I do have something in mind that I want to do and I want to hit him. It all depends on Nursulton and how he comes. Regardless, though, I know that knockout is gonna be there at the end of the day.\"", "source": {"uri": "ca.sports.yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo Sports Canada"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Welterweight", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Welterweight"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ultimate_Fighting_Championship", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Ultimate Fighting Championship"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ESPN", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "ESPN"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/St._Louis", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "St. Louis"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "St. Louis"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enterprise_Center", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Enterprise Center"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vicente_Luque", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Vicente Luque"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mixed_martial_arts", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Mixed martial arts"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Middleweight", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Middleweight"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knockout", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Knockout"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bellator_MMA", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Bellator MMA"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Viral_video", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Viral video"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Relationships", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Relationships", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Relationships/Romance", "label": "dmoz/Society/Relationships/Romance", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 97}], "image": "https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/IEUGhADggsAGpXqpJFe2qA--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyMDA7aD02NzU7Y2Y9d2VicA--/https://media.zenfs.com/en/mma_junkie_usa_today_articles_344/fdc928bae340b4dda37b2d05d1e5f772", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9553344", "eventUri": "eng-9553344", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.2156862745098038, "wgt": 452992393, "relevance": 2}], "totalResults": 16, "page": 1, "count": 1, "pages": 16}}}

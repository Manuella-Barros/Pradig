He threw a career-high 114 pitches in a game that included a 1-hour, 16-minute rain delay in the first inning.\n\nJoe Musgrove pitched the Padres' first no-hitter against Texas on April 9, 2021. Houston's Ronel Blanco threw the only other no-hitter this season, against Toronto on April 1.\n\nCease was within one out of a no-hitter for the Chicago White Sox against Minnesota on Sept. 3, 2022, when Arr\u00e1ez lined a single to right-center on a 1-1 slider over the middle of the strike zone.\n\n\"Think I had a little flashback right there: Make sure I get the slider a little bit lower,\" Cease said. \"Man off the bat right there, it looked kind of like a bloop hit. I saw it stay up. Just screaming and yelling. That was awesome.\"\n\nCease's pitch count was 94 after the seventh inning. He lobbied manager Mike Shildt to keep him in the game.\n\n\"He said nice job. And I looked up and it was like 94 pitches. I just said 'I feel great.' And if we get through the next one in like 105. I've have thrown 113 this year,\" Cease recalled. \"Thankfully, they let me talk him into it. And then, he we are.\"\n\nThe closest Washington came to a hit was when Juan Yepez lofted a fly to shallow center in the fifth inning. The ball popped out of second baseman Xander Bogaerts' glove, but center fielder Jackson Merrill was there to snare the ball before it hit the ground.\n\nBogaerts also bobbled a ball after making a diving stop of Keibert Ruiz's grounder with one out in the eighth but recovered in time to throw out the slow-footed catcher at first.\n\nCease threw 60 sliders against the Nationals along with 39 fastballs averaging 98.3 mph -- 1.4 mph above his season average -- and 10 knuckle-curves.\n\nHis previous complete games also were shutouts: a seven-inning three-hitter against Detroit on April 29, 2021, and the win over the Twins.\n\nCease allowed only three baserunners. Lane Thomas walked with one out in the first inning and was caught stealing, then reached on another walk in the fourth but was erased on Jesse Winker's double-play grounder. Abrams walked leading off the seventh and was stranded at second base.\n\nWashington was no-hit for the second straight season. Philadelphia's Michael Lorenzen achieved the feat last Aug. 9.\n\nSan Diego has won five in a row and earned its third series sweep of the season and first on the road. The Padres swept Oakland and Washington at home last month.\n\nWashington was swept for the sixth time this season and finished 0-6 against San Diego. It was the first time the Padres went undefeated against the Nationals/Montreal Expos franchise since both teams joined the National League in 1969.\n\nSan Diego loaded the bases in the first with a single and two walks against Patrick Corbin (2-10) before the delay while Ha-Seong Kim was batting, When the game resumed, Kim worked a full count before poking a single to left-center that scored all three runners.\n\nUP NEXT\n\nPadres: Open a series Friday at Baltimore.\n\nNationals: LHP MacKenzie Gore (6-8, 4.20 ERA), whose two-inning outing Saturday against Cincinnati was his shortest start of

He knows what this looks like. We let him ride.\"\n\nCease needed only nine pitches in the eighth and 11 in the ninth in a 3-0 victory over the Washington Nationals on Thursday that completed a three-game sweep.\n\nAfter falling one out short of a no-hitter two years ago when he gave up a single to current teammate Luis Arr\u00e1ez, Cease retired Ildemaro Vargas and Jacob Young on a groundouts for the first two outs of the ninth, then got CJ Abrams to hit a flyout to right on a 1-0 slider.\n\n\"My thought was I'm going to throw a slider and I'm going to get it down, and if it's down he's either hopefully going to beat it into the ground or he can't put in play,\" Cease said. \"I didn't like it off the bat. It looked very hitterish, but fortunately fate's on my side today.\"\n\nCease (10-8) struck out nine and walked three in the 28-year-old right-hander's third complete game in 145 big league starts. He threw a career-high 114 pitches in a game that included a 1-hour, 16-minute rain delay in the first.\n\n\"The first inning, he comes in and says 'I'm not quite there,'\" Shildt recalled. \"The second inning, 'Getting there.' Then the third inning, he just hit his stride.\"\n\nMusgrove pitched the Padres' first no-hitter against Texas on April 9, 2021. Houston's Ronel Blanco threw the only other no-hitter this season, against Toronto on April 1.\n\nCease was within one out of a no-hitter for the Chicago White Sox against Minnesota on Sept. 3, 2022, when Arr\u00e1ez lined a single to right-center on a 1-1 slider over the middle of the strike zone.\n\n\"I've been close and to finally get it done, it's one of those things that feels so remarkable and hard to believe,\" Cease said. \"To be able to do it and go out and experience it, I really don't even know how to feel. Just happy.\"\n\nHe worried about the pitch count causing an early end to his outing.\n\n\"Thankfully, we were able to talk it out,\" Cease said. \"I just said 'I feel really good right now. Next inning, if I'm kind of erratic or use up too many pitches, pull me then. But give me a shot, at least.' Thankfully, we worked it out.\"\n\nShildt said he wasn't going to allow Cease's pitch count to rise into the high 120s. He said there was no further conversation after Cease breezed through the eighth.\n\n\"I just love the conviction,\" Shildt said. \"I think it's important in my chair to be able to be open-minded and listen to your athletes. He felt good. He felt convicted. He made a really strong case. I want him to go out, too, but looking at the big picture and the factor (of the rain delay) before, and once I cleared that with him, he was good.\"\n\nThe closest Washington came to a hit was when Juan Yepez lofted a fly to shallow center in the fifth inning. The ball popped out of second baseman Xander Bogaerts' glove, but center fielder Jackson Merrill was there to snare the ball before it hit the ground.\n\n\"I was just playing keepy-ups, making sure it didn't hit the ground,\" Merrill said. \"As soon as he calls me off, I'm there and I'm ready for anything that happened --- if it bounces off him, goes the other way, I'm ready for anything.\"\n\nBogaerts also bobbled a ball after making a diving stop of Keibert Ruiz's grounder with one out in the eighth but recovered in time to throw out the slow-footed catcher at first.\n\n\"It feels like every no-hitter, there's a couple plays like that are just remarkable,\" Cease said.\n\nCease threw 60 sliders against the Nationals along with 39 fastballs averaging 98.3 mph -- 1.4 mph above his season average -- and 10 knuckle-curves. Cease induced 12 groundouts. The Nationals swung and missed 18 times, including six on strikeouts.\n\nHis previous complete games also were shutouts: a seven-inning three-hitter against Detroit on April 29, 2021, and the win over the Twins.\n\nCease allowed only three baserunners. Lane Thomas walked with one out in the first inning and was caught stealing, then reached on another walk in the fourth but was erased on Jesse Winker's double-play grounder. Abrams walked leading off the seventh and was stranded at second base.\n\nCease has pitched 22 shutout innings over his last three starts, and earlier threw seven innings of one-hit, shutout ball against Washington on June 26.\n\n\"He kept our hitters off balance all game and never really gave us much to hit,\" Nationals manager Dave Martinez said.\n\nWashington was no-hit for the second straight season. Philadelphia's Michael Lorenzen achieved the feat last Aug. 9.\n\nSan Diego has won five in a row and earned its third series sweep of the season and first on the road. The Padres swept Oakland and Washington at home last month.\n\nWashington was swept for the sixth time this season and finished 0-6 against San Diego. It was the first time the Padres went undefeated against the Nationals/Montreal Expos franchise since both teams joined the National League in 1969.\n\nSan Diego loaded the bases in the first with a single and two walks against Patrick Corbin (2-10) before the delay after the first pitch to Ha-Seong Kim. When the game resumed, Kim worked a full count before poking a single to left-center that scored all three runners.\n\nUP NEXT\n\nPadres: Open a series Friday at Baltimore and RHP Grayson Rodriguez

He knows what this looks like. We let him ride.\"\n\nCease needed only nine pitches in the eighth and 11 in the ninth in a 3-0 victory over the Washington Nationals on Thursday that completed a three-game sweep.\n\nAfter falling one out short of a no-hitter two years ago when he gave up a single to current teammate Luis Arr\u00e1ez, Cease retired Ildemaro Vargas and Jacob Young on a groundouts for the first two outs of the ninth, then got CJ Abrams to hit a flyout to right on a 1-0 slider.\n\n\"My thought was I'm going to throw a slider and I'm going to get it down, and if it's down he's either hopefully going to beat it into the ground or he can't put in play,\" Cease said. \"I didn't like it off the bat. It looked very hitterish, but fortunately fate's on my side today.\"\n\nCease (10-8) struck out nine and walked three in the 28-year-old right-hander's third complete game in 145 big league starts. He threw a career-high 114 pitches in a game that included a 1-hour, 16-minute rain delay in the first.\n\n\"The first inning, he comes in and says 'I'm not quite there,'\" Shildt recalled. \"The second inning, 'Getting there.' Then the third inning, he just hit his stride.\"\n\nMusgrove pitched the Padres' first no-hitter against Texas on April 9, 2021. Houston's Ronel Blanco threw the only other no-hitter this season, against Toronto on April 1.\n\nCease was within one out of a no-hitter for the Chicago White Sox against Minnesota on Sept. 3, 2022, when Arr\u00e1ez lined a single to right-center on a 1-1 slider over the middle of the strike zone.\n\n\"I've been close and to finally get it done, it's one of those things that feels so remarkable and hard to believe,\" Cease said. \"To be able to do it and go out and experience it, I really don't even know how to feel. Just happy.\"\n\nHe worried about the pitch count causing an early end to his outing.\n\n\"Thankfully, we were able to talk it out,\" Cease said. \"I just said 'I feel really good right now. Next inning, if I'm kind of erratic or use up too many pitches, pull me then. But give me a shot, at least.' Thankfully, we worked it out.\"\n\nShildt said he wasn't going to allow Cease's pitch count to rise into the high 120s. He said there was no further conversation after Cease breezed through the eighth.\n\n\"I just love the conviction,\" Shildt said. \"I think it's important in my chair to be able to be open-minded and listen to your athletes.

He knows what this looks like. We let him ride.\"\n\nCease needed only nine pitches in the eighth and 11 in the ninth in a 3-0 victory over the Washington Nationals on Thursday that completed a three-game sweep.\n\nAfter falling one out short of a no-hitter two years ago when he gave up a single to current teammate Luis Arr\u00e1ez, Cease retired Ildemaro Vargas and Jacob Young on a groundouts for the first two outs of the ninth, then got CJ Abrams to hit a flyout to right on a 1-0 slider.\n\n\"My thought was I'm going to throw a slider and I'm going to get it down, and if it's down he's either hopefully going to beat it into the ground or he can't put in play,\" Cease said. \"I didn't like it off the bat. It looked very hitterish, but fortunately fate's on my side today.\"\n\nCease (10-8) struck out nine and walked three in the 28-year-old right-hander's third complete game in 145 big league starts. He threw a career-high 114 pitches in a game that included a 1-hour, 16-minute rain delay in the first.\n\n\"The first inning, he comes in and says 'I'm not quite there,'\" Shildt recalled. \"The second inning, 'Getting there.' Then the third inning, he just hit his stride.\"\n\nMusgrove pitched the Padres' first no-hitter against Texas on April 9, 2021. Houston's Ronel Blanco threw the only other no-hitter this season, against Toronto on April 1.\n\nCease was within one out of a no-hitter for the Chicago White Sox against Minnesota on Sept. 3, 2022, when Arr\u00e1ez lined a single to right-center on a 1-1 slider over the middle of the strike zone.\n\n\"I've been close and to finally get it done, it's one of those things that feels so remarkable and hard to believe,\" Cease said. \"To be able to do it and go out and experience it, I really don't even know how to feel. Just happy.\"\n\nHe worried about the pitch count causing an early end to his outing.\n\n\"Thankfully, we were able to talk it out,\" Cease said. \"I just said 'I feel really good right now. Next inning, if I'm kind of erratic or use up too many pitches, pull me then. But give me a shot, at least.' Thankfully, we worked it out.\"\n\nShildt said he wasn't going to allow Cease's pitch count to rise into the high 120s. He said there was no further conversation after Cease breezed through the eighth.\n\n\"I just love the conviction,\" Shildt said. \"I think it's important in my chair to be able to be open-minded and listen to your athletes. He felt good. He felt convicted. He made a really strong case. I want him to go out, too, but looking at the big picture and the factor (of the rain delay) before, and once I cleared that with him, he was good.\"\n\nThe closest Washington came to a hit was when Juan Yepez lofted a fly to shallow center in the fifth inning. The ball popped out of second baseman Xander Bogaerts' glove, but center fielder Jackson Merrill was there to snare the ball before it hit the ground.\n\n\"I was just playing keepy-ups, making sure it didn't hit the ground,\" Merrill said. \"As soon as he calls me off, I'm there and I'm ready for anything that happened --- if it bounces off him, goes the other way, I'm ready for anything.\"\n\nBogaerts also bobbled a ball after making a diving stop of Keibert Ruiz's grounder with one out in the eighth but recovered in time to throw out the slow-footed catcher at first.\n\n\"It feels like every no-hitter, there's a couple plays like that are just remarkable,\" Cease said.\n\nCease threw 60 sliders against the Nationals along with 39 fastballs averaging 98.3 mph -- 1.4 mph above his season average -- and 10 knuckle-curves. Cease induced 12 groundouts. The Nationals swung and missed 18 times, including six on strikeouts.\n\nHis previous complete games also were shutouts: a seven-inning three-hitter against Detroit on April 29, 2021, and the win over the Twins.\n\nCease allowed only three baserunners. Lane Thomas walked with one out in the first inning and was caught stealing, then reached on another walk in the fourth but was erased on Jesse Winker's double-play grounder. Abrams walked leading off the seventh and was stranded at second base.\n\nCease has pitched 22 shutout innings over his last three starts, and earlier threw seven innings of one-hit, shutout ball against Washington on June 26.\n\n\"He kept our hitters off balance all game and never really gave us much to hit,\" Nationals manager Dave Martinez said.\n\nWashington was no-hit for the second straight season. Philadelphia's Michael Lorenzen achieved the feat last Aug. 9.\n\nSan Diego has won five in a row and earned its third series sweep of the season and first on the road. The Padres swept Oakland and Washington at home last month.\n\nWashington was swept for the sixth time this season and finished 0-6 against San Diego. It was the first time the Padres went undefeated against the Nationals/Montreal Expos franchise since both teams joined the National League in 1969.\n\nSan Diego loaded the bases in the first with a single and two walks against Patrick Corbin (2-10) before the delay after the first pitch to Ha-Seong Kim. When the game resumed, Kim worked a full count before poking a single to left-center that scored all three runners.\n\nUP NEXT\n\nPadres: Open a series Friday at Baltimore and RHP Grayson Rodriguez (12-4, 3.83).\n\nNationals: LHP MacKenzie Gore (6-8, 4.20 ERA), whose two-inning outing Saturday against Cincinnati was his shortest start of the season, starts in the opener of a three-game series at St. Louis.\n\n___\n\nAP MLB: https://apnews.com/hub/mlb\n\nPatrick Stevens, The Associated Press", "source": {"uri": "princegeorgecitizen.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Prince George Citizen"},

He knows what this looks like. We let him ride.\"\n\nCease needed only nine pitches in the eighth and 11 in the ninth in to complete a 3-0 victory over the Washington Nationals that capped a three-game series sweep.\n\nAfter falling one out short of a no-hitter two years ago, when he gave up a single to current teammate Luis Arr\u00e1ez, Cease retired Ildemaro Vargas and Jacob Young on a ground balls for the first two outs of the ninth, then got CJ Abrams to fly out to right field on a 1-0 slider.\n\n\"My thought was I'm going to throw a slider and I'm going to get it down, and if it's down he's either hopefully going to beat it into the ground or he can't put it in play,\" Cease said. \"I didn't like it off the bat. It looked very hitterish, but fortunately fate's on my side today.\"\n\nCease (10-8) struck out nine and walked three in the 28-year-old right-hander's third complete game in 145 big-league starts. He threw a career-high 114 pitches in a game that included a one-hour, 16-minute rain delay in the first inning.\n\n\"The first inning, he comes in and says, 'I'm not quite there,'\" Shildt recalled. \"The second inning, 'Getting there.' Then the third inning, he just hit his stride.\"\n\nMusgrove pitched the Padres' first no-hitter, against Texas, on April 9, 2021. Houston's Ronel Blanco threw the major leagues' only other no-hitter this season, against Toronto on April 1.\n\nCease was within one out of a no-hitter for the Chicago White Sox against Minnesota on Sept. 3, 2022, when Arr\u00e1ez lined a single to right-center on a 1-1 slider over the middle of the strike zone.\n\n\"I've been close, and to finally get it done, it's one of those things that feels so remarkable and hard to believe,\" Cease said. \"To be able to do it and go out and experience it, I really don't even know how to feel. Just happy.\"\n\nHe worried about the pitch count causing an early end to his outing.\n\n\"Thankfully, we were able to talk it out,\" Cease said. \"I just said 'I feel really good right now. Next inning, if I'm kind of erratic or use up too many pitches, pull me then. But give me a shot, at least.' Thankfully, we worked it out.\"\n\nShildt said he wasn't going to allow Cease's pitch count to rise into the high 120s. He said there was no further conversation after Cease breezed through the eighth.\n\n\"I just love the conviction,\" Shildt said. \"I think it's important in my chair to be able to be open-minded and listen to your athletes. He felt good. He felt convicted. He made a really strong case. I want him to go out, too, but looking at the big picture and the factor [of the rain delay] before, and once I cleared that with him, he was good.\"\n\nThe closest Washington came to a hit was when Juan Yepez lofted a fly to shallow center in the fifth inning. The ball popped out of second baseman Xander Bogaerts' glove, but center fielder Jackson Merrill was there to snare the ball before it hit the ground.\n\n\"I was just playing keepy-ups, making sure it didn't hit the ground,\" Merrill said. \"As soon as he calls me off, I'm there and I'm ready for anything that happened -- if it bounces off him, goes the other way, I'm ready for anything.\"\n\nBogaerts also bobbled a ball after making a diving stop of Keibert Ruiz's grounder with one out in the eighth, but recovered in time to throw out the slow-footed catcher at first.\n\n\"It feels like every no-hitter, there's a couple plays that are just remarkable,\" Cease said.\n\nCease threw 60 sliders, along with 39 fastballs averaging 98.3 mph -- 1.4 mph above his season average -- and 10 knuckle-curves. Cease induced 12 groundouts. The Nationals swung and missed 18 times, including six on strikeouts.\n\nHis previous complete games also were shutouts: a seven-inning three-hitter against Detroit on April 29, 2021, and the win over the Twins.\n\nCease allowed only three baserunners. Lane Thomas walked with one out in the first inning and was caught stealing, then reached on another walk in the fourth but was erased on Jesse Winker's double-play grounder. Abrams walked leading off the seventh and was stranded at second base.\n\nCease has pitched 22 shutout innings over his past three starts, and earlier threw seven innings of one-hit, shutout ball against Washington on June 26.\n\n\"He kept our hitters off balance all game and never really gave us much to hit,\" Nationals Manager Dave Martinez said.\n\nWashington was no-hit for the second straight season. Philadelphia's Michael Lorenzen achieved the feat Aug. 9 of last year.\n\nSan Diego has won five consecutive games and earned its third series sweep of the season, and first on the road. The Padres swept Oakland and Washington at home last month.\n\nThe Nationals were swept for the sixth time this season and finished 0-6 against San Diego. It was the first time the Padres went undefeated against the Nationals/Montreal Expos franchise since both joined the National League as expansion teams in 1969.\n\nNationals: Left-hander MacKenzie Gore (6-8, 4.20), whose two-inning outing Saturday against Cincinnati was his shortest start of the season, is set to start Friday's opener of a three-game series at St. Louis.", "source": {"uri":

It looked very hitterish, but fortunately fate's on my side today.\"\n\nCease (10-8) struck out nine and walked three in the 28-year-old right-hander's third complete game in 145 big league starts. He threw a career-high 114 pitches in a game that included a 1-hour, 16-minute rain delay in the first.\n\n\"The first inning, he comes in and says 'I'm not quite there,'\" Shildt recalled. \"The second inning, 'Getting there.' Then the third inning, he just hit his stride.\"\n\nMusgrove pitched the Padres' first no-hitter against Texas on April 9, 2021. Houston's Ronel Blanco threw the only other no-hitter this season, against Toronto on April 1.\n\nCease was within one out of a no-hitter for the Chicago White Sox against Minnesota on Sept. 3, 2022, when Arr\u00e1ez lined a single to right-center on a 1-1 slider over the middle of the strike zone.\n\n\"I've been close and to finally get it done, it's one of those things that feels so remarkable and hard to believe,\" Cease said. \"To be able to do it and go out and experience it, I really don't even know how to feel. Just happy.\"\n\nHe worried about the pitch count causing an early end to his outing.\n\n\"Thankfully, we were able to talk it out,\" Cease said. \"I just said 'I feel really good right now. Next inning, if I'm kind of erratic or use up too many pitches, pull me then. But give me a shot, at least.' Thankfully, we worked it out.\"\n\nShildt said he wasn't going to allow Cease's pitch count to rise into the high 120s. He said there was no further conversation after Cease breezed through the eighth.\n\n\"I just love the conviction,\" Shildt said. \"I think it's important in my chair to be able to be open-minded and listen to your athletes. He felt good. He felt convicted. He made a really strong case. I want him to go out, too, but looking at the big picture and the factor (of the rain delay) before, and once I cleared that with him, he was good.\"\n\nThe closest Washington came to a hit was when Juan Yepez lofted a fly to shallow center in the fifth inning. The ball popped out of second baseman Xander Bogaerts' glove, but center fielder Jackson Merrill was there to snare the ball before it hit the ground.\n\n\"I was just playing keepy-ups, making sure it didn't hit the ground,\" Merrill said. \"As soon as he calls me off, I'm there and I'm ready for anything that happened -- if it bounces off him, goes the other way, I'm ready for anything.\"\n\nBogaerts also bobbled a ball after making a diving stop of Keibert Ruiz's grounder with one out in the eighth but recovered in time to throw out the slow-footed catcher at first.\n\n\"It feels like every no-hitter, there's a couple plays like that are just remarkable,\" Cease said.\n\nCease threw 60 sliders against the Nationals along with 39 fastballs averaging 98.3 mph -- 1.4 mph above his season average -- and 10 knuckle-curves. Cease induced 12 groundouts. The Nationals swung and missed 18 times, including six on strikeouts.\n\nHis previous complete games also were shutouts: a seven-inning three-hitter against Detroit on April 29, 2021, and the win over the Twins.\n\nCease allowed only three baserunners. Lane Thomas walked with one out in the first inning and was caught stealing, then reached on another walk in the fourth but was erased on Jesse Winker's double-play grounder. Abrams walked leading off the seventh and was stranded at second base.\n\nCease has pitched 22 shutout innings over his last three starts, and earlier threw seven innings of one-hit, shutout ball against Washington on June 26.\n\n\"He kept our hitters off balance all game and never really gave us much to hit,\" Nationals manager Dave Martinez said.\n\nWashington was no-hit for the second straight season. Philadelphia's Michael Lorenzen achieved the feat last Aug. 9.\n\nSan Diego has won five in a row and earned its third series sweep of the season and first on the road. The Padres swept Oakland and Washington at home last month.\n\nWashington was swept for the sixth time this season and finished 0-6 against San Diego. It was the first time the Padres went undefeated against the Nationals/Montreal Expos franchise since both teams joined the National League in 1969.\n\nSan Diego loaded the bases in the first with a single and two walks against Patrick Corbin (2-10) before the delay after the first pitch to Ha-Seong Kim. When the game resumed, Kim worked a full count before poking a single to left-center that scored all three runners.\n\nUP NEXT\n\nPadres: Open a series Friday at Baltimore and RHP Grayson Rodriguez

He threw a career-high 114 pitches in a game that included a 1-hour, 16-minute rain delay in the first inning.\n\nJoe Musgrove pitched the Padres' first no-hitter against Texas on April 9, 2021. Houston's Ronel Blanco threw the only other no-hitter this season, against Toronto on April 1.\n\nCease was within one out of a no-hitter for the Chicago White Sox against Minnesota on Sept. 3, 2022, when Arr\u00e1ez lined a single to right-center on a 1-1 slider over the middle of the strike zone.\n\nThe closest Washington came to a hit was when Juan Yepez lofted a fly to shallow center in the fifth inning. The ball popped out of second baseman Xander Bogaerts' glove, but center fielder Jackson Merrill was there to snare the ball before it hit the ground.\n\nBogaerts also bobbled a ball after making a diving stop of Keibert Ruiz's grounder with one out in the eighth but recovered in time to throw out the slow-footed catcher at first.\n\nSign Up for Newsletters Email* Select Newsletters to Sign Up For News Updates Breaking News Sports Digest Obituaries and Death Notices Submit\n\nCease threw 60 sliders against the Nationals along with 39 fastballs averaging 98.3 mph -- 1.4 mph above his season average -- and 10 knuckle-curves.\n\nHis previous complete games also were shutouts: a seven-inning three-hitter against Detroit on April 29, 2021, and the win over the Twins.\n\nCease allowed only three baserunners. Lane Thomas walked with one out in the first inning and was caught stealing, then reached on another walk in the fourth but was erased on Jesse Winker's double-play grounder. Abrams walked leading off the seventh and was stranded at second base.\n\nWashington was no-hit for the second straight season. Philadelphia's Michael Lorenzen achieved the feat last Aug. 9.\n\nSan Diego has won five in a row and earned its third series sweep of the season and first on the road. The Padres swept Oakland and Washington at home last month.\n\nWashington was swept for the sixth time this season and finished 0-6 against San Diego. It was the first time the Padres went undefeated against the Nationals/Montreal Expos franchise since both teams joined the National League in 1969.\n\nSan Diego loaded the bases in the first with a single and two walks against Patrick Corbin (2-10) before the delay while Ha-Seong Kim was batting, When the game resumed, Kim worked a full count before poking a single to left-center that scored all three runners.", "source": {"uri": "news-journal.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Longview News-Journal"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/No-hitter", "type":

Cease threw the second no-hitter in Padres history Thursday afternoon against the Washington Nationals at Nationals Park (SD 3, WAS 0). He struck out nine and threw a career-high 114 pitches in the masterpiece. It is Cease's first career no-hitter and his second career nine-inning complete game.\n\nThe final out of Cease's no-hitter was a line drive to right field by former Padre CJ Abrams. Abrams was traded to the Nationals in the big Juan Soto deal at the 2022 trade deadline.\n\nCease walked three batters in the no-hitter but faced only one over the minimum. One walk was erased on a double play, another on a caught stealing. Cease certainly had plenty left in the tank -- he hit 100 mph with his 110th pitch -- and at no point in the game did he have a high-stress inning. The Nationals never put much pressure on him.\n\nFollowing the game, Padres manager Mike Shildt said he originally planned to remove Cease after the seventh inning, but the pitcher was able to talk him out of it. Cease had thrown 94 pitches up to that point. Padres closer Robert Suarez was warming up in the ninth just in case Cease gave up a hit and ran into some trouble. Obviously Suarez wasn't needed.\n\nThis marks the second no-hitter so far this season: Houston Astros righty Ronel Blanco blanked the Toronto Blue Jays on April 1. Cease and the Padres are the third team to take a no-hitter into the ninth inning in 2024. Blanco did it, of course, and Atlanta Braves had a combined no-hitter going against the New York Mets on May 11. J.D. Martinez broke that up with a two-out home run.\n\nCease's no-hitter is the second in Padres franchise history. San Diego native Joe Musgrove no-hit the Texas Rangers at Globe Life Field on April 9, 2021. The Padres joined the league as an expansion team in 1969.\n\nHere now is what you need to know about Cease, the Padres, and the no-hitter.\n\nOf course it did. Doesn't every no-hitter seem to have that one great defensive play? That was certainly true Thursday, when center fielder Jackson Merrill bailed out second baseman Xander Bogaerts following a bobble. Check it out:\n\nBased on exit velocity and launch angle, Statcast says just one ball the Nationals put in play against Cease had even a 40% chance to go for a hit: Abram's lineout to end the game at 56%. The Juan Yepez pop up above had a mere 26% chance to go for a hit. It was a great recovery by Merrill more than a truly great defensive play, I'd say. Either way, it's an out.\n\nThis was not the first time Cease took a no-hitter into the ninth inning. On Sept. 3, 2022, Cease was out away from a no-hitter against the Minnesota Twins when (who else?) Luis Arraez lined a single to right field. Arraez is now Cease's teammate with the Padres, though he was not in the lineup Thursday, leaving him a spectator for the no-hitter.\n\nAs noted, Cease's no-hitter is the second in Padres franchise history. That leaves three teams with just a single no-hitter:\n\nThe Padres went the first half-century of their existence without a no-hitter. Now they have two in the last four years.\n\nThe Padres landed Cease in a spring-training trade with the Chicago White Sox and he has been one of the single best additions made by any team heading into the 2024 season. The no-hitter gives him a 3.50 ERA through 22 starts and 131 innings, and check out his last three starts. Cease has been out of this world lately:\n\nAccording to MLB.com, Cease is the first pitcher to go at least six innings with no more than one hit allowed in three consecutive starts since 1901. Thursday was his sixth start of at least six innings with no more than one hit allowed this season. That is two more than any other pitcher in any season since 1901. Cease has been tremendous the last few weeks.\n\nThursday's win was San Diego's fifth straight and their 18th in their last 28 games. The Padres are now 55-50 and a half-game up on the St. Louis Cardinals for the third wild-card spot. Thanks in large part to Cease, the Padres have gotten their season on track, and they are beginning to make a move up the standings.", "source": {"uri": "cbssports.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "CBS Sports"}, "authors": [{"uri": "mike_axisa@cbssports.com", "name": "Mike Axisa", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inning", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Inning"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/No-hitter", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "No-hitter"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Washington_Nationals", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Washington Nationals"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/San_Diego_Padres", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "San Diego Padres"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mike_Shildt", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Mike Shildt"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dylan_Cease", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Dylan Cease"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pitch_(baseball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Pitch (baseball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caught_stealing", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Caught stealing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Juan_Soto", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Juan Soto"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nationals_Park", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Nationals Park"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Right_fielder", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Right fielder"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Double_play", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Double play"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manager_(baseball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Manager (baseball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Batted_ball", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Batted ball"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strikeout", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Strikeout"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complete_game", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Complete game"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exit_velocity", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Exit velocity"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Globe_Life_Field", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Globe Life Field"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Musgrove", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Joe Musgrove"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statcast", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Statcast"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xander_Bogaerts", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Xander Bogaerts"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Expansion_team", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Expansion team"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Second_baseman", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Second baseman"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_Mets", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "New York Mets"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/J._D._Martinez", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "J.

He threw a career-high 114 pitches.\n\nThe 28-year-old right-hander allowed only three baserunners. Lane Thomas walked with one out in the first inning and was caught stealing, then reached on another walk in the fourth but was erased on Jesse Winker's double-play grounder. CJ Abrams walked leading off the seventh and was stranded at second base.\n\nThe closest Washington came to a hit was when Juan Yepez lofted a fly to shallow center leading off the fifth inning. The ball popped out of second baseman Xander Bogaerts' glove and center fielder Jackson Merrill was there to snare it before it hit the ground.\n\nBogaerts also bobbled a ball while making a diving stop of Keibert Ruiz's grounder with one out in the eighth inning but recovered in time to throw out the catcher at first.\n\nCease entered with two complete games in 144 big league starts, both shutouts: a seven-inning three-hitter against Detroit on April 29, 2021, and a nine-inning one-hitter vs. Minnesota on Sept. 3, 2022, when Luis Arr\u00e1ez lined a single to right-center with two outs in the ninth inning.\n\nHis season high before Thursday was 113 pitches over seven scoreless innings at the Chicago White Sox on May 8, which matched his career high.\n\nSan Diego earned its 3-0 lead early on as Ha-Seong Kim hit a three-run single in the first inning.\n\nThe first no-hitter this season was thrown by Houston's Ronel Blanco against Toronto on April 1.\n\nJoe Musgrove was the first

Thursday, Dylan Cease was simply unhittable.\n\nThe Padres ace pitched just the second no-hitter in franchise history, dominating the Washington Nationals in a 3-0 victory at Nationals Park. Cease, acquired in March to galvanize the Padres rotation, pitched like the ace San Diego sought: He struck out nine and needed just one defensive gem to stave off the Nationals.\n\nCease, 28, walked three and induced one double play. He leads the major leagues with 168 strikeouts in 131 innings, and perhaps we should have seen this no-hitter coming. Thursday's gem was the fourth time in six starts Cease gave up one or fewer hits, a stretch in which he's lowered his ERA from 4.14 to 3.50.\n\nThe Padres were the last team in Major League Baseball without a no-hitter until Cease's teammate, Joe Musgrove, no-hit the Texas Rangers on April 10, 2021. Cease needed just a little intervention - from nature and his center fielder - to pitch the second.\n\nThe game was delayed 76 minutes during the top of the first inning due to a passing storm. Cease had completed his pregame warmup but had not thrown a pitch; the Padres were fortunate he hadn't yet taken the mound and that the rain passed relatively quickly.\n\nThen, in the top of the fifth, Juan Yepez led off with a bloop fly ball that second baseman Xander Bogaerts pursued with a poor route, getting turned around. He lunged to catch the ball but it popped out of his glove.\n\nMercifully, rookie center fielder Jackson Merrill was right there to snatch the ball out of midair, keeping the no-hitter intact.\n\nWith Cease at 94 pitches through seven innings, manager Mike Shildt shook Cease's hand and had a conversation before he went out for the eighth.\n\n\"He said, 'Nice job,'\" Cease told the Padres' TV broadcast, \"and I looked up and it was like 94 pitches and I just said, 'I feel great, and if we get through the next one in like 105...' I've thrown 113 this year so thankfully, they let me talk them into it.\n\n\"And here we are.\"\n\nCease threw just eight pitches in the eighth before working a perfect ninth, finishing with a career-high 114 pitches as he induced CJ Abrams to fly to right fielder Bryce Johnson for the final out.\n\nThe Padres' victory was their fifth in a row after losing the second-half opener at Cleveland, and they've moved into the lead, by percentage points over St. Louis, for the NL's third wild card spot.\n\nCease says he has matured as a pitcher under the tutelage of San Diego pitching coach Ruben Nieblas and in his fifth full season and first in the NL might be turning into the best version of himself.\n\n\"Anytime you gain another half-year of experience, that's valuable,\" he told USA TODAY Sports on Wednesday. \"Ruben has taught me some different pitches, shown me different pitch grips. Consistently pitching against new teams, in new environments. Anytime you're forced to do new things, it's going to ultimately end up making you grow.\"\n\nThat growth continued Thursday.\n\nThis article originally appeared on USA TODAY: Padres' Dylan Cease

I saw it stay up. Just screaming and yelling. That was awesome.\"\n\nCease (10-8) struck out nine and walked three, throwing a career-high 114 pitches for his third complete game in 145 starts. Cease's pitch count was 94 after the seventh inning, but he lobbied manager Mike Shildt to keep him in the game.\n\n\"He said nice job. And I looked up and it was like 94 pitches. I just said 'I feel great.' And if we get through the next one in like 105. I've thrown 113 this year,\" Cease recalled. \"Thankfully, they let me talk him into it. And then, here we are.\"\n\nJoe Musgrove pitched the Padres' first no-hitter on April 9, 2021 against Texas. Houston's Ronel Blanco threw the only other no-hitter in Major League Baseball this season, against Toronto on April 1.\n\nCease nearly had a no-hitter on Sept. 3, 2022, while pitching for the White Sox. But his bid was spoiled by Arr\u00e1ez, whose two-out single in the ninth inning helped the Twins avoid being no-hit that day.\n\nCease's no-hitter came nine years to the day after Philadelphia Phillies left-hander Cole Hamels, a San Diego native, no-hit the Chicago Cubs.\n\n\"I think it'll set in even more as time goes,\" Cease said. \"But I've been close, and to finally get it done, it's one of those things that's just -- it feels so remarkable and hard to believe. To be able to do it and go out and experience it, I really don't even know how to feel, I'm just happy.\"\n\nThe no-hitter shortened the betting odds for Cease to win the NL Cy Young Award at ESPN BET, where he moved from 100-1 to 40-1. Cease is tied with Logan Webb for fifth-shortest odds for the award at ESPN BET, behind Atlanta's Chris Sale (+135), Philadelphia's Zack Wheeler (+185) and Pittsburgh rookie Paul Skenes (+275).\n\nCease allowed only three baserunners Thursday: Lane Thomas walked with one out in the first inning and was caught stealing, then reached on another walk in the fourth but was erased on Jesse Winker's double-play grounder. Abrams walked leading off the seventh and was stranded at second base.\n\nThe closest Washington came to a hit was when Juan Yepez lofted a fly to shallow center in the fifth inning. The ball popped out of second baseman Xander Bogaerts' glove, but center fielder Jackson Merrill was there to snare the ball before it hit the ground.\n\nBogaerts also bobbled a ball after making a diving stop of Keibert Ruiz's grounder with one out in the eighth but recovered in time to throw out the slow-footed catcher at first.\n\nCease threw 60 sliders against the Nationals along with 44 fastballs averaging 98.3 mph -- 1.4 mph above his season average -- and 10 knuckle-curves.", "source": {"uri": "africa.espn.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "ESPN.com"}, "authors": [], "concepts":

He threw 114 pitches.\n\nCease joins Houston Astros right-handed pitcher Ronel Blanco as the two hurlers with no-hitters this season. Blanco's came in his eighth career start at the MLB level.\n\nFor Cease, it's his first career no-hitter in his 145th career start at the MLB level. He came very close to throwing one in 2022 when he was with the Chicago White Sox. However, a ninth inning single by Luis Arraez (now his teammate on the Padres) ended the bid.\n\nThis time, nothing came in the way of Cease's historic start.\n\nCease, 28, was acquired by the Padres just before they left for Korea for their opening series against the Los Angeles Dodgers in Seoul. Cease was expected to work as the team's No. 3 starter behind right-handed pitchers Yu Darvish and Joe Musgrove, but quickly turned into the ace of the Padres this season.\n\nCease entered Thursday's start with a record of 9-8 and a 3.76 ERA across 122 innings pitched. Now, he's lowered his ERA to 3.50 on the season.\n\nCease's no-hitter comes amid a dominant stretch for the right-handed pitcher. On July 13, Cease threw six innings of shutout, one-hit baseball against the Atlanta Braves. Then, on July 20, Cease threw seven innings of shutout, one-hit baseball against the Cleveland Guardians.\n\nNow, Cease has reached the pinnacle of dominance, completing a no-hitter against the Nationals.\n\nCease said after the game that he started thinking about the no-hitter after the sixth inning. After the seventh inning, he lobbied with his manager, Mike Shildt, to keep him in the game. Clearly, he won that battle.\n\nThursday's Padres vs. Nationals game got off to an immediate rocky start. After the Padres loaded the bases in the top of the first inning with two outs, rain started pouring down at Nationals Park, causing a delay just nine minutes after first pitch.\n\nThe delay lasted over an hour, but finally, when the tarp came off, it was Ha-Seong Kim who got the lone big hit of the game, a bases clearing, two-out double that gave the Padres a 3-0 lead. That ended up being the only run support Cease needed.\n\nCease has now joined Musgrove as the only pitchers with no-hitters in Padres' franchise history.

After loading the bases at the top of the first inning with two outs, play was stopped due to rain. The rain would last for over an hour.

He threw a career-high 114 pitches in a game that included a 1-hour, 16-minute rain delay in the first inning.\n\nJoe Musgrove pitched the Padres' first no-hitter against Texas on April 9, 2021.

I saw it stay up. Just screaming and yelling. That was awesome.\"\n\nCease's pitch count was 94 after the seventh inning. He lobbied manager Mike Shildt to keep him in the game.\n\n\"He said nice job. And I looked up and it was like 94 pitches. I just said 'I feel great.' And if we get through the next one in like 105. I've have thrown 113 this year,\" Cease recalled. \"Thankfully, they let me talk him into it. And then, he we are.\"\n\nThe closest Washington came to a hit was when Juan Yepez lofted a fly to shallow center in the fifth inning. The ball popped out of second baseman Xander Bogaerts' glove, but center fielder Jackson Merrill was there to snare the ball before it hit the ground.\n\nBogaerts also bobbled a ball after making a diving stop of Keibert Ruiz's grounder with one out in the eighth but recovered in time to throw out the slow-footed catcher at first.\n\nCease threw 60 sliders against the Nationals along with 39 fastballs averaging 98.3 mph -- 1.4 mph above his season average -- and 10 knuckle-curves.\n\nHis previous complete games also were shutouts: a seven-inning three-hitter against Detroit on April 29, 2021, and the win over the Twins.\n\nCease allowed only three baserunners. Lane Thomas walked with one out in the first inning and was caught stealing, then reached on another walk in the fourth but was erased on Jesse Winker's double-play grounder. Abrams walked leading off the seventh and was stranded at second base.\n\nWashington was no-hit for the second straight season. Philadelphia's Michael Lorenzen achieved the feat last Aug. 9.\n\nSan Diego has won five in a row and earned its third series sweep of the season and first on the road. The Padres swept Oakland and Washington at home last month.\n\nWashington was swept for the sixth time this season and finished 0-6 against San Diego. It was the first time the Padres went undefeated against the Nationals/Montreal Expos franchise since both teams joined the National League in 1969.\n\nSan Diego loaded the bases in the first with a single and two walks against Patrick Corbin (2-10) before the delay while Ha-Seong Kim was batting, When the game resumed, Kim worked a full count before poking a single to left-center that scored all three runners.\n\nUP NEXT\n\nPadres: Open a series Friday at Baltimore.\n\nNationals: LHP MacKenzie Gore (6-8, 4.20 ERA), whose two-inning outing Saturday against Cincinnati was his shortest start of the season, starts in a three-game series at St. Louis.\n\nAP MLB: https://apnews.com/hub/mlb\n\nCopyright 2024 The Associated Press.

He then induced Jacob Young to ground out and former Padre CJ Abrams to line out to right field.\n\nCease (10-8) became the second pitcher in Padres franchise history to toss a no-hitter. San Diego native Joe Musgrove accomplished the feat against the Texas Rangers on April 9, 2021.\n\nHouston Astros right-hander Ronel Blanco tossed a no-hitter against the Toronto Blue Jays on April 1 this season.\n\nCease lobbied to stay in the game following a brief conversation with manager Mike Shildt after the seventh inning.\n\n\"He said, 'Nice job,' and I looked up (and the scoreboard) said 94 pitches,\" Cease told MLB Network. \"I said I feel great, and if we get through the next (inning) in like 105. I've thrown 113 pitches this year. Thankfully they let me talk him into it, and here we are.\"\n\nSchildt said Musgrove helped lobby for Cease sticking around another inning -- at least -- calling his stuff \"pretty good.\"\n\nAfter a brief pause, Schildt said he thought, \"Well, he's thrown one. He knows.\"\n\nCease nearly had a no-hitter on Sept. 3, 2022 while pitching for the Chicago White Sox. Luis Arraez ended that bid for the Minnesota Twins with a two-out single in the ninth inning.\n\nThursday's game was delayed 76 minutes by rain during the top of the first inning.\n\nLeading off the bottom of the fifth inning, Juan Yepez hit a blooper to short center that bounced out of the glove of second baseman Xander Bogaerts but was caught in the air by center fielder Jackson Merrill.\n\n\"I feel like in every no-hitter there are a couple of plays that kind of save it,\" Cease said. \"I think there were a couple right there. Made it happen.\"\n\nHa-Seong Kim drove in three in the first inning for San Diego, which has won five straight overall and all six meetings this season with Washington.\n\nThe Nationals scored three runs in the series, all of them coming in the first inning of a 12-3 setback on Wednesday.\n\nWashington's Patrick Corbin (2-10) took the loss after yielding three runs on four hits over seven innings. He struck out seven and walked three.\n\nThe Padres seized a 3-0 lead during a rain-interrupted first inning. With one out, Donovan Solano singled and Bogaerts walked. After Manny Machado lined out, Jake Cronenworth walked to load the bases. With a 1-0 count to Kim, the game was delayed by rain and Corbin appeared to have words with an umpire as he left the field.\n\nWhen play resumed, Kim sent a blooper to left-center field. The ball deflected off the glove of a diving James Wood, and all three runners came home on the base hit.\n\nLane Thomas walked with one out in the Washington first but was caught stealing.

Cease, acquired in March to galvanize the Padres rotation, pitched like the ace San Diego sought: He struck out nine and needed just one defensive gem to stave off the Nationals.\n\nCease, 28, walked three and induced one double play. He leads the major leagues with 168 strikeouts in 131 innings, and perhaps we should have seen this no-hitter coming. Thursday's gem was the fourth time in six starts Cease gave up one or fewer hits, a stretch in which he's lowered his ERA from 4.14 to 3.50.\n\nThe Padres were the last team in Major League Baseball without a no-hitter until Cease's teammate, Joe Musgrove, no-hit the Texas Rangers on April 10, 2021. Cease needed just a little intervention - from nature and his center fielder - to pitch the second.\n\nThe game was delayed 76 minutes during the top of the first inning due to a passing storm. Cease had completed his pregame warmup but had not thrown a pitch; the Padres were fortunate he hadn't yet taken the mound and that the rain passed relatively quickly.\n\nThen, in the top of the fifth, Juan Yepez led off with a bloop fly ball that second baseman Xander Bogaerts pursued with a poor route, getting turned around. He lunged to catch the ball but it popped out of his glove.\n\nMercifully, rookie center fielder Jackson Merrill was right there to snatch the ball out of midair, keeping the no-hitter intact.\n\nWith Cease at 94 pitches through seven innings, manager Mike Shildt shook Cease's hand and had a conversation before he went out for the eighth.\n\n\"He said, 'Nice job,'\" Cease told the Padres' TV broadcast, \"and I looked up and it was like 94 pitches and I just said, 'I feel great, and if we get through the next one in like 105...' I've thrown 113 this year so thankfully, they let me talk them into it.\n\n\"And here we are.\"\n\nCease threw just eight pitches in the eighth before working a perfect ninth, finishing with a career-high 114 pitches as he induced CJ Abrams to fly to right fielder Bryce Johnson for the final out.\n\nThe Padres' victory was their fifth in a row after losing the second-half opener at Cleveland, and they've moved into the lead, by percentage points over St. Louis, for the NL's third wild card spot.\n\nCease says he has matured as a pitcher under the tutelage of San Diego pitching coach Ruben Nieblas and in his fifth full season and first in the NL might be turning into the best version of himself.\n\n\"Anytime you gain another half-year of experience, that's valuable,\" he told USA TODAY Sports on Wednesday. \"Ruben has taught me some different pitches, shown me different pitch grips. Consistently pitching against new teams, in new environments. Anytime you're forced to do new things, it's going to ultimately end up making you grow.\"", "source": {"uri": "usatoday.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "USA Today"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ace_(baseball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Ace (baseball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/No-hitter", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "No-hitter"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Washington_Nationals", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Washington Nationals"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/San_Diego_Padres", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "San Diego Padres"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inning", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Inning"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strikeout", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Strikeout"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Major_League_Baseball", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Major League Baseball"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dylan_Cease", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Dylan Cease"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pitch_(baseball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Pitch (baseball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nationals_Park", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Nationals Park"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Double_play", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Double play"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Center_fielder", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Center fielder"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earned_run_average", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Earned run average"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/San_Diego", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "San Diego"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "San Diego"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Juan_Yepez", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Juan Yepez"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Musgrove", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Joe Musgrove"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xander_Bogaerts", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Xander Bogaerts"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Second_baseman", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Second baseman"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rookie", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Rookie"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Texas_Rangers_(baseball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Texas Rangers (baseball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CJ_Abrams", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "CJ Abrams"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_League_(baseball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "National League (baseball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mike_Shildt", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Mike Shildt"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coach_(baseball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Coach (baseball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Right_fielder", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Right fielder"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pitcher", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Pitcher"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/St._Louis", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "St. Louis"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "St. Louis"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cleveland", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Cleveland"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Cleveland"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Baseball", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Baseball", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Softball/Slowpitch", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Softball/Slowpitch", "wgt": 16}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Softball/Modified_Pitch", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Softball/Modified Pitch", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Golf/Pitch_and_Putt", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Golf/Pitch and Putt", "wgt": 24}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Instruction", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Instruction", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://www.gannett-cdn.com/authoring/authoring-images/2024/07/25/USAT/74548725007-usatsi-23824924.jpg?auto=webp&crop=3030,1705,x24,y1045&format=pjpg&width=1200", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9764260", "eventUri": "eng-9764260", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "date": "2010-04-", "textStart": 777, "textEnd": 785}], "sentiment": 0.003921568627450966, "wgt": 200, "relevance": 1}

Thursday, Dylan Cease was simply unhittable.\n\nThe Padres ace pitched just the second no-hitter in franchise history, dominating the Washington Nationals in a 3-0 victory at Nationals Park. Cease, acquired in March to galvanize the Padres rotation, pitched like the ace San Diego sought: He struck out eight and needed just one defensive gem to stave off the Nationals.\n\nCease, 28, leads the major leagues with 167 strikeouts in 131 innings, and perhaps we should have seen this no-hitter coming. Thursday's gem was the fourth time in six starts Cease gave up one or fewer hits, a stretch in which he's lowered his ERA from 4.14 to 3.50.\n\nThe Padres were the last team in Major League Baseball without a no-hitter until Cease's teammate, Joe Musgrove, no-hit the Texas Rangers on April 10, 2021. Cease needed just a little intervention - from nature and his center fielder - to pitch the second.\n\nThe game was delayed more than an hour after the top of the first inning due to a passing storm. Cease had completed his warmup but had not thrown a pitch and was fortunate he hadn't taken the mound and that the rain passed relatively quickly.\n\nThen, in the top of the fifth, Juan Yepez led off with a bloop fly ball that second baseman Xander Bogaerts pursued with a poor route, getting turned around. He lunged to catch the ball but it popped out of his glove.\n\nMercifully, rookie center fielder Jackson Merrill was right there to snatch the ball out of midair, keeping the no-hitter intact.\n\nThe Padres' victory was their fifth in a row after losing the second-half opener at Cleveland, and they've moved into the lead, by percentage points over St. Louis, for the NL's third wild card spot.\n\nCease says he has matured as a pitcher under the tutelage of San Diego pitching coach Ruben Nieblas and in his fifth full season and first in the NL might be turning into the best version of himself.\n\n\"Anytime you gain another half-year of experience, that's valuable,\" he told USA TODAY Sports on Wednesday. \"Ruben has taught me some different pitches, shown me different pitch grips.

John McDonnell/Associated Press\n\nWASHINGTON -- Hoping for a chance to stay in the game and pitch the second no-hitter in San Diego Padres history, Dylan Cease received some help from the man who threw the first.\n\nCease was at 95 pitches through seven innings when Padres Manager Mike Schildt glanced at Joe Musgrove.\n\n\"Joe is like, 'His stuff is pretty good,'\" Shildt recalled. \"Well, he's thrown one. He knows what this looks like. We let him ride.\"\n\nCease needed only nine pitches in the eighth and 11 in the ninth in a 3-0 victory over the Washington Nationals on Thursday that completed a three-game sweep.\n\nCease, who fell one out short of a no-hitter two years ago when he gave up a single to current teammate Luis Arr\u00e1ez, retired Ildemaro Vargas and Jacob Young on groundouts for the first two outs of the ninth, then got CJ Abrams to hit a flyout to right on a 1-0 slider.\n\n\"My thought was I'm going to throw a slider and I'm going to get it down, and if it's down, he's either hopefully going to beat it into the ground or he can't put in play,\" Cease said. \"I didn't like it off the bat. It looked very hitterish, but fortunately fate's on my side today.\"\n\nAdvertisement\n\nCease (10-8) struck out nine and walked three in the 28-year-old right-hander's third complete game in 145 big league starts. He threw a career-high 114 pitches in a game that included a 1-hour, 16-minute rain delay in the first inning.\n\n\"The first inning, he comes in and says 'I'm not quite there,'\" Shildt recalled. \"The second inning, 'Getting there.' Then the third inning, he just hit his stride.\"\n\nJoe Musgrove pitched the Padres' first no-hitter, against Texas on April 9, 2021. Houston's Ronel Blanco threw the only other no-hitter this season, against Toronto on April 1.\n\nCease was within one out of a no-hitter for the Chicago White Sox against Minnesota on Sept. 3, 2022, when Arr\u00e1ez lined a single to right-center on a 1-1 slider over the middle of the strike zone.\n\n\"I've been close, and to finally get it done, it's one of those things that feels so remarkable and hard to believe,\" Cease said. \"To be able to do it and go out and experience it, I really don't even know how to feel. Just happy.\"\n\nThe closest Washington came to a hit was when Juan Yepez lofted a fly to shallow center in the fifth inning. The ball popped out of second baseman Xander Bogaerts' glove, but center fielder Jackson Merrill was there to snare the ball before it hit the ground.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBogaerts also bobbled a ball after making a diving stop of Keibert Ruiz's grounder with one out in the eighth but recovered in time to throw out the slow-footed catcher.\n\nRANGERS 2, WHITE SOX 1: Max Scherzer struck out a season-high nine to take over 10th place on the career list, Marcus Semien homered, and Texas won at home.\n\nPitching two days before his 40th birthday, Scherzer (2-3) pushed his career total to 3,400 strikeouts after first passing former teammate and fellow three-time Cy Young winner Justin Verlander with his third strikeout of the game. Scherzer leads among active pitchers.\n\nSemien's 15th homer led off the third against rookie right-hander Jonathan Cannon (1-5) to tie the game at 1-1. The Rangers went ahead an inning later when Nathaniel Lowe hit a leadoff double and scored on a fielder's choice grounder by Leody Taveras.\n\nTIGERS 3, GUARDIANS 0: Javier B\u00e1ez hit a three-run homer in the second inning and six pitchers combined on a four-hitter, sending Detroit to a victory at Cleveland.\n\nB\u00e1ez homered for the first time since April 14, belting a 409-footer into the left-field bleachers. It was his second home run in 217 at-bats this season and raised his average to .180.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nORIOLES 7, MARLINS 6: Ryan Mountcastle hit a go-ahead single in the 10th inning and Baltimore rebounded after wasting a six-run lead at Miami.\n\nAnthony Santander hit his 28th homer, and Colton Cowser and Connor Norby also went deep for Baltimore.\n\nNOTES\n\nRED SOX: First baseman Triston Casas is almost ready for a rehab assignment, chief baseball officer Craig Breslow said on a Boston morning radio show.\n\n\"He's made quite a bit of progress over the last week or so, where he's taking swings at full intensity and taking full batting practice. So, I think he could find himself in rehab games pretty quickly, as quickly as potentially even the end of this week, which is a great turnaround from where we were at the timeline we were talking about a few weeks ago,\" Breslow said.\n\n\"I think we've all talked, Alex (Cora) and I, about the sensitive nature of this rehab in that there are some feelings and tolerance that Triston needs to work through,\" he continued. \"But we've been really, really excited about the last week or so and hope to see him in rehab games here shortly.\"\n\nCasas appeared in 22 games for Boston before suffering his injury, batting .244 with 10 RBI and six home runs.\n\nCopy the Story Link\n\nSend questions/comments to the editors.\n\nRelated Stories Latest Articles", "source": {"uri":

Mandatory Credit: Geoff Burke-USA TODAY Sports\n\nDylan Cease provided some excitement for afternoon baseball goers on Thursday. The San Diego Padres pitcher hurled a no-hitter, which is always a fun time.\n\nCease put the Washington Nationals through it on Thursday afternoon in D.C.

The right-hander made history after becoming the second-ever San Diego Padres pitcher to achieve the feat. Interestingly enough, he was actually close to garnering a hitless outing back in 2022. However, a certain teammate of his was the reason why he had to wait nearly two more years before finally succeeding: Luis Arraez. (per USA Today's Bob Nightengale)\n\nThe date was September 3, 2022. Cease -- who suited up for the Chicago White Sox at that time -- had all the momentum for a no-hitter against the Minnesota Twins. He had gone through 8 2/3 innings without a hit...until Arraez stepped up to the plate that is. Despite the chants of \"Cease\" by the fans at Guaranteed Rate Field, Arraez wasn't fazed. The infielder smashed a single to right-center, ending Cease's night without a major record for the White Sox's history books.\n\nThe two somehow ended up on the San Diego roster prior to the 2024 season. And on Thursday, Arraez watched his teammate throw a flawless game during a 3-0 Padres victory against the Washington Nationals.\n\nCease was untouchable through nine innings, but there were close calls. In the fifth, a swing by Washington's Juan Yepez almost led to a fumble when Xander Bogaerts lost control of the baseball during a near catch. Luckily for Cease, Jackson Merrill was nearby to secure the ball.\n\nNevertheless, Dylan Cease was able to replicate what Joe Musgrove did years ago. Musgrove became the first Padres hurler to throw a no-hitter back in 2021. With Cease joining him, the franchise now has two historic games in a span of three years. The San Diego fans arguably deserve it, considering how they waited for around seven decades before the first one took place.\n\nAs for Cease, he's been on a string of big outings. Before Thursday's record-setting afternoon, Cease allowed just one hit in each of the Padres' last two games. The team is now on a five-game winning streak, holding a 55-50 record as the second-best team in the NL West.", "source": {"uri": "clutchpoints.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "ClutchPoints"}, "authors": [{"uri": "brian_buyawe@clutchpoints.com", "name": "Brian Buyawe", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dylan_Cease", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Dylan Cease"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/No-hitter", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "No-hitter"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/San_Diego_Padres", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "San Diego Padres"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chicago_White_Sox", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Chicago White Sox"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Innings_pitched", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Innings pitched"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baseball", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Baseball"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pitcher", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Pitcher"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guaranteed_Rate_Field", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Guaranteed Rate Field"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infielder", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Infielder"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minnesota_Twins", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Minnesota Twins"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/USA_Today", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "USA Today"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/San_Diego", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "San Diego"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "San Diego"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Juan_Yepez", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Juan Yepez"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Musgrove", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Joe Musgrove"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xander_Bogaerts", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Xander Bogaerts"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_League_West", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "National League West"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Washington_Nationals", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Washington Nationals"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Amateur", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Amateur", "wgt": 8}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Major_League", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Major League", "wgt": 9}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Game_Studies/Education", "label": "dmoz/Games/Game Studies/Education", "wgt": 8}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/History", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/History", "wgt": 9}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Sabermetrics", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Sabermetrics", "wgt": 8}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 81}], "image": "https://wp.clutchpoints.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/The-spooky-Dylan-Cease-Luis-Arraez-no-hitter-connection.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9764260", "eventUri": "eng-9764260", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1058823529411765, "wgt": 181, "relevance": 1}

Now he has a no-hitter.\n\nThe Padres ace no-hit the Washington Nationals in a 3-0 win in our nation's capital, the second no-hitter in Padres franchise history and the first since Joe Musgrove did it in Texas in 2021. It was the second no-hitter of the 2024 MLB season after Astros pitcher Ronel Blanco did it on April 1.\n\nCease struck out nine and walked three on the day. His 114th and final pitch was a fly ball to right field by former Padres prospect C.J. Abrams to end it, sparking a wild celebration in the middle of the diamond.\n\nAs with most historic starts, there were a few harrowing moments along the way. In the bottom of the fifth it looked like Juan Yepez had the Nats first knock. He hit a flare into shallow centerfield. Second baseman Xander Bogaerts got there and had the ball in his glove but couldn't hold it there. The pearl popped out and Bogaerts, for a moment, thought he'd cost his starter a chance at a no-no.\n\nThis is why you back up in a play. Jackson Merrill was right there to grab the airborne orb for an out, baseball's version of an alley-oop dunk.\n\nWhen a pitcher gets close to 100 pitches a manager can face a tough decision on whether or not to let him continue hunting history or pull him to fight again another day. Cease only needed nine pitches to get through the 8th inning so San Diego skipper Mike Shildt did not hesitate to give his guy a chance to finish the job. The 114 pitches are only one more than his previous season high.\n\nSan Diego got all the offense they needed in a very strange first inning. Ten minutes after throwing his first pitch of the day, Patrick Corbin was not a happy camper. The Nationals starter got off to a terrible start against the Padres, giving up a single and two walks to load the bases with two outs. Just as Ha-Seong Kim was about to step into the batters box rain started to fall. The officiating crew called for a delay.\n\nThat's not normal. Typically umpires will give an inning a chance to end before sending teams to their clubhouses. Corbin voiced his displeasure, barking at the blues all the way to the dugout steps.\n\nAfter a 76-minute delay Corbin was back on the hill to try and get out of the jam he'd been stewing over for an hour and a half. Kim did not help his mood very much. San Diego's shortstop lofted a full count blooper just in front of a diving James Wood in left field. With the runners moving on the 3-2 pitch all three of them scored to make it 3-0 Padres.\n\nCease took it from there, finishing a season sweep of the Nats and giving the Friars a five-game winning streak.", "source": {"uri": "nbcnewyork.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "NBC New York"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/No-hitter", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "No-hitter"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/San_Diego_Padres", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "San Diego Padres"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pitcher", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Pitcher"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ronel_Blanco", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Ronel Blanco"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Musgrove", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Joe Musgrove"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dylan_Cease", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Dylan Cease"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ace_(baseball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Ace (baseball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pitch_(baseball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Pitch (baseball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xander_Bogaerts", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Xander Bogaerts"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baseball_field", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Baseball field"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Right_fielder", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Right fielder"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Washington_Nationals", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Washington Nationals"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Batted_ball", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Batted ball"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Houston_Astros", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Houston Astros"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strikeout", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Strikeout"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Major_League_Baseball", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Major League Baseball"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Texas", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Texas"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Texas"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Juan_Yepez", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Juan Yepez"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inning", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Inning"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mike_Shildt", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Mike Shildt"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patrick_Corbin", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Patrick Corbin"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Second_baseman", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Second baseman"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manager_(baseball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Manager (baseball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Center_fielder", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Center fielder"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baseball", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Baseball"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/San_Diego", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "San Diego"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "San Diego"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dugout_(baseball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Dugout (baseball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Left_fielder", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Left fielder"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Baseball", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Baseball", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/History", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/History", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Sabermetrics", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Sabermetrics", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Instruction", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Instruction", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://media.nbcnewyork.com/2024/07/GettyImages-2163665216.jpg?quality=85&strip=all&crop=0px%2C51px%2C4037px%2C2271px&resize=1200%2C675", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9764260", "eventUri": "eng-9764260", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "date": "-04-01", "textStart": 417, "textEnd": 424}], "sentiment": 0.1294117647058823, "wgt": 178, "relevance": 1}

(RELATED: 'You J*cked Off In A F*cking Parking Lot': Cal Quantrill's Savage Trolling Towards Reese McGuire Nearly Sparks Brawl)\n\nBack in March, the Padres acquired Cease to upgrade their starting rotation, and that move paid off in flying colors against the Nats as he struck out eight and only one defensive gem (which was insane!) was needed to keep D.C. away as a threat.\n\nThe 28-year-old Cease has recorded 167 strikeouts this season, which leads all of Major League Baseball.

And with that, Dylan Cease had gone nine innings without allowing a hit going back to the start of the fourth inning on Saturday in Cleveland.\n\nThen he was through the sixth in 13 pitches and after walking CJ Abrams to start the seventh got through that with two groundouts and a fly ball to left field.\n\nCease was at 94 pitches, however, and likely needed a quick eighth to not make manager Mike Shildt nervous about keeping him in.\n\nHe walked off the mound after the eighth pumping slowly after throwing just nine pitches.\n\nA slow roller by Ildemargo Vargas to Bogaerts got the first out. One pitch later, Jacob Young grounded out to Kim. Then came Abrams line drive and a celebration.\n\nAll this came after rain forced the game to be stopped nine minutes after it started.\n\nIt was dry, and the clouds didn't seem all that threatening during the game's first three at-bats, which left the Padres with two runners on after Donovan Solano's single and Bogaerts' walk.\n\nThe rain, steady right from the start, began as clean-up hitter Manny Machado stepped to the plate. Many fans headed for cover, but a good number stayed put as Machado made the inning's second out on a soft line drive to second base.\n\nIt began to pour as Jake Cronenworth was seeing five pitches, wiping his bat on his pant legs a few times as he worked a walk, which loaded the bases.\n\nWater was dripping from Kim's helmet, which he shook as he walked from the on-deck area.\n\nKim was in the batter's box for one pitch before crew chief Adrian Johnson ran in from second base with his hands raised.\n\nThe deluge continued for about 20 minutes, turning the warning track into a brown puddle surrounding the grass. That took the longest to clear before the game could resume.\n\nKim was the first Padres player on the field, running along the edge of the infield as the final preparations were made on the field and the umpires reemerged in new outfits.\n\nOn the eighth pitch he saw after the storm, a 3-2 cutter at the bottom of the zone, Kim flared a soft line drive into left-center that bounced past diving James Wood as all three runners raced around the bases and scored.\n\nNationals starter Patrick was at 55 pitches after two innings. But he ended up getting through seven innings while throwing just 54 more pitches, which was second among the impressive feats done by a starting pitcher in Thursday's game.", "source": {"uri": "troyrecord.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Record"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inning", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Inning"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dylan_Cease", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Dylan Cease"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/No-hitter", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "No-hitter"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Batted_ball", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Batted ball"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/San_Diego_Padres", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "San Diego Padres"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dugout_(baseball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Dugout (baseball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Second_baseman", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Second baseman"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Washington_Nationals", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Washington Nationals"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CJ_Abrams", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "CJ Abrams"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luis_Campusano", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Luis Campusano"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ground_out_(baseball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Ground out (baseball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Musgrove", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Joe Musgrove"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xander_Bogaerts", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Xander Bogaerts"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Center_fielder", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Center fielder"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Out_(baseball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Out (baseball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fastball", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Fastball"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bullpen", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Bullpen"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minnesota_Twins", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Minnesota Twins"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catcher", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Catcher"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Outfielder", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Outfielder"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/San_Diego", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "San Diego"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "San Diego"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Keibert_Ruiz", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Keibert Ruiz"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lane_Thomas", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Lane Thomas"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mike_Shildt", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Mike Shildt"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pitch_(baseball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Pitch (baseball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manny_Machado", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Manny Machado"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cleveland", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Cleveland"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Cleveland"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jake_Cronenworth", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Jake Cronenworth"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donovan_Solano", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Donovan Solano"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Browser_Based", "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Browser Based", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Baseball", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Baseball", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Softball/Slowpitch", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Softball/Slowpitch", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Walking", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Walking", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Golf/Pitch_and_Putt", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Golf/Pitch and Putt", "wgt": 16}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://www.saratogian.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/sut-l-padres-0725_18bd9e.jpg?w=640", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9764260", "eventUri": "eng-9764260", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-06-26", "textStart": 1231, "textEnd": 1238}], "sentiment": -0.03529411764705881, "wgt": 174, "relevance": 1}

Now he has a no-hitter.\n\nThe Padres ace no-hit the Washington Nationals in a 3-0 win in our nation's capital, the second no-hitter in Padres franchise history and the first since Joe Musgrove did it in Texas in 2021. It was the second no-hitter of the 2024 MLB season after Astros pitcher Ronel Blanco did it on April 1.\n\nCease struck out nine and walked three on the day. His 114th and final pitch was a fly ball to centerfield by former Padres prospect C.J. Abrams to end it, and there were a few harrowing moments along the way.\n\nIn the bottom of the fifth it looked like Juan Yepez had the Nats first knock. He hit a flare into shallow centerfield. Second baseman Xander Bogaerts got there and had the ball in his glove but couldn't hold it there. The pearl popped out and Bogaerts, for a moment, thought he'd cost his starter a chance at a no-no.\n\nThis is why you back up in a play. Jackson Merrill was right there to grab the airborne orb for an out, baseball's version of an alley-oop dunk.\n\nSan Diego got all the offense they needed in a very strange first inning. Ten minutes after throwing his first pitch of the day, Patrick Corbin was not a happy camper. The Nationals starter got off to a terrible start against the Padres, giving up a single and two walks to load the bases with two outs. Just as Ha-Seong Kim was about to step into the batters box rain started to fall. The officiating crew called for a delay.\n\nThat's not normal. Typically umpires will give an inning a chance to end before sending teams to their clubhouses. Corbin voiced his displeasure, barking at the blues all the way to the dugout steps.\n\nAfter a 76-minute delay Corbin was back on the hill to try and get out of the jam he'd been stewing over for an hour and a half. Kim did not help his mood very much. San Diego's shortstop lofted a full count blooper just in front of a diving James Wood in left field. With the runners moving on the 3-2 pitch all three of them scored to make it 3-0 Padres.\n\nCease took it from there, finishing a season sweep of the Nats and giving the Friars a five-game winning streak.", "source": {"uri": "nbcphiladelphia.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "NBC10 Philadelphia"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/No-hitter", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "No-hitter"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/San_Diego_Padres", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "San Diego Padres"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Center_fielder", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Center fielder"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ronel_Blanco", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Ronel Blanco"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Musgrove", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Joe Musgrove"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dylan_Cease", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Dylan Cease"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ace_(baseball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Ace (baseball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pitch_(baseball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Pitch (baseball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xander_Bogaerts", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Xander Bogaerts"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Washington_Nationals", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Washington Nationals"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Batted_ball", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Batted ball"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Houston_Astros", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Houston Astros"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strikeout", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Strikeout"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Major_League_Baseball", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Major League Baseball"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pitcher", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Pitcher"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Texas", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Texas"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Texas"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Juan_Yepez", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Juan Yepez"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inning", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Inning"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patrick_Corbin", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Patrick Corbin"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Second_baseman", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Second baseman"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baseball", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Baseball"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/San_Diego", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "San Diego"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "San Diego"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baseball_field", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Baseball field"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dugout_(baseball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Dugout (baseball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Left_fielder", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Left fielder"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Out_(baseball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Out (baseball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Umpire_(baseball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Umpire (baseball)"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Baseball", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Baseball", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Fan_Pages", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Fan Pages", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/History", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/History", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Sabermetrics", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Sabermetrics", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://media.nbcphiladelphia.com/2024/07/GettyImages-2163665216.jpg?quality=85&strip=all&crop=0px%2C51px%2C4037px%2C2271px&resize=1200%2C675", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9764260", "eventUri": "eng-9764260", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "date": "-04-01", "textStart": 417, "textEnd": 424}], "sentiment": 0.0980392156862746, "wgt": 165, "relevance": 1}

He was frequently dominant, with nine strikeouts and loads of weak contact. And as is commonly the case with no-hitters, he benefited from some quality defense behind him.\n\nIn the bottom of the 5th inning, Juan Yepez popped a ball up to shallow center, where Xander Bogaerts bobbled it. It looked initially like it'd drop to the ground for a hit, but center fielder Jackson Merrill was in the right place at the right time and managed to corral it. About as unusual of a 4-8 putout as you'll ever see.\n\nIronically, the final out had the highest expected batting average of any ball put in play by the Nationals at .560. But right fielder Bryce Johnson was positioned perfectly, and the ball held up just long enough for him to secure the final out.\n\nUnsurprisingly, Padres announcers were pretty pumped after Cease completed the no-hitter.\n\nIt was the second in the history of the Padres organization after Joe Musgrove's start in 2021.\n\nCease's was impressive not just for his performance, but the fact that Padres manager Mike Shildt let him go well over 100 pitches. In an era where pitchers are routinely taken out at 80-90 pitches to preserve their arms, Cease reached 114.\n\nImportantly for the Padres, it secured their fifth consecutive victory in an extremely tight National League wild card race.

He finished second in AL Cy Young voting in 2022, as well as 22nd in AL MVP voting.\n\nWhile the 28-year-old right-hander may not be a leading NL Cy Young candidate this year, he has certainly managed to make his mark in San Diego.", "source": {"uri": "si.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Sports Illustrated"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/No-hitter", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "No-hitter"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/San_Diego_Padres", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "San Diego Padres"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Major_League_Baseball", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Major League Baseball"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strikeout", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Strikeout"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dylan_Cease", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Dylan Cease"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tampa_Bay_Rays", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Tampa Bay Rays"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Washington_Nationals", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Washington Nationals"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toronto_Blue_Jays", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Toronto Blue Jays"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earned_run_average", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Earned run average"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colorado_Rockies", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Colorado Rockies"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perfect_game_(baseball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Perfect game (baseball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Walks_plus_hits_per_inning_pitched", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Walks plus hits per inning pitched"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Houston_Astros", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Houston Astros"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Innings_pitched", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Innings pitched"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Base_on_balls", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Base on balls"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pitcher", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Pitcher"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MLB.com", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "MLB.com"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/San_Diego", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "San Diego"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "San Diego"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cy_Young", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Cy Young"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Major_League_Baseball_Most_Valuable_Player_Award", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Major League Baseball Most Valuable Player Award"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wins_Above_Replacement", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Wins Above Replacement"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chicago_White_Sox", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Chicago White Sox"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_League", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "American League"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_agent", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Free agent"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cy_Young_Award", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Cy Young Award"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Amateur", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Amateur", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Officiating", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Officiating", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/History", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/History", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://images2.minutemediacdn.com/image/upload/c_crop,w_2697,h_1517,x_0,y_0/c_fill,w_1440,ar_16:9,f_auto,q_auto,g_auto/images/voltaxMediaLibrary/mmsport/fastball/01j3npkmr79saptdnf1k.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9764260", "eventUri": "eng-9764260", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "date": "-04-01", "textStart": 746, "textEnd": 753}], "sentiment": 0.192156862745098, "wgt": 160, "relevance": 1}

The ninth inning had just begun and Cease had yet to allow a hit. He had thrown 103 pitches -- a low enough total, even in today's game, to get a shot at completing the no-hitter.\n\nIldemaro Vargas battled for eight pitches, fouling off five pitches, before finally grounding out to second base. Jacob Young swung at a first-pitch slider and grounded out routinely to shortstop. CJ Abrams took a slider low and in and then swung at another one, lifting a soft liner to right field.\n\nWith that final out, Cease had his first career no-hitter -- just the second in franchise history after Joe Musgrove broke through in 2021 -- and completed one of the great three-game stretches in major league history.\n\nOn July 13, he allowed one hit with 11 strikeouts in six scoreless innings to beat the Atlanta Braves. Then, in his next start on July 20, he allowed one hit with 10 strikeouts in seven scoreless innings to beat the Cleveland Guardians.\n\nNow, he has gone the distance, striking out nine batters en route to the first no-no of his career.\n\nCease, who pitched 8 2/3 no-hit innings with the White Sox in a 2022 game before seeing the bid broken up by current teammate Luis Arraez, said he first started thinking about the no-hitter after the sixth inning, \"but the pitch count was high, so it was like 'uhh ... .'\"\n\nHe issued a leadoff walk in the seventh but managed to get through the inning in 16 pitches. He told manager Mike Shildt that he still felt great but figured he had to get through the eighth inning in 105 pitches. With an easy nine-pitch inning, he had room to go out for the ninth.\n\nRemarkably, this was Cease's sixth start this season of at least six innings allowing one or fewer hits. That's a major league record -- 10 pitchers, including Cease in 2022, are tied for second with four such games in a season. This might not be quite as impressive as it seems; since pitchers rarely throw complete games anymore (or even eight innings), seven of those other 10 pitchers did it since 2021. Still, it points to how difficult it is to square up Cease, especially his slider, which he threw 60 times on Thursday. He leads the majors in strikeouts; batters are hitting just .191 against him (although his ERA is a bit high for a Cy Young contender at 3.50).\n\nNow, about that three-start stretch. To say Cease's is an all-time great is a little more difficult since you're comparing him to pitchers who, back in the day, would have thrown three straight complete games. Still, he's the first pitcher to have three consecutive starts of at least six innings allowing one or fewer hits. Let's list some of the other candidates, leaving out the dead-ball era:\n\nSubjectively, I'd probably go with Scherzer's trio, which features probably the most dominant back-to-back efforts ever -- although you have to give Koufax extra credit for doing it in the final days of a heated playoff race in 1965. For me, Cease just didn't quite enough innings to get the nod for the best three-start stretch ever.\n\nWell, not yet -- but let's see what he does next time out.", "source": {"uri": "espn.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "ESPN.com"}, "authors": [{"uri": "david_schoenfield@espn.co.uk", "name": "David Schoenfield", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inning", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Inning"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dylan_Cease", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Dylan Cease"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/No-hitter", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "No-hitter"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ESPN.com", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "ESPN.com"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strikeout", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Strikeout"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Major_League_Baseball", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Major League Baseball"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slider_(pitch)", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Slider (pitch)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cy_Young", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Cy Young"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Right_fielder", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Right fielder"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Second_baseman", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Second baseman"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Batted_ball", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Batted ball"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/San_Diego_Padres", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "San Diego Padres"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shortstop", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Shortstop"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cleveland_Guardians", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Cleveland Guardians"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mike_Shildt", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Mike Shildt"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Musgrove", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Joe Musgrove"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pitch_count", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Pitch count"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leadoff_hitter", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Leadoff hitter"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manager_(baseball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Manager (baseball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chicago_White_Sox", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Chicago White Sox"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atlanta_Braves", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Atlanta Braves"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dead-ball_era", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Dead-ball era"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sandy_Koufax", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Sandy Koufax"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Max_Scherzer", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Max Scherzer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complete_game", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Complete game"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earned_run_average", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Earned run average"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pitcher", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Pitcher"}, "location": null}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Browser_Based", "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Browser Based", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Softball/Slowpitch", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Softball/Slowpitch", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Fitness/Flexibility", "label": "dmoz/Health/Fitness/Flexibility", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Golf/Pitch_and_Putt", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Golf/Pitch and Putt", "wgt": 18}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Instruction", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Instruction", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://a2.espncdn.com/combiner/i?img=%2Fphoto%2F2024%2F0725%2Fr1363223_1296x729_16%2D9.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9764260", "eventUri": "eng-9764260", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-07-13", "textStart": 958, "textEnd": 965}, {"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-07-20", "textStart": 1085, "textEnd": 1092}], "sentiment": 0.03529411764705892, "wgt": 154, "relevance": 1}

Jacob Young had other ideas, as he grounded out to short on the first pitch of his at-bat.\n\nThat brought up C.J. Abrams, who lined out to right field on a 1-0 count to put Cease in the history books.\n\nIt's the second no-hitter in the big leagues this season, as Ronel Blanco of the Houston Astros accomplished the feat on April 1.\n\nJoe Musgrove tossed the organization's first no-no in 2021 - to put that in perspective, they have been no-hit against 10 times.\n\nThis is now the seventh season in a row

It was the beginning of the fifth inning, a moment in time in the middle of a game in the middle of a long season.\n\n\"I see Jackson right there,\" Bogaerts said. \"I'm like, 'Oh yeah. He's everywhere.'\"\n\nShadowing Bogaerts after a 96-foot burst of his own was rookie Jackson Merrill, a blur who somehow, some way positioned himself to make the most un-rookie-like play.\n\nMerrill stabbed at the airborne ball for an out when his catch probability was determined to be 5 percent. He flashed a knowing grin at the unlikelihood of it all as he cradled the ball.\n\nFour innings later, Padres starting pitcher Dylan Cease polished off the second no-hitter in franchise history. The tell-your-grandkids stunner of a play was the icing on Cease's unforgettable cake as the Padres cruised 3-0 for their fifth consecutive win.\n\n\"It looked like one of those in-betweeners and I saw Bogey going back and I was like, I have confidence in him but I'm like, 'Man, that looks like it's perfectly placed,'\" Cease said.\n\n\"... It feels like every no-hitter, there's a couple plays like that that are just remarkable.\"\n\nHow was Merrill there? Because that's what the best in baseball do. The meter's always running. Assume nothing. Give up on nothing. Attack each play to the fullest.\n\nFlip the 50-50 moments to your side of things. That's what winning baseball looks like.\n\n\"If he had five hits or no hits, I'm going to go all out for that ball,\" Merrill said.\n\nBogaerts smiled as he took a breath to rewind the moment.\n\n\"You name it, he's there,\" said Bogaerts, who shook his head and hugged Merrill after the out was secure. \"It's very routine for him to be in the right spot every time.\"\n\nNow back to that 5-percent part.\n\nEven if you do math like a toddler, that means there was a 95 percent chance of the ball finding grass. That also means there was a 95 percent chance of the no-hitter going poof-see ya'-gone.\n\n\"Well, I had a little help,\" Merrill said with a grin. \"I don't worry about the probability. All I know is that I caught it.\"\n\nPadres manager Mike Shildt has given up on ways to contextualize how much Merrill plays like a veteran, rather than a barely 21-year-old 100 games into his big-league career.\n\n\"That's just Jackson,\" Shildt said. \"You know, that's just a baseball player. I don't know that it has a status for him anymore. Whether it's a rookie or a veteran, he's just a baseball player. And he's proven that.\n\n\"It's a really heady play and it turned out to be in a big moment.\"\n\nIt was the closest Cease came to a scare until the eighth inning, when Bogaerts had to dive to the first-base-side of second on a ball hit by Keibert Ruiz. Bogaerts fumbled it, but recovered in time to cut the no-hitter outs needed from five to four.\n\nYou see that type of play from time to time in baseball. You do not see the play Bogaerts and Merrill combined on often, if ever. As teammates mobbed Cease on the mound, the moment was magnified 10-fold.\n\n\"I was going to call him off if he didn't raise his hands,\" Merrill said of the hard-charging Bogaerts. \"It would've been a tough play for me. I'm glad he went for it. It made it a little easier, honestly. But definitely a little more stressful.\"\n\nCease needed 114 pitches to make history, but No. 58 earned a share of the spotlight.\n\nFor all but perhaps one.\n\n\"It wasn't my moment. It was Dylan's moment all day,\" said the always understated Merrill. \"It's just another out that we made.\"\n\nThe crazy catch had relevance in the big picture, as well. If Yepez leads off an inning with a hit, there's no crystal ball to tell us what would have happened next.\n\nThose sorts of plays snuff out fires before they start.\n\nIn the end, it contributed to the Padres building the longest current streak in the National League, tied for the beefiest in baseball.\n\n\"I kind of had it and last second, I kind of hear his footsteps,\" Bogaerts said of the play. \"Obviously knowing my shoulder issue and stuff, I just kind of was a little more (hesitant). ... (It was) relief. The situation with me is, I'm going back, he's coming in, he probably has a better view.\"", "source": {"uri": "sandiegouniontribune.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "San Diego Union-Tribune"}, "authors": [{"uri": "bryce_miller@sandiegouniontribune.com", "name": "Bryce Miller", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inning", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Inning"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xander_Bogaerts", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Xander Bogaerts"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/No-hitter", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "No-hitter"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baseball", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Baseball"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/San_Diego_Padres", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "San Diego Padres"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Juan_Yepez", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Juan Yepez"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dylan_Cease", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Dylan Cease"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nationals_Park", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Nationals Park"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infielder", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Infielder"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Outfield", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Outfield"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Second_baseman", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Second baseman"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rookie", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Rookie"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Washington_Nationals", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Washington Nationals"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Starting_pitcher", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Starting pitcher"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mike_Shildt", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Mike Shildt"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manager_(baseball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Manager (baseball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_League_(baseball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "National League (baseball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Keibert_Ruiz", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Keibert Ruiz"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Relief_pitcher", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Relief pitcher"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Baseball", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Baseball", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Fan_Pages", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Fan Pages", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Sabermetrics", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Sabermetrics", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 99}], "image": "https://www.sandiegouniontribune.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/sut-l-padres-0726-04.jpg?w=640", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9764260", "eventUri": "eng-9764260", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1686274509803922, "wgt": 122, "relevance": 1}

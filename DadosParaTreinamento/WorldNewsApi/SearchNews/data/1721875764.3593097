{"id": 239728276, "title": "Israeli air strike hits refugee camp and homes in Gaza leaving 38 Palestinians dead", "text": "At least 38 people died on Saturday when Israeli air strikes hit a refugee camp and homes in Gaza City. Hamas said a residential block in the al-Shati area \u2013 used as a camp by people fleeing the war \u2013 was struck several times. People were pictured clambering over mountains of rubble in the aftermath of the attack. Another blast targeted houses in the al-Tuffah district, the Hamas-run government media office said. Officials from the World Health Organization said Gaza\u2019s health system was near collapse as casualties poured into the al-Aqsa Hospital. The air strikes came hours after an Israeli was shot dead in the Palestinian town of Qalqilya, in the northern West Bank. Israel\u2019s army confirmed a man had died and said its troops were now operating in the area. Today's events followed heavy shelling near offices of the International Committee of the Red Cross on Friday, when at least 22 people were killed. William Schomburg, head of the ICRC office in Rafah, tonight branded the attack \u201chorrific\u201d. But an Israel Defence Forces spokesman said there was \u201cno indication\u201d it carried out the strike. At least 37,431 people in Gaza have been killed and 1,139 Israelis have so far died in the war. But UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres yesterday warned spiralling tensions between Israel and Iran-backed group Hezbollah risk triggering catastrophe further afield.Calling for immediate de-escalation, he said the world cannot afford for Lebanon to become \u201canother Gaza\u201d. Meanwhile in the UK, today activists sprayed red paint on a Cambridge University hall in protest of the war. Palestine Action said it marked the end of an academic year \u201cwhere the University of Cambridge has funded, enabled and normalised the ongoing Palestinian genocide\u201d. The university condemned what it called an \u201cact of vandalism\u201d on its historic Senate House.", "summary": "One strike hit houses in al-Shati which is one of Gaza's historic refugee camps and another hit houses in the al-Tuffah neighborhood", "url": "https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/world-news/israeli-air-strike-hits-refugee-33087283", "image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article33087255.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/1_Israeli-attacks-continue-on-Gaza.jpg", "video": null, "publish_date": "2024-06-23 00:24:24", "author": "Saskia Rowlands,Saskia-Rowlands", "authors": ["Saskia Rowlands", "Saskia-Rowlands"], "language": "en", "catgory": "politics", "source_country": "gb", "sentiment": -0.363}

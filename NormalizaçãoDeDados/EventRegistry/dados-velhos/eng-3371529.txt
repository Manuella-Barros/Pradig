The causes of humanitarian crises may be different, from wars and inter-communal violence to conflicts over land and resources, from climate change erosion of farm lands and sea shores to sudden and unpredictable natural disasters such as earthquakes, landslides and typhoons.\n\nWhat is common in all the different scenarios of a humanitarian disaster is the suffering of the affected people, the scattering of families, the displacement of communities, and the need of women, men, boys and girls for cover, protection, water and nutrition, new homes and welcoming social structures. Normally, in support of the affected and responsible countries the international community mobilizes aid and resources to provide the much needed and life-saving assistance through either bilateral arrangements or through multilateral channels such as the United Nations and other international organizations.\n\nAt the end of this line of international assistance, at the intersection point between giving and receiving humanitarian aid, there operates the humanitarian worker. She or he can be a member of a non-governmental organization, or an official of an international organization or a volunteer of a local community or a simple citizen who is offering time, service, professionality and passion to addressing the immediate and urgent needs of the victims of humanitarian crises.\n\nEvery year, on the 19th of August, the international community celebrates the efforts of humanitarian workers across the world. The 19th of August is World Humanitarian Day, established in 2008 by a United Nations General Assembly resolution in order to \"contribute to increasing public awareness about humanitarian assistance activities worldwide and.... to honour all humanitarian and United Nations and associated personnel who have worked in the promotion of the humanitarian cause and those who have lost their lives in the cause of duty, and invites all Member States....as well as other international organizations and non-governmental organizations, to observe it annually in an appropriate manner\".\n\nThe day itself, the 19th of August, is a stark reminder of the environment in which humanitarian workers live and operate. On that day of the year 2003, in Baghdad, a car bomb destroyed the United Nations headquarters in Iraq killing the UN's Special Representative in Iraq, Sergio Vieira de Mello, and 21 other employees. The tragic incident had a profound and lasting impact on the UN's security practices globally.\n\nDespite increasing awareness and more effective security measures available in humanitarian operations, in 2015, 287 aid workers were victims of major attacks: 109 were killed, 110 wounded and 68 kidnapped. The trend of casualties is increasing as we compare these figures to the 86 aid workers killed in 2011. The reasons for attacking a humanitarian worker can differ but they are all based on the rejection or at times the misunderstanding of the purely humanitarian function they fulfil. It is a strict requirement for all humanitarian operations to adhere to three basic principles governing humanitarian work: humanity, impartiality, neutrality. The observance of these principles is the trademark and the condicio sine qua non for operating in conflict areas, it should provide the ultimate protection from warring factions as it distinguishes the combatants from the civilians who try to alleviate the human consequences of conflicts.\n\nHowever, and despite an overall compliance with the mentioned principles, humanitarian workers are often caught in the midst of conflicts and they are perceived biased on the basis on the faintest suspicion or they are merely targeted to send a political message to far-away quarters, or sometimes are the scapegoats of local conflicts, or commercial contracts that are not honoured, or just of the power game of local war lords and militia who impose their will on submitted populations.\n\nWhat should be done to halt the increasing loss of life among the people who bring relief and assistance to areas of conflict and who sometimes are the only ones to offer a gentle hand or a listening ear, who are able to empathize with people's years-long suffering and distress?\n\nPrimarily, states and non-state actors that are parties to conflicts, of whichever nature the conflict might be, must recognise the super-partes status of humanitarian workers, they must respect their mission and personal commitment and ensure their security at all costs and in all circumstances. It is no longer acceptable that beside the innocent victims of the conflict itself, also innocent humanitarian aid workers pay the ultimate price for their courage and their spirit of service.\n\nSecondly and most importantly, it is time to impose on belligerent states and factions a political solution to conflicts. Public opinions must hold their governments accountable for the genuine efforts made in the search of a compromised solution, as political settlements are based on sincere and well-intentioned compromises. Influential states must use their political and economic leverages to apply the necessary pressure on the warring parties to encourage a negotiating table discussion. The lives of humanitarian workers should no longer be wasted in human-made disasters, when other humanitarian emergencies caused by the force of nature are requiring an ever increasing level of resources and efforts to deal with unpredictable and devastating nature-made disasters. The world should let humanitarian workers serve to mitigate the whims of nature and not those of unscrupulous politicians and warlords.\n\nThe 19th of August is the day we celebrate the sacrifice of humanitarian workers who lost their lives on the line of duty, and we recognise the courage and the hardship of those who continue to provide their service in the most challenging situations. Let's all of us reflect and make an extra effort to create the conditions and the opportunities for peace, let's think of ways and means to show a genuine quest for peace and let's inspire others to do the same.\n\nThis year, 2017, is also the 25th anniversary of the relations between Azerbaijan and the United Nations, an important milestone in a partnership that has the objective of promoting peace and security, development and human rights in the country. This relationship started during the still unresolved conflict with Armenia, which saw humanitarian workers from Azerbaijan and from abroad working hand in hand for the protection and assistance of the civilian victims of the conflict. It is important to recognise today the past and present efforts of these valorous humanitarian workers, as well as the contribution of all the Azerbaijani humanitarian workers presently active around the world in the exercise of their humanitarian mission.\n\nMay World Humanitarian Day give us the urge to become part of the solution, to join, in spirit and actions, based on our capacity and means, the humanitarian workers' efforts to make this world a more peaceful and tolerant place to live.\n\n--\n\nFollow us on Twitter @AzerNewsAz", "date": "2017-08-18", "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Philanthropy/Organizations", "wgt": 100, "id": 17, "label": "dmoz/Society/Philanthropy/Organizations"}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues", "wgt": 100, "id": 41, "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues"}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Warfare_and_Conflict", "wgt": 100, "id": 164, "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Warfare and Conflict"}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Peace", "wgt": 100, "id": 331, "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Peace"}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Philanthropy/International_Aid_and_Development", "wgt": 100, "id": 332, "label": "dmoz/Society/Philanthropy/International Aid and Development"}], "concepts": [{"location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Republic of Azerbaijan"}}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Azerbaijan", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Republic of Azerbaijan"}, "type": "loc", "id": "15"}, {"location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Republic of Iraq"}}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iraq", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Republic of Iraq"}, "type": "loc", "id": "106"}, {"location": {"country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Republic of Iraq"}}, "type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Baghdad"}}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baghdad", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Baghdad"}, "type": "loc", "id": "1579"}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_rights", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "id": "302584", "label": {"eng": "Human rights"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "302854", "label": {"eng": "Human"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Politics", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "302948", "label": {"eng": "Politics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Water", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "303000", "label": {"eng": "Water"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Climate_change", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "id": "303331", "label": {"eng": "Climate change"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Nations", "type": "org", "score": 5, "id": "303396", "label": {"eng": "United Nations"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_disaster", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "303498", "label": {"eng": "Natural disaster"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sea", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "id": "306965", "label": {"eng": "Sea"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Nations_High_Commissioner_for_Refugees", "type": "org", "score": 4, "id": "308095", "label": {"eng": "United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_community", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "id": "308438", "label": {"eng": "International community"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Car_bomb", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "308914", "label": {"eng": "Car bomb"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Erosion", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "id": "309869", "label": {"eng": "Erosion"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-governmental_organization", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "id": "309893", "label": {"eng": "Non-governmental organization"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_organization", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "id": "310457", "label": {"eng": "International organization"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Militia", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "id": "310583", "label": {"eng": "Militia"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Humanitarian_aid", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "id": "315283", "label": {"eng": "Humanitarian aid"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Humanitarianism", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "id": "319035", "label": {"eng": "Humanitarianism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Humanitarian_crisis", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "id": "319038", "label": {"eng": "Humanitarian crisis"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Nations_Headquarters", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "353855", "label": {"eng": "United Nations Headquarters"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Humanitarian_Day", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "385670", "label": {"eng": "World Humanitarian Day"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special_Representative_of_the_Secretary-General", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "422135", "label": {"eng": "Special Representative of the Secretary-General"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sine_qua_non", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "id": "453863", "label": {"eng": "Sine qua non"}}]}

It is important to recognise today the past and present efforts of these valorous humanitarian workers, as well as the contribution of all the Azerbaijani humanitarian workers presently active around the world in the exercise of their humanitarian mission.\n\nMay World Humanitarian Day give us the urge to become part of the solution, to join, in spirit and actions, based on our capacity and means, the humanitarian workers' efforts to make this world a more peaceful and tolerant place to live.", "date": "2017-08-18", "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Philanthropy/Organizations", "wgt": 100, "id": 17, "label": "dmoz/Society/Philanthropy/Organizations"}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues", "wgt": 100, "id": 41, "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues"}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Warfare_and_Conflict", "wgt": 100, "id": 164, "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Warfare and Conflict"}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Peace", "wgt": 100, "id": 331, "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Peace"}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Philanthropy/International_Aid_and_Development", "wgt": 100, "id": 332, "label": "dmoz/Society/Philanthropy/International Aid and Development"}], "concepts": [{"location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Republic of Azerbaijan"}}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Azerbaijan", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Republic of Azerbaijan"}, "type": "loc", "id": "15"}, {"location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Republic of Iraq"}}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iraq", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Republic of Iraq"}, "type": "loc", "id": "106"}, {"location": {"country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Republic of Iraq"}}, "type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Baghdad"}}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baghdad", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Baghdad"}, "type": "loc", "id": "1579"}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_rights", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "id": "302584", "label": {"eng": "Human rights"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "302854", "label": {"eng": "Human"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Politics", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "302948", "label": {"eng": "Politics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Water", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "303000", "label": {"eng": "Water"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Climate_change", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "id": "303331", "label": {"eng": "Climate change"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Nations", "type": "org", "score": 5, "id": "303396", "label": {"eng": "United Nations"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_disaster", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "303498", "label": {"eng": "Natural disaster"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sea", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "id": "306965", "label": {"eng": "Sea"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Nations_High_Commissioner_for_Refugees", "type": "org", "score": 4, "id": "308095", "label": {"eng": "United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_community", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "id": "308438", "label": {"eng": "International community"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Car_bomb", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "308914", "label": {"eng": "Car bomb"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Erosion", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "id": "309869", "label": {"eng": "Erosion"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-governmental_organization", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "id": "309893", "label": {"eng": "Non-governmental organization"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_organization", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "id": "310457", "label": {"eng": "International organization"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Militia", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "id": "310583", "label": {"eng": "Militia"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Humanitarian_aid", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "id": "315283", "label": {"eng": "Humanitarian aid"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Humanitarianism", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "id": "319035", "label": {"eng": "Humanitarianism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Humanitarian_crisis", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "id": "319038", "label": {"eng": "Humanitarian crisis"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Nations_Headquarters", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "353855", "label": {"eng": "United Nations Headquarters"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Humanitarian_Day", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "385670", "label": {"eng": "World Humanitarian Day"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special_Representative_of_the_Secretary-General", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "422135", "label": {"eng": "Special Representative of the Secretary-General"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sine_qua_non", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "id": "453863", "label": {"eng": "Sine qua non"}}]}

There have also been increased incidents of aid diversion away from intended beneficiaries in areas under the control of the Sana'a authorities.\n\nI am specifically concerned about the looting of food aid and other humanitarian goods in Taizz Governorate where there have been three separate incidents over a period of two months. Since January 2017, eleven vehicles belonging to humanitarian organisations have been hijacked in Taizz City in areas under the control of the Government of Yemen.\n\nWhile I acknowledge the efforts of the authorities and local leaders to recover looted items, more needs to be done to ensure a safe and secure operational environment conducive to the timely delivery of humanitarian assistance to people in need. All of these incidents delay the provision of urgently need help to those most affected by the conflict while at the same time putting humanitarian staff at risk.\n\nAs basic social services in Yemen are near collapse, there is mounting pressure on humanitarian organisations to expand the humanitarian response. Ensuring unhindered humanitarian access is essential to save the lives of those who depend on assistance, particularly as Yemen is facing an unprecedented cholera crisis and over seven million people are at risk of famine.\n\nI urge all parties to the conflict to uphold their obligations under international humanitarian law to facilitate the safe and unhindered delivery of humanitarian assistance in areas under their control.", "date": "2017-08-17", "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Philanthropy/Organizations", "wgt": 100, "id": 17, "label": "dmoz/Society/Philanthropy/Organizations"}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Health", "wgt": 100, "id": 289, "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Health"}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Philanthropy/International_Aid_and_Development", "wgt": 100, "id": 332, "label": "dmoz/Society/Philanthropy/International Aid and Development"}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Conditions_and_Diseases/Immune_Disorders", "wgt": 100, "id": 901, "label": "dmoz/Health/Conditions and Diseases/Immune Disorders"}], "concepts": [{"location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Yemen"}}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yemen", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Yemen"}, "type": "loc", "id": "245"}, {"location": {"country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Yemen"}}, "type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Sanaa"}}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sana'a", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Sanaa"}, "type": "loc", "id": "1110"}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Humanitarian_aid", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "315283", "label": {"eng": "Humanitarian aid"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aid", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "318692", "label": {"eng": "Aid"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Humanitarianism", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "id": "319035", "label": {"eng": "Humanitarianism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cholera", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "id": "325379", "label": {"eng": "Cholera"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Politics_of_Yemen", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "id": "375574", "label": {"eng": "Politics of Yemen"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taiz", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "1053698", "label": {"eng": "Taiz"}}]}

Lack of access to people in need together with an increase in the targeting of aid workers make it very challenging to reach those most in need. The international community should unite to guarantee access and security for humanitarians in order for them to assist those most in need, the Danish Refugee Council said today in a statement ahead of World Humanitarian Day, August 19.\n\nHumanitarian organisations experience a decreasing lack of humanitarian access to people in need, an increasing loss of life in the field and a constant political pressure on the work they do. The World Humanitarian Day, August 19 marks the anniversary of the 2003 bombing of the UN headquarters in Baghdad, Iraq, when 22 humanitarian workers were killed - and is an opportunity to remember that a humanitarian worker is #notatarget.\n\n\"We see a huge gap between the increasing humanitarian needs in the world - not least as an outcome of a growing number of displaced - while at the same time, the risk linked to helping people in need is also increasing. From 1997 to 2016, the number of humanitarian aid workers killed on duty doubled. We need to remember that humanitarians are and should never be a target. It must never cost lives to save lives,\" says Andreas Kamm, Secretary General, the Danish Refugee Council: \"At the same time an increased lack of access on the ground makes it impossible to reach some of the areas affected by the world's worst crises. This means that those most in need often do not get the required humanitarian assistance even if we are ready and stand by to deliver.\"\n\nIt is not only dangerous and challenging to work in the conflict zones of today's world. The humanitarian organisations also experience an increased pressure from political side, when trying to fulfil their mandate.\n\n\"A recent example was the statements of European politicians criticizing NGOs for their work in the Mediterranean sea though they are in fact fulfilling our stated humanitarian mandates and doing what we as humanitarian organisations do everywhere in the world - namely, save lives. Another example is an increased pressure upon NGOs to work along political agendas. However, phenomena likes migration should be addressed through a focus on sustainable and durable solutions. We have to remember that it is a desperate choice that forces people to leave his or her home and to put oneself and sometimes one's family at risk by crossing the Sahara desert, the Mediterranean, the Red Sea or where ever people flee in desperate pursue of survival and new and better opportunities,\" says Andreas Kamm.\n\nThe Danish Refugee Council is a leading international humanitarian organisation and work in more than 35 countries around the world, assisting forcibly displaced and host communities with emergency aid and deliver long term and durable solutions.\n\n\"This day also marks an opportunity to send out a big thank you to our more than 7,000 DRC and DDG colleagues around the world who work tirelessly every day in some of the most challenging safety sensitive environments assisting people in need.

The Gu rains started late in April and ended prematurely in early May, instead of June. Pasture and water conditions have improved but remain below average to poor in central regions, large areas of the south and parts of northern regions.\n\n- The number of people in need of humanitarian assistance has increased to 6.7 million people, up from 5 million in August 2016. According to the latest projections by the FAO-managed Food Security and Nutrition Analysis Unit (FSNAU), a total of 3.2 million people were facing Crisis and Emergency (IPC Phase 3 and 4) levels of food insecurity through June.\n\n- Large-scale humanitarian assistance has reduced household food consumption gaps. Even so, there remains an elevated risk of Famine (IPC Phase 5) due to the combination of severe food consumption gaps, high acute malnutrition, high disease burden, and reliance on humanitarian assistance.\n\n- Preliminary findings from the ongoing post-Gu assessment indicate that humanitarian needs are expected to persist at current levels through the end of the year.

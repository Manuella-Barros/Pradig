{"id": 223760572, "title": "\u2018It could be the end of the road for a few of us\u2019 - Henry Shefflin to reassess time as Galway manager", "text": "Shefflin was crestfallen after the Tribesmen's season came to a premature end and the likelihood of the Kilkenny legend staying on for a fourth season looks in serious doubt. \"I don\u2019t know, it could be the end of the road for a few of us,\" Shefflin said when asked if a few of Galway's 2017 All-Ireland SHC winners could walk away after their season ended at the round-robin stages. \"But what we said in the dressing room was that we\u2019d take a few days and don\u2019t make a rash decision, and that\u2019s the only logical thing. I do feel sorry for someone like Johnny Glynn, who\u2019s back home. \"He couldn\u2019t catch a break, comes on making an impact and next thing he dislocates his shoulder. Davy Burke obviously who has given so much, you know the type of person he is more than a player. \"And what he has done for St Thomas\u2019 and Galway, and he\u2019s hurting inside. There\u2019s a lot of hurt in that dressing room and it\u2019s very difficult, that\u2019s sport and there\u2019s good days and bad days, and today was a very bad day for us.\" Shefflin, who was \"absolutely heartbroken\" with the result, was set to stay on until the end of the 2026 season but he insists that he was always going to \"reassess\" after his third year in charge. \"It\u2019s something after three years that I was always going to reassess, and that will be no different now. But I think today is not the day for that,\" he said. \"I\u2019m absolutely heartbroken because you put so much into this and we\u2019ve thrown everything at it. We felt we had to be a little bit different this year and make that step change, and we did that with the support of the county board. \"We tried everything, but the more we seemed to try, the more it seemed to come back on us and it was very hard for us to catch a break, and it was just one of those years I think.\" Shefflin insisted that the next few days would be \"very low\" and he will take some time before making a decision on his future. \"I\u2019m going to be very low obviously, because you put a lot into this and you just weigh up your family and everything like that that goes into it. For us, though, that\u2019s why we do sport,\" Shefflin said. \"It\u2019s easy to sit at home and watch the TV and do these things, but you have to front up and go out there and that\u2019s what I decided to do. But your family put a lot into it and there\u2019s a lot of things kind of go around. \"But for me, it will be hurt for a few days and just kind of take a break and just try and get back to normal after a few days and see how things lie at that stage.\" Shefflin was visibly upset with the early sending off of David Burke after the All-Ireland-winning skipper was dismissed by Colm Lyons in the 16th minute and he insisted it \"had a big bearing on the game\". Shefflin was adamant that it was only a \"yellow card\" while he questioned Lyons and his team, as well as the alleged influence which Dublin boss Miche\u00e1l Donoghue had on the decision. \"I obviously saw the clip there after and for me, it's a yellow card. For me, it's a yellow card. When you have the opposing manager as well in the linesman's ear telling him that it should be a red card,\" he said. \"I think the linesmen and the officials need to support each other. The linesman in the second half (Kevin Jordan) told Colm Lyons that it was a wide ball (Chris Crummey's shot in the 52nd minute). \"He (Lyons) walked into his umpires and had a chat with them for a minute. I said (to Jordan), 'why is that?' He (Jordan) said, 'I don't know' and next thing they gave a point. I thought they were a team just like we're trying to be a team. I just didn't see that today. \"I don\u2019t know if the ref had seen something straight on that he made a decision on (the red card), but it seemed to me that the linesman (in the first half, Niall Malone) definitely had an influence on the game. \"And as well as that, you have a player jumping into another player, so if a player has his two feet off the ground and is moving with his head, it\u2019s very hard to avoid it. \"So look, I\u2019m sure there will be debate around that, but for me did he deserve a red card? No, he didn\u2019t - it was a yellow card, and it obviously had a big bearing on the game.\"", "summary": "<p>Henry Shefflin will \"weigh up\" his future as Galway senior hurling manager after three seasons in charge following their early championship exit at the hands of Dublin this afternoon.</p>", "url": "https://www.independent.ie/sport/gaelic-games/hurling/it-could-be-the-end-of-the-road-for-a-few-of-us-henry-shefflin-to-reassess-time-as-galway-manager/a493366672.html", "image": "https://focus.independent.ie/thumbor/acRl4NAqkaoBNQeXUpVp0l2ECQA=/291x166:2946x1935/550x550/prod-mh-ireland/90c4a9ae-d8f8-4d2d-84f1-709c36802ec7/6936f063-a76b-4a0d-9e91-a9e42ad70452/Sports2827900.jpg", "video": null, "publish_date": "2024-05-26 16:06:31", "author": "Michael Verney", "authors": ["Michael Verney"], "language": "en", "source_country": "ie", "sentiment": -0.105}

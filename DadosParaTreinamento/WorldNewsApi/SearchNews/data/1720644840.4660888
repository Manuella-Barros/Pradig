{"id": 231278982, "title": "Family of Joshua Tarnue still seeking answers following alleged killer\u2019s arrest", "text": "Joshua Tarnue\u2019s family is still wondering why he was targeted, almost 10 months after the 18-year-old was killed in a downtown Kitchener parking lot. Emergency responders found Tarnue with a gunshot wound near Queen and Charles streets on Aug. 13, 2023. He was later pronounced dead in hospital. The following month, two men who police haven\u2019t named were charged with manslaughter in the case. A Canada-wide warrant was also issued for Habiton Solomon of Hamilton, who was wanted for second-degree murder. There were no public updates on the case for months, but then on May 31, 2024, Solomon was arrested in connection to a different shooting in Hamilton. Police have confirmed he\u2019s facing five gun charges related to an incident there on July 22, 2023. On June 4, Waterloo Regional Police officially charged Solomon for second degree murder. MORE: Look back at the timeline of shooting and arrests in the case \u201cStill not going to bring my child back\u201d Evelyn Woart, Tarnue\u2019s mother, said it\u2019s been difficult waiting for Solomon\u2019s arrest. \u201cAs time went on, and we couldn\u2019t get the person that killed Joshua, it was very, very hard for me,\u201d she explained. \u201cI\u2019ve been going along with this up until this time, praying and wanting this guy to get arrested.\u201d When Woart heard the update last week, she felt one small step closer to justice for her son. \u201cIt gives me peace of mind that the person has been caught, but it\u2019s still not going to bring my child back to me. And it\u2019s still not going to heal the pain that I have \u2013 that\u2019s something that I will have to live with forever,\u201d she said. \u201cI feel like I failed my child. Bringing him from a place like Africa, and then bringing him here to die. I blame myself. Why didn\u2019t I leave him there? I had to bring him here. So all of those things, I don\u2019t think that\u2019s something that will heal so easily for me. Until justice is done, then maybe.\u201d Woart doesn\u2019t know what the connection was between her son and Solomon. She also doesn\u2019t know the answer to one looming question \u2013 why did this happen to Joshua? \u201cI never got that answer,\u201d Woart said. \u201cI\u2019m hoping that since they have gotten [Solomon] arrested, maybe we\u2019ll get the answer to why he did it. What would a child do that would deserve killing him?\u201d Joshua Tarnue's family on June 7, 2024. Jikulunu Jorgbo, Joshua\u2019s step-sister, said the family has been anxiously waiting this arrest. \u201cWe\u2019ve heard other stories about how this goes on and on for many years and they never catch whoever commits such a crime like this,\u201d she said. \u201cTo know in our case, in less than a year, police were diligent in doing their work and they caught this individual. It\u2019s huge, huge relief for sure.\u201d Remembering Joshua Tarnue\u2019s family has been trying to come to terms with his death since that awful night. \u201cWhen I heard that my son Joshua was murdered, at first I didn\u2019t believe it happened,\u201d Woart said. \u201cThe first question that I asked myself was \u2018how can I undo this?\u2019\u201d To his mom, Tarnue was a major source of happiness. \u201cSometimes when I wake up, I think he\u2019s there or making tea, or he\u2019s cleaning or trying to find something to make me happy,\u201d she explained. \u201cHe loved people. He loved to see people happy, and he\u2019d do anything to make friends happy.\u201d Woart said Joshua loved dancing and football, and was just getting into basketball at the time of his death. \u201cI was trying to enroll in a team, but we never got to do that,\u201d Woart recalled. Cooking was another hobby that Tarnue exceled in \u2013 most of the time. \u201cThere\u2019s a kind of soup we have in our [culture] called palm soup. That was the only soup he couldn\u2019t cook. He would say \u2018mom, I don\u2019t know how to cook this one,\u201d Woart said with a laugh. \u201cOne time he tried it, and it just wasn\u2019t done right.\u201d Evelyn Woart, Joshua Tarnue\u2019s mother, sits behind photos of her son on June 7, 2024. To many of his family and friends, Tarnue is remembered as a quiet and kind person. \u201cMy memory of him was a very quiet, calm individual,\u201d Jorgbo said. \u201cI could not get a word out of him. The goal and the plan was to get him coming to church often in order to pick him up and grow a connection with him. Obviously that didn\u2019t get to happen because now he\u2019s not here.\u201d The next chapter of this case will be the court proceedings. Tarnue\u2019s family hopes that\u2019s when their questions will finally be answered. As the legal case plays out, they\u2019ll continue to reflect on all the happy memories they had with Tarnue. They\u2019ll also continue to rely on the support of their community, which has helped them through this tragedy. \u201cFor something as major as this, to have them present throughout the entire journey has been such a blessing. Not just to the families here, but for the family back home because they knew that we had a support system,\u201d Jorgbo said.

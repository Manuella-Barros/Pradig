Elissa Slotkin brought in $6.45 million for her U.S. Senate bid during the last fundraising quarter and reports $9.5 million in cash reserves four months out from Election Day, her campaign said Tuesday.\n\nThe massive haul is the most that Slotkin has raised during a three-month period since she jumped into the race for the open Senate seat in February 2023, bringing her total raised this cycle to about $22.5 million. She posted about $4.4 million in total receipts during the first quarter of the year.\n\nHer campaign said that 95% of donations were $100 or less, and that 56% of donors were new to giving to the campaign. The total includes no self-funding and no donations from corporate PACs, according to a spokesman.\n\nThe fundraising announcement comes after the Democratic frontrunner's campaign last week dropped $8 million on advertising reservations on cable, broadcast and digital platforms in the final weeks leading up to the general election during for October and November.\n\nSlotkin has dominated fundraising in the Senate race among all candidates, and is the first in the Michigan contest to announce her second quarter total ahead of the July 15 deadline for reports to be filed with the Federal Election Commission.\n\nIn the Aug. 6 Democratic primary, she is facing Hill Harper of Detroit, an actor and author who has struggled to raise money. The Republican primary includes former U.S. Reps. Mike Rogers of Brighton and Justin Amash of Cascade Township, businessman Sandy Pensler of Grosse Pointe Park and physician Sherry O'Donnell of Stevensville.\n\nThey are competing for the seat held by retiring U.S. Sen. Debbie Stabenow, D-Lansing.\n\nComing behind Slotkin in the first quarter of the year was Pensler, who has largely financed his bid himself by loaning his campaign a total $3 million through March 31. The Trump-backed Rogers has raised $2.9 million overall this cycle as of March 31. Amash, who joined the race late, raised nearly $478,500 in his first quarter and closed out with over $740,230 in the bank.\n\nHarper brought in nearly $358,000 from individual donors in the first quarter of the year and gave his campaign $350,000. He posted just over $2 million in overall receipts for the cycle as of March 31.\n\nComedian Dave Chappelle is headlining a show Thursday at Saint Andrew's Hall in downtown Detroit as a fundraiser benefiting Harper's campaign. Chappelle's 2021 comedy special, filmed at the Fillmore Detroit, was controversial over anti-transgender content, though it won a Grammy Award for Best Comedy Album.\n\nNational groups are increasingly eyeing the Michigan race, with the Senate Republicans' political arm, which backs Rogers, making nearly $10 million in TV and digital ad reservations in Michigan last month. The Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee has made over $11 million in Michigan TV reservations to defend Stabenow's seat, and Senate Majority PAC, a group associated with Majority Leader Charles Schumer of New York, has reserved $14 million of airtime in Michigan to boost the Democratic nominee.\n\n\"Elissa Slotkin is raising big money from coastal elites,\" said Maggie Abboud, spokeswoman for the National Republican Senatorial Committee. \"Unfortunately, the price of those donations is that Slotkin is not allowed to state the obvious: Joe Biden is mentally unfit to serve as president.\"\n\nThe contest for Stabenow's seat is among several battleground states that could be key in deciding which party controls the chamber in 2025.\n\n_____", "source": {"uri":

Elissa Slotkin brought in $6.45 million for her U.S. Senate bid during the last fundraising quarter and reports $9.5 million in cash reserves four months out from Election Day, her campaign said Tuesday.\n\nThe massive haul is the most that Slotkin has raised during a three-month period since she jumped into the race for the open Senate seat in February 2023, bringing her total raised this cycle to about $22.5 million. She posted about $4.4 million in total receipts during the first quarter of the year.\n\nHer campaign said that 95% of donations were $100 or less, and that 56% of donors were new to giving to the campaign. The total includes no self-funding and no donations from corporate PACs, according to a spokesman.\n\nThe fundraising announcement comes after the Democratic frontrunner's campaign last week dropped $8 million on advertising reservations on cable, broadcast and digital platforms in the final weeks leading up to the general election during for October and November.\n\nSlotkin has dominated fundraising in the Senate race among all candidates, and is the first in the Michigan contest to announce her second quarter total ahead of the July 15 deadline for reports to be filed with the Federal Election Commission.\n\nIn the Aug. 6 Democratic primary, she is facing Hill Harper of Detroit, an actor and author who has struggled to raise money. The Republican primary includes former U.S. Reps. Mike Rogers of Brighton and Justin Amash of Cascade Township, businessman Sandy Pensler of Grosse Pointe Park and physician Sherry O'Donnell of Stevensville.\n\nThey are competing for the seat held by retiring U.S. Sen. Debbie Stabenow, D-Lansing.\n\nMore: Who's leading the money race in Michigan's U.S. Senate contest?\n\nComing behind Slotkin in the first quarter of the year was Pensler, who has largely financed his bid himself by loaning his campaign a total $3 million through March 31. The Trump-backed Rogers has raised $2.9 million overall this cycle as of March 31. Amash, who joined the race late, raised nearly $478,500 in his first quarter and closed out with over $740,230 in the bank.\n\nHarper brought in nearly $358,000 from individual donors in the first quarter of the year and gave his campaign $350,000. He posted just over $2 million in overall receipts for the cycle as of March 31.\n\nNational groups are increasingly eyeing the Michigan race, with the Senate Republicans' political arm, which backs Rogers, making nearly $10 million in TV and digital ad reservations in Michigan last month. The Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee has made over $11 million in Michigan TV reservations to defend Stabenow's seat, and Senate Majority PAC, a group associated with Majority Leader Charles Schumer of New York, has reserved $14 million of airtime in Michigan to boost the Democratic nominee.\n\nThe contest for Stabenow's seat is among several battleground states that could be key in deciding which party controls the chamber in 2025.", "source": {"uri": "detroitnews.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Detroit News"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

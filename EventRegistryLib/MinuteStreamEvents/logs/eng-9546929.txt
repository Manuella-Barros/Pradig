Engelmeyer said he'd been housed on the floor for inmates where everyone has access to a room with phones and a television room.\"He's been moved back to Rikers largely due to pressure, I believe, due to pressure because of the news about what somebody thought was VIP treatment,\" he said.Weinstein was brought to Bellevue Hospital only hours after he was transferred on April 26 from the Mohawk Correctional Facility, about 100 miles northwest of Albany, to Rikers less than a day after the New York Court of Appeals vacated his conviction.The appeals court ruled that a Manhattan trial judge permitted jurors to see and hear too much evidence not directly related to the charges he faced, and it ordered a new trial, negating his 23-year prison sentence.

Weinstein will continue to be held in New York as the extradition process plays out. Weinstein, released from a city hospital days ago, showed up for the hearing in a wheelchair and wearing a dark suit.\n\nWeinstein's attorney said California first needs to produce a warrant.\n\n\"They are not in a position to extradite Mr. Weinstein because they have not done what they need to do,\" attorney Diana Fabi Samson said outside court.\n\nHis next appearance is set for Aug. 7.\n\nThe 16-year sentence Weinstein received in 2023 for raping a woman at a 2013 Los Angeles film festival had been on ice while he served time behind bars in New York after being found guilty of rape in Manhattan in 2020. But the Empire State conviction was overturned late last month, negating its 23-year sentence.\n\nThe 72-year-old has nevertheless remained in New York custody while Manhattan's district attorney works to retry him. At a hearing last week, prosecutors said they could be ready as soon as September, and that at least one of two alleged victims was willing to testify again.\n\nIn that case, the once powerful former movie executive is accused of raping an aspiring actor in 2013 and sexually assaulting a TV and film production assistant in 2006.

Engelmeyer said he'd been housed on the floor for inmates where everyone has access to a room with phones and a television room.\n\n\"He's been moved back to Rikers largely due to pressure, I believe, due to pressure because of the news about what somebody thought was VIP treatment,\" he said.\n\nWeinstein was brought to Bellevue Hospital only hours after he was transferred on April 26 from the Mohawk Correctional Facility, about 100 miles (160 kilometers) northwest of Albany, to Rikers less than a day after the New York Court of Appeals vacated his conviction.\n\nThe appeals court ruled that a Manhattan trial judge permitted jurors to see and hear too much evidence not directly related to the charges he faced, and it ordered a new trial, negating his 23-year prison sentence. However, he remained jailed because he was convicted in Los Angeles in 2022 of another rape and was sentenced to 16 years in prison.\n\nWhile prosecutors have asked for a September retrial on charges that he forcibly performed oral sex on a TV and film production assistant in 2006 and raped an aspiring actor in 2013, it was unclear if key trial witnesses would return for a new trial. Weinstein has disputed the allegations.\n\nFrank Dwyer, a New York City Department of Correction spokesperson, said Weinstein was originally taken to Bellevue for medical care and was returned to the West Facility, a Rikers Island jail in Queens, when the treatment was completed.\n\nThe West Facility houses 140 specially air-controlled housing units for inmates with contagious diseases such as tuberculosis, according to a city website, though the jail has reportedly also been used for inmates that need to be isolated from the general jail population for other reasons.\n\nCraig Rothfeld, a jail consultant working with Weinstein attorneys, responded to an email sent to a Weinstein lawyer by saying the decision to return Weinstein to Rikers was made by medical staff \"who are more than qualified to make these medical decisions.\"\n\nHe said there are no more updates to provide regarding Weinstein's health, and all of his health conditions continue to be closely monitored by city jail and health officials.\n\n\"We have every confidence in their decision-making ability regarding Mr. Weinstein's safety and well-being and are grateful for their continued communication,\" Rothfeld said.\n\nEngelmeyer said Weinstein had been treated at the hospital for pneumonia, a recurring issue related to his heart troubles, along with his other medical issues, including diabetes.\n\n\"He appreciates the care he was getting in Bellevue,\" he said.\n\nEngelmeyer said Weinstein was \"disappointed\" at his return to Rikers and was \"uncomfortable\" there, where the spokesperson described Weinstein's housing as \"more like an infirmary.\"\n\nHe said Weinstein was regularly speaking by phone with his lawyers when he was at the hospital as other inmates awaiting trial are allowed to do.\n\n\"He didn't get any treatment different from others. He wasn't talking to his friends and buddies and having a good time,\" Engelmeyer said.\n\nEngelmeyer said Weinstein gained some \"relief and hope\" from the appeals ruling, but he knows he faces a long prison term from the California case and an appeal of that conviction won't be heard for another year.\n\n\"His spirits are up, but he also knows he has a long, long trip ahead of him,\" Engelmeyer said. \"He knows that he won't be getting out soon.", "source": {"uri": "wboc.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "WBOC TV-16"}, "authors": [{"uri": "associated_press@wboc.com", "name":

The 16-year sentence Weinstein received for raping a woman at a Los Angeles film festival in 2013 had been on ice while he served time in New York.\n\nNEW YORK (AP) -- Harvey Weinstein will remain locked up in New York as a court works out whether he should stay in a city jail while he awaits a retrial in a rape case, or be sent back to California to continue serving a prison sentence.\n\nThe fallen movie mogul denied his consent for an extradition request from California related to a separate rape conviction during a brief court hearing Thursday. Weinstein will continue to be held in New York as the extradition process plays out.\n\nWeinstein, released from a city hospital days ago, showed up for the hearing in a wheelchair and wearing a dark suit. Defense attorney Diana Fabi Samson said later outside of court that their main concern was making sure Weinstein gets needed medical care while he remains in custody in New York.\n\n\"He's holding up the best he can,\" she said.\n\nSamson described the court appearance Thursday as normal procedure and said California first needs to produce a warrant signed by the governor.\n\n\"They are not in a position to extradite Mr. Weinstein because they have not done what they need to do,\" attorney Diana Fabi Samson said outside court.\n\nHis next appearance is set for Aug. 7.\n\nThe 16-year sentence Weinstein received in 2023 for raping a woman at a 2013 Los Angeles film festival had been on ice while he served time behind bars in New York after being found guilty of rape in Manhattan in 2020. But the Empire State conviction was overturned late last month, negating its 23-year sentence.\n\nThe 72-year-old has nevertheless remained in New York custody while Manhattan's district attorney works to retry him.

Engelmeyer said he'd been housed on the floor for inmates where everyone has access to a room with phones and a television room.\n\n\"He's been moved back to Rikers largely due to pressure, I believe, due to pressure because of the news about what somebody thought was VIP treatment,\" he said.\n\nWeinstein was brought to Bellevue Hospital only hours after he was transferred on April 26 from the Mohawk Correctional Facility, about 100 miles (160 kilometers) northwest of Albany, to Rikers less than a day after the New York Court of Appeals vacated his conviction.\n\nThe appeals court ruled that a Manhattan trial judge permitted jurors to see and hear too much evidence not directly related to the charges he faced, and it ordered a new trial, negating his 23-year prison sentence. However, he remained jailed because he was convicted in Los Angeles in 2022 of another rape and was sentenced to 16 years in prison.\n\nWhile prosecutors have asked for a September retrial on charges that he forcibly performed oral sex on a TV and film production assistant in 2006 and raped an aspiring actor in 2013, it was unclear if key trial witnesses would return for a new trial. Weinstein has disputed the allegations.\n\nFrank Dwyer, a New York City Department of Correction spokesperson, said Weinstein was originally taken to Bellevue for medical care and was returned to the West Facility, a Rikers Island jail in Queens, when the treatment was completed.\n\nThe West Facility houses 140 specially air-controlled housing units for inmates with contagious diseases such as tuberculosis, according to a city website, though the jail has reportedly also been used for inmates that need to be isolated from the general jail population for other reasons.\n\nCraig Rothfeld, a jail consultant working with Weinstein attorneys, responded to an email sent to a Weinstein lawyer by saying the decision to return Weinstein to Rikers was made by medical staff \"who are more than qualified to make these medical decisions.\"\n\nHe said there are no more updates to provide regarding Weinstein's health, and all of his health conditions continue to be closely monitored by city jail and health officials.\n\n\"We have every confidence in their decision-making ability regarding Mr. Weinstein's safety and well-being and are grateful for their continued communication,\" Rothfeld said.\n\nEngelmeyer said Weinstein had been treated at the hospital for pneumonia, a recurring issue related to his heart troubles, along with his other medical issues, including diabetes.\n\n\"He appreciates the care he was getting in Bellevue,\" he said.\n\nEngelmeyer said Weinstein was \"disappointed\" at his return to Rikers and was \"uncomfortable\" there, where the spokesperson described Weinstein's housing as \"more like an infirmary.\"\n\nHe said Weinstein was regularly speaking by phone with his lawyers when he was at the hospital as other inmates awaiting trial are allowed to do.\n\n\"He didn't get any treatment different from others. He wasn't talking to his friends and buddies and having a good time,\" Engelmeyer said.\n\nEngelmeyer said Weinstein gained some \"relief and hope\" from the appeals ruling, but he knows he faces a long prison term from the California case and an appeal of that conviction won't be heard for another year.\n\n\"His spirits are up, but he also knows he has a long, long trip ahead of him,\" Engelmeyer said. \"He knows that he won't be getting out soon.", "source": {"uri": "aol.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Aol"}, "authors": [{"uri": "larry_neumeister@aol.com", "name": "Larry

He spends most of his day watching CNN and other television programs and talking in person or on the phone to Arthur Aidala, the attorney handling his appeal.\n\nThe disgraced movie mogul was moved to the Manhattan public hospital hours after he was brought back to Rikers Island on April 27 when an appeals court tossed his 2020 rape conviction.\n\nWeinstein, 72, was transferred to the hospital following complaints of chest pain, according to a jail source familiar with his case.\n\nHe has since been diagnosed with pneumonia, and his legal team says he's dealing with a host of other serious medical conditions such as constant chest and abdominal pain.\n\n\"He's a sick man,\" Weinstein attorney Donna Rotunno told the City. \"Harvey has multiple health issues and he's never gotten the level of care that he received prior to going into custody.\"\n\nA former therapist who worked on Rikers questioned why Weinstein has remained in the ICU for so long and said he is capable of shaving, showering, and moving out of bed.\n\n\"He's not supposed to be there,\" said the clinician, who asked to remain anonymous. \"It's special treatment.\"\n\nThe city's correctional health services, which oversees medical care for incarcerated people, did not respond to a request seeking comment.\n\nJail officials briefly tried to move Weinstein to the 19th floor unit last week but he was sent back to his room in the ICU, according to the jail sources.\n\nThe former Hollywood powerbroker is also being watched by four correction officers from the department's emergency service unit.\n\nA former top jail official questioned why he was being watched by four ESU officers.\n\n\"Does he need ESU? No. Could two regular officers watch him? Probably. He's certainly not an escape risk,\" said Martin Horn, who served as commissioner of the probation and correction departments during the Bloomberg administration.\n\nMost high-profile detainees are housed in the department's west facility on Rikers. The jail was originally built to house people with contagious diseases. It is largely empty and detainees placed there, such as former Trump Organization CFO Allen Weisselberg, are typically given their own cells - away from other people locked up.\n\nThe city department of correction has long struggled to properly treat incarcerated people with complex medical needs. Most are treated at medical clinics located in each of the 10 jail facilities on Rikers.\n\nThe board of correction, the city jails' oversight body, has repeatedly cited missed medical visits as a key factor in deaths behind bars since Mayor Eric Adams took over in January 2022.\n\nMost recently, on Friday, the board found that a Rikers detainee who died behind bars earlier this year was without a mattress for 18 hours and only got one outside recreation session in 15 days before he was found unresponsive in his cell.\n\nManuel Luna, 30, was also not brought to a medical clinic to receive methadone eight times from 25 October through 12 January, according to the board of correction.\n\nLuna, who was facing charges of stealing an e-bike, was found unresponsive inside his cell in the George R Vierno center on 19 January. Known as Panda to his friends, he was moved to that new housing area shortly before his death, the Daily News reported.\n\nThe city medical examiner has not determined the cause of the death.\n\nLuna was a \"loving person\" who \"always loved to make people laugh,\" his brother, Angel Luna, told the City.\n\nIn jail, he and others are \"not being treated like human beings,\" he said.\n\n\"If you can't keep people alive, then close the jail down,\" he added. \"If a bakery can't make bread, you close shop. The same for these jails. You can't keep holding people there. They're killing people, and they're going to keep killing people. There is a trail of bodies left behind by the negligence and abuse.\"\n\nThe department of correction did not immediately respond to an email seeking comment.\n\nWeinstein's situation is not totally different from those of other detainees in the hospital.\n\nWeinstein can eat only hospital food and must wear sweats issued by the jail. He was forced to remove a Yankees baseball hat and sweatshirt, according to one of the jail sources.\n\nHis visitors also must first go to the 19th floor to be screened and searched before they are allowed to meet him, the jail insiders said.\n\nBut it is still more convenient than the hours-long screening process that takes place on Rikers.\n\nUntil last month, Weinstein was incarcerated at the Mohawk correctional facility, about 100 miles north-west of Albany. He was moved back to city custody after New York's highest court vacated his conviction, ruling that a trial judge unfairly allowed jurors to see and hear evidence that was not directly related to the charges.\n\nThe decision tossed his 23-year prison sentence and called for a retrial.\n\nWeinstein remains in prison because in 2022 he was convicted of another rape in Los Angeles. He was sentenced to 16 years in prison in that case.", "source": {"uri": "theguardian.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Guardian"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

Engelmeyer said he'd been housed on the floor for inmates where everyone has access to a room with phones and a television room.\n\n\"He's been moved back to Rikers largely due to pressure, I believe, due to pressure because of the news about what somebody thought was VIP treatment,\" he said.\n\nWeinstein was brought to Bellevue Hospital only hours after he was transferred on April 26 from the Mohawk Correctional Facility, about 100 miles (160 kilometers) northwest of Albany, to Rikers less than a day after the New York Court of Appeals vacated his conviction.\n\nThe appeals court ruled that a Manhattan trial judge permitted jurors to see and hear too much evidence not directly related to the charges he faced, and it ordered a new trial, negating his 23-year prison sentence. However, he remained jailed because he was convicted in Los Angeles in 2022 of another rape and was sentenced to 16 years in prison.\n\nWhile prosecutors have asked for a September retrial on charges that he forcibly performed oral sex on a TV and film production assistant in 2006 and raped an aspiring actor in 2013, it was unclear if key trial witnesses would return for a new trial. Weinstein has disputed the allegations.\n\nFrank Dwyer, a New York City Department of Correction spokesperson, said Weinstein was originally taken to Bellevue for medical care and was returned to the West Facility, a Rikers Island jail in Queens, when the treatment was completed.\n\nThe West Facility houses 140 specially air-controlled housing units for inmates with contagious diseases such as tuberculosis, according to a city website, though the jail has reportedly also been used for inmates that need to be isolated from the general jail population for other reasons.\n\nCraig Rothfeld, a jail consultant working with Weinstein attorneys, responded to an email sent to a Weinstein lawyer by saying the decision to return Weinstein to Rikers was made by medical staff \"who are more than qualified to make these medical decisions.\"\n\nHe said there are no more updates to provide regarding Weinstein's health, and all of his health conditions continue to be closely monitored by city jail and health officials.\n\n\"We have every confidence in their decision-making ability regarding Mr. Weinstein's safety and well-being and are grateful for their continued communication,\" Rothfeld said.\n\nEngelmeyer said Weinstein had been treated at the hospital for pneumonia, a recurring issue related to his heart troubles, along with his other medical issues, including diabetes.\n\n\"He appreciates the care he was getting in Bellevue,\" he said.\n\nEngelmeyer said Weinstein was \"disappointed\" at his return to Rikers and was \"uncomfortable\" there, where the spokesperson described Weinstein's housing as \"more like an infirmary.\"\n\nHe said Weinstein was regularly speaking by phone with his lawyers when he was at the hospital as other inmates awaiting trial are allowed to do.\n\n\"He didn't get any treatment different from others. He wasn't talking to his friends and buddies and having a good time,\" Engelmeyer said.\n\nEngelmeyer said Weinstein gained some \"relief and hope\" from the appeals ruling, but he knows he faces a long prison term from the California case and an appeal of that conviction won't be heard for another year.\n\n\"His spirits are up, but he also knows he has a long, long trip ahead of him,\" Engelmeyer said. \"He knows that he won't be getting out soon.\n\nCopyright 2024 The Associated Press.

Sign up to get the latest New York City news delivered to you each morning.\"\n\nHarvey Weinstein is being kept in a private room inside Bellevue Hospital's Intensive Care Unit on a floor away from all other detainees, THE CITY has learned.\n\nAlmost all city detainees with serious medical issues are kept inside the Department of Correction's medical unit on the 19th floor.\n\nBut Weinstein currently has his own phone, bathroom, and television -- a perk few, if any, other city detainees are afforded -- in a different location in the hospital. He spends most of his day watching CNN and other television programs and talking in person or on the phone to Arthur Aidala, the attorney handling his appeal.\n\nThe disgraced movie mogul was moved to the Manhattan public hospital hours after he was brought back to Rikers Island on April 27 when an appeals court tossed his 2020 rape conviction.\n\nWeinstein, 72, was transferred to the hospital following complaints of chest pain, according to a jail source familiar with his case.\n\nHe has since been diagnosed with pneumonia, and his legal team says he's dealing with a host of other serious medical conditions like constant chest and abdominal pain, another jail insider said.\n\n\"He's a sick man,\" Weinstein attorney Donna Rotunno told THE CITY. \"Harvey has multiple health issues and he's never gotten the level of care that he received prior to going into custody.\"\n\nA former therapist who worked on Rikers questioned why Weinstein has remained in the ICU for so long, noting he's capable of shaving, showering, and moving out of bed.\n\n\"He's not supposed to be there,\" said the clinician who asked to remain anonymous. \"It's special treatment.\"\n\nThe city's Correctional Health Services, which oversees medical care for incarcerated people, did not respond to a request seeking comment.\n\nJail officials briefly tried to move Weinstein to the 19th floor unit last week but he was sent back to his room in the ICU, according to the jail sources.\n\nThe former Hollywood powerbroker is also being watched by four correction officers from the department's Emergency Service Unit.\n\nA former top jail official questioned why he was being watched by four ESU officers.\n\n\"Does he need ESU? No. Could two regular officers watch him? Probably. He's certainly not an escape risk,\" said Martin Horn, who served as commissioner of the probation and correction departments during the Bloomberg administration.\n\nMost high-profile detainees are housed in the department's West Facility on Rikers. The jail was originally built to house people with contagious diseases. It is largely empty and detainees placed there, like former Trump Organization CFO Allen Weisselberg, are typically given their own cells -- away from other people locked up.\n\nThe city Department of Correction has long struggled to properly treat incarcerated people with complex medical needs. Most are treated at medical clinics located in each of the 10 jail facilities on Rikers.\n\nThe Board of Correction, the city jails' oversight body, has repeatedly cited missed medical visits as a key factor in deaths behind bars since Mayor Eric Adams took over in January 2022.\n\nMost recently, on Friday, the board found that a Rikers detainee who died behind bars earlier this year was without a mattress for 18 hours and only got one outside recreation session in 15 days before he was found unresponsive in his cell.\n\nManuel Luna, 30, was also not brought to a medical clinic to receive methadone eight times from Oct. 25, 2023, through Jan. 12, 2024, according to the Board of Correction.\n\nLuna, who was facing charges of stealing an e-bike, was found unresponsive inside his cell in the George R. Vierno Center on Jan. 19. Known as Panda to his friends, he was moved to that new housing area shortly before his death, the Daily News reported.\n\nThe city Medical Examiner has not determined the cause of the death.\n\nLuna was a \"loving person\" who \"always loved to make people laugh,\" his brother, Angel Luna, told THE CITY.\n\nIn jail, he and others are \"not being treated like human beings,\" he said.\n\n\"If you can't keep people alive, then close the jail down,\" he added. \"If a bakery can't make bread, you close shop. The same for these jails. You can't keep holding people there. They're killing people, and they're going to keep killing people. There is a trail of bodies left behind by the negligence and abuse.\"\n\nThe Department of Correction did not immediately respond to an email seeking comment.\n\nWeinstein's situation isn't totally different from those of other detainees in the hospital.\n\nThe former movie mogul can eat only hospital food and must wear sweats issued by the jail. He was forced to remove a Yankees baseball hat and sweatshirt, according to one of the jail sources.\n\nHis visitors also must first go to the 19th floor to be screened and searched before they are allowed to meet him, the jail insiders said.\n\nBut it is still more convenient than the hours-long screening process that takes place on Rikers.\n\nUntil last month, Weinstein was incarcerated at the Mohawk Correctional Facility, about 100 miles northwest of Albany. He was moved back to city custody after New York's highest court vacated his conviction, ruling that a trial judge unfairly allowed jurors to see and hear evidence that was not directly related to the charges.\n\nThe decision tossed his 23-year prison sentence and called for a retrial.\n\nWeinstein remains in prison because in 2022 he was convicted of another rape in Los Angeles. He was sentenced to 16 years in prison in that case.", "source": {"uri": "yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

Engelmeyer stated that this decision came in response to allegations in a published report suggesting Weinstein received privileged treatment during his 10-day hospital stay.\n\nWeinstein was moved from Bellevue Hospital in Manhattan to an infirmary within Rikers Island late Monday. This relocation followed claims by The City, a nonprofit news outlet, that Weinstein was given special accommodations, including a private room with amenities like a television, phone, and bathroom, instead of being housed in the standard inmate area.\n\nEngelmeyer contested these allegations, asserting that Weinstein did not receive VIP treatment and was not accommodated in a hospital suite. According to Engelmeyer, Weinstein stayed on the inmate floor, where all individuals have access to basic amenities like phones and a television room. Engelmeyer suggested that Weinstein's return to Rikers was primarily due to public pressure stemming from the news report about alleged preferential treatment.\n\nWeinstein had been transferred to Bellevue Hospital on April 26 from Mohawk Correctional Facility, shortly after his conviction was overturned by the New York Court of Appeals due to procedural errors during his trial. Despite this, Weinstein remained in custody due to a separate conviction in Los Angeles. Prosecutors are seeking a retrial in September for charges related to sexual assault allegations against Weinstein, although it's uncertain if key witnesses will participate.\n\nFrank Dwyer, a spokesperson for the New York City Department of Correction, clarified that Weinstein was initially hospitalized for medical treatment and was returned to Rikers Island upon completion. Weinstein's health conditions, including pneumonia and heart issues, were monitored during his hospitalization.\n\nWeinstein's publicist expressed his disappointment at returning to Rikers and described his accommodation there as more akin to an infirmary.

York court following hospital stay", "body": "Harvey Weinstein was expected in a New York City courtroom on Thursday as authorities consider California's extradition request to serve his pending sentence for a 2022 rape conviction in Los Angeles.\n\nThe 16-year sentence Weinstein received in 2023 for raping a woman at a 2013 Los Angeles film festival had been on ice while he served time behind bars in New York after being found guilty of rape in Manhattan in 2020.\n\nBut the New York conviction was overturned late last month, negating its 23-year sentence.\n\nWeinstein\u00b4s 2020 rape conviction was overturned by an appeals court (Steven Hirsch/New York Post via AP, Pool)\n\nThe hearing in Queens criminal court on Thursday morning, days after Weinstein left a city hospital, is related to California's request, according to prosecutors and defence attorneys.\n\nThe 72-year-old has nevertheless remained in New York custody while Manhattan's district attorney works to retry him.\n\nAt a hearing last week, prosecutors said they could be ready as soon as September, and that at least one of two alleged victims was willing to testify again.\n\nIn that case, the once-powerful former movie mogul is accused of raping an aspiring actor in 2013 and sexually assaulting a TV and film production assistant in 2006.\n\nHe denies the charges.\n\nNew York\u00b4s highest court found that the trial judge prejudiced Weinstein with improper rulings, including by letting other women testify about allegations he wasn\u00b4t charged with (Etienne Laurent/Pool Photo via AP, File)\n\nIn vacating the conviction, New York's highest court found that the trial judge prejudiced Weinstein with improper rulings, including by letting other women testify about allegations he wasn't charged with.\n\nThe 2020 conviction was heralded at the time as a milestone in the #MeToo movement, an era that began in 2017 with a flood of allegations against Weinstein.\n\nWeinstein was sent to serve his sentence in an upstate New York state prison.\n\nAfter being transferred to city custody following the appeals court decision, he was sent to Manhattan's Bellevue Hospital, where his publicist says he was treated for pneumonia and other medical issues.\n\nHe was moved to the city's Rikers Island jail complex on Monday.", "source": {"uri": "dailymail.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "Daily Mail

This privilege is not typically extended to most city detainees with serious health conditions. Unlike other detainees, Weinstein has access to his own phone, bathroom, and television, reported the City. His days are primarily spent watching TV shows and discussing legal matters with his appeal attorney, Arthur Aidala.\n\nPreviously held at Mohawk correctional facility, Weinstein was transferred back into city custody after New York's highest court overturned his 23-year prison sentence. The court ruled that a trial judge had unjustly permitted jurors access to evidence not directly related to the charges against him. Despite this ruling necessitating a retrial, Weinstein continues to serve time due to another rape conviction in Los Angeles in 2022 for which he received a 16-year sentence.\n\nWeinstein was moved to Bellevue Hospital in Manhattan after reporting chest discomfort. The 72-year-old former Hollywood heavyweight has since been diagnosed with pneumonia and is reportedly dealing with other severe health issues, including persistent chest and abdominal pain. \"Harvey has multiple health issues and he's never gotten the level of care that he received prior to going into custody,\" his attorney, Donna Rotunno, told the City.\n\nDespite being able to shave, shower, and move out of bed independently, Weinstein continues to stay in the ICU. A clinician previously working at Rikers Island Correctional Facility questioned his extended stay in the unit. \"He's not supposed to be there. It's special treatment,\" the clinician stated. Despite attempts by jail officials last week to relocate him to the 19th-floor unit, Weinstein was returned to his private room in the ICU.\n\nWeinstein is constantly monitored by four correction officers from the department's emergency service unit (ESU). Martin Horn, a former high-ranking jail official during NYC Mayor Michael Bloomberg's administration, questioned this arrangement. \"Does he need ESU? No. Could two regular officers watch him? Probably. He's certainly not an escape risk,\" Horn stated. Despite his private accommodations, Weinstein must comply with certain regulations such as consuming only hospital-provided meals and wearing jail-issued sweatsuits.", "source": {"uri": "newsbytesapp.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "NewsBytes"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harvey_Weinstein", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Harvey Weinstein"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_Court_of_Appeals", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "New York Court of Appeals"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mohawk_people", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Mohawk people"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intensive_care_unit", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Intensive care unit"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prison", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Prison"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lawyer", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Lawyer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bellevue,_Washington", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Bellevue, Washington"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Bellevue, Washington"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hollywood,_Los_Angeles", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Hollywood, Los Angeles"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bellevue_Hospital", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Bellevue Hospital"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chest_pain", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Chest pain"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jury", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Jury"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pneumonia", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Pneumonia"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abdomen", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Abdomen"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rape", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Rape"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los_Angeles", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manhattan", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Manhattan"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Manhattan"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Martin_Horn_(politician)", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Martin Horn (politician)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emergency_Service_Unit", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Emergency Service Unit"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mayor_of_New_York_City", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Mayor of New York City"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Bloomberg", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Michael Bloomberg"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rikers_Island", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Rikers Island"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Rikers Island"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/End-of-Life", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/End-of-Life", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Crime_and_Justice", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Crime and Justice", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Job-Related", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Job-Related", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://i.cdn.newsbytesapp.com/images/l69920240507115419.jpeg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9546929", "eventUri": "eng-9546929", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.1529411764705882, "wgt": 205, "relevance": 1}

But the Empire State conviction was overturned late last month, negating its 23-year sentence.\n\nThe hearing in Queens criminal court on Thursday morning, days after Weinstein left a city hospital, is related to California's request, according to prosecutors and defense attorneys.\n\nThe 72-year-old has nevertheless remained in New York custody while Manhattan's district attorney works to retry him. At a hearing last week, prosecutors said they could be ready as soon as September, and that at least one of two alleged victims was willing to testify again.\n\nIn that case, the once powerful former movie mogul is accused of raping an aspiring actor in 2013 and sexually assaulting a TV and film production assistant in 2006. He denies the charges.\n\nIn vacating the conviction, New York's highest court found that the trial judge prejudiced Weinstein with improper rulings, including by letting other women testify about allegations he wasn't charged with.\n\nThe 2020 conviction was heralded at the time as a milestone in the #MeToo movement, an era that began in 2017 with a flood of allegations against Weinstein.\n\nWeinstein was sent to serve his sentence in an upstate New York state prison. After being transferred to city custody following the appeals court decision, he was sent to Manhattan's Bellevue Hospital, where his publicist says he was treated for pneumonia and other medical issues.

(Steven Hirsch/New York Post via AP, File)NEW YORK (AP) - One-time movie mogul Harvey Weinstein was returned to a New York City jail in what his publicist said Tuesday was the result from a published report claiming he was getting VIP treatment during his 10-day stay at a hospital. The publicist, Juda Engelmeyer, said Weinstein was moved late Monday from Bellevue Hospital in Manhattan to an infirmary at the city's Rikers Island jail complex. The move came hours after The City, a nonprofit news outlet, reported that Weinstein was housed in a private room in the hospital's intensive care unit with a television, phone and a bathroom rather than a separate floor where inmates normally reside. Engelmeyer disputed the account, saying Weinstein \"wasn't getting preferential or VIP treatment\"\u009d and wasn't housed in what could be characterized as a hospital suite. Engelmeyer said he'd been housed on the floor for inmates where everyone has access to a room with phones and a television room. \"He's been moved back to Rikers largely due to pressure, I believe, due to pressure because of the news about what somebody thought was VIP treatment,\"\u009d he said. Weinstein was brought to Bellevue Hospital only hours after he was transferred on April 26 from the Mohawk Correctional Facility, about 100 miles (160 kilometers) northwest of Albany, to Rikers less than a day after the New York Court of Appeals vacated his conviction. The appeals court ruled that a Manhattan trial judge permitted jurors to see and hear too much evidence not directly related to the charges he faced, and it ordered a new trial, negating his 23-year prison sentence. However, he remained jailed because he was convicted in Los Angeles in 2022 of another rape and was sentenced to 16 years in prison. While prosecutors have asked for a September retrial on charges that he forcibly performed oral sex on a TV and film production assistant in 2006 and raped an aspiring actor in 2013, it was unclear if key trial witnesses would return for a new trial. Weinstein has disputed the allegations. Frank Dwyer, a New York City Department of Correction spokesperson, said Weinstein was originally taken to Bellevue for medical care and was returned to the West Facility, a Rikers Island jail in Queens, when the treatment was completed. The West Facility houses 140 specially air-controlled housing units for inmates with contagious diseases such as tuberculosis, according to a city website, though the jail has reportedly also been used for inmates that need to be isolated from the general jail population for other reasons. Craig Rothfeld, a jail consultant working with Weinstein attorneys, responded to an email sent to a Weinstein lawyer by saying the decision to return Weinstein to Rikers was made by medical staff \"who are more than qualified to make these medical decisions.\"\u009d He said there are no more updates to provide regarding Weinstein's health, and all of his health conditions continue to be closely monitored by city jail and health officials. \"We have every confidence in their decision-making ability regarding Mr. Weinstein's safety and well-being and are grateful for their continued communication,\"\u009d Rothfeld said. Engelmeyer said Weinstein had been treated at the hospital for pneumonia, a recurring issue related to his heart troubles, along with his other medical issues, including diabetes. \"He appreciates the care he was getting in Bellevue,\"\u009d he said. Engelmeyer said Weinstein was \"disappointed\"\u009d at his return to Rikers and was \"uncomfortable\"\u009d there, where the spokesperson described Weinstein's housing as \"more like an infirmary.\"\u009d He said Weinstein was regularly speaking by phone with his lawyers when he was at the hospital as other inmates awaiting trial are allowed to do. \"He didn't get any treatment different from others. He wasn't talking to his friends and buddies and having a good time,\"\u009d Engelmeyer said. Engelmeyer said Weinstein gained some \"relief and hope\"\u009d from the appeals ruling, but he knows he faces a long prison term from the California case and an appeal of that conviction won't be heard for another year. \"His spirits are up, but he also knows he has a long, long trip ahead of him,\"\u009d Engelmeyer said. \"He knows that he won't be getting out soon.", "source": {"uri":

He has real medical issues. The care is much better at Bellevue than Rikers.\"\n\n\"He's a detainee but he should be considered as if he never had a trial here and they are treating him like a hardened criminal,\" the source said, adding that Weinstein was unhappy about the transfer.\n\nThe New York Court of Appeals on April 25 reversed Weinstein's conviction and 23-year sentence for rape and criminal sex act, finding that the trial judge made a series of bad calls during trial that deprived the ex-Miramax honcho from getting a fair shake.\n\nThe Manhattan District Attorney's Office has said it plans to retry Weinstein which could go forward as early as the fall.\n\nWeinstein is not eligible to be released on bail as he was separately sentenced in 2023 to 16 years in prison in Los Angeles for raping an

Engelmayer said the transfer was unwarranted because Weinstein's \"medical issues were being handled properly and he needs the care.\"\n\nConvicted in 2020 and sentenced to 23 years, Weinstein scored a court victory last month when an appeals court threw out the guilty verdict, finding the court should not have allowed some witnesses to testify.\n\nHe had been held at a state prison in upstate New York but after the decision was moved to Rikers, where detainees awaiting trial are held. He was transferred to Bellevue with complaints of chest pain on April 27 and reportedly has since been diagnosed with pneumonia. Engelmayer said that Weinstein has a heart condition, spinal issues, and \"a long list of concerns.\"\n\n\"Harvey said 'The care at Bellevue was excellent and I appreciate the care that was given,'\" Engelmayer said, adding that the prison \"will do the best they can, but the services and capabilities at Rikers are more limited, and his medical needs are serious.\"\n\nThe transfer comes after the news site The City reported on Monday that Weinstein was being held on a Bellevue floor separate from other detainees -- and was enjoying a private room, bathroom phone, and television. The outlet reported that the 72-year-old was spending his days watching CNN, talking on the phone, and speaking in person to his lawyer.\n\nCiting sources, the New York Post reported that The City's article \"set off\" officials in the city Department of Corrections, who immediately began \"contemplating how to move him and when to move him quickly.\"\n\nEngelmayer pushed back on reports that Weinstein was getting special treatment, stating that he was getting \"standard\" medical care for \"someone facing trial.\"\n\n\"Bellevue is just set up differently,\" he added. \"The room with the phone is a smaller space, there are fewer inmates and so, it often could have looked like he had it to himself.\n\n\"Someone must have complained, but it's not a private room, just empty most of the time.\"", "source": {"uri": "thedailybeast.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Daily Beast"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harvey_Weinstein", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Harvey Weinstein"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bellevue,_Washington", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Bellevue, Washington"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Bellevue, Washington"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hollywood,_Los_Angeles", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Hollywood, Los Angeles"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Daily_Beast", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "The Daily Beast"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intensive_care_unit", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Intensive care unit"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rape", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Rape"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lawyer", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Lawyer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hospital", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Hospital"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rikers_Island", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Rikers Island"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Rikers Island"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Upstate_New_York", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Upstate New York"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pneumonia", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Pneumonia"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Corrections", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Corrections"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_Post", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "New York Post"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CNN", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "CNN"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/End-of-Life", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/End-of-Life", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Crime_and_Justice", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Crime and Justice", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Murder", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Murder", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Prisons", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Prisons", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 58}], "image": "https://img.thedailybeast.com/image/upload/c_crop,d_placeholder_euli9k,h_1688,w_3000,x_0,y_0/dpr_2.0/c_limit,w_740/fl_lossy,q_auto/v1715100555/GettyImages-2150463212_nllz42", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9546929", "eventUri": "eng-9546929", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-04-27", "textStart": 1118, "textEnd": 1126}], "sentiment": -0.1372549019607843, "wgt": 198, "relevance": 1}

Engelmeyer said he'd been housed on the floor for inmates where everyone has access to a room with phones and a television room.\n\nPeople are also reading...

However, he remained jailed because he was convicted in Los Angeles in 2022 of another rape and was sentenced to 16 years in prison.\n\nWhile prosecutors have asked for a September retrial on charges that he forcibly performed oral sex on a TV and film production assistant in 2006 and raped an aspiring actor in 2013, it was unclear if key trial witnesses would return for a new trial. Weinstein has disputed the allegations.\n\nFrank Dwyer, a New York City Department of Correction spokesperson, said Weinstein was originally taken to Bellevue for medical care and was returned to the West Facility, a Rikers Island jail in Queens, when the treatment was completed.\n\nListen now and subscribe: Apple Podcasts | Google Podcasts | Spotify | YouTube | RSS Feed | SoundStack | All Of Our Podcasts\n\nThe West Facility houses 140 specially air-controlled housing units for inmates with contagious diseases such as tuberculosis, according to a city website, though the jail has reportedly also been used for inmates that need to be isolated from the general jail population for other reasons.\n\nCraig Rothfeld, a jail consultant working with Weinstein attorneys, responded to an email sent to a Weinstein lawyer by saying the decision to return Weinstein to Rikers was made by medical staff \"who are more than qualified to make these medical decisions.\"\n\nHe said there are no more updates to provide regarding Weinstein's health, and all of his health conditions continue to be closely monitored by city jail and health officials.\n\n\"We have every confidence in their decision-making ability regarding Mr. Weinstein's safety and well-being and are grateful for their continued communication,\" Rothfeld said.\n\nEngelmeyer said Weinstein had been treated at the hospital for pneumonia, a recurring issue related to his heart troubles, along with his other medical issues, including diabetes.\n\n\"He appreciates the care he was getting in Bellevue,\" he said.\n\nEngelmeyer said Weinstein was \"disappointed\" at his return to Rikers and was \"uncomfortable\" there, where the spokesperson described Weinstein's housing as \"more like an infirmary.\"\n\nHe said Weinstein was regularly speaking by phone with his lawyers when he was at the hospital as other inmates awaiting trial are allowed to do.\n\n\"He didn't get any treatment different from others. He wasn't talking to his friends and buddies and having a good time,\" Engelmeyer said.\n\nEngelmeyer said Weinstein gained some \"relief and hope\" from the appeals ruling, but he knows he faces a long prison term from the California case and an appeal of that conviction won't be heard for another year.\n\n\"His spirits are up, but he also knows he has a long, long trip ahead of him,\" Engelmeyer said. \"He knows that he won't be getting out soon.\n\nCopyright 2024 The Associated Press.

And I think it's also worth noting that since the day he was incarcerated, he has been in a hospital setting.\"\n\nSamson also noted that California is \"not in a position to extradite Mr. Weinstein because they have not done what they need to do.\"\n\nFor now, Weinstein will remain locked up in New York as a court works out whether he should stay in a city jail while he awaits his retrial or be sent back to California to continue serving a prison sentence.\n\nHis next appearance in this matter is set for Aug. 7.\n\nCalifornia has requested Weinstein be extradited to begin serving his 16-year sentence due to the appeals court overturning the entertainment mogul's New York conviction.\n\nWeinstein has not served any of the 16-year sentence he was given after being found guilty in California on charges separate from the New York overturned conviction. Weinstein was found guilty of rape, forced oral copulation and another sexual misconduct count involving a woman known as Jane Doe 1 in California. His legal team has vowed to appeal the conviction.\n\nWeinstein was sentenced to 23 years in prison after being convicted in February 2020 of forcing oral sex on TV and film production assistant Mimi Haley in 2006 and third-degree rape of hairstylist Jessica Mann in 2013.\n\nHe was acquitted of first-degree rape and two counts of predatory sexual assault from actor Annabella Sciorra's allegations of rape in the 1990s. Weinstein has denied ever engaging in non-consensual sex.\n\nA New York appeals court overturned Weinstein's 2020 rape conviction, ordering a new trial in a stunning reversal of a landmark #MeToo case.\n\nIn a 4-3 decision, the court found that Weinstein's trial judge allowed prosecutors to call women who said Weinstein had assaulted them to testify, even though their accusations did not specifically relate to the entertainment mogul's charges.\n\nThe 72-year-old film producer will be retried on the New York charges. Last week prosecutors claimed they would be ready to re-try Weinstein as early as September.\n\n\"We will do everything in our power to retry this case, and remain steadfast in our commitment to survivors of sexual assault,\" a spokesperson for the Manhattan DA previously told Fox News Digital.\n\nWeinstein will return to court May 29 for a discovery hearing related to the new trial.\n\nFox News' Jennifer Johnson and The Associated Press contributed to this report.", "source": {"uri": "foxla.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "FOX 11 Los Angeles"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extradition", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Extradition"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/California", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "California"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "California"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_City", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "New York City"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "New York City"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rape", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Rape"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diana,_Princess_of_Wales", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Diana, Princess of Wales"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Doe", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "John Doe"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oral_sex", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Oral sex"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sexual_misconduct", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Sexual misconduct"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MeToo_movement", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "MeToo movement"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fox_News", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Fox News"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Annabella_Sciorra", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Annabella Sciorra"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_County_District_Attorney", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "New York County District Attorney"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acquittal", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Acquittal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Filmmaking", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Filmmaking"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sexual_assault", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Sexual assault"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Associated_Press", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Associated Press"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Film_producer", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Film producer"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/End-of-Life", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/End-of-Life", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Crime_and_Justice", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Crime and Justice", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Victims", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Victims", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Trials", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Trials", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 86}], "image": "https://images.foxtv.com/static.foxla.com/www.foxla.com/content/uploads/2022/06/1280/720/weinstein-court-02062020.jpg?ve=1&tl=1", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9546929", "eventUri": "eng-9546929", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "date": "-08-07", "textStart": 1109, "textEnd": 1115}, {"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-05-29", "textStart": 2863, "textEnd": 2869}, {"amb": false, "date": "2020-02-", "textStart": 1727, "textEnd": 1740}], "sentiment": 0.06666666666666665, "wgt": 196, "relevance": 1}

He spent his days talking to his legal team and watching CNN and other television programs.\n\nHe had been moved to the Bellevue almost immediately after he was brought to Rikers Island on April 27, when an state appeals court tossed his 2020 rape conviction.\n\nAt the time, Weinstein complained he was experiencing chest pain, according to a jail source, who noted the producer was also asking for a Pepsi.\n\nHis legal team says he's dealing with a host of other serious medical conditions like constant chest and abdominal pain.\n\n\"He's a sick man,\" Weinstein attorney Donna Rotunno told THE CITY on Monday. \"Harvey has multiple health issues and he's never gotten the level of care that he received prior to going into custody.\"\n\nBut after a series of tests medical staff at Bellevue concluded there was nothing serious enough to require hospital care, according to the Rikers source.\n\n\"The decision to discharge Mr. Weinstein from Bellevue Hospital and return him to Rikers Island was made by medical staff from New York City Health + Hospitals who are more than qualified to make these medical decisions,\" said Engelmayer.\n\nBack and Forth\n\nMost high-profile detainees held at Rikers are currently kept in s West Facility. That jail was opened in 1991 to house people with contagious diseases. Now it is largely empty and detainees placed there, like former Trump Organization CFO Allen Weisselberg, are typically given their own cells -- away from other people locked up.\n\nWeinstein was originally put in that area but was unhappy being on Rikers at all, according to the jail sources.\n\nFrank Dwyer, DOC's chief spokesperson, confirmed Weinstein was moved back to Rikers Monday night. He declined to comment further or explain why he was housed in the Bellevue ICU for days.\n\n\"Individuals in custody may require extended medical care which would necessitate staying at NYC Health + Hospitals/Bellevue,\" DOC spokesperson Annais Morales told THE CITY Monday.\n\nJeanette Merrill, a spokesperson for the city's Correctional Health Services, which oversees medical care for incarcerated people, said Monday that she can't \"discuss the care of any specific patient due to privacy laws.\"\n\n\"There is a forensic health general medicine unit at Bellevue,\" she added. \"However, if a patient requires a higher level of care, they can be treated in another medical unit in the hospital.\"\n\nWeinstein was previously incarcerated at the Mohawk Correctional Facility, about 100 miles northwest of Albany. He was transferred to city custody after New York's highest court vacated his conviction, ruling that a trial judge unfairly allowed jurors to see and hear evidence that was not directly related to the charges.\n\nThe decision tossed his 23-year prison sentence and called for a retrial.\n\nWeinstein remains behind bars because of a 2022 conviction for another rape in Los Angeles.

Here's the latest on his retrial.", "body": "NEW YORK -- Harvey Weinstein will remain jailed in New York City while the Manhattan district attorney works to retry his 2020 rape case that was thrown out last month.\n\nWeinstein appeared in court Thursday for an extradition hearing that lasted just minutes. He rejected an extradition request from California, and his next court date was set for August 7.\n\nThe 72-year-old had been serving a 23-year sentence in New York before the state's highest court overturned his conviction last month, ruling the judge should not have allowed other women to testify about allegations he was not charged with.\n\nNow that his New York conviction has been thrown out, California prosecutors want him extradited to serve a 16-year sentence for raping a woman at a 2013 Los Angeles film festival.\n\n\"According to the procedural rules here and in most states, a governor needs to sign such a warrant for extradition,\" defense attorney Diana Fabi Samson said Thursday. \"Our main concern is Mr. Weinstein is here in New York, so we can prepare for trial and that he get the medical care that he needs.\"\n\nWeinstein's lawyers say they also plan to appeal his conviction in California.\n\nA New York jury convicted Weinstein in 2020 on charges of forcibly performing a sex act on one woman and rape in the third degree for an attack on another woman. He was acquitted on charges of predatory sex assault and first degree rape.\n\nSix women testified against him during his trial, even though his charges only related to claims from three of them.\n\nThe New York Court of Appeals issued a 4-3 decision last month to overturn his conviction, saying \"the trial court erroneously admitted testimony of uncharged, alleged prior sexual acts.\" One judge wrote in a dissent the decision was \"endangering decades of progress in this incredibly complex and nuanced area of law\" regarding sex crimes.\n\nManhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg, who was not the district attorney during Weinstein's previous trial, has said he will retry the case. That retrial is expected some time in September.\n\nOnce last month's appeals court decision came down, Weinstein was transferred from a state prison in upstate New York to Rikers Island. He was then taken to Bellevue Hospital, where his attorney told CBS New York he received \"immediate medical attention.\"\n\n\"A myriad of tests are being performed on Harvey and he is being kept for observation,\" Weinstein's lawyer Arthur Aidala said in a statement at the time.\n\nAfter 10 days in the hospital, Weinstein returned to Rikers' infirmary Monday.\n\n\"He's holding up the best he can,\" Samson said Thursday.", "source": {"uri": "cbsnews.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "CBS News"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harvey_Weinstein", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Harvey Weinstein"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extradition", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Extradition"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rape", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Rape"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/California", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "California"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "California"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_City", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "New York City"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "New York City"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_County_District_Attorney", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "New York County District Attorney"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/State_supreme_court", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "State supreme court"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Criminal_defense_lawyer", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Criminal defense lawyer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Procedural_law", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Procedural law"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Governor_of_New_York", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Governor of New York"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acquittal", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Acquittal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los_Angeles", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alvin_Bragg", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Alvin Bragg"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_Court_of_Appeals", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "New York Court of Appeals"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WCBS-TV", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "WCBS-TV"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bellevue_Hospital", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Bellevue Hospital"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Upstate_New_York", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Upstate New York"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trial_court", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Trial court"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/District_attorney", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "District attorney"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lawyer", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Lawyer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rikers_Island", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Rikers Island"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Rikers Island"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Crime_and_Justice", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Crime and Justice", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Organized_Crime", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Organized Crime", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Trials", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Trials", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Law", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Law", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 56}], "image": "https://assets2.cbsnewsstatic.com/hub/i/r/2024/05/09/d896013b-cb12-4694-a752-6ab5a621e146/thumbnail/1200x630/55d56ffafb2c3b68882fd0293dbfffba/ap24130560603008.jpg?v=3a71db5e6dd1c027f95668a1c7b6fcaf", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9546929", "eventUri": "eng-9546929", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "date": "-08-07", "textStart": 348, "textEnd": 356}], "sentiment": -0.2470588235294118, "wgt": 186, "relevance": 1}

Weinstein will continue to be held in New York as the extradition process plays out. Weinstein, released from a city hospital days ago, showed up for the hearing in a wheelchair and wearing a dark suit.\n\nWeinstein's attorney said California first needs to produce a warrant.\n\n\"They are not in a position to extradite Mr. Weinstein because they have not done what they need to do,\" attorney Diana Fabi Samson said outside court.\n\nHis next appearance is set for Aug. 7.\n\nPeople are also reading...

But the Empire State conviction was overturned late last month, negating its 23-year sentence.\n\nThe 72-year-old has nevertheless remained in New York custody while Manhattan's district attorney works to retry him. At a hearing last week, prosecutors said they could be ready as soon as September, and that at least one of two alleged victims was willing to testify again.\n\nIn that case, the once powerful former movie executive is accused of raping an aspiring actor in 2013 and sexually assaulting a TV and film production assistant in 2006. He denies the charges.\n\nIn vacating the conviction, New York's highest court found that the trial judge prejudiced Weinstein with improper rulings, including by letting other women testify about allegations he wasn't charged with.\n\nThe 2020 conviction was heralded at the time as a milestone in the #MeToo movement, an era that began in 2017 with a flood of allegations against Weinstein.\n\nWeinstein was sent to serve his sentence in an upstate New York state prison. After being transferred to city custody following the appeals court decision, he was sent to Manhattan's Bellevue Hospital, where his publicist says he was treated for pneumonia and other medical issues. He was moved to the city's Rikers Island jail complex on Monday.\n\nCopyright 2024 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.

During Night Off From 'Daily Show'\n\nWhile the New York courts decide whether convicted rapist Harvey Weinstein should return to California while he awaits a retrial for his overturned 2020 conviction, the former movie mogul will remain jailed in the Empire State, it was decided on Thursday.\n\nThe courts must decide if Weinstein, who was previously convicted on rape charges in two separate trials in New York and California, should stay in a New York jail while he awaits the retrial in the former rape case, which has been planned to begin after Labor Day; his conviction was overturned on April 25 in a shock 4-3 decision by the New York State Court of Appeals. The second option for the courts is to ship the 72-year-old back to California, where he would begin serving his 16-year prison sentence, which came after a dramatic 2022 trial in L.A.\n\nWeinstein's team on Thursday denied his consent for an extradition request from California related to his second rape conviction during a brief court hearing, according to the Associated Press. Now, he will remain in New York as the extradition process plays out.\n\nThe former power player exited a New York hospital just days ago and appeared for Thursday's hearing in Queen's criminal court in a wheelchair while wearing a dark suit, the AP reports. The defense team's main concern is ensuring Weinstein needed medical care while he was in custody in New York, attorney Diana Fabi Samson told reporters outside of court.\n\n\"He's holding up the best he can,\" she said, describing Thursday's court proceedings as normal. She added that California first needs to produce a warrant signed by the governor.\n\n\"They are not in a position to extradite Mr. Weinstein because they have not done what they need to do,\" Samson said, according to the AP.\n\nFollowing his conviction, Weinstein had been sent to serve his sentence in an upstate New York state prison. He was then transferred to city custody following the appeals court decision. Following his recent release from Manhattan's Bellevue Hospital, he was moved to the city's Rikers Island jail complex on Monday.\n\nWeinstein's next N.Y. criminal court appearance in is scheduled for May 29, followed by an Aug. 7 appearance related to the L.A. case.", "source": {"uri": "hollywoodreporter.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Hollywood Reporter"}, "authors": [{"uri": "kevin_dolak@hollywoodreporter.com", "name": "Kevin Dolak", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_(state)", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "New York (state)"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harvey_Weinstein", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Harvey Weinstein"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rape", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Rape"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/California", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "California"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "California"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jon_Stewart", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Jon Stewart"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extradition", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Extradition"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jimmy_Kimmel_Live!", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Jimmy Kimmel Live!"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_Court_of_Appeals", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "New York Court of Appeals"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Labor_Day", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Labor Day"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bellevue_Hospital", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Bellevue Hospital"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diana,_Princess_of_Wales", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Diana, Princess of Wales"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Upstate_New_York", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Upstate New York"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Criminal_law", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Criminal law"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Associated_Press", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Associated Press"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lawyer", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Lawyer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Governor", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Governor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rikers_Island", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Rikers Island"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Rikers Island"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manhattan", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Manhattan"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Manhattan"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Crime_and_Justice", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Crime and Justice", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Organized_Crime", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Organized Crime", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Prisons", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Prisons", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Trials", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Trials", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 56}], "image": "https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/AP24130545277579-H-2024.jpg?w=1296", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9546929", "eventUri": "eng-9546929", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-04-25", "textStart": 636, "textEnd": 644}, {"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-05-29", "textStart": 2224, "textEnd": 2230}, {"amb": false, "date": "-08-07", "textStart": 2247, "textEnd": 2253}], "sentiment": -0.3176470588235294, "wgt": 178, "relevance": 1}

But the Empire State conviction was overturned late last month, negating its 23-year sentence.\n\nThe hearing in Queens criminal court on Thursday morning, days after Weinstein left a city hospital, was related to California's request, according to prosecutors and defense attorneys. Weinstein showed up for the hearing in a wheelchair, wearing a dark suit.\n\nPeople are also reading...

At a hearing last week, prosecutors said they could be ready as soon as September, and that at least one of two alleged victims was willing to testify again.\n\nIn that case, the once powerful former movie mogul is accused of raping an aspiring actor in 2013 and sexually assaulting a TV and film production assistant in 2006. He denies the charges.\n\nIn vacating the conviction, New York's highest court found that the trial judge prejudiced Weinstein with improper rulings, including by letting other women testify about allegations he wasn't charged with.\n\nThe 2020 conviction was heralded at the time as a milestone in the #MeToo movement, an era that began in 2017 with a flood of allegations against Weinstein.\n\nWeinstein was sent to serve his sentence in an upstate New York state prison. After being transferred to city custody following the appeals court decision, he was sent to Manhattan's Bellevue Hospital, where his publicist says he was treated for pneumonia and other medical issues. He was moved to the city's Rikers Island jail complex on Monday.\n\nCopyright 2024 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.

Weinstein's release from prison following the shock decision of a New York appeals court to overturn his 2020 rape and sexual assault conviction put the disgraced movie mogul's status in flux, as he is also facing a 16-year sentence on separate rape and sexual assault charges in California (he was originally set to begin the California sentence after completing the New York one).\n\nLast week, prosecutors stated their intention to pursue a retrial, and while a start date hasn't been announced yet, the trial is expected to begin in early September. A court will now decide whether Weinstein will spend the next few months in New York, or if he will be extradited to California for the time being.\n\nIt does appear that prosecutors and Weinstein's defense attorneys are in agreement about him remaining in New York. In court Thursday, Weinstein's lawyers said he did not want to be extradited, and, per The Daily News, prosecutors are also fighting an extradition request filed by California.\n\nSpeaking with reporters after the hearing, one of Weinstein's attorneys, Diana Fabi Samson, said California was \"not in a position to extradite Weinstein right now\" because the state first needed to produce a warrant signed by the governor.\n\n\"He's not a fugitive in the colloquial sense of the word -- that's just the language they use,\" Samson said. \"Our main concern is that Mr. Weinstein is here in New York so that we can prepare for the trial.\"\n\nWeinstein's next New York court appearance is scheduled for May 29, while an Aug. 7 appearance is scheduled in the California case.\n\nPrior to his New York conviction being overturned, Weinstein was being held in a prison in upstate New York; afterwards, he was sent to Bellevue Hospital in Manhattan, where he was reportedly being treated for pneumonia and other medical issues. He has since been moved to New York City's Rikers Island jail complex.", "source": {"uri": "rollingstone.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Rolling Stone"}, "authors": [{"uri": "jon_blistein@rollingstone.com", "name": "Jon Blistein", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_(state)", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "New York (state)"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harvey_Weinstein", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Harvey Weinstein"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extradition", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Extradition"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rape", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Rape"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/California", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "California"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "California"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sexual_assault", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Sexual assault"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Mulaney", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "John Mulaney"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weezer", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Weezer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_Daily_News", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "New York Daily News"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bellevue_Hospital", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Bellevue Hospital"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diana,_Princess_of_Wales", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Diana, Princess of Wales"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Upstate_New_York", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Upstate New York"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Governor_of_New_York", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Governor of New York"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pneumonia", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Pneumonia"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fugitive", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Fugitive"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Associated_Press", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Associated Press"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rikers_Island", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Rikers Island"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Rikers Island"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_City", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "New York City"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "New York City"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manhattan", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Manhattan"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Manhattan"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Crime_and_Justice", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Crime and Justice", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Organized_Crime", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Organized Crime", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Trials", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Trials", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 62}], "image": "https://www.rollingstone.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/AP24130560603008.jpg?w=1600&h=900&crop=1", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9546929", "eventUri": "eng-9546929", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-05-09", "textStart": 333, "textEnd": 338}, {"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-05-29", "textStart": 1886, "textEnd": 1892}, {"amb": false, "date": "-08-07", "textStart": 1903, "textEnd": 1909}], "sentiment": -0.01960784313725494, "wgt": 172, "relevance": 1}

But the Empire State conviction was overturned late last month, negating its 23-year sentence.\n\nThe hearing in Queens criminal court on Thursday morning, days after Weinstein left a city hospital, is related to California's request, according to prosecutors and defense attorneys.\n\nThe 72-year-old has nevertheless remained in New York custody while Manhattan's district attorney works to retry him. At a hearing last week, prosecutors said they could be ready as soon as September, and that at least one of two alleged victims was willing to testify again.\n\nIn that case, the once powerful former movie mogul is accused of raping an aspiring actor in 2013 and sexually assaulting a TV and film production assistant in 2006. He denies the charges.\n\nIn vacating the conviction, New York's highest court found that the trial judge prejudiced Weinstein with improper rulings, including by letting other women testify about allegations he wasn't charged with.\n\nThe 2020 conviction was heralded at the time as a milestone in the #MeToo movement, an era that began in 2017 with a flood of allegations against Weinstein.\n\nWeinstein was sent to serve his sentence in an upstate New York state prison. After being transferred to city custody following the appeals court decision, he was sent to Manhattan's Bellevue Hospital, where his publicist says he was treated for pneumonia and other medical issues. He was moved to the city's Rikers Island jail complex on Monday.\n\nHave a breaking news tip or an idea for a story we should cover? Send it to Eyewitness News using the form below.

You'll have it tomorrow.\"\n\nA governor's warrant must be sought for Weinstein's release to California.

Nicola Coughlan (NIK'-uh-lah COK'-lan), who plays Penelope, says the lead couples are different with every season, which changes the tone of the show. Part one of season three of \"Bridgerton\" will premiere on Netflix on May 16. The second part debuts June 13.\n\n\"The Neighborhood\" spawns new show starring Tracy Morgan\n\nLOS ANGELES (AP) - Tracy Morgan will star in a series set in the same neighborhood as the Cedric the Entertainer show \"The Neighborhood.\" \"Crutch\" will focus on Morgan's character, named Frank Crutchfield, who is a cousin to Cedric the Entertainer's \"Neighborhood\" character, Calvin Butler. The show's premise is that Crutch is an empty-nester until his two adult children move back home with their kids. The show will begin production later this year and run on Paramount Plus.", "source": {"uri": "register-herald.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Beckley Register-Herald"}, "authors": [{"uri": "associated_press@register-herald.com", "name": "Associated Press", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}, {"uri": "margie_szaroleta@register-herald.com", "name": "Margie Szaroleta", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harvey_Weinstein", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Harvey Weinstein"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_City", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "New York City"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "New York City"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bridgerton", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Bridgerton"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Associated_Press", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Associated Press"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Film_producer", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Film producer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rikers_Island", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Rikers Island"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Rikers Island"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luke_Newton", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Luke Newton"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nicola_Coughlan", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Nicola Coughlan"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bellevue_Hospital", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Bellevue Hospital"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Romance_novel", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Romance novel"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nonprofit_organization", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Nonprofit organization"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paramount+", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Paramount+"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Neighborhood_(TV_series)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "The Neighborhood (TV series)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cedric_the_Entertainer", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Cedric the Entertainer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tracy_Morgan", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Tracy Morgan"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Netflix", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Netflix"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Television", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Television", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "dmoz/Home/Moving_and_Relocating", "label": "dmoz/Home/Moving and Relocating", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Home/Moving_and_Relocating/Moving", "label": "dmoz/Home/Moving and Relocating/Moving", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Equestrian/Shows", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Equestrian/Shows", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Autos/Events_and_Shows", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Autos/Events and Shows", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 84}], "image": "https://bloximages.chicago2.vip.townnews.com/register-herald.com/content/tncms/custom/image/b87268c4-7873-11e7-af9a-f3a04545878a.jpg?resize=200%2C200", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9546929", "eventUri": "eng-9546929", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-05-16", "textStart": 1114, "textEnd": 1120}, {"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-06-13", "textStart": 1145, "textEnd": 1152}], "sentiment": 0.3176470588235294, "wgt": 147, "relevance": 1}

{"id": 231278116, "title": "2027: APC Chieftain Charges Nigerians To Remove APC, Tinubu From Power", "text": "ABUJA \u2013 As political parties prepare for the 2027 general elections, a Chieftain of the ruling All Progressives Congress (APC) and former National Vice Chairman North-west of the party, Dr. Salihu Lukman, has told Nigerians to form a popular democratically alternative platform to push President Bola Ahmed Tinubu and APC out of power. The APC Chieftain, who said President Tinubu has turned out to be a leader who is intolerant to those who could disagree with him, added that he is not committed to the democratic development of Nigeria. He said for an import defendant nation to withdraw subsidy and float the exchange of the Naira without any clear responsive policy plan to boost local production is simply decidedly anti-poor, adding that the government is taking the additional cost of subsidy without being able to admit that its decision to withdraw it has failed. According to him, the President Tinubu\u2019s government is living in denial, asking how long can it continue to deny that subsidy is back? He noted that many of the APC leaders, including former President Muhammadu Buhari and now President Asiwaju Tinubu, only agreed to come together for the purpose of grabbing power, which was not associated with the needed commitment to deliver services to address national challenges, adding, \u201csadly, with the mission to grab power, they \u2018promise (everything) and did nothing.\u201d Dr. Salihu Lukman, in a statement said: \u201cThe way and manner both former President Buhari and President Asiwaju Tinubu have managed affairs of the country without consulting party leadership and structures in the last nine years made a mockery of democracy. \u201cJust like we succeeded in pushing the military back to the barracks and defeating the PDP in 2015, it is possible to create a politically viable and truly popular democratically alternative platform that can put the APC in its rightful place and overcome the current extreme right-wing adventurously unplanned leadership of President Asiwaju Tinubu. The beauty of being a democracy is the freedom it offers to engage in political contest. \u201cPatriotic Nigerians must practically and loudly convey the right message to President Asiwaju Tinubu, the APC leadership and Nigerian politicians that our democracy must be transformed beyond the current ugly state of ceremonial elections, which ends up producing leaders who continue to act like emperors and dictators who rule the country worse that military governments. \u201cNigerians must be mobilised to rise above dishonest politicians who only manipulate their way to power and reduce to citizens to the status of conquered people. Democracy will be worthless if the result is only to elect civilian overlords. That can only be checked if we produce a functional political party, with committed leaders who submit themselves to processes of negotiations in all its ramifications, and agreements contracted that are binding and capable of regulating the conducts of elected representatives and governments produced at all levels. Nigerians are not conquered people! \u201cSomehow, developments of the last one year since the emergence of President Asiwaju Tinubu highlight the crisis of our democracy. As it is, there is no need to pretend, APC as a political party capable of aggregating the interest of Nigerians has been lost. \u201cPainfully, the APC is now implementing extreme right-wing policy and President Asiwaju Tinubu has turned out to be a leader who is intolerant to those who could disagree with him. If after one year, President Asiwaju Tinubu could succeed in shielding himself from being accessed by people who could tell him the hard truth, it is only logical to conclude that he is intolerant. Combined with the way and manner he subverts internal agreement to impose Dr. Abdullahi Umar Ganduje as the National Chairman of APC, it simply means that he is not committed to the democratic development of Nigeria. \u201cThe bigger calamity is that President Asiwaju Tinubu is turning out to be an extreme right-wing leader and not a liberal capitalist. The speed with which he declared that petroleum \u2018subsidy is gone\u2019 even before settling down as President and the inability to have a clear policy plan to cushion the effect for vulnerable Nigerians clearly highlighted the ideological leaning of President Asiwaju Tinubu. Combined with the policy of floating the exchange rate of the Naira against major international currency clearly defined the extreme right-wing credentials of the Tinubu administration. \u201cUnfortunately, all we have is grandstanding by the government so much so that they are now trapped back in the subsidy debate. The reality is, given the value of the Naira today, the landing cost of one litre of imported petroleum motor spirit is certainly more than N700. 2027: APC Chieftain Charges Nigerians To Remove APC, Tinubu From Power\u2026.Says Tinubu Not Committed To Democratic Development Of Nigeria\u2026 Can\u2019t Tolerate Disagreement\u2026Withdrawal Of subsidy, Floating Exchange Rate Anti-PoorDecision to withdraw subsidy has failed, Tinubu Living In Denial \u2026..Says Buhari, Tinubu\u2019s Mission Was To Grab Power \u2026.

{"id": 232089214, "title": "Dr Michael Mosley remembered as \u2018national treasure\u2019 and \u2018hero\u2019 for health advice", "text": "The 67-year-old TV personality was with friends at Agios Nikolaos beach on Symi on Wednesday before going missing during a walk by himself to the centre of the island. Clare Bailey Mosley confirmed a body found on Sunday morning in a rocky area near Agia Marina beach on Symi was her husband, describing the loss as \u201cdevastating\u201d. Mimi Spencer, who co-authored The Fast Diet with Dr Mosley, paid tribute to him as \u201cimmediately likeable, genuinely funny\u201d and said she will \u201cmiss him terribly\u201d. Speaking on BBC Radio 4, she said: \u201cIn person he was very much the sort of figure that you would see on television: immediately likeable, genuinely funny, enthusiastic, he had this innate enthusiasm about life and he was always very generous with his time. \u201cHe had a brilliant line in tangential anecdote which comes out of his broadcasting as well, that his mind would go down rabbit holes and come out with fantastic snippets of information, and talking to him in person was much like that, you never quite knew where you were going to arrive, but the journey was always fascinating.\u201d Ms Spencer said she believes the 5:2 intermittent fasting plan and The Fast Diet, which the pair helped popularise, gave Mosley so much joy \u201cbecause it benefited so many people\u201d. Ms Spencer added: \u201cFunnily enough in person, he could also be quite self-deprecating, and actually quite shy. So he never blew his trumpet, he was quite a humble person. \u201cI think when he had success, whether it was on the TV or through his books, he was rather thrown by it, he wasn\u2019t expecting it, and that speaks to the man really; that he kept that humility throughout.\u201d Dr Saleyha Ahsan, Dr Mosley\u2019s co-presenter on Trust Me, I\u2019m A Doctor, described him as \u201ca national treasure\u201d who put her at ease during her first audition for the BBC series. Speaking to BBC News, Ahsan said: \u201cMichael\u2019s a national treasure and he\u2019s so personable.\u201d She recalled how Mosley put her \u201cto ease\u201d during an on-camera audition for the BBC series which looked at health care in Britain. Ahsan said: \u201cI can now appreciate that\u2019s a one-off, not everyone is able to make other people feel so at ease with lights and cameras in front of them. \u201cBut then to forget about all of that and just to focus on the science, on the story, on the message that we\u2019re trying to get out, is such a talented man, hugely talented.\u201d She also praised his \u201cpassion for explaining science to a wider audience\u201d, adding: \u201cMaking it accessible to anyone and everyone, not just a niche scientific crowd, but to everyone.\u201d Academic and broadcaster Alice Roberts shared three pictures on social media with Mosley, with whom she first worked on her 2009 TV series Human Journey. Prof Roberts said the \u201cfragility of life is so shocking\u201d as she recalled working with him and seeing him at the Hay Festival two weeks ago, adding: \u201cI can\u2019t believe he\u2019s gone. My thoughts are with his bereaved family.\u201d The Hay Festival shared black and white photos of Dr Mosley taken during his appearance of the literature and arts festival last month. Organisers of the annual event in Hay-on-Wye wrote on X: \u201cIt was a privilege to share his work on our stages. Our thoughts go to his family, friends and colleagues.\u201d Mosley recorded a special edition of his BBC R4 podcast, just One Thing, on May 25 on stage at the festival with Professor Tanya Byron, a consultant clinical psychologist, broadcaster and author. Celebrity chef and healthy eating campaigner Jamie Oliver praised the work Mosley had done for public health with his broadcasting and research. Oliver wrote on Instagram: \u201cWhat a wonderfully sweet, kind and gentle man he was. He did such a lot of good for public health with his TV shows and research. \u201cHe was a curious investigator, producer and presenter and often changed the conversation around many public health issues for the better.\u201d Tom Watson, the former deputy leader of the Labour Party, described Mosley, as a \u201chero\u201d. \u201cIt\u2019s hard to describe how upset I am by this news,\u201d Mr Watson said on social media. \u201cThrough courageous, science-based journalism, Michael Mosley has helped thousands of people get well and healthy. I\u2019m one of them. \u201cHe was a hero to me. He will be deeply missed. My thoughts and prayers are with his family.\u201d Watson said in an interview after losing around seven stone that Mosley\u2019s The Fast Diet book was part of his weight-loss regime. Author, TV writer and former doctor Adam Kay said it was \u201cdesperately sad\u201d to hear the news. \u201cMy thoughts with his family \u2013 may his memory be a blessing,\u201d Kay wrote on X. Physicist and TV presenter Brian Cox said Mosley was a \u201cgenuinely lovely man\u201d who helped him when he started his TV career. \u201cTragic news about Michael Mosley. He was such an important figure both on and off screen in the BBC science unit, and as a mentor to many of us when we started out in science presenting\u201d, he wrote on X. \u201cAnd, as many of our colleagues have already said on here, he was a genuinely lovely man. So sorry for his family. RIP Michael.\u201d This Morning said staff at the ITV programme were \u201cheartbroken\u201d to learn that Mosley, a regular contributor, had died. In a post on X, the show added: \u201cEveryone at This Morning is thinking of Clare, their four children and the rest of Michael\u2019s family and friends at this extremely sad time.\u201d Angela Rippon hailed Mosley\u2019s contribution to keeping the nation healthy as \u201coutstanding\u201d. \u201cHis Just One Thing broadcasts really did persuade people that by changing just one thing to their daily routine they could make a serious difference to their health and wellbeing,\u201d she told the PA news agency. \u201cHis death is such a tragedy. Sincere condolences to his family.\u201d", "summary": "<p>Colleagues of Dr Michael Mosley have led tributes, hailing the late TV broadcaster, producer and columnist as a \u201cnational treasure\u201d and a \u201ckind and gentle man\u201d, after his death while holidaying on a Greek island was confirmed.</p>", "url": "https://www.independent.ie/style/celebrity/celebrity-news/dr-michael-mosley-remembered-as-national-treasure-and-hero-for-health-advice/a578164864.html", "image": "https://focus.independent.ie/thumbor/KzRfZhP5nOisUXVf4Fib8kDNV00=/0x626:2994x2622/550x550/prod-mh-ireland/4293867d-b7fa-431f-93d1-a9e81cbd78e8/083a998e-2c84-4bd1-9291-ac6f75b811a9/2d34ee0b-64ed-499b-b32b-23f58bf7da3b.jpg", "video": null, "publish_date": "2024-06-09 14:55:06", "author": "Naomi Clarke And George Lithgow, Pa Reporters", "authors": ["Naomi Clarke And George Lithgow, Pa Reporters"], "language": "en", "source_country": "ie", "sentiment": 0.331}

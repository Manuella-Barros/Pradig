It sounds like Homer Simpson\u2019s fever dream, but that could be the shape of the entire universe \u2013 to be exact, a hyperdimensional doughnut that mathematicians call a 3-torus. This is just one of the many possibilities for the topology of the cosmos. \u201cWe\u2019re trying to find the shape of space,\u201d says Yashar Akrami of the Institute for Theoretical Physics in Madrid, a member of an international partnership called Compact (Collaboration for Observations, Models and Predictions of Anomalies and Cosmic Topology). In May, the Compact team explained that the question of the shape of the universe remains wide open and surveyed the future prospects for pinning it down. \u201cIt\u2019s high-risk, high-reward cosmology,\u201d says team member Andrew Jaffe, a cosmologist at Imperial College London. \u201cI would be very surprised if we find anything, but I\u2019ll be extremely happy if we do.\u201d The topology of an object specifies how its parts are connected. A doughnut has the same topology as a teacup, the hole being equivalent to the handle: you can remould a clay doughnut into a cup shape without tearing it. Similarly, a sphere, cube and banana all have the same topology, with no holes. The idea that the whole universe can have a shape is hard to picture. In addition to the topology there is another aspect: the curvature. In his theory of general relativity in 1916, Albert Einstein showed that space can be curved by massive objects, creating the force of gravity. Imagine space as two-dimensional, like a sheet, rather than having all three spatial dimensions. Flat space is like a flat sheet of paper, while curved space could be like the surface of a sphere (positive curvature) or a saddle (negative curvature). These possibilities can be distinguished by simple geometry. On a flat sheet, the angles of a triangle must add up to 180 degrees. But on a curved surface, that\u2019s no longer so. By comparing the real and apparent size of distant objects such as galaxies, astronomers can see that our universe as a whole seems to be as close to flat as we can measure: it\u2019s like a flat sheet pocked with little dimples where each star deforms the space around it. \u201cKnowing what the curvature is, you know what kinds of topologies are possible,\u201d says Akrami. Flat space could just go on for ever, like an infinite sheet of paper. That\u2019s the most boring, trivial possibility. But a flat geometry also fits with some topologies that cosmologists euphemistically call \u201cnontrivial\u201d, meaning that they\u2019re far more interesting and can get pretty mind-boggling. There are, for mathematical reasons, precisely 18 possibilities. In general, they correspond to the universe having a finite volume but no edges: if you travel farther than the scale of the universe, you end up back where you started. It\u2019s like the screen of a video game in which a character exiting on the far right reappears on the far left \u2013 as though the screen is twisted into a loop. In three dimensions, the simplest of these topologies is the 3-torus: like a box from which, exiting through any face, you re-enter through the opposite face. Such a topology has a bizarre implication. If you could look out across all the universe \u2013 which would require the speed of light to be infinite \u2013 you would see endless copies of yourself in all directions, like a 3D hall of mirrors. Other, more complex topologies are variations on the same theme, where, for example, the images would appear slightly shifted \u2013 you re-enter the box in a different place, or perhaps twisted so that right becomes left. If the universe\u2019s volume is not too big, we may then be able to see such duplicate images \u2013 an exact copy, say, of our own galaxy. \u201cPeople started looking for topology on very small scales by looking for images of the Milky Way,\u201d says Jaffe. But it\u2019s not entirely straightforward because of the finite speed of light \u2013 \u201cyou have to look for them as they were a long time ago\u201d \u2013 and so you may not recognise the duplicate. Also, our galaxy is moving, so the copy won\u2019t be in the same place as we are now. And some of the more exotic topologies would also shift it. In any event, astronomers have seen no such cosmic duplication. If, on the other hand, the universe is really immense yet not infinite, we may never be able to distinguish between the two, says Akrami. But if the universe is finite, at least along some directions, and not much larger than the farthest we can see, then we should be able to detect its shape. One of the best ways to do that is to look at the cosmic microwave background (CMB): the very faint glow of heat left over from the big bang itself, which fills the cosmos with microwave radiation. First detected in 1965, the CMB is one of the key pieces of evidence that the big bang happened at all. It is very nearly uniform throughout the cosmos. But as astronomers have developed ever more precise telescopes to detect and map it across the sky, they have found tiny variations in the \u201ctemperature\u201d of this microwave sea from place to place. These variations are remnants of random temperature differences in the nascent universe \u2013 differences that helped to seed the emergence of structure, so that matter in the universe is not spread evenly throughout the cosmos like butter on bread. Thus the CMB is a sort of map of what the universe looked like at the earliest stage we can still observe today (about 10bn years ago), imprinted on the sky all around us. If the universe has a nontrivial topology that produces copies in some or all directions, and if its volume is not significantly larger than the sphere on which we see the projection of the CMB, then these copies should leave traces in the temperature variations. Two or more patches will match, like duplicates of fingerprints. But that\u2019s not easy to detect, given that these variations are random and faint and that some topologies would shift the duplicates around. Nonetheless, we can search among the statistics of the tiny temperature variations and see if they are random or not. It\u2019s pattern-seeking, like traders looking for nonrandomness in fluctuations of the stock market. The Compact team has taken a close look at the chances of finding anything. It showed that, even though no nonrandom patterns have yet been seen in the CMB map, neither have they been ruled out. In other words, many weird cosmic topologies are still entirely consistent with the observed data. \u201cWe haven\u2019t ruled out as many interesting topologies as some previously thought,\u201d says Akrami. Others outside the group agree. \u201cPrevious analyses do not rule out there being possibly observable effects due to the universe having a nontrivial topology,\u201d says astrophysicist Neil Cornish of Montana State University in Bozeman, who devised one such analysis 20 years ago. Ralf Aurich, an astronomer at Ulm University in Baden-W\u00fcrttemberg, Germany, also says:\u201cI think that nontrivial topologies are still very much a possibility.\u201d Isn\u2019t it, though, a little perverse to imagine that the universe may have some twisted-doughnut shape rather than having the simplest possible topology of infinite size? Not necessarily. Going from nothing to infinity in the big bang is quite a step. \u201cIt\u2019s easier to create small things than big things,\u201d says Jaffe. \u201cSo it\u2019s easier to create a universe that is compact in some way \u2013 and a nontrivial topology does that.\u201d Besides, there are theoretical reasons to suspect that the universe is finite. There is no agreed theory of how the universe originated, but one of the most popular frameworks for thinking about it is string theory. But current versions of string theory predict that the universe shouldn\u2019t have just four dimensions (three of space, plus time) but at least 10. String theorists argue that maybe all the other dimensions became highly \u201ccompactified\u201d: they are so small that we don\u2019t experience them at all. But then why would only six or so have become finite while the others remained infinite? \u201cI would say it is more natural to have a compact universe, rather than four infinite dimensions and the others compact,\u201d says Akrami. And if the search for cosmic topology showed that at least three of the dimensions are indeed finite, says Aurich, that would rule out many of the possible versions of string theory. \u201cA detection of a compact universe would be one of the most staggering discoveries in human history,\u201d says cosmologist Janna Levin of Barnard College in New York. That\u2019s why searches like this, \u201cthough they threaten to disappoint, are worthwhile.\u201d But if she had to place a bet, she adds: \u201cI would wager against a small universe.\u201d Will we ever know the answer? \u201cIt is quite likely that the universe is finite, but with the topology scale larger than what we can probe with observations,\u201dsays Cornish. But he adds that some odd features in the CMB pattern \u201care exactly the kind you would expect in a finite universe, so it is worth probing further\u201d. The problem with seeking patterns in the CMB, Cornish says, is given how each of the 18 flat topologies can be varied, \u201cthere are an infinite number of possibilities to consider, each with its own unique predictions, so it is impossible to try them all out.\u201d Maybe the best we can do, then, is decide which possibilities seem most probable and see if the data fits those. Aurich says that a planned improvement of the CMB map in an international project called CMB stage 4, using a dozen telescopes in Chile and Antarctica, should help the hunt. But the Compact researchers suspect that, unless we get lucky, the CMB alone may not allow us to answer the topology question definitively. However, they say there is plenty of other astronomical data we can use too: not just what\u2019s on the \u201csphere\u201d of the CMB map but what\u2019s inside it, in the rest of space. \u201cEverything in the universe is affected by the topology,\u201d says Akrami. \u201cThe ideal case will be to combine everything that is observable and hopefully that will give us a large signal of the topology.\u201d The team wants either to detect that signal, he says, or show that it\u2019s impossible. There are several instruments now in use or in construction that will fill in more details of what is inside the volume of observable space, such as the European Space Agency\u2019s Euclid space telescope, launched last year, and the SKA Observatory (formerly the Square Kilometre Array), a system of radio telescopes being built in Australia and South Africa. \u201cWe want a census of all the matter in the universe,\u201d says Jaffe, \u201cwhich will enable us to understand the global structure of space and time.\u201d If we manage that \u2013 and if it turns out that the cosmic topology makes the universe finite \u2013 Akrami imagines a day when we have a kind of Google Earth for the entire cosmos: a map of everything.", "summary": "<p>Rather than stretching to infinity and beyond, the universe may have a topology that can eventually be mapped  </p><p>We may be living in a doughnut.

Voting will later start in territories in the Pacific and then in the Indian Ocean before it gets underway on the mainland on Sunday.\n\nElections for the 577 seats in the lower house National Assembly are a two-round process. The shape of the new parliament will become clear after the second round a week later, on July 7.\n\nWith Russia's war against Ukraine in its third year and energy and food prices soaring, support for the anti-immigration and eurosceptic National Rally party has surged.\n\nMost polls show that National Rally is on course to win the largest number of seats in the National Assembly, parliament's lower house, although it remains unclear if the party will secure an outright majority.\n\nA high turnout is predicted and final opinion polls have given the RN between 35 percent and 37 percent of the vote, against 27.5-29 percent for the left-wing New Popular Front alliance and 20-21 percent for President Emmanuel Macron's centrist camp.\n\nIf the RN obtains an absolute majority, party chief Jordan Bardella, Le Pen's 28-year-old protege with no governing experience, could become prime minister in a tense \"cohabitation\" with Macron.\n\n- 'No precedent' -\n\nOn Monday, Macron plans to convene a government meeting to decide the further course of action, government sources told AFP.\n\nFrance is heading for a year of political chaos and confusion with a hung Assembly, said Mujtaba Rahman, Europe head at Eurasia Group, a risk consultancy.\n\n\"There is no precedent in recent French politics for such an impasse,\" Rahman said.\n\nMacron's decision to call snap elections after the RN's victory in European Parliament elections this month stunned friends and foes and sparked uncertainty in Europe's second-biggest economy.\n\nThe Paris stock exchange suffered its biggest monthly decline in two years in June, dropping by 6.4 percent, according to figures released on Friday.\n\nIn an editorial, French daily Le Monde said it was time to mobilise against the far right.\n\n\"Yielding any power to it means nothing less than taking the risk of seeing everything that has been built and conquered over more than two and a half centuries gradually being undone,\" it said.\n\nWielding mops and buckets, several activists of the Femen feminist collective dressed as cleaners on Saturday demonstrated bare-breasted at the Trocadero in Paris, chanting slogans against the extreme right.\n\n- 'Victory is within grasp' -\n\nMacron apparently hoped to catch political opponents off guard by presenting voters with a crucial choice about France's future, but observers say he might have lost his gamble.\n\nMany have pointed to a spike in hate speech, intolerance and racism during the charged campaign. A video of two RN supporters verbally assaulting a black woman has gone viral in recent days.\n\nMacron has deplored \"racism or anti-Semitism\".\n\nSupport for Macron's centrist camp collapsed, while left-wing parties put their bickering aside to form the New Popular Front, in a nod to an alliance founded in 1936 to combat fascism.\n\nAnalysts say Le Pen's years-long efforts to clean up the image of a party co-founded by a former Waffen SS member have been paying off. The party has promised to bolster purchasing power, curb immigration and boost law and order.\n\n\"Victory is within our grasp, so let's seize this historic opportunity and get out and vote!\" Le Pen wrote on X on Friday.\n\nUnder Macron, France has been one of Ukraine's main Western backers since Russia invaded in 2022.\n\nBut Le Pen and Bardella have said they would scale down French support for Ukraine, by ruling out the deployment of ground troops and long-range missiles.\n\nThe party's path to victory could be blocked if the left and centre-right join forces against the RN in the second round.\n\nA defiant Macron has stood by his decision to call the elections, while warning voters that a win by the far right or hard left could spark a \"civil war.\"\n\nHe has insisted he will serve out the remainder of his second term until 2027, no matter which party wins.\n\nSome 49 million French are eligible to vote.\n\nare-fff-adc-as/db\n\nFOX28 Spokane\u00a9", "source": {"uri":

Voting will later start in territories in the Pacific and then in the Indian Ocean before it gets underway on the mainland on Sunday.\n\nElections for the 577 seats in the lower house National Assembly are a two-round process. The shape of the new parliament will become clear after the second round a week later, on July 7.\n\nWith Russia's war against Ukraine in its third year and energy and food prices soaring, support for the anti-immigration and eurosceptic National Rally party has surged.\n\nMost polls show that National Rally is on course to win the largest number of seats in the National Assembly, parliament's lower house, although it remains unclear if the party will secure an outright majority.\n\nA high turnout is predicted and final opinion polls have given the RN between 35 percent and 37 percent of the vote, against 27.5-29 percent for the left-wing New Popular Front alliance and 20-21 percent for President Emmanuel Macron's centrist camp.\n\nIf the RN obtains an absolute majority, party chief Jordan Bardella, Le Pen's 28-year-old protege with no governing experience, could become prime minister in a tense \"cohabitation\" with Macron.\n\n- 'No precedent' -\n\nOn Monday, Macron plans to convene a government meeting to decide the further course of action, government sources told AFP.\n\nFrance is heading for a year of political chaos and confusion with a hung Assembly, said Mujtaba Rahman, Europe head at Eurasia Group, a risk consultancy.\n\n\"There is no precedent in recent French politics for such an impasse,\" Rahman said.\n\nMacron's decision to call snap elections after the RN's victory in European Parliament elections this month stunned friends and foes and sparked uncertainty in Europe's second-biggest economy.\n\nThe Paris stock exchange suffered its biggest monthly decline in two years in June, dropping by 6.4 percent, according to figures released on Friday.\n\nIn an editorial, French daily Le Monde said it was time to mobilise against the far right.\n\n\"Yielding any power to it means nothing less than taking the risk of seeing everything that has been built and conquered over more than two and a half centuries gradually being undone,\" it said.\n\nWielding mops and buckets, several activists of the Femen feminist collective dressed as cleaners on Saturday demonstrated bare-breasted at the Trocadero in Paris, chanting slogans against the extreme right.\n\n- 'Victory is within grasp' -\n\nMacron apparently hoped to catch political opponents off guard by presenting voters with a crucial choice about France's future, but observers say he might have lost his gamble.\n\nMany have pointed to a spike in hate speech, intolerance and racism during the charged campaign. A video of two RN supporters verbally assaulting a black woman has gone viral in recent days.\n\nMacron has deplored \"racism or anti-Semitism\".\n\nSupport for Macron's centrist camp collapsed, while left-wing parties put their bickering aside to form the New Popular Front, in a nod to an alliance founded in 1936 to combat fascism.\n\nAnalysts say Le Pen's years-long efforts to clean up the image of a party co-founded by a former Waffen SS member have been paying off. The party has promised to bolster purchasing power, curb immigration and boost law and order.\n\n\"Victory is within our grasp, so let's seize this historic opportunity and get out and vote!\" Le Pen wrote on X on Friday.\n\nUnder Macron, France has been one of Ukraine's main Western backers since Russia invaded in 2022.\n\nBut Le Pen and Bardella have said they would scale down French support for Ukraine, by ruling out the deployment of ground troops and long-range missiles.\n\nThe party's path to victory could be blocked if the left and centre-right join forces against the RN in the second round.\n\nA defiant Macron has stood by his decision to call the elections, while warning voters that a win by the far right or hard left could spark a \"civil war.\"\n\nHe has insisted he will serve out the remainder of his second term until 2027, no matter which party wins.\n\nSome 49 million French are eligible to vote.\n\nare-fff-adc-as/db\n\nMore from this section\n\nHow to Record Phone Calls

French support for Ukraine, by ruling out the deployment of ground troops and long-range missiles.\n\nIf the far right obtains an absolute majority, Bardella could become prime minister in a tense \"cohabitation\" with Macron.\n\nHis party's path to victory could be blocked if the left and center-right join forces against the RN in the second round.\n\nA defiant Macron has stood by his decision to call the elections, while warning voters that a win by the far right or hard left could spark a \"civil war\" in France.\n\nHe has insisted he will serve out the remainder of his second term until 2027, no matter which party wins.", "source": {"uri": "arab.news", "dataType": "news", "title": "Arab News"}, "authors": [{"uri": "agence_france_presse@arab.news", "name": "Agence France-Presse",

The party has promised to bolster purchasing power, curb immigration and boost law and order.\n\n\"Victory is within our grasp, so let's seize this historic opportunity and get out and vote!\" Le Pen wrote on X Friday.\n\nUnder Macron, France has been one of Ukraine's main Western backers since Russia invaded in 2022.\n\nBut Le Pen and Bardella have said they would scale down French support for Ukraine, by ruling out the deployment of ground troops and long-range missiles.\n\nA defiant Macron has stood by his decision to call the elections, while warning voters that a win by the far right or hard left could spark a \"civil war.\"\n\nHe has insisted he will serve out the remainder of his second term until 2027, no matter which party wins.", "source": {"uri": "yahoo.com", "dataType":

Macron's centrist camp collapsed during the campaign, while left-wing parties put their bickering aside to form the New Popular Front, in a nod to an alliance founded in 1936 to combat fascism.\n\nSupport for the far right has surged, with analysts saying Le Pen's years-long efforts to clean up the image of a party co-founded by a former Waffen SS member have paid off.\n\n\"Victory is within our grasp, so let's seize this historic opportunity and get out and vote!\" Le Pen wrote on X on Friday, vowing to bolster purchasing power and \"curb insecurity and immigration\".\n\nUnder Macron, France has been one of Ukraine's main Western backers since Russia invaded in 2022.\n\nBut Le Pen and her 28-year-old lieutenant, party chief Jordan Bardella, have said they would scale down French support for Ukraine, by ruling out the deployment of ground troops and long-range missiles.\n\nIf the far right obtains an absolute majority, Bardella could become prime minister in a tense \"cohabitation\" with Macron.\n\nHis party's path to victory could be blocked if the left and center-right joined forces against the RN in the second round.\n\nA defiant Macron has stood by his decision to call the elections while warning voters that a win by the far right or hard left could spark a \"civil war\" in France.\n\nHe has insisted he will serve out the remainder of his second term until 2027, no matter which party wins.", "source": {"uri": "english.ahram.org.eg", "dataType": "news", "title": "\u062c\u0631\u064a\u062f\u0629 \u0627\u0644\u0623\u0647\u0631\u0627\u0645"},

Voting will later start in territories in the Pacific and then in the Indian Ocean before it gets underway on the mainland on Sunday.\n\nMost polls show that Le Pen's far-right National Rally (RN) is on course to win the largest number of seats in the 577-member National Assembly, parliament's lower house, although it remains unclear if the party will secure an outright majority.\n\nA high turnout is predicted and final opinion polls have given the RN between 35 percent and 37 percent of the vote, against 27.5-29 percent for the left-wing New Popular Front alliance and 20-21 percent for President Emmanuel Macron's centrist camp.\n\nMacron's decision to call snap elections after the RN's victory in European Parliament elections this month stunned friends and foes and sparked uncertainty in Europe's second-biggest economy.\n\nThe Paris stock exchange suffered its biggest monthly decline in two years in June, dropping by 6.4 percent, according to figures released on Friday.\n\nIn an editorial, French daily Le Monde said it was time to mobilise against the far right.\n\n\"Yielding any power to it means nothing less than taking the risk of seeing everything that has been built and conquered over more than two and a half centuries gradually being undone,\" it said.\n\nBrice Teinturier, head of the Ipsos polling firm, said there were two tendancies coming out of the campaign.\n\n\"One is a dynamic of hope\" with left-wing and RN supporters believing that \"there can be a change\".\n\nBut Teinturier also highlighted \"the negative politicisation, the fear, the dread caused\" by the RN and the hard-left France Unbowed party which is part of the left-wing coalition.\n\nMacron apparently hoped to catch political opponents off guard by presenting voters with a crucial choice about France's future, but observers say he might have lost his gamble.\n\nMany have pointed to a spike in hate speech, intolerance and racism during the charged campaign. A video of two RN supporters verbally assaulting a black woman has gone viral in recent days.\n\nSpeaking in Brussels late Thursday, Macron deplored \"racism or anti-Semitism\".\n\nSupport for Macron's centrist camp collapsed during the campaign, while left-wing parties put their bickering aside to form the New Popular Front, in a nod to an alliance founded in 1936 to combat fascism.\n\nSupport for the far right has surged, with analysts saying Le Pen's years-long efforts to clean up the image of a party co-founded by a former Waffen SS member have paid off.\n\n\"Victory is within our grasp, so let's seize this historic opportunity and get out and vote!\" Le Pen wrote on X on Friday, vowing to bolster purchasing power and \"curb insecurity and immigration\".\n\nBut Le Pen and her 28-year-old lieutenant, party chief Jordan Bardella, have said they would scale down French support for Ukraine, by ruling out the deployment of ground troops and long-range missiles.\n\nIf the far right obtains an absolute majority, Bardella could become prime minister in a tense \"cohabitation\" with Macron.\n\nHis party's path to victory could be blocked if the left and centre-right join forces against the RN in the second round.\n\nA defiant Macron has stood by his decision to call the elections, while warning voters that a win by the far right or hard left could spark a \"civil war\" in France.\n\nHe has insisted he will serve out the remainder of his second term until 2027, no matter which party wins.", "source": {"uri": "urdupoint.com", "dataType":

Some 49 million French are eligible to vote.\n\nElections for the 577 seats in the National Assembly are a two-round process. The shape of the new parliament will become clear after the second round, a week later, on July 7.\n\nMost polls show that National Rally is on course to win the largest number of seats in the National Assembly, parliament's lower house, although it remains unclear if the party will secure an outright majority.\n\nA high turnout is predicted and final opinion polls have given the RN between 35 percent and 37 percent of the vote, against 27.5-29 percent for the left-wing New Popular Front alliance and 20-21 percent for Macron's centrist camp.\n\nIf the RN obtains an absolute majority, RN party chief Jordan Bardella, Le Pen's 28-year-old protege with no governing experience, could become prime minister in a tense \"cohabitation\" with Macron.\n\nOn Monday, Macron plans to convene a government meeting to decide the further course of action, government sources told AFP.\n\nFrance is heading for a year of political chaos and confusion with a hung Assembly, said Mujtaba Rahman, Europe head at Eurasia Group, a risk consultancy.\n\n\"There is no precedent in recent French politics for such an impasse,\" Rahman said.\n\n- Calls to mobilise -\n\nMacron's decision to call snap elections after the RN's strong showing in European Parliament elections this month stunned friends and foes and sparked uncertainty in Europe's second-biggest economy.\n\nThe Paris stock exchange suffered its biggest monthly decline in two years in June, dropping by 6.4 percent, according to figures released on Friday.\n\nIn an editorial, French daily Le Monde said it was time to mobilise against the far right.\n\n\"Yielding any power to it means nothing less than taking the risk of seeing everything that has been built and conquered over more than two and a half centuries gradually being undone,\" it said.\n\nWielding mops and buckets, several activists of the Femen feminist collective dressed as cleaners on Saturday demonstrated bare-breasted at the Trocadero in Paris, chanting slogans against the extreme right.\n\nSeparately, thousands of people joined an LGBT Pride march in Paris, with some carrying placards targeting the far-right.\n\n\"I think it's even more important right now to fight against hatred in general, in all its forms,\" said 19-year-old student Themis Hallin-Mallet.\n\n- Spike in hate speech -\n\nMany have pointed to a spike in hate speech, intolerance and racism during the charged campaign. A video of two RN supporters verbally assaulting a black woman has gone viral in recent days.\n\nMacron has deplored \"racism or anti-Semitism\".\n\nMacron apparently hoped to catch political opponents off guard by presenting voters with a crucial choice about France's future, but observers say he might have lost his gamble.\n\nSupport for Macron's centrist camp has collapsed, while left-wing parties put their bickering aside to form the New Popular Front, in a nod to an alliance founded in 1936 to combat fascism.\n\nAnalysts say Le Pen's years-long efforts to clean up the image of a party co-founded by a former Waffen SS member have been paying off. The party has promised to bolster purchasing power, curb immigration and boost law and order.\n\n\"Victory is within our grasp, so let's seize this historic opportunity and get out and vote!\" Le Pen wrote on social media platform X on Friday.\n\nUnder Macron, France has been one of Ukraine's main Western backers since Russia invaded in 2022.\n\nBut Le Pen and Bardella have said they would scale down French support for Ukraine by ruling out the deployment of ground troops and long-range missiles.\n\nA defiant Macron has stood by his decision to call the elections, while warning voters that a win by the far right or hard left could spark a \"civil war.\"\n\nHe has insisted he will serve out the remainder of his second term until 2027, no matter which party wins.\n\nbur-as/gv/mca\n\nMore

Her eurosceptic, anti-immigrant party was a longtime pariah but is now closer to power than it has ever been.\n\nPolls opened at 0600 GMT and will close at 1600 GMT in small towns and cities, with an 1800 GMT finish in the bigger cities, when the first exit polls for the night and seat projections for the decisive second round a week later are expected.\n\nHowever the electoral system can make it hard to estimate the precise distribution of seats in the 577-seat National Assembly, and the final outcome will not be known until the end of voting on July 7.\n\n\"We are going to win an absolute majority,\" Le Pen said in a newspaper interview on Wednesday, predicting that her prot\u00e9g\u00e9, 28-year-old Jordan Bardella, would be prime minister. Her party has a high-spending economic programme and seeks to reduce immigration.\n\nA woman screamed \"It's shameful, it's shameful\" as Bardella arrived to cast his vote in Garches near Paris. \"They even invited the leftists,\" he said.\n\nIf the RN does win an absolute majority, French diplomacy could be headed for an unprecedented period of turbulence: with Macron - who has said he will continue his presidency until the end of his term in 2027 - and Bardella jostling for the right to speak for France.\n\nFrance has had three periods of \"cohabitation\" - when the president and government are from opposite political camps - in its post-war history, but none with such radically divergent world views competing at the top of the state.\n\nBardella has already indicated he would challenge Macron on global issues. France could lurch from being a pillar of the EU to a thorn in its side, demanding a rebate of the French contribution to the EU budget, clashing with Brussels over European Commission jobs and reversing Macron's calls for greater EU unity and assertiveness on defence.\n\nA clear RN victory would also bring uncertainty as to where France stands on the Russia-Ukraine war. Le Pen has a history of pro-Russian sentiment and while the party now says it would help Ukraine defend itself against Russian invaders, it has also set out red lines, such as refusing to provide long-range missiles.\n\nIn H\u00e9nin-Beaumont, a town in Le Pen's constituency in northern France where she may be re-elected in the first round, 67-year-old Denis Ledieu said people were suffering due to the long-term deindustrializaton of the region.\n\n\"So if the (RN) promises them things, then why not? They want to try it out, I think,\" he said.\n\nAcross France, early turnout figures were higher than in the 2022 legislative vote, at 25.9% by midday, compared with 18.43% two years ago, the interior ministry said.\n\n'Split vote favours RN'\n\nOpinion polls have suggested the RN has a comfortable lead of 33%-36% of the popular vote, with a hastily assembled left-wing coalition, the New Popular Front, in second place on 28%-31% and Macron's centrist alliance in third on 20%-23%.\n\nThe New Popular Front includes a wide range of parties, from the moderate centre-left to the hard-left, eurosceptic, anti-NATO party France Unbowed, led by one of Macron's most vitriolic opponents, Jean-Luc Melenchon.\n\nHow the poll numbers will translate into seats in the National Assembly is hard to predict because of how the election works, said Vincent Martigny, professor of political science at the University of Nice and the Ecole Polytechnique.\n\nCandidates can be elected in the first round if they win an absolute majority of votes in their constituency, but that is rare. Most constituencies will need a second round involving all candidates who received votes from at least 12.5% of registered voters in the first round. The top scorer wins.\n\n\"If you have a very high level of participation you might have a third or fourth party that is getting into the struggle. So then of course there's a risk of split voting and we know that the split vote favours the National Rally,\" Martigny said.\n\nFor decades, as the far right steadily gained popularity, voters and parties who did not support it would unite against it whenever it edged closer to national power, but that may not hold true this time.\n\nMartigny said no one knew whether candidates from Macron's camp would consider dropping out of the second round to give rivals from the left a chance of beating the RN, or the reverse.\n\nLe Pen and Bardella have sought to make their party's image more acceptable to the mainstream, for example by denouncing antisemitism. Le Pen's father Jean-Marie Le Pen, founder and long-term leader of the RN's forerunner, had a history of overtly antisemitic comments.\n\nBut critics say the RN's courting of Jews is just a cover allowing it to deny accusations of racism while constantly stigmatising Muslims and foreigners.", "source": {"uri": "kathmandupost.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "kathmandupost.com"}, "authors":

Her eurosceptic, anti-immigrant party was a longtime pariah but is now closer to power than it has ever been.\n\nPolls opened at 0600 GMT and will close at 1600 GMT in small towns and cities, with an 1800 GMT finish in the bigger cities, when the first exit polls for the night and seat projections for the decisive second round a week later are expected.\n\nHowever the electoral system can make it hard to estimate the precise distribution of seats in the 577-seat National Assembly, and the final outcome will not be known until the end of voting on July 7.\n\n\"We are going to win an absolute majority,\" said Le Pen in a newspaper interview on Wednesday, predicting that her prot\u00e9g\u00e9, 28-year-old Jordan Bardella would be prime minister. Her party has a high-spending economic programme and seeks to reduce immigration.\n\nIf the RN does win an absolute majority, French diplomacy could be headed for an unprecedented period of turbulence: with Macron - who has said he will continue his presidency until the end of his term in 2027 - and Bardella jostling for the right to speak for France.\n\nAt a voting station in Sevres, on the outskirts of Paris, 70-year-old former company director Didier Delacroix said he had voted for Macron's alliance.\n\n\"Otherwise it'll be a complete mess,\" he said.\n\nFrance has had three periods of \"cohabitation\" - when the president and government are from opposite political camps - in its post-war history, but none with such radically divergent world views competing at the top of the state.\n\nBardella has already indicated he would challenge Macron on global issues. France could lurch from being a pillar of the EU to a thorn in its side, demanding a rebate of the French contribution to the EU budget, clashing with Brussels over European Commission jobs and reversing Macron's calls for greater EU unity and assertiveness on defence.\n\nA clear RN victory would also bring uncertainty as to where France stands on the Russia-Ukraine war. Le Pen has a history of pro-Russian sentiment and while the party now says it would help Ukraine defend itself against Russian invaders, it has also set out red lines, such as refusing to provide long-range missiles.\n\n'Split Voters Favour RN'\n\nOpinion polls have suggested the RN has a comfortable lead of 33-36% of the popular vote, with a hastily assembled left-wing coalition, the New Popular Front, in second place on 28-31% and Macron's centrist alliance in third on 20-23%.\n\nThe New Popular Front includes a wide range of parties, from the moderate centre-left to the hard-left, eurosceptic, anti-NATO party France Unbowed, led by one of Macron's most vitriolic opponents, Jean-Luc Melenchon.\n\nHow the poll numbers will translate into seats in the National Assembly is hard to predict because of how the election works, said Vincent Martigny, professor of political science at the University of Nice and the Ecole Polytechnique.\n\nCandidates can be elected in the first round if they win an absolute majority of votes in their constituency, but that is rare. Most constituencies will need a second round involving all candidates who received votes from at least 12.5% of registered voters in the first round. The top scorer wins.\n\n\"If you have a very high level of participation you might have a third or fourth party that is getting into the struggle. So then of course there's a risk of split voting and we know that the split vote favours the National Rally,\" said Martigny.\n\nFor decades, as the far right steadily gained popularity, voters and parties who did not support it would unite against it whenever it edged closer to national power, but that may not hold true this time.\n\nMartigny said no one knew whether candidates from Macron's camp would consider dropping out of the second round to give rivals from the left a chance of beating the RN, or the reverse.\n\nLe Pen and Bardella have sought to make their party's image more acceptable to the mainstream, for example by denouncing antisemitism. Le Pen's father Jean-Marie Le Pen, founder and long-term leader of the RN's forerunner, had a history of overtly antisemitic comments.\n\nPromotedListen to the latest songs, only on

Across France, early turnout figures were higher than in the 2022 legislative vote, at 25.9% by midday, compared with 18.43% two years ago, the interior ministry said.\n\n'SPLIT VOTE FAVOURS RN' Opinion polls have suggested the RN has a comfortable lead of 33%-36% of the popular vote, with a hastily assembled left-wing coalition, the New Popular Front, in second place on 28%-31% and Macron's centrist alliance in third on 20%-23%.\n\nThe New Popular Front includes a wide range of parties, from the moderate centre-left to the hard-left, eurosceptic, anti-NATO party France Unbowed, led by one of Macron's most vitriolic opponents, Jean-Luc Melenchon. How the poll numbers will translate into seats in the National Assembly is hard to predict because of how the election works, said Vincent Martigny, professor of political science at the University of Nice and the Ecole Polytechnique.\n\nCandidates can be elected in the first round if they win an absolute majority of votes in their constituency, but that is rare. Most constituencies will need a second round involving all candidates who received votes from at least 12.5% of registered voters in the first round. The top scorer wins. \"If you have a very high level of participation you might have a third or fourth party that is getting into the struggle. So then of course there's a risk of split voting and we know that the split vote favours the National Rally,\" Martigny said.\n\nFor decades, as the far right steadily gained popularity, voters and parties who did not support it would unite against it whenever it edged closer to national power, but that may not hold true this time. Martigny said no one knew whether candidates from Macron's camp would consider dropping out of the second round to give rivals from the left a chance of beating the RN, or the reverse.\n\nLe Pen and Bardella have sought to make their party's image more acceptable to the mainstream, for example by denouncing antisemitism. Le Pen's father Jean-Marie Le Pen, founder and long-term leader of the RN's forerunner, had a history of overtly antisemitic comments. But critics say the RN's courting of Jews is just a cover allowing it to deny accusations of racism while constantly stigmatising Muslims and foreigners.

So then of course there's a risk of split voting and we know that the split vote favours the National Rally,\" Martigny said.\n\nFor decades, as the far right steadily gained popularity, voters and parties who did not support it would unite against it whenever it edged closer to national power, but that may not hold true this time.\n\nMartigny said no one knew whether candidates from Macron's camp would consider dropping out of the second round to give rivals from the left a chance of beating the RN, or the reverse.\n\nLe Pen and Bardella have sought to make their party's image more acceptable to the mainstream, for example by denouncing antisemitism. Le Pen's father Jean-Marie Le Pen, founder and long-term leader of the RN's forerunner, had a history of overtly antisemitic comments.\n\nBut critics say the RN's courting of Jews is just a cover allowing it to deny accusations of racism while constantly stigmatising Muslims and foreigners.", "source": {"uri": "taiwannews.com.tw", "dataType": "news", "title": "Taiwan News"}, "authors": [],

Macron's centrist alliance faces a tough battle against Marine Le Pen's National Rally and a new left-wing coalition, with uncertain implications for France's future and EU relations.\n\nFrench voters began voting on Sunday in the first round of a snap parliamentary election that could usher in the country's first far-right government since World War Two, a potential sea change at the heart of the European Union. President Emmanuel Macron stunned the country when he called the vote after his centrist alliance was crushed in European elections this month by Marine Le Pen's National Rally (RN). Her eurosceptic, anti-immigrant party was a longtime pariah but is now closer to power than it has ever been.\n\nPolls opened at 0600 GMT and will close at 1600 GMT in small towns and cities, with an 1800 GMT finish in the bigger cities, when the first exit polls for the night and seat projections for the decisive second round a week later are expected. However the electoral system can make it hard to estimate the precise distribution of seats in the 577-seat National Assembly, and the final outcome will not be known until the end of voting on July 7.\n\n\"We are going to win an absolute majority,\" said Le Pen in a newspaper interview on Wednesday, predicting that her prot\u00e9g\u00e9, 28-year-old Jordan Bardella would be prime minister. Her party has a high-spending economic programme and seeks to reduce immigration. If the RN does win an absolute majority, French diplomacy could be headed for an unprecedented period of turbulence: with Macron - who has said he will continue his presidency until the end of his term in 2027 - and Bardella jostling for the right to speak for France.\n\nAt a voting station in Sevres, on the outskirts of Paris, 70-year-old former company director Didier Delacroix said he had voted for Macron's alliance. \"Otherwise it'll be a complete mess,\" he said.\n\nFrance has had three periods of \"cohabitation\" - when the president and government are from opposite political camps - in its post-war history, but none with such radically divergent world views competing at the top of the state. Bardella has already indicated he would challenge Macron on global issues. France could lurch from being a pillar of the EU to a thorn in its side, demanding a rebate of the French contribution to the EU budget, clashing with Brussels over European Commission jobs and reversing Macron's calls for greater EU unity and assertiveness on defence.\n\nA clear RN victory would also bring uncertainty as to where France stands on the Russia-Ukraine war. Le Pen has a history of pro-Russian sentiment and while the party now says it would help Ukraine defend itself against Russian invaders, it has also set out red lines, such as refusing to provide long-range missiles. 'SPLIT VOTE FAVOURS RN'\n\nOpinion polls have suggested the RN has a comfortable lead of 33-36% of the popular vote, with a hastily assembled left-wing coalition, the New Popular Front, in second place on 28-31% and Macron's centrist alliance in third on 20-23%. The New Popular Front includes a wide range of parties, from the moderate centre-left to the hard-left, eurosceptic, anti-NATO party France Unbowed, led by one of Macron's most vitriolic opponents, Jean-Luc Melenchon.\n\nHow the poll numbers will translate into seats in the National Assembly is hard to predict because of how the election works, said Vincent Martigny, professor of political science at the University of Nice and the Ecole Polytechnique. Candidates can be elected in the first round if they win an absolute majority of votes in their constituency, but that is rare. Most constituencies will need a second round involving all candidates who received votes from at least 12.5% of registered voters in the first round. The top scorer wins.\n\n\"If you have a very high level of participation you might have a third or fourth party that is getting into the struggle. So then of course there's a risk of split voting and we know that the split vote favours the National Rally,\" said Martigny. For decades, as the far right steadily gained popularity, voters and parties who did not support it would unite against it whenever it edged closer to national power, but that may not hold true this time.\n\nMartigny said no one knew whether candidates from Macron's camp would consider dropping out of the second round to give rivals from the left a chance of beating the RN, or the reverse. Le Pen and Bardella have sought to make their party's image more acceptable to the mainstream, for example by denouncing antisemitism. Le Pen's father Jean-Marie Le Pen, founder and long-term leader of the RN's forerunner, had a history of overtly antisemitic comments.\n\nBut critics say the RN's courting of Jews is just a cover allowing it to deny accusations of racism while constantly stigmatising Muslims and foreigners.

Voting will later start in territories in the Pacific and then in the Indian Ocean before it gets underway on the mainland on Sunday.\n\nMost polls show that Le Pen's far-right National Rally (RN) is on course to win the largest number of seats in the 577-member National Assembly, parliament's lower house, although it remains unclear if the party will secure an outright majority.\n\nA high turnout is predicted and final opinion polls have given the RN between 35 percent and 37 percent of the vote, against 27.5-29 percent for the left-wing New Popular Front alliance and 20-21 percent for President Emmanuel Macron's centrist camp.\n\nOn Monday, Macron plans to convene a government meeting to decide the further course of action ahead of the second round of voting on July 7, government sources told AFP.\n\nFrance is heading for a year of political chaos and confusion with a hung Assembly, said Mujtaba Rahman, Europe head at Eurasia Group, a risk consultancy.\n\n\"There is no precedent in recent French politics for such an impasse,\" Rahman said.\n\nMacron's decision to call snap elections after the RN's victory in European Parliament elections this month stunned friends and foes and sparked uncertainty in Europe's second-biggest economy.\n\nThe Paris stock exchange suffered its biggest monthly decline in two years in June, dropping by 6.4 percent, according to figures released on Friday.\n\nIn an editorial, French daily Le Monde said it was time to mobilise against the far right.\n\n\"Yielding any power to it means nothing less than taking the risk of seeing everything that has been built and conquered over more than two and a half centuries gradually being undone,\" it said.\n\nBrice Teinturier, head of the Ipsos polling firm, said there were two tendancies coming out of the campaign.\n\n\"One is a dynamic of hope\" with left-wing and RN supporters believing that \"there can be a change\".\n\nBut Teinturier also highlighted \"the negative politicisation, the fear, the dread caused\" by the RN and the hard-left France Unbowed party which is part of the left-wing coalition.\n\nMacron apparently hoped to catch political opponents off guard by presenting voters with a crucial choice about France's future, but observers say he might have lost his gamble.", "source": {"uri": "enca.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "eNCAnews"},

Some 49 million people are eligible to vote.\n\nCassandre Cazaux, a nurse who voted in France's Pacific territory of New Caledonia, where tensions remain high following last month's deadly riots, said the elections were \"decisive\".\n\n\"It should be well attended, but I don't know if everyone will play along and come out to vote,\" she said.\n\nElections for the 577 seats in the National Assembly are a two-round process. The shape of the new parliament will become clear after the second round on July 7.\n\nMost polls show the RN on course to win the largest number of seats in the National Assembly, parliament's lower house, although it remains unclear if the party will secure an outright majority.\n\nA high turnout is predicted and final opinion polls have given the RN between 35 percent and 37 percent of the vote, against 27.5-29 percent for the left-wing New Popular Front alliance and 20-21 percent for Macron's centrist camp.\n\nIf the RN obtains an absolute majority, party chief Jordan Bardella, Le Pen's 28-year-old protege with no governing experience, could become prime minister in a tense \"cohabitation\" with Macron.\n\nOn Monday, Macron plans to convene a government meeting to decide the further course of action, government sources told AFP.\n\nFrance is heading for a year of political chaos and confusion with a hung Assembly, said Mujtaba Rahman, Europe head at Eurasia Group, a risk consultancy.\n\n\"There is no precedent in recent French politics for such an impasse,\" Rahman said.\n\n- Calls to mobilise -\n\nMacron's decision to call the snap vote after the RN's strong showing in European Parliament elections this month stunned friends and foes and sparked uncertainty in Europe's second-biggest economy.\n\nThe Paris stock exchange suffered its biggest monthly decline in two years in June, dropping by 6.4 percent, according to figures released on Friday.\n\nIn an editorial, French daily Le Monde said it was time to mobilise against the far right.\n\n\"Yielding any power to it means nothing less than taking the risk of seeing everything that has been built and conquered over more than two and a half centuries gradually being undone,\" it said.\n\nWielding mops and buckets, several activists of the Femen feminist collective dressed as cleaners on Saturday demonstrated bare-breasted at the Trocadero in Paris, chanting slogans against the extreme right.\n\nSeparately, tens of thousands of people joined an LGBTQ Pride march in Paris, with some carrying placards targeting the far right.\n\n\"I think it's even more important right now to fight against hatred in general, in all its forms,\" said 19-year-old student Themis Hallin-Mallet.\n\n- Spike in hate speech -\n\nMany have pointed to a spike in hate speech, intolerance and racism during the charged campaign. A video of two RN supporters verbally assaulting a black woman has gone viral in recent days.\n\nMacron has deplored \"racism or anti-Semitism\".\n\nHe apparently hoped to catch political opponents off guard by presenting voters with a crucial choice about France's future, but observers say he might have lost his gamble.\n\nSupport for Macron's centrist camp has collapsed, while left-wing parties put their bickering aside to form the New Popular Front, in a nod to an alliance founded in 1936 to combat fascism.\n\nAnalysts say Le Pen's years-long efforts to clean up the image of a party co-founded by a former Waffen SS member have been paying off.\n\nThe party has promised to bolster purchasing power, curb immigration and boost law and order.\n\nA defiant Macron has stood by his decision to call the elections, while warning voters that a win by the far right or hard left could spark a \"civil war\".\n\nHe has insisted he will serve out the remainder of his second term until 2027, no matter which party wins.\n\nbur-as/imm", "source": {"uri": "ktbs.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "KTBS"}, "authors": [{"uri": "anna_smolchenko@ktbs.com", "name": "Anna Smolchenko", "type":

Her party has a high-spending economic programme and seeks to reduce immigration.\n\nIf the RN does win an absolute majority, French diplomacy could be headed for an unprecedented period of turbulence: with Macron - who has said he will continue his presidency until the end of his term in 2027 - and Bardella jostling for the right to speak for France.\n\nAt a voting station in Sevres, on the outskirts of Paris, 70-year-old former company director Didier Delacroix said he had voted for Macron's alliance.\n\n\"Otherwise it'll be a complete mess,\" he said.\n\nFrance has had three periods of \"cohabitation\" - when the president and government are from opposite political camps - in its post-war history, but none with such radically divergent world views competing at the top of the state.\n\nBardella has already indicated he would challenge Macron on global issues. France could lurch from being a pillar of the EU to a thorn in its side, demanding a rebate of the French contribution to the EU budget, clashing with Brussels over European Commission jobs and reversing Macron's calls for greater EU unity and assertiveness on defence.\n\nA clear RN victory would also bring uncertainty as to where France stands on the Russia-Ukraine war. Le Pen has a history of pro-Russian sentiment and while the party now says it would help Ukraine defend itself against Russian invaders, it has also set out red lines, such as refusing to provide long-range missiles.\n\n'SPLIT VOTE FAVOURS RN'\n\nOpinion polls have suggested the RN has a comfortable lead of 33-36% of the popular vote, with a hastily assembled left-wing coalition, the New Popular Front, in second place on 28-31% and Macron's centrist alliance in third on 20-23%.\n\nThe New Popular Front includes a wide range of parties, from the moderate centre-left to the hard-left, eurosceptic, anti-NATO party France Unbowed, led by one of Macron's most vitriolic opponents, Jean-Luc Melenchon.\n\nHow the poll numbers will translate into seats in the National Assembly is hard to predict because of how the election works, said Vincent Martigny, professor of political science at the University of Nice and the Ecole Polytechnique.\n\nCandidates can be elected in the first round if they win an absolute majority of votes in their constituency, but that is rare. Most constituencies will need a second round involving all candidates who received votes from at least 12.5% of registered voters in the first round. The top scorer wins.\n\n\"If you have a very high level of participation you might have a third or fourth party that is getting into the struggle. So then of course there's a risk of split voting and we know that the split vote favours the National Rally,\" said Martigny.\n\nFor decades, as the far right steadily gained popularity, voters and parties who did not support it would unite against it whenever it edged closer to national power, but that may not hold true this time.\n\nMartigny said no one knew whether candidates from Macron's camp would consider dropping out of the second round to give rivals from the left a chance of beating the RN, or the reverse.\n\nLe Pen and Bardella have sought to make their party's image more acceptable to the mainstream, for example by denouncing antisemitism. Le Pen's father Jean-Marie Le Pen, founder and long-term leader of the RN's forerunner, had a history of overtly antisemitic comments.\n\nBut critics say the RN's courting of Jews is just a cover allowing it to deny accusations of racism while constantly stigmatising Muslims and foreigners.", "source": {"uri": "cyprus-mail.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Cyprus Mail"}, "authors": [],

Voting will later start in territories in the Pacific and then in the Indian Ocean before it gets underway on the mainland on Sunday.\n\nElections for the 577 seats in the lower house National Assembly are a two-round process. The shape of the new parliament will become clear after the second round a week later, on July 7.\n\nMost polls show that National Rally is on course to win the largest number of seats in the National Assembly, parliament's lower house, although it remains unclear if the party will secure an outright majority.\n\nA high turnout is predicted and final opinion polls have given the RN between 35 percent and 37 percent of the vote, against 27.5-29 percent for the left-wing New Popular Front alliance and 20-21 percent for President Emmanuel Macron's centrist camp.\n\nIf the RN obtains an absolute majority, party chief Jordan Bardella, Le Pen's 28-year-old protege with no governing experience, could become prime minister in a tense \"cohabitation\" with Macron.\n\nOn Monday, Macron plans to convene a government meeting to decide the further course of action, government sources said.\n\nMacron's decision to call snap elections after the RN's victory in European Parliament elections this month stunned friends and foes and sparked uncertainty in Europe's second-biggest economy.\n\nIn an editorial, French daily Le Monde said it was time to mobilise against the far right.\n\n\"Yielding any power to it means nothing less than taking the risk of seeing everything that has been built and conquered over more than two and a half centuries gradually being undone,\" it said.\n\nWielding mops and buckets, several activists of the Femen feminist collective on Saturday demonstrated bare-breasted at the Trocadero in Paris. -- AFP", "source": {"uri": "omanobserver.om",

Her eurosceptic, anti-immigrant party was a longtime pariah but is now closer to power than it has ever been.\n\nPolls opened at 0600 GMT and will close at 1600 GMT in small towns and cities, with an 1800 GMT finish in the bigger cities, when the first exit polls for the night and seat projections for the decisive second round a week later are expected.\n\nHowever the electoral system can make it hard to estimate the precise distribution of seats in the 577-seat National Assembly, and the final outcome will not be known until the end of voting on July 7.\n\n\"We are going to win an absolute majority,\" said Le Pen in a newspaper interview on Wednesday, predicting that her prot\u00e9g\u00e9, 28-year-old Jordan Bardella would be prime minister. Her party has a high-spending economic programme and seeks to reduce immigration.\n\nIf the RN does win an absolute majority, French diplomacy could be headed for an unprecedented period of turbulence: with Macron - who has said he will continue his presidency until the end of his term in 2027 - and Bardella jostling for the right to speak for France.\n\nAt a voting station in Sevres, on the outskirts of Paris, 70-year-old former company director Didier Delacroix said he had voted for Macron's alliance.\n\n\"Otherwise it'll be a complete mess,\" he said.\n\nFrance has had three periods of \"cohabitation\" - when the president and government are from opposite political camps - in its post-war history, but none with such radically divergent world views competing at the top of the state.\n\nBardella has already indicated he would challenge Macron on global issues. France could lurch from being a pillar of the EU to a thorn in its side, demanding a rebate of the French contribution to the EU budget, clashing with Brussels over European Commission jobs and reversing Macron's calls for greater EU unity and assertiveness on defence.\n\nA clear RN victory would also bring uncertainty as to where France stands on the Russia-Ukraine war. Le Pen has a history of pro-Russian sentiment and while the party now says it would help Ukraine defend itself against Russian invaders, it has also set out red lines, such as refusing to provide long-range missiles.\n\n'SPLIT VOTE FAVOURS RN'\n\nOpinion polls have suggested the RN has a comfortable lead of 33-36% of the popular vote, with a hastily assembled left-wing coalition, the New Popular Front, in second place on 28-31% and Macron's centrist alliance in third on 20-23%.\n\nThe New Popular Front includes a wide range of parties, from the moderate centre-left to the hard-left, eurosceptic, anti-NATO party France Unbowed, led by one of Macron's most vitriolic opponents, Jean-Luc Melenchon.\n\nHow the poll numbers will translate into seats in the National Assembly is hard to predict because of how the election works, said Vincent Martigny, professor of political science at the University of Nice and the Ecole Polytechnique.\n\nCandidates can be elected in the first round if they win an absolute majority of votes in their constituency, but that is rare.

So then of course there's a risk of split voting and we know that the split vote favours the National Rally,\" said Martigny.\n\nFor decades, as the far right steadily gained popularity, voters and parties who did not support it would unite against it whenever it edged closer to national power, but that may not hold true this time.\n\nMartigny said no one knew whether candidates from Macron's camp would consider dropping out of the second round to give rivals from the left a chance of beating the RN, or the reverse.\n\nLe Pen and Bardella have sought to make their party's image more acceptable to the mainstream, for example by denouncing antisemitism. Le Pen's father Jean-Marie Le Pen, founder and long-term leader of the RN's forerunner, had a history of overtly antisemitic comments.\n\nBut critics say the RN's courting of Jews is just a cover allowing it to deny accusations of racism while constantly stigmatising Muslims and foreigners.

Her eurosceptic, anti-immigrant party was a longtime pariah but is now closer to power than it has ever been.\n\nPolls opened at 6am and will close at 4pm in small towns and cities, with a 6pm finish in the bigger cities, when the first exit polls for the night and seat projections for the decisive second round on July 7 are expected.\n\nOpinion polls have suggested the RN has a comfortable lead of 33-36 per cent of the popular vote, with a hastily assembled left-wing coalition, the New Popular Front, in second place on 28-31 per cent and Macron's centrist alliance in third on 20-23 per cent.However the electoral system can make it hard to estimate the precise distribution of seats in the 577-seat National Assembly, and the final outcome will not be known until the end of voting next Sunday.\n\n\"We are going to win an absolute majority,\" said Le Pen in a newspaper interview on Wednesday, predicting that her prot\u00e9g\u00e9, 28-year-old Jordan Bardella would be prime minister. Her party has a high-spending economic programme and seeks to reduce immigration.\n\nIf the RN does win an absolute majority, French diplomacy could be headed for an unprecedented period of turbulence: with Macron - who has said he will continue his presidency until the end of his term in 2027 - and Bardella jostling for the right to speak for France.\n\nAt a voting station in Sevres, on the outskirts of Paris, 70-year-old former company director Didier Delacroix said he had voted for Macron's alliance.\n\n\"Otherwise it'll be a complete mess,\" he said.\n\nFrance has had three periods of \"cohabitation\" - when the president and government are from opposite political camps - in its post-war history, but none with such radically divergent world views competing at the top of the state.\n\nBardella has already indicated he would challenge Macron on global issues. France could lurch from being a pillar of the EU to a thorn in its side, demanding a rebate of the French contribution to the EU budget, clashing with Brussels over European Commission jobs and reversing Macron's calls for greater EU unity and assertiveness on defence.\n\nA clear RN victory would also bring uncertainty as to where France stands on the Russia-Ukraine war. Le Pen has a history of pro-Russian sentiment and while the party now says it would help Ukraine defend itself against Russian invaders, it has also set out red lines, such as refusing to provide long-range missiles.\n\nThe New Popular Front includes a wide range of parties, from the moderate centre-left to the hard-left, eurosceptic, anti-NATO party France Unbowed, led by one of Macron's most vitriolic opponents, Jean-Luc Melenchon.\n\nHow the poll numbers will translate into seats in the National Assembly is hard to predict because of how the election works, said Vincent Martigny, professor of political science at the University of Nice and the Ecole Polytechnique.\n\nCandidates can be elected in the first round if they win an absolute majority of votes in their constituency, but that is rare. Most constituencies will need a second round involving all candidates who received votes from at least 12.5 per cent of registered voters in the first round. The top scorer wins.\n\n\"If you have a very high level of participation you might have a third or fourth party that is getting into the struggle. So then of course there's a risk of split voting and we know that the split vote favours the National Rally,\" said Martigny.\n\nFor decades, as the far right steadily gained popularity, voters and parties who did not support it would unite against it whenever it edged closer to national power, but that may not hold true this time.\n\nMartigny said no one knew whether candidates from Macron's camp would consider dropping out of the second round to give rivals from the left a chance of beating the RN, or the reverse.\n\nLe Pen and Bardella have sought to make their party's image more acceptable to the mainstream, for example by denouncing antisemitism. Le Pen's father Jean-Marie Le Pen, founder and long-term leader of the RN's forerunner, had a history of overtly antisemitic comments.", "source": {"uri": "ca.news.yahoo.com", "dataType": "news",

"Millions of French vote in snap polls as far right eyes power", "body": "French President Emmanuel Macron and his wife Brigitte vote in the first round of snap parliamentary elections in Le Touquet, northern France\n\nFrench voters turned out in large numbers on Sunday for the first round of high-stakes snap parliamentary elections which could alter France's trajectory and see the far-right party of Marine Le Pen take power in a historic first.\n\nPresident Emmanuel Macron stunned the nation by calling snap polls after the far-right National Rally (RN) party's strong showing in European Parliament elections this month.\n\nWith Russia's war against Ukraine in its third year and energy and food prices much higher, support for the anti-immigration and eurosceptic party has surged despite Macron's pledges to prevent its ascent.\n\nThe two-round vote could put the far-right in power in France for the first time since the Nazi occupation in World War II.\n\nPresented with a crucial choice about France's future, many said they could not stay home, while political observers pointed to the highest voter turnout in decades.\n\nIn the southern city of Marseille, Nabil Agueni said he skipped the European elections but voted on Sunday.\n\n\"As long as we have a choice, it's better to go and vote\", the 40-year-old said.\n\n- 'Keep fighting' -\n\nIn the southwestern city of Bordeaux, Roxane Lebrun, 40, sounded worried.\n\n\"I don't recognise my country anymore,\" she said. \"We have to keep fighting for what we believe in and what we want for France.\"\n\nJulien Martin, a 38-year-old architect, added: \"These are not easy elections, the results are very uncertain, and the repercussions could be serious for society.\"\n\nMacron and his wife Brigitte cast their ballots in Le Touquet in northern France, with the 46-year-old president seen taking selfies and mingling with supporters.\n\nAs of noon, turnout in mainland France stood at 25.90 percent, an increase from the 18.43 percent recorded in legislative elections in 2022.\n\n\"This is the highest level since the 1981 legislative elections,\" Mathieu Gallard, research director at the Ipsos polling institute, said on X (formerly Twitter).\n\nAccording to most polls, the RN party is on course to win the largest number of seats in the National Assembly, parliament's lower house, although it remains unclear if it will secure an outright majority.\n\n- Predictions of deadlock -\n\nFinal opinion polls have given the RN between 35 percent and 37 percent of the vote, compared to 27.5-29 percent for the left-wing New Popular Front alliance, and 20-21 percent for Macron's centrist camp.\n\nMujtaba Rahman, Europe head at Eurasia Group, a risk consultancy, said turnout was key to the outcome of the election.\n\n\"The higher the turnout, the more candidates qualify,\" he said on X.\n\nHe said that the left-wing alliance and Macron's centrist camp would be able \"to make deals to withdraw worst-placed candidates and allow the others a free run against the far right candidate\" in the second round of voting.\n\nPolling stations opened across mainland France at 8:00 am (0600 GMT) and will close 12 hours later, immediately followed by projections that usually predict the result with a degree of accuracy.\n\nPrime Minister Gabriel Attal was set to make a statement on Sunday evening, his team said.\n\nIf the RN obtains an absolute majority, party chief Jordan Bardella, Le Pen's 28-year-old protege with no governing experience, could become prime minister in a tense \"cohabitation\" with Macron.\n\nMany analysts say that France is facing a hung Assembly, which could lead to deadlock and political instability.\n\nThe shape of the new parliament will become clear after the second round on July 7.\n\n- Spike in hate speech -\n\nVoters in France's overseas territories had cast ballots earlier in the weekend.\n\nElectors lined up to cast ballots in France's Pacific territory of New Caledonia, where tensions remain high following deadly riots there last month.\n\n\"It should be well attended, but I don't know if everyone will play along and come out to vote,\" said nurse Cassandre Cazaux.\n\nMacron's decision to call the snap vote plunged the country into political turmoil and sparked uncertainty in Europe's second-biggest economy.\n\nThe Paris stock exchange suffered its biggest monthly decline in two years in June, dropping by 6.4 percent, according to figures released on Friday.\n\nIn an editorial, French daily Le Monde said it was time to mobilise against the far right.\n\n\"Yielding any power to it means nothing less than taking the risk of seeing everything that has been built and conquered over more than two and a half centuries gradually being undone,\" it said.\n\nMany have pointed to a spike in hate speech, intolerance and racism during the charged campaign. A video of two RN supporters verbally assaulting a black woman has gone viral in recent days.\n\nMacron has deplored \"racism or anti-Semitism\".\n\nSupport for Macron's centrist camp tumbled during the campaign, while left-wing parties put their bickering aside to form the New Popular Front, in a nod to an alliance founded in 1936 to combat fascism.\n\nAnalysts say Le Pen's years-long efforts to clean up the image of a party co-founded by a former Waffen SS member have been paying off.\n\nA defiant Macron has stood by his decision to call the elections, while warning voters that a win by the far right or hard left could spark a \"civil war.\"\n\nbur-as/rox", "source": {"uri": "ktbs.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "KTBS"}, "authors": [{"uri": "anna_smolchenko@ktbs.com", "name": "Anna

Most constituencies will need a second round involving all candidates who received votes from at least 12.5 per cent of registered voters in the first round.

Le Pen's father Jean-Marie Le Pen, founder and long-term leader of the RN, had a history of overtly anti-Semitic comments.\n\nBut critics say the RN's courting of Jews is just a cover allowing it to

577-member National Assembly, parliament's lower house, although it remains unclear if the party will secure an outright majority.\n\n\"Victory is within our grasp, so let's seize this historic opportunity and get out and vote!\" Ms Le Pen wrote on X on Friday, vowing to bolster purchasing power and \"curb insecurity and immigration\".\n\nA high turnout is predicted and final opinion polls have given the RN between 35 per cent and 37 per cent of the vote, against 27.5 per cent to 29 per cent for the left-wing New Popular Front alliance, and 20 per cent to 21 per cent for Mr Macron's centrist camp.\n\nOn Monday, Mr Macron plans to convene a government meeting to decide the course of action ahead of the second round of voting on July 7.\n\nFrance is heading for a year of political chaos and confusion with a hung assembly, said Mujtaba Rahman, Europe head at Eurasia Group, a risk consultancy.\n\n\"There is no precedent in recent French politics for such an impasse,\" Mr Rahman said.\n\nSome 49 million French are eligible to vote.\n\nBrice Teinturier, head of the Ipsos polling firm, said there were two tendencies coming out of the campaign.\n\n\"One is a dynamic of hope\" with left-wing and RN supporters believing that \"there can be a change\".\n\nBut Mr Teinturier also highlighted \"the negative politicisation, the fear, the dread caused\" by the RN and the hard-left France Unbowed party which is part of the left-wing coalition.\n\nMr Macron apparently hoped to catch political opponents off guard by presenting voters with a crucial choice about France's future, but observers say he might have lost his gamble.\n\nMany have pointed to a spike in hate speech, intolerance and racism during the charged campaign.\n\nSpeaking in Brussels late on Thursday, Mr Macron deplored \"racism or anti-Semitism\".\n\nMr Macron has stood by his decision to call the elections, while warning voters that a win by the far right or hard left could spark a \"civil war\" in France.\n\nHe has insisted he will serve out the remainder of his second term until 2027, no matter which party wins.", "source": {"uri": "thenationalnews.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The

Her eurosceptic, anti-immigrant party was a longtime pariah but is now closer to power than it has ever been.\n\nPolls opened at 0600 GMT and will close at 1600 GMT in small towns and cities, with an 1800 GMT finish in the bigger cities, when the first exit polls for the night and seat projections for the decisive second round a week later are expected.\n\nHowever the electoral system can make it hard to estimate the precise distribution of seats in the 577-seat National Assembly, and the final outcome will not be known until the end of voting on July 7.\n\n\"We are going to win an absolute majority,\" said Le Pen in a newspaper interview on Wednesday, predicting that her prot\u00e9g\u00e9, 28-year-old Jordan Bardella would be prime minister. Her party has a high-spending economic programme and seeks to reduce immigration.\n\nIf the RN does win an absolute majority, French diplomacy could be headed for an unprecedented period of turbulence: with Macron - who has said he will continue his presidency until the end of his term in 2027 - and Bardella jostling for the right to speak for France.\n\nAt a voting station in Sevres, on the outskirts of Paris, 70-year-old former company director Didier Delacroix said he had voted for Macron's alliance.\n\n\"Otherwise it'll be a complete mess,\" he said.\n\nFrance has had three periods of \"cohabitation\" - when the president and government are from opposite political camps - in its post-war history, but none with such radically divergent world views competing at the top of the state.\n\nBardella has already indicated he would challenge Macron on global issues. France could lurch from being a pillar of the EU to a thorn in its side, demanding a rebate of the French contribution to the EU budget, clashing with Brussels over European Commission jobs and reversing Macron's calls for greater EU unity and assertiveness on defence.\n\nA clear RN victory would also bring uncertainty as to where France stands on the Russia-Ukraine war. Le Pen has a history of pro-Russian sentiment and while the party now says it would help Ukraine defend itself against Russian invaders, it has also set out red lines, such as refusing to provide long-range missiles.\n\n'SPLIT VOTE FAVOURS RN'\n\nOpinion polls have suggested the RN has a comfortable lead of 33-36% of the popular vote, with a hastily assembled left-wing coalition, the New Popular Front, in second place on 28-31% and Macron's centrist alliance in third on 20-23%.\n\nThe New Popular Front includes a wide range of parties, from the moderate centre-left to the hard-left, eurosceptic, anti-NATO party France Unbowed, led by one of Macron's most vitriolic opponents, Jean-Luc Melenchon.\n\nHow the poll numbers will translate into seats in the National Assembly is hard to predict because of how the election works, said Vincent Martigny, professor of political science at the University of Nice and the Ecole Polytechnique.\n\nCandidates can be elected in the first round if they win an absolute majority of votes in their constituency, but that is rare. Most constituencies will need a second round involving all candidates who received votes from at least 12.5% of registered voters in the first round. The top scorer wins.\n\n\"If you have a very high level of participation you might have a third or fourth party that is getting into the struggle. So then of course there's a risk of split voting and we know that the split vote favours the National Rally,\" said Martigny.\n\nFor decades, as the far right steadily gained popularity, voters and parties who did not support it would unite against it whenever it edged closer to national power, but that may not hold true this time.\n\nMartigny said no one knew whether candidates from Macron's camp would consider dropping out of the second round to give rivals from the left a chance of beating the RN, or the reverse.\n\nLe Pen and Bardella have sought to make their party's image more acceptable to the mainstream, for example by denouncing antisemitism. Le Pen's father Jean-Marie Le Pen, founder and long-term leader of the RN's forerunner, had a history of overtly antisemitic comments.\n\nBut critics say the RN's courting of Jews is just a cover allowing it to deny accusations of racism while constantly stigmatising Muslims and foreigners.\n\n(Additional reporting by Paris bureauWriting by Estelle ShirbonEditing by Frances Kerry and Gareth

Some 49 million people are eligible to vote.\n\nCassandre Cazaux, a nurse who voted in France's Pacific territory of New Caledonia, where tensions remain high following last month's deadly riots, said the elections were \"decisive\".\n\n\"It should be well attended, but I don't know if everyone will play along and come out to vote,\" she said.\n\nElections for the 577 seats in the National Assembly are a two-round process. The shape of the new parliament will become clear after the second round on July 7.\n\nMost polls show the RN on course to win the largest number of seats in the National Assembly, parliament's lower house, although it remains unclear if the party will secure an outright majority.\n\nA high turnout is predicted and final opinion polls have given the RN between 35 percent and 37 percent of the vote, against 27.5-29 percent for the left-wing New Popular Front alliance and 20-21 percent for Macron's centrist camp.\n\nIf the RN obtains an absolute majority, party chief Jordan Bardella, Le Pen's 28-year-old protege with no governing experience, could become prime minister in a tense \"cohabitation\" with Macron.\n\nOn Monday, Macron plans to convene a government meeting to decide the further course of action, government sources told AFP.\n\nFrance is heading for a year of political chaos and confusion with a hung Assembly, said Mujtaba Rahman, Europe head at Eurasia Group, a risk consultancy.\n\n\"There is no precedent in recent French politics for such an impasse,\" Rahman said.\n\nMacron's decision to call the snap vote after the RN's strong showing in European Parliament elections this month stunned friends and foes and sparked uncertainty in Europe's second-biggest economy.\n\nThe Paris stock exchange suffered its biggest monthly decline in two years in June, dropping by 6.4 percent, according to figures released on Friday.\n\nIn an editorial, French daily Le Monde said it was time to mobilise against the far right.\n\n\"Yielding any power to it means nothing less than taking the risk of seeing everything that has been built and conquered over more than two and a half centuries gradually being undone,\" it said.\n\nWielding mops and buckets, several activists of the Femen feminist collective dressed as cleaners on Saturday demonstrated bare-breasted at the Trocadero in Paris, chanting slogans against the extreme right.\n\nSeparately, tens of thousands of people joined an LGBTQ Pride march in Paris, with some carrying placards targeting the far right.\n\n\"I think it's even more important right now to fight against hatred in general, in all its forms,\" said 19-year-old student Themis Hallin-Mallet.\n\nMany have pointed to a spike in hate speech, intolerance and racism during the charged campaign. A video of two RN supporters verbally assaulting a black woman has gone viral in recent days.\n\nMacron has deplored \"racism or anti-Semitism\".\n\nHe apparently hoped to catch political opponents off guard by presenting voters with a crucial choice about France's future, but observers say he might have lost his gamble.\n\nSupport for Macron's centrist camp has collapsed, while left-wing parties put their bickering aside to form the New Popular Front, in a nod to an alliance founded in 1936 to combat fascism.\n\nAnalysts say Le Pen's years-long efforts to clean up the image of a party co-founded by a former Waffen SS member have been paying off.\n\nThe party has promised to bolster purchasing power, curb immigration and boost law and order.\n\nA defiant Macron has stood by his decision to call the elections, while warning voters that a win by the far right or hard left could spark a \"civil war\".\n\nHe has insisted he will serve out the remainder of his second term until

| FOX 28 Spokane", "body": "French voters turned out in large numbers on Sunday for the first round of high-stakes snap parliamentary elections which could alter France's trajectory and see the far-right party of Marine Le Pen take power in a historic first.\n\nPresident Emmanuel Macron stunned the nation by calling snap polls after the far-right National Rally (RN) party's strong showing in European Parliament elections this month.\n\nWith Russia's war against Ukraine in its third year and energy and food prices much higher, support for the anti-immigration and eurosceptic party has surged despite Macron's pledges to prevent its ascent.\n\nThe two-round vote could put the far-right in power in France for the first time since the Nazi occupation in World War II.\n\nPresented with a crucial choice about France's future, many said they could not stay home, while political observers pointed to the highest voter turnout in decades.\n\nIn the southern city of Marseille, Nabil Agueni said he skipped the European elections but voted on Sunday.\n\n\"As long as we have a choice, it's better to go and vote\", the 40-year-old said.\n\n- 'Keep fighting' -\n\nIn the southwestern city of Bordeaux, Roxane Lebrun, 40, sounded worried.\n\n\"I don't recognise my country anymore,\" she said. \"We have to keep fighting for what we believe in and what we want for France.\"\n\nJulien Martin, a 38-year-old architect, added: \"These are not easy elections, the results are very uncertain, and the repercussions could be serious for society.\"\n\nMacron and his wife Brigitte cast their ballots in Le Touquet in northern France, with the 46-year-old president seen taking selfies and mingling with supporters.\n\nAs of noon, turnout in mainland France stood at 25.90 percent, an increase from the 18.43 percent recorded in legislative elections in 2022.\n\n\"This is the highest level since the 1981 legislative elections,\" Mathieu Gallard, research director at the Ipsos polling institute, said on X (formerly Twitter).\n\nAccording to most polls, the RN party is on course to win the largest number of seats in the National Assembly, parliament's lower house, although it remains unclear if it will secure an outright majority.\n\n- Predictions of deadlock -\n\nFinal opinion polls have given the RN between 35 percent and 37 percent of the vote, compared to 27.5-29 percent for the left-wing New Popular Front alliance, and 20-21 percent for Macron's centrist camp.\n\nMujtaba Rahman, Europe head at Eurasia Group, a risk consultancy, said turnout was key to the outcome of the election.\n\n\"The higher the turnout, the more candidates qualify,\" he said on X.\n\nHe said that the left-wing alliance and Macron's centrist camp would be able \"to make deals to withdraw worst-placed candidates and allow the others a free run against the far right candidate\" in the second round of voting.\n\nPolling stations opened across mainland France at 8:00 am (0600 GMT) and will close 12 hours later, immediately followed by projections that usually predict the result with a degree of accuracy.\n\nPrime Minister Gabriel Attal was set to make a statement on Sunday evening, his team said.\n\nIf the RN obtains an absolute majority, party chief Jordan Bardella, Le Pen's 28-year-old protege with no governing experience, could become prime minister in a tense \"cohabitation\" with Macron.\n\nMany analysts say that France is facing a hung Assembly, which could lead to deadlock and political instability.\n\nThe shape of the new parliament will become clear after the second round on July 7.\n\n- Spike in hate speech -\n\nVoters in France's overseas territories had cast ballots earlier in the weekend.\n\nElectors lined up to cast ballots in France's Pacific territory of New Caledonia, where tensions remain high following deadly riots there last month.\n\n\"It should be well attended, but I don't know if everyone will play along and come out to vote,\" said nurse Cassandre Cazaux.\n\nMacron's decision to call the snap vote plunged the country into political turmoil and sparked uncertainty in Europe's second-biggest economy.\n\nThe Paris stock exchange suffered its biggest monthly decline in two years in June, dropping by 6.4 percent, according to figures released on Friday.\n\nIn an editorial, French daily Le Monde said it was time to mobilise against the far right.\n\n\"Yielding any power to it means nothing less than taking the risk of seeing everything that has been built and conquered over more than two and a half centuries gradually being undone,\" it said.\n\nMany have pointed to a spike in hate speech, intolerance and racism during the charged campaign. A video of two RN supporters verbally assaulting a black woman has gone viral in recent days.\n\nMacron has deplored \"racism or anti-Semitism\".\n\nSupport for Macron's centrist camp tumbled during the campaign, while left-wing parties put their bickering aside to form the New Popular Front, in a nod to an alliance founded in 1936 to combat fascism.\n\nAnalysts say Le Pen's years-long efforts to clean up the image of a party co-founded by a former Waffen SS member have been paying off.\n\nA defiant Macron has stood by his decision to call the elections, while warning voters that a win by the far right or hard left could spark a \"civil war.\"\n\nbur-as/rox\n\nFOX28 Spokane\u00a9", "source": {"uri": "fox28spokane.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "FOX 28 Spokane"}, "authors": [],

Her eurosceptic, anti-immigrant party was a longtime pariah but is now closer to power than it has ever been.\n\nPolls open at 0600 GMT, closing at 1600 GMT in small towns and cities, and at 1800 GMT in the bigger cities, when the first exit polls for the night and seat projections for the decisive second round a week later are expected.\n\nHowever the electoral system can make it hard to estimate the precise distribution of seats in the 577-seat National Assembly, and the final outcome will not be known until the end of voting on July 7.\n\n\"We are going to win an absolute majority,\" said Le Pen in a newspaper interview on Wednesday, predicting that her prot\u00e9g\u00e9, 28-year-old Jordan Bardella would be prime minister. Her party has a high-spending economic programme and seeks to reduce immigration.\n\nIf the RN does win an absolute majority, French diplomacy could be headed for an unprecedented period of turbulence: with Macron - who has said he will continue his presidency until the end of his term in 2027 - and Bardella jostling for the right to speak for France.\n\nFrance has had three periods of \"cohabitation\" - when the president and government are from opposite political camps - in its post-war history, but none with such radically divergent world views competing at the top of the state.\n\nRead more: France arrests 8 in New Caledonia including independence leader\n\nBardella has already indicated he would challenge Macron on global issues. France could lurch from being a pillar of the EU to a thorn in its side, demanding a rebate of the French contribution to the EU budget, clashing with Brussels over European Commission jobs and reversing Macron's calls for greater EU unity and assertiveness on defence.\n\nA clear RN victory would also bring uncertainty as to where France stands on the Russia-Ukraine war. Le Pen has a history of pro-Russian sentiment and while the party now says it would help Ukraine defend itself against Russian invaders, it has also set out red lines, such as refusing to provide long-range missiles.\n\nOpinion polls have suggested the RN has a comfortable lead of 33-36% of the popular vote, with a hastily assembled left-wing coalition, the New Popular Front, in second place on 28-31% and Macron's centrist alliance in third on 20-23%.\n\nThe New Popular Front includes a wide range of parties, from the moderate centre-left to the hard-left, eurosceptic, anti-NATO party France Unbowed, led by one of Macron's most vitriolic opponents, Jean-Luc Melenchon.\n\nHow the poll numbers will translate into seats in the National Assembly is hard to predict because of how the election works, said Vincent Martigny, professor of political science at the University of Nice and the Ecole Polytechnique.\n\nCandidates can be elected in the first round if they win an absolute majority of votes in their constituency, but that is rare. Most constituencies will need a second round involving all candidates who received votes from at least 12.5% of registered voters in the first round. The top scorer wins.\n\n\"If you have a very high level of participation you might have a third or fourth party that is getting into the struggle. So then of course there's a risk of split voting and we know that the split vote favours the National Rally,\" said Martigny.\n\nFor decades, as the far right steadily gained popularity, voters and parties who did not support it would unite against it whenever it edged closer to national power, but that may not hold true this time.\n\nMartigny said no one knew whether candidates from Macron's camp would consider dropping out of the second round to give rivals from the left a chance of beating the RN, or the reverse.\n\nLe Pen and Bardella have sought to make their party's image more acceptable to the mainstream, for example by denouncing antisemitism. Le Pen's father Jean-Marie Le Pen, founder and long-term leader of the RN's forerunner, had a history of overtly antisemitic comments.\n\nBut critics say the RN's courting of Jews is just a cover allowing it to deny accusations of racism while constantly stigmatising Muslims and foreigners.", "source": {"uri": "arynews.tv", "dataType": "news", "title": "ARY NEWS"}, "authors": [{"uri":

Her eurosceptic, anti-immigrant party was a longtime pariah but is now closer to power than it has ever been.\n\nPolls open at 0600 GMT, closing at 1600 GMT in small towns and cities, and at 1800 GMT in the bigger cities, when the first exit polls for the night and seat projections for the decisive second round a week later are expected.\n\nExplained | Will France's snap elections spark the next euro crisis?\n\nHowever the electoral system can make it hard to estimate the precise distribution of seats in the 577-seat National Assembly, and the final outcome will not be known until the end of voting on July 7.\n\n\"We are going to win an absolute majority,\" said Le Pen in a newspaper interview on Wednesday, predicting that her prot\u00e9g\u00e9, 28-year-old Jordan Bardella would be prime minister. Her party has a high-spending economic programme and seeks to reduce immigration.\n\nIf the RN does win an absolute majority, French diplomacy could be headed for an unprecedented period of turbulence: with Macron - who has said he will continue his presidency until the end of his term in 2027 - and Bardella jostling for the right to speak for France.\n\nFrance has had three periods of \"cohabitation\" - when the president and government are from opposite political camps - in its post-war history, but none with such radically divergent world views competing at the top of the state.\n\nBardella has already indicated he would challenge Macron on global issues. France could lurch from being a pillar of the EU to a thorn in its side, demanding a rebate of the French contribution to the EU budget, clashing with Brussels over European Commission jobs and reversing Macron's calls for greater EU unity and assertiveness on defence.\n\nAlso in Explained | How France's snap legislative elections are shaping up\n\nA clear RN victory would also bring uncertainty as to where France stands on the Russia-Ukraine war. Le Pen has a history of pro-Russian sentiment and while the party now says it would help Ukraine defend itself against Russian invaders, it has also set out red lines, such as refusing to provide long-range missiles.\n\n'SPLIT VOTE FAVOURS RN'\n\nOpinion polls have suggested the RN has a comfortable lead of 33-36% of the popular vote, with a hastily assembled left-wing coalition, the New Popular Front, in second place on 28-31% and Macron's centrist alliance in third on 20-23%.\n\nThe New Popular Front includes a wide range of parties, from the moderate centre-left to the hard-left, eurosceptic, anti-NATO party France Unbowed, led by one of Macron's most vitriolic opponents, Jean-Luc Melenchon.\n\nHow the poll numbers will translate into seats in the National Assembly is hard to predict because of how the election works, said Vincent Martigny, professor of political science at the University of Nice and the Ecole Polytechnique.\n\nCandidates can be elected in the first round if they win an absolute majority of votes in their constituency, but that is rare. Most constituencies will need a second round involving all candidates who received votes from at least 12.5% of registered voters in the first round. The top scorer wins.\n\nDon't Miss | France elections: What is cohabitation?\n\n\"If you have a very high level of participation you might have a third or fourth party that is getting into the struggle. So then of course there's a risk of split voting and we know that the split vote favours the National Rally,\" said Martigny.\n\nFor decades, as the far right steadily gained popularity, voters and parties who did not support it would unite against it whenever it edged closer to national power, but that may not hold true this time.\n\nMartigny said no one knew whether candidates from Macron's camp would consider dropping out of the second round to give rivals from the left a chance of beating the RN, or the reverse.\n\nLe Pen and Bardella have sought to make their party's image more acceptable to the mainstream, for example by denouncing antisemitism. Le Pen's father Jean-Marie Le Pen, founder and long-term leader of the RN's forerunner, had a history of overtly antisemitic comments.\n\nBut critics say the RN's courting of Jews is just a cover allowing it to deny accusations of racism while constantly stigmatising Muslims and foreigners.", "source": {"uri": "indianexpress.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Indian Express"}, "authors":

A video of two RN supporters verbally assaulting a black woman has gone viral in recent days.\n\nMacron has deplored \"racism or anti-Semitism\".\n\nHe apparently hoped to catch political opponents off guard by presenting voters with a crucial choice about France's future, but observers say he might have lost his gamble.\n\nSupport for Macron's centrist camp appears to have collapsed, while left-wing parties put their bickering aside to form the New Popular Front, in a nod to an alliance founded in 1936 to combat fascism.\n\nAnalysts say Le Pen's years-long efforts to clean up the image of a party co-founded by a former Waffen SS member have been paying off.\n\nThe party has promised to bolster purchasing power, curb immigration and boost law and order.

The final results will not be known until the end of voting on July 7.\n\nEarlier this month, French President Emmanuel Macron stunned the nation when he called for a snap poll after his centrist alliance lost against Marine Le Pen's far-right National Rally (RN) in the European elections.\n\nLe Pen's eurosceptic, anti-immigrant party has been operating on the sidelines for years but now has a good chance of winning.\n\nThree major political blocs are competing in this election - Le Pen's RN, Macron's centrist alliance, and the New Popular Front coalition that includes centre-left, greens and hard-left parties.\n\nOpinion polls show that RN has a chance of winning an absolute majority or at least 289 out of the 577 seats in the National Assembly.\n\nA report by AFP citing the final opinion poll ahead of the election gave RN between 35 per cent and 37 per cent of the vote, followed by 27.5-29 per cent for the recently formed New Popular Front alliance and 20-21 per cent for Macron's party.\n\nFrance also witnessed massive demonstrations after Macron's announcement as people protested against both the far right and the French president's decision. A high turnout is expected in this election.\n\nThe outcome of this election is important as despite Macron's presidency which will continue until 2027, the National Assembly is the more powerful of France's two houses of parliament.\n\nAlso Read | UN says five bombs planted by ISIS years ago found hidden in Iraq's Al-Nuri mosque\n\nTherefore, if RN does win an absolute majority, it would not only weaken Macron's presidency but also French diplomacy could be headed for an unprecedented period of turbulence.\n\n\"We are going to win an absolute majority,\" said Le Pen in an interview last week, and predicted that her prot\u00e9g\u00e9, 28-year-old Jordan Bardella would be prime minister.\n\nThe RN has sought to spend more on the French economy and reduce immigration. Additionally, Bardella has already indicated he would challenge Macron on global issues.\n\n(With inputs from agencies)", "source": {"uri": "wionews.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "WION"},

President Macron called for the vote following his centrist alliance's defeat by Marine Le Pen's National Rally. High voter turnout reflected the electorate's engagement in the ongoing political crisis.\n\nFrench voters flocked to the polls on Sunday in the first round of a snap parliamentary election that could usher in the country's first far-right government since World War Two, a potential sea change at the heart of the European Union. President Emmanuel Macron stunned the country when he called the vote after his centrist alliance was crushed in European elections this month by Marine Le Pen's National Rally (RN). Her eurosceptic, anti-immigrant party was a longtime pariah but is now closer to power than it has ever been.\n\nPolls opened at 0600 GMT and will close at 1600 GMT in small towns and cities, with an 1800 GMT finish in the bigger cities, when the first exit polls for the night and seat projections for the decisive second round a week later are expected. Participation was high, underlining how France's rumbling political crisis has energized the electorate. By midday, turnout was at 25.9%, compared with 18.43% two years ago - the highest comparable turnout figures since the 1981 legislative vote, Ipsos France's research director Mathieu Gallard said.\n\nFrance's electoral system can make it hard to estimate the precise distribution of seats in the 577-seat National Assembly, and the final outcome will not be known until the end of the second round of voting on July 7. \"We are going to win an absolute majority,\" Le Pen said in a newspaper interview on Wednesday, predicting that her prot\u00e9g\u00e9, 28-year-old Jordan Bardella, would be prime minister.\n\nShe has sought to detoxify a party known for racism and antisemitism, a tactic that has worked amid voter anger at Macron, the high cost of living and growing concerns over immigration. In H\u00e9nin-Beaumont, a town in Le Pen's constituency in northern France where she may be re-elected in the first round, 67-year-old Denis Ledieu said people were suffering due to the long-term deindustrializaton of the region.\n\n\"So if the (RN) promises them things, then why not? They want to try it out, I think,\" he said. In Garches, a small town near Paris, a woman screamed \"It's shameful, it's shameful\" as Bardella arrived to cast his vote.\n\n\"They even invited the leftists,\" he said. On the other side of Paris, in the town of Meaux, 51-year-old Myl\u00e8ne Diop said she had voted for the New Popular Front, a hastily assembled left-wing coalition polling in second. She said it was \"the most important election\" of her life.\n\n\"The RN is at the gates of power and you see the aggressiveness of people and the racist speech that has been unleashed,\" she said. If the RN does win an absolute majority, French diplomacy could be headed for an unprecedented period of turbulence: with Macron - who has said he will continue his presidency until the end of his term in 2027 - and Bardella jostling for the right to speak for France.\n\nFrance has had three periods of \"cohabitation\" - when the president and government are from opposite political camps - in its post-war history, but none with such radically divergent world views competing at the top of the state. Bardella says he would challenge Macron on global issues. France could lurch from a pillar of the EU to a thorn in its side, demanding a rebate of its contribution to the EU budget, clashing with Brussels over European Commission jobs and reversing Macron's calls for greater EU unity on defence.\n\nA clear RN victory would also bring uncertainty as to where France stands on the Russia-Ukraine war. Le Pen has a history of pro-Russian sentiment and while the party now says it would help Ukraine defend itself against Russian invaders, it has also set out red lines, such as refusing to provide long-range missiles. 'SPLIT VOTE FAVOURS RN'\n\nOpinion polls have suggested the RN has a comfortable lead of 33%-36% of the popular vote, with the New Popular Front in second place on 28%-31% and Macron's centrist alliance in third on 20%-23%. The New Popular Front includes a wide range of parties, from the moderate centre-left to the hard-left, eurosceptic, anti-NATO party France Unbowed, led by one of Macron's most vitriolic opponents, Jean-Luc Melenchon.\n\nHow the poll numbers will translate into seats in the National Assembly is hard to predict because of how the election works, said Vincent Martigny, professor of political science at the University of Nice and the Ecole Polytechnique. Candidates can be elected in the first round if they win an absolute majority of votes in their constituency, but that is rare. Most constituencies will need a second round involving all candidates who received votes from at least 12.5% of registered voters in the first round. The top scorer wins.\n\n\"If you have a very high level of participation you might have a third or fourth party that is getting into the struggle. So then of course there's a risk of split voting and we know that the split vote favours the National Rally,\" Martigny said. For decades, as the RN steadily gained popularity, voters and parties joined forces to block it from winning power, but that may not hold true this time.

Some 49 million people are eligible to vote.\n\nCassandre Cazaux, a nurse who voted in France's Pacific territory of New Caledonia, where tensions remain high following last month's deadly riots, said the elections were \"decisive\".\n\n\"It should be well attended, but I don't know if everyone will play along and come out to vote,\" she said.\n\nElections for the 577 seats in the National Assembly are a two-round process. The shape of the new parliament will become clear after the second round on July 7.\n\nMost polls show the RN on course to win the largest number of seats in the National Assembly, parliament's lower house, although it remains unclear if the party will secure an outright majority.\n\nA high turnout is predicted and final opinion polls have given the RN between 35 percent and 37 percent of the vote, against 27.5-29 percent for the left-wing New Popular Front alliance and 20-21 percent for Macron's centrist camp.\n\nIf the RN obtains an absolute majority, party chief Jordan Bardella, Le Pen's 28-year-old protege with no governing experience, could become prime minister in a tense \"cohabitation\" with Macron.\n\nOn Monday, Macron plans to convene a government meeting to decide the further course of action, government sources told AFP.\n\nFrance is heading for a year of political chaos and confusion with a hung Assembly, said Mujtaba Rahman, Europe head at Eurasia Group, a risk consultancy.\n\n\"There is no precedent in recent French politics for such an impasse,\" Rahman said.\n\n- Calls to mobilise -\n\nMacron's decision to call the snap vote after the RN's strong showing in European Parliament elections this month stunned friends and foes and sparked uncertainty in Europe's second-biggest economy.\n\nThe Paris stock exchange suffered its biggest monthly decline in two years in June, dropping by 6.4 percent, according to figures released on Friday.\n\nIn an editorial, French daily Le Monde said it was time to mobilise against the far right.\n\n\"Yielding any power to it means nothing less than taking the risk of seeing everything that has been built and conquered over more than two and a half centuries gradually being undone,\" it said.\n\nWielding mops and buckets, several activists of the Femen feminist collective dressed as cleaners on Saturday demonstrated bare-breasted at the Trocadero in Paris, chanting slogans against the extreme right.\n\nSeparately, tens of thousands of people joined an LGBTQ Pride march in Paris, with some carrying placards targeting the far right.\n\n\"I think it's even more important right now to fight against hatred in general, in all its forms,\" said 19-year-old student Themis Hallin-Mallet.\n\n- Spike in hate speech -\n\nMany have pointed to a spike in hate speech, intolerance and racism during the charged campaign. A video of two RN supporters verbally assaulting a black woman has gone viral in recent days.\n\nMacron has deplored \"racism or anti-Semitism\".\n\nHe apparently hoped to catch political opponents off guard by presenting voters with a crucial choice about France's future, but observers say he might have lost his gamble.\n\nSupport for Macron's centrist camp has collapsed, while left-wing parties put their bickering aside to form the New Popular Front, in a nod to an alliance founded in 1936 to combat fascism.\n\nAnalysts say Le Pen's years-long efforts to clean up the image of a party co-founded by a former Waffen SS member have been paying off.\n\nThe party has promised to bolster purchasing power, curb immigration and boost law and order.\n\nA defiant Macron has stood by his decision to call the elections, while warning voters that a win by the far right or hard left could spark a \"civil war\".\n\nHe has insisted he will serve out the remainder of his second term until 2027, no matter which party wins.\n\nbur-as/imm\n\nMore from this section\n\nOld Vine Registry Marks One Year Anniversary and Announces Heritage Vine Hunt Contest\n\nEnergyCAP Named Market Leader in

REUTERS\n\nFrench voters cast their ballots on Sunday in the first round of a snap parliamentary election that could usher in the country's first far-right government since World War Two, a potential sea change at the heart of the European Union.\n\nPresident Emmanuel Macron stunned the country when he called the vote after his centrist alliance was crushed in European elections this month by Marine Le Pen's National Rally (RN). Her eurosceptic, anti-immigrant party was a longtime pariah but is now closer to power than it has ever been.\n\nPolls open at 0600 GMT, closing at 1600 GMT in small towns and cities, and at 1800 GMT in the bigger cities, when the first exit polls for the night and seat projections for the decisive second round a week later are expected.\n\nHowever the electoral system can make it hard to estimate the precise distribution of seats in the 577-seat National Assembly, and the final outcome will not be known until the end of voting on July 7.\n\n\"We are going to win an absolute majority,\" said Le Pen in a newspaper interview on Wednesday, predicting that her prot\u00e9g\u00e9, 28-year-old Jordan Bardella would be prime minister. Her party has a high-spending economic programme and seeks to reduce immigration.\n\nIf the RN does win an absolute majority, French diplomacy could be headed for an unprecedented period of turbulence: with Macron - who has said he will continue his presidency until the end of his term in 2027 - and Bardella jostling for the right to speak for France.\n\nFrance has had three periods of \"cohabitation\" - when the president and government are from opposite political camps - in its post-war history, but none with such radically divergent world views competing at the top of the state.\n\nBardella has already indicated he would challenge Macron on global issues. France could lurch from being a pillar of the EU to a thorn in its side, demanding a rebate of the French contribution to the EU budget, clashing with Brussels over European Commission jobs and reversing Macron's calls for greater EU unity and assertiveness on defence.\n\nA clear RN victory would also bring uncertainty as to where France stands on the Russia-Ukraine war. Le Pen has a history of pro-Russian sentiment and while the party now says it would help Ukraine defend itself against Russian invaders, it has also set out red lines, such as refusing to provide long-range missiles.\n\nOpinion polls have suggested the RN has a comfortable lead of 33-36% of the popular vote, with a hastily assembled left-wing coalition, the New Popular Front, in second place on 28-31% and Macron's centrist alliance in third on 20-23%.\n\nThe New Popular Front includes a wide range of parties, from the moderate centre-left to the hard-left, eurosceptic, anti-NATO party France Unbowed, led by one of Macron's most vitriolic opponents, Jean-Luc Melenchon.\n\nHow the poll numbers will translate into seats in the National Assembly is hard to predict because of how the election works, said Vincent Martigny, professor of political science at the University of Nice and the Ecole Polytechnique.\n\nCandidates can be elected in the first round if they win an absolute majority of votes in their constituency, but that is rare. Most constituencies will need a second round involving all candidates who received votes from at least 12.5% of registered voters in the first round. The top scorer wins.\n\n\"If you have a very high level of participation you might have a third or fourth party that is getting into the struggle. So then of course there's a risk of split voting and we know that the split vote favours the National Rally,\" said Martigny.\n\nFor decades, as the far right steadily gained popularity, voters and parties who did not support it would unite against it whenever it edged closer to national power, but that may not hold true this time.\n\nMartigny said no one knew whether candidates from Macron's camp would consider dropping out of the second round to give rivals from the left a chance of beating the RN, or the reverse.\n\nLe Pen and Bardella have sought to make their party's image more acceptable to the mainstream, for example by denouncing antisemitism. Le Pen's father Jean-Marie Le Pen, founder and long-term leader of the RN's forerunner, had a history of overtly antisemitic comments.\n\nBut critics say the RN's courting of Jews is just a cover allowing it to deny accusations of racism while constantly stigmatising Muslims and foreigners.", "source": {"uri": "bdnews24.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "bdnews24.com"}, "authors": [{"uri":

Some 49 million people are eligible to vote.\n\n\"These are not easy elections, the results are very uncertain, and the repercussions could be serious for society,\" said Julien Martin, a 38-year-old architect in the southwestern city of Bordeaux.\n\nVoters lined up to cast their ballots in France's Pacific territory of New Caledonia, where tensions remain high following last month's deadly riots.\n\nThe vote is \"decisive\", said Cassandre Cazaux, a nurse.\n\nCazaux added:\n\nBy midday local time, turnout in the archipelago, which is located between Australia and Fiji, stood at 32.4%, compared to 13.06% recorded during the 2022 legislative polls.\n\nFormer president Nicolas Sarkozy, Greens party leader Marine Tondelier, and former prime minister and Macron ally Edouard Philippe were among the first high-profile politicians to vote.\n\nPhilippe, the mayor of Le Havre in northern France who has made little effort to hide his ambitions for the presidency, was seen smiling and chatting to locals on Sunday morning.\n\nElections for the 577 seats in the National Assembly are a two-round process.

Her eurosceptic, anti-immigrant party was a longtime pariah but is now closer to power than it has ever been.\n\nPolls open at 0600 GMT, closing at 1600 GMT in small towns and cities, and at 1800 GMT in the bigger cities, when the first exit polls for the night and seat projections for the decisive second round a week later are expected.\n\nHowever the electoral system can make it hard to estimate the precise distribution of seats in the 577-seat National Assembly, and the final outcome will not be known until the end of voting on July 7.\n\n\"We are going to win an absolute majority,\" said Le Pen in a newspaper interview on Wednesday, predicting that her prot\u00e9g\u00e9, 28-year-old Jordan Bardella would be prime minister. Her party has a high-spending economic programme and seeks to reduce immigration.\n\nIf the RN does win an absolute majority, French diplomacy could be headed for an unprecedented period of turbulence: with Macron - who has said he will continue his presidency until the end of his term in 2027 - and Bardella jostling for the right to speak for France.\n\nFrance has had three periods of \"cohabitation\" - when the president and government are from opposite political camps - in its post-war history, but none with such radically divergent world views competing at the top of the state.\n\nBardella has already indicated he would challenge Macron on global issues. France could lurch from being a pillar of the EU to a thorn in its side, demanding a rebate of the French contribution to the EU budget, clashing with Brussels over European Commission jobs and reversing Macron's calls for greater EU unity and assertiveness on defence.\n\nA clear RN victory would also bring uncertainty as to where France stands on the Russia-Ukraine war. Le Pen has a history of pro-Russian sentiment and while the party now says it would help Ukraine defend itself against Russian invaders, it has also set out red lines, such as refusing to provide long-range missiles.\n\nOpinion polls have suggested the RN has a comfortable lead of 33-36% of the popular vote, with a hastily assembled left-wing coalition, the New Popular Front, in second place on 28-31% and Macron's centrist alliance in third on 20-23%.\n\nThe New Popular Front includes a wide range of parties, from the moderate centre-left to the hard-left, eurosceptic, anti-NATO party France Unbowed, led by one of Macron's most vitriolic opponents, Jean-Luc Melenchon.\n\nHow the poll numbers will translate into seats in the National Assembly is hard to predict because of how the election works, said Vincent Martigny, professor of political science at the University of Nice and the Ecole Polytechnique.\n\nCandidates can be elected in the first round if they win an absolute majority of votes in their constituency, but that is rare. Most constituencies will need a second round involving all candidates who received votes from at least 12.5% of registered voters in the first round. The top scorer wins.\n\n\"If you have a very high level of participation you might have a third or fourth party that is getting into the struggle. So then of course there's a risk of split voting and we know that the split vote favours the National Rally,\" said Martigny.\n\nFor decades, as the far right steadily gained popularity, voters and parties who did not support it would unite against it whenever it edged closer to national power, but that may not hold true this time.\n\nMartigny said no one knew whether candidates from Macron's camp would consider dropping out of the second round to give rivals from the left a chance of beating the RN, or the reverse.\n\nLe Pen and Bardella have sought to make their party's image more acceptable to the mainstream, for example by denouncing antisemitism. Le Pen's father Jean-Marie Le Pen, founder and long-term leader of the RN's forerunner, had a history of overtly antisemitic comments.", "source": {"uri": "tbsnews.net", "dataType": "news", "title":

A video of two RN supporters verbally assaulting a black woman has gone viral in recent days.\n\nMacron has deplored \"racism or anti-Semitism\".\n\nSupport for Macron's centrist camp tumbled during the campaign, while left-wing parties put their bickering aside to form the New Popular Front, in a nod to an alliance founded in 1936 to combat fascism.\n\nAnalysts say Le Pen's years-long efforts to clean up the image of a party co-founded by a former Waffen SS member have been paying off.\n\nA defiant Macron has stood by his decision to call the elections, while warning voters that a win by the far right or hard left could spark a \"civil war.\"", "source": {"uri": "urdupoint.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "UrduPoint"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

The shape of the new parliament will become clear after the second round on July 7.\n\nMost polls show the RN on course to win the largest number of seats in the National Assembly, parliament's lower house, although it remains unclear if the party will secure an outright majority.\n\nFinal opinion polls have given the RN between 35 percent and 37 percent of the vote, against 27.5-29 percent for the left-wing New Popular Front alliance and 20-21 percent for Macron's centrist camp.\n\nIf the RN obtains an absolute majority, party chief Jordan Bardella, Le Pen's 28-year-old protege with no governing experience, could become prime minister in a tense \"cohabitation\" with Macron.\n\nMany analysts say that France is facing a hung Assembly, which could lead to deadlock and political instability.\n\n- 'Fight against hatred' -\n\nMacron's decision to call the snap vote after the RN's strong showing in European Parliament elections this month stunned friends and foes and sparked uncertainty in Europe's second-biggest economy.\n\nThe Paris stock exchange suffered its biggest monthly decline in two years in June, dropping by 6.4 percent, according to figures released on Friday.\n\nIn an editorial, French daily Le Monde said it was time to mobilise against the far right.\n\n\"Yielding any power to it means nothing less than taking the risk of seeing everything that has been built and conquered over more than two and a half centuries gradually being undone,\" it said.\n\nWielding mops and buckets, several activists of the Femen feminist collective dressed as cleaners on Saturday demonstrated bare-breasted at the Trocadero in Paris, chanting slogans against the extreme right.\n\nSeparately, more than 100,000 joined an LGBTQ Pride march in Paris, with some carrying placards targeting the far right.\n\n\"I think it's even more important right now to fight against hatred in general, in all its forms,\" said 19-year-old student Themis Hallin-Mallet.\n\n- Spike in hate speech -\n\nMany have pointed to a spike in hate speech, intolerance and racism during the charged campaign. A video of two RN supporters verbally assaulting a black woman has gone viral in recent days.\n\nMacron has deplored \"racism or anti-Semitism\".\n\nHe apparently hoped to catch political opponents off guard by presenting voters with a crucial choice about France's future, but observers say he might have lost his gamble.\n\nSupport for Macron's centrist camp has collapsed, while left-wing parties put their bickering aside to form the New Popular Front, in a nod to an alliance founded in 1936 to combat fascism.\n\nAnalysts say Le Pen's years-long efforts to clean up the image of a party co-founded by a former Waffen SS member have been paying off.\n\nThe party has promised to bolster purchasing power, curb immigration and boost law and order.\n\nA defiant Macron has stood by his decision to call the elections, while warning voters that a win by the far right or hard left could spark a \"civil war\".\n\nbur-as/cw\n\nMore from this section\n\nCelebrating the Success of The

The top scorer wins.\n\nVincent Martigny, professor of political science at the University of Nice and the Ecole Polytechnique, said this opens the door for the RN.\n\n\"If you have a very high level of participation you might have a third or fourth party that is getting into the struggle,\" said Prof Martigny.\n\n\"So then of course there's a risk of split voting and we know that the split vote

to moderate the party's extremist image.\n\nIf elected, Mr Bardella said he will propose immediate legislation on to tackle what the party calls the \"flood\" of migration to the lower house of parliament within weeks.\n\nIt would abolish the policy of automatically granting French nationality at 18 to people born in France to foreign parents, providing they have lived here for at least five years since the age of 11.\n\nThe RN also has plans to toughen conditions for family reunification.\n\nAmong its other policies would be a policy of giving French citizens priority access to housing and jobs, with welfare benefits limited to French nationals.\n\nUnder RN there would be strict conditions of assimilation for those seeking citizenship including mastery of the French language and respect for French laws and customs.\n\nMr Bardella said some of the measures would be put to a nationwide referendum in 2027, following the presidential election that year, in a bid to sidestep challenges from the Constitutional Council.\n\nThe council has previously ruled that RN-proposed changes to French immigration law were unconstitutional.\n\nIf the RN does win an absolute majority, French diplomacy could be heading for an unprecedented period of turbulence as Mr Macron and Mr Bardella jostling for the right to speak for France.\n\nA clear RN victory would also bring uncertainty

have opened in the first round of a snap parliamentary election in France that could usher in the country's first far-right government since World War II - a potential sea change at the heart of the European Union.\n\nPresident Emmanuel Macron stunned the country when he called the vote after his centrist alliance was crushed in European elections in June by Marine Le Pen's National Rally.\n\nHer Eurosceptic, anti-immigrant party was a longtime pariah but is now closer to power than it has ever been.\n\nPolls opened at 0600 GMT on Sunday and will close at 1600 GMT in small towns and cities, with an 1800 GMT finish in the bigger cities, when the first exit polls for the night and seat projections for the decisive second round a week later are expected.\n\nHowever, the electoral system can make it hard to estimate the precise distribution of seats in the 577-seat National Assembly, and the outcome will not be known until the end of voting on July 7.\n\n\"We are going to win an absolute majority,\" said Le Pen in a newspaper interview on Wednesday, predicting that her protege, 28-year-old Jordan Bardella, would be prime minister.\n\nHer party has a high-spending economic program and seeks to reduce immigration.\n\nIf her party does win an absolute majority, French diplomacy could be headed for an unprecedented period of turbulence: with Macron - who has said he will continue his presidency until the end of his term in 2027 - and Bardella jostling for the right to speak for France.\n\nFrance has had three periods of \"cohabitation\" - when the president and government are from opposite political camps - in its post-war history, but none with such radically divergent world views competing at the top of the state.\n\nBardella has already indicated he would challenge Macron on global issues.\n\nFrance could lurch from being a pillar of the EU to a thorn in its side, demanding a rebate of the French contribution to the EU budget, clashing with Brussels over European Commission jobs and reversing Macron's calls for greater EU unity and assertiveness on defence.\n\nLe Pen also has a history of pro-Russian sentiment and while the party now says it would help Ukraine defend itself against Russian invaders, it has also set out red lines such as refusing to provide long-range missiles.\n\nOpinion polls have suggested National Rally has a comfortable lead of 33 to 36 per cent of the popular vote, with a hastily assembled left-wing coalition, the New Popular Front, in second place on 28 to 31 per cent and Macron's centrist alliance in third on 20 to 23 per cent.\n\nThe New Popular Front includes a wide range of parties, from the moderate centre-left to the hard-left, Eurosceptic, anti-NATO party France Unbowed, led by one of Macron's most vitriolic opponents, Jean-Luc Melenchon.\n\nHow the poll numbers will translate into seats in the National Assembly is hard to predict because of how the election works, said Vincent Martigny, professor of political science at the University of Nice.\n\nCandidates can be elected in the first round if they win an absolute majority of votes in their constituency, which is rare.\n\nMost constituencies will need a second round involving all candidates who received votes from at least 12.5 per cent of registered voters in the first round.\n\n\"If you have a very high level of participation you might have a third or fourth party that is getting into the struggle,\" Martigny said.\n\n\"So then ... there's a risk of split voting and we know that the split vote favours the National Rally.\"\n\nMartigny said no one knew whether candidates from Macron's camp would consider dropping out of the second round to give rivals from the left a chance of beating National Rally, or the reverse.\n\nLe Pen and Bardella have sought to make their party's image more acceptable to the mainstream, for example by denouncing anti-Semitism.\n\nLe Pen's father Jean-Marie Le Pen, founder and long-term leader of the party's forerunner, had a history of overtly anti-Semitic comments.", "source": {"uri": "au.news.yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo!7 News"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

Some 49 million people are eligible to vote.\n\n\"These are not easy elections, the results are very uncertain, and the repercussions could be serious for society\", said Julien Martin, a 38-year-old architect in the southwestern city of Bordeaux.\n\nVoters lined up to cast their ballots in France's Pacific territory of New Caledonia, where tensions remain high following last month's deadly riots.\n\nThe vote is \"decisive\", said Cassandre Cazaux, a nurse.\n\n\"It should be well attended, but I don't know if everyone will play along and come out to vote,\" Cazaux added.\n\nBy midday local time, turnout in the archipelago, which is located between Australia and Fiji, stood at 32.4 percent, compared to 13.06 percent recorded during the 2022 legislative polls.\n\nFormer president Nicolas Sarkozy, Greens party leader Marine Tondelier and former prime minister and Macron ally Edouard Philippe were among the first high-profile politicians to vote.\n\nPhilippe, the mayor of Le Havre in northern France who has made little effort to hide his ambitions for the presidency, was seen smiling and chatting to locals on Sunday morning.\n\nElections for the 577 seats in the National Assembly are a two-round process. The shape of the new parliament will become clear after the second round on July 7.\n\nMost polls show the RN on course to win the largest number of seats in the National Assembly, parliament's lower house, although it remains unclear if the party will secure an outright majority.\n\nFinal opinion polls have given the RN between 35 percent and 37 percent of the vote, against 27.5-29 percent for the left-wing New Popular Front alliance and 20-21 percent for Macron's centrist camp.\n\nIf the RN obtains an absolute majority, party chief Jordan Bardella, Le Pen's 28-year-old protege with no governing experience, could become prime minister in a tense \"cohabitation\" with Macron.\n\nMany analysts say that France is facing a hung Assembly, which could lead to deadlock and political instability.\n\n- 'Fight against hatred' -\n\nMacron's decision to call the snap vote after the RN's strong showing in European Parliament elections this month stunned friends and foes and sparked uncertainty in Europe's second-biggest economy.\n\nThe Paris stock exchange suffered its biggest monthly decline in two years in June, dropping by 6.4 percent, according to figures released on Friday.\n\nIn an editorial, French daily Le Monde said it was time to mobilise against the far right.\n\n\"Yielding any power to it means nothing less than taking the risk of seeing everything that has been built and conquered over more than two and a half centuries gradually being undone,\" it said.\n\nWielding mops and buckets, several activists of the Femen feminist collective dressed as cleaners on Saturday demonstrated bare-breasted at the Trocadero in Paris, chanting slogans against the extreme right.\n\nSeparately, more than 100,000 joined an LGBTQ Pride march in Paris, with some carrying placards targeting the far right.\n\n\"I think it's even more important right now to fight against hatred in general, in all its forms,\" said 19-year-old student Themis Hallin-Mallet.\n\n- Spike in hate speech -\n\nMany have pointed to a spike in hate speech, intolerance and racism during the charged campaign. A video of two RN supporters verbally assaulting a black woman has gone viral in recent days.\n\nMacron has deplored \"racism or anti-Semitism\".\n\nHe apparently hoped to catch political opponents off guard by presenting voters with a crucial choice about France's future, but observers say he might have lost his gamble.\n\nSupport for Macron's centrist camp has collapsed, while left-wing parties put their bickering aside to form the New Popular Front, in a nod to an alliance founded in 1936 to combat fascism.\n\nAnalysts say Le Pen's years-long efforts to clean up the image of a party co-founded by a former Waffen SS member have been paying off.\n\nThe party has promised to bolster purchasing power, curb immigration and boost law and order.\n\nA defiant Macron has stood by his decision to call the elections, while warning voters that a win by the far right or hard left could spark a \"civil war\".\n\nbur-as/cw", "source": {"uri": "ktbs.com", "dataType": "news", "title":

Her eurosceptic, anti-immigrant party was a longtime pariah but is now closer to power than it has ever been.\n\nPolls open at 0600 GMT (11:30 am IST), closing at 1600 GMT (9:30 pm IST) in small towns and cities, and at 1800 GMT in the bigger cities, when the first exit polls for the night and seat projections for the decisive second round a week later are expected.\n\nHowever, the electoral system can make it hard to estimate the precise distribution of seats in the 577-seat National Assembly, and the final outcome will not be known until the end of voting on July 7.\n\n\"We are going to win an absolute majority,\" said Le Pen in a newspaper interview on Wednesday, predicting that her prot\u00e9g\u00e9, 28-year-old Jordan Bardella would be prime minister. Her party has a high-spending economic programme and seeks to reduce immigration.\n\nIf the RN does win an absolute majority, French diplomacy could be headed for an unprecedented period of turbulence: with Macron - who has said he will continue his presidency until the end of his term in 2027 - and Bardella jostling for the right to speak for France.\n\nFrance has had three periods of \"cohabitation\" - when the president and government are from opposite political camps - in its post-war history, but none with such radically divergent world views competing at the top of the state.\n\nBardella has already indicated he would challenge Macron on global issues. France could lurch from being a pillar of the EU to a thorn in its side, demanding a rebate of the French contribution to the EU budget, clashing with Brussels over European Commission jobs and reversing Macron's calls for greater EU unity and assertiveness on defence.\n\nA clear RN victory would also bring uncertainty as to where France stands on the Russia-Ukraine war. Le Pen has a history of pro-Russian sentiment and while the party now says it would help Ukraine defend itself against Russian invaders, it has also set out red lines, such as refusing to provide long-range missiles.\n\nOpinion polls have suggested the RN has a comfortable lead of 33-36% of the popular vote, with a hastily assembled left-wing coalition, the New Popular Front, in second place on 28-31% and Macron's centrist alliance in third on 20-23%.\n\nThe New Popular Front includes a wide range of parties, from the moderate centre-left to the hard-left, eurosceptic, anti-NATO party France Unbowed, led by one of Macron's most vitriolic opponents, Jean-Luc Melenchon.\n\nHow the poll numbers will translate into seats in the National Assembly is hard to predict because of how the election works, said Vincent Martigny, professor of political science at the University of Nice and the Ecole Polytechnique.\n\nCandidates can be elected in the first round if they win an absolute majority of votes in their constituency, but that is rare. Most constituencies will need a second round involving all candidates who received votes from at least 12.5% of registered voters in the first round. The top scorer wins.\n\n\"If you have a very high level of participation you might have a third or fourth party that is getting into the struggle. So then of course there's a risk of split voting and we know that the split vote favours the National Rally,\" said Martigny.\n\nFor decades, as the far right steadily gained popularity, voters and parties who did not support it would unite against it whenever it edged closer to national power, but that may not hold true this time.\n\nMartigny said no one knew whether candidates from Macron's camp would consider dropping out of the second round to give rivals from the left a chance of beating the RN, or the reverse.\n\nLe Pen and Bardella have sought to make their party's image more acceptable to the mainstream, for example by denouncing antisemitism. Le Pen's father Jean-Marie Le Pen, founder and long-term leader of the RN's forerunner, had a history of overtly antisemitic comments.\n\nBut critics say the RN's courting of Jews is just a cover allowing it to deny accusations of racism while constantly stigmatising Muslims and foreigners.", "source": {"uri": "indiatoday.in", "dataType": "news", "title": "India Today"}, "authors": [],

Some 49 million people are eligible to vote.\n\n\"These are not easy elections, the results are very uncertain, and the repercussions could be serious for society\", said Julien Martin, a 38-year-old architect in the southwestern city of Bordeaux.\n\nVoters lined up to cast their ballots in France's Pacific territory of New Caledonia, where tensions remain high following last month's deadly riots.\n\nThe vote is \"decisive\", said Cassandre Cazaux, a nurse.\n\n\"It should be well attended, but I don't know if everyone will play along and come out to vote,\" Cazaux added.\n\nBy midday local time, turnout in the archipelago, which is located between Australia and Fiji, stood at 32.4 percent, compared to 13.06 percent recorded during the 2022 legislative polls.\n\nFormer president Nicolas Sarkozy, Greens party leader Marine Tondelier and former prime minister and Macron ally Edouard Philippe were among the first high-profile politicians to vote.\n\nPhilippe, the mayor of Le Havre in northern France who has made little effort to hide his ambitions for the presidency, was seen smiling and chatting to locals on Sunday morning.\n\nElections for the 577 seats in the National Assembly are a two-round process. The shape of the new parliament will become clear after the second round on July 7.\n\nMost polls show the RN on course to win the largest number of seats in the National Assembly, parliament's lower house, although it remains unclear if the party will secure an outright majority.\n\nFinal opinion polls have given the RN between 35 percent and 37 percent of the vote, against 27.5-29 percent for the left-wing New Popular Front alliance and 20-21 percent for Macron's centrist camp.\n\nIf the RN obtains an absolute majority, party chief Jordan Bardella, Le Pen's 28-year-old protege with no governing experience, could become prime minister in a tense \"cohabitation\" with Macron.\n\nMany analysts say that France is facing a hung Assembly, which could lead to deadlock and political instability.\n\nMore from this section Police: Rider killed in Milford motorcycle crash Nyack School Superintendent Susan Yom to step down at end of June Jan. 6 defendants from CT could get lighter sentences after Supreme Court ruling - 'Fight against hatred' -\n\nMacron's decision to call the snap vote after the RN's strong showing in European Parliament elections this month stunned friends and foes and sparked uncertainty in Europe's second-biggest economy.\n\nThe Paris stock exchange suffered its biggest monthly decline in two years in June, dropping by 6.4 percent, according to figures released on Friday.\n\nIn an editorial, French daily Le Monde said it was time to mobilise against the far right.\n\n\"Yielding any power to it means nothing less than taking the risk of seeing everything that has been built and conquered over more than two and a half centuries gradually being undone,\" it said.\n\nWielding mops and buckets, several activists of the Femen feminist collective dressed as cleaners on Saturday demonstrated bare-breasted at the Trocadero in Paris, chanting slogans against the extreme right.\n\nSeparately, more than 100,000 joined an LGBTQ Pride march in Paris, with some carrying placards targeting the far right.\n\n\"I think it's even more important right now to fight against hatred in general, in all its forms,\" said 19-year-old student Themis Hallin-Mallet.\n\n- Spike in hate speech -\n\nMany have pointed to a spike in hate speech, intolerance and racism during the charged campaign. A video of two RN supporters verbally assaulting a black woman has gone viral in recent days.\n\nMacron has deplored \"racism or anti-Semitism\".\n\nHe apparently hoped to catch political opponents off guard by presenting voters with a crucial choice about France's future, but observers say he might have lost his gamble.\n\nSupport for Macron's centrist camp has collapsed, while left-wing parties put their bickering aside to form the New Popular Front, in a nod to an alliance founded in 1936 to combat fascism.\n\nAnalysts say Le Pen's years-long efforts to clean up the image of a party co-founded by a former Waffen SS member have been paying off.\n\nThe party has promised to bolster purchasing power, curb immigration and boost law and order.\n\nA defiant Macron has stood by his decision to call the elections, while warning voters that a win by the far right or hard left could spark a \"civil war\".\n\nbur-as/cw", "source": {"uri": "reformer.com", "dataType": "news", "title":

France could lurch from being a pillar of the EU to a thorn in its side, demanding a rebate of the French contribution to the EU budget, clashing with Brussels over European Commission jobs and reversing Macron's calls for greater EU unity and assertiveness on defence.\n\nA clear RN victory would also bring uncertainty as to where France stands on the Russia-Ukraine war. Le Pen has a history of pro-Russian sentiment and while the party now says it would help Ukraine defend itself against Russian invaders, it has also set out red lines, such as refusing to provide long-range missiles.\n\nOpinion polls have suggested the RN has a comfortable lead of 33-36% of the popular vote, with a hastily assembled left-wing coalition, the New Popular Front, in second place on 28-31% and Macron's centrist alliance in third on 20-23%.\n\nThe New Popular Front includes a wide range of parties, from the moderate centre-left to the hard-left, eurosceptic, anti-NATO party France Unbowed, led by one of Macron's most vitriolic opponents, Jean-Luc Melenchon.\n\nHow the poll numbers will translate into seats in the National Assembly is hard to predict because of how the election works, said Vincent Martigny, professor of political science at the University of Nice and the Ecole Polytechnique.\n\nCandidates can be elected in the first round if they win an absolute majority of votes in their constituency, but that is rare. Most constituencies will need a second round involving all candidates who received votes from at least 12.5% of registered voters in the first round. The top scorer wins.\n\n\"If you have a very high level of participation you might have a third or fourth party that is getting into the struggle. So then of course there's a risk of split voting and we know that the split vote favours the National Rally,\" said Martigny.\n\nFor decades, as the far right steadily gained popularity, voters and parties who did not support it would unite against it whenever it edged closer to national power, but that may not hold true this time.\n\nMartigny said no one knew whether candidates from Macron's camp would consider dropping out of the second round to give rivals from the left a chance of beating the RN, or the reverse.\n\nLe Pen and Bardella have sought to make their party's image more acceptable to the mainstream, for example by denouncing antisemitism. Le Pen's father Jean-Marie Le Pen, founder and long-term leader of the RN's forerunner, had a history of overtly antisemitic comments.\n\nBut critics say the RN's courting of Jews is just a cover allowing it to deny accusations of racism while constantly stigmatising Muslims and foreigners.\n\n(Additional reporting by Paris bureauWriting by Estelle ShirbonEditing by Frances Kerry and Gareth

The slogan reads \"Bardella Prime Minister\". REUTERS/Yves Herman\n\nPARIS (Reuters) - French voters cast their ballots on Sunday in the first round of a snap parliamentary election that could usher in the country's first far-right government since World War Two, a potential sea change at the heart of the European Union.\n\nPresident Emmanuel Macron stunned the country when he called the vote after his centrist alliance was crushed in European elections this month by Marine Le Pen's National Rally (RN).

France could lurch from being a pillar of the EU to a thorn in its side, demanding a rebate of the French contribution to the EU budget, clashing with Brussels over European Commission jobs and reversing Macron's calls for greater EU unity and assertiveness on defence.\n\nA clear RN victory would also bring uncertainty as to where France stands on the Russia-Ukraine war. Le Pen has a history of pro-Russian sentiment and while the party now says it would help Ukraine defend itself against Russian invaders, it has also set out red lines, such as refusing to provide long-range missiles.\n\n'SPLIT VOTE FAVOURS RN'\n\nOpinion polls have suggested the RN has a comfortable lead of 33-36% of the popular vote, with a hastily assembled left-wing coalition, the New Popular Front, in second place on 28-31% and Macron's centrist alliance in third on 20-23%.\n\nThe New Popular Front includes a wide range of parties, from the moderate centre-left to the hard-left, eurosceptic, anti-NATO party France Unbowed, led by one of Macron's most vitriolic opponents, Jean-Luc Melenchon.\n\nHow the poll numbers will translate into seats in the National Assembly is hard to predict because of how the election works, said Vincent Martigny, professor of political science at the University of Nice and the Ecole Polytechnique.\n\nCandidates can be elected in the first round if they win an absolute majority of votes in their constituency, but that is rare. Most constituencies will need a second round involving all candidates who received votes from at least 12.5% of registered voters in the first round. The top scorer wins.\n\n\"If you have a very high level of participation you might have a third or fourth party that is getting into the struggle. So then of course there's a risk of split voting and we know that the split vote favours the National Rally,\" said Martigny.\n\nFor decades, as the far right steadily gained popularity, voters and parties who did not support it would unite against it whenever it edged closer to national power, but that may not hold true this time.\n\nMartigny said no one knew whether candidates from Macron's camp would consider dropping out of the second round to give rivals from the left a chance of beating the RN, or the reverse.\n\nLe Pen and Bardella have sought to make their party's image more acceptable to the mainstream, for example by denouncing antisemitism. Le Pen's father Jean-Marie Le Pen, founder and long-term leader of the RN's forerunner, had a history of overtly antisemitic comments.\n\nBut critics say the RN's courting of Jews is just a cover allowing it to deny accusations of racism while constantly stigmatising Muslims and foreigners.\n\n(Additional reporting by Paris bureau; Writing by Estelle Shirbon; Editing by Frances Kerry)",

Some 49 million people are eligible to vote.\n\n\"These are not easy elections, the results are very uncertain, and the repercussions could be serious for society\", said Julien Martin, a 38-year-old architect in the southwestern city of Bordeaux.\n\nVoters lined up to cast their ballots in France's Pacific territory of New Caledonia, where tensions remain high following last month's deadly riots.\n\nThe vote is \"decisive\", said Cassandre Cazaux, a nurse.\n\n\"It should be well attended, but I don't know if everyone will play along and come out to vote,\" Cazaux added.\n\nBy midday local time, turnout in the archipelago, which is located between Australia and Fiji, stood at 32.4 percent, compared to 13.06 percent recorded during the 2022 legislative polls.\n\nFormer president Nicolas Sarkozy, Greens party leader Marine Tondelier and former prime minister and Macron ally Edouard Philippe were among the first high-profile politicians to vote.\n\nPhilippe, the mayor of Le Havre in northern France who has made little effort to hide his ambitions for the presidency, was seen smiling and chatting to locals on Sunday morning.\n\nElections for the 577 seats in the National Assembly are a two-round process. The shape of the new parliament will become clear after the second round on July 7.\n\nMost polls show the RN on course to win the largest number of seats in the National Assembly, parliament's lower house, although it remains unclear if the party will secure an outright majority.\n\nFinal opinion polls have given the RN between 35 percent and 37 percent of the vote, against 27.5-29 percent for the left-wing New Popular Front alliance and 20-21 percent for Macron's centrist camp.\n\nIf the RN obtains an absolute majority, party chief Jordan Bardella, Le Pen's 28-year-old protege with no governing experience, could become prime minister in a tense \"cohabitation\" with Macron.\n\nMany analysts say that France is facing a hung Assembly, which could lead to deadlock and political instability.\n\nMacron's decision to call the snap vote after the RN's strong showing in European Parliament elections this month stunned friends and foes and sparked uncertainty in Europe's second-biggest economy.\n\nThe Paris stock exchange suffered its biggest monthly decline in two years in June, dropping by 6.4 percent, according to figures released on Friday.\n\nIn an editorial,

Her eurosceptic, anti-immigrant party was a longtime pariah but is now closer to power than it has ever been.\n\nPolls open at 0600 GMT, closing at 1600 GMT in small towns and cities, and at 1800 GMT in the bigger cities, when the first exit polls for the night and seat projections for the decisive second round a week later are expected.\n\nHowever the electoral system can make it hard to estimate the precise distribution of seats in the 577-seat National Assembly, and the final outcome will not be known until the end of voting on July 7.\n\n\"We are going to win an absolute majority,\" said Le Pen in a newspaper interview on Wednesday, predicting that her prot\u00e9g\u00e9, 28-year-old Jordan Bardella would be prime minister. Her party has a high-spending economic programme and seeks to reduce immigration.\n\nIf the RN does win an absolute majority, French diplomacy could be headed for an unprecedented period of turbulence: with Macron - who has said he will continue his presidency until the end of his term in 2027 - and Bardella jostling for the right to speak for France.\n\nFrance has had three periods of \"cohabitation\" - when the president and government are from opposite political camps - in its post-war history, but none with such radically divergent world views competing at the top of the state.\n\nBardella has already indicated he would challenge Macron on global issues. France could lurch from being a pillar of the EU to a thorn in its side, demanding a rebate of the French contribution to the EU budget, clashing with Brussels over European Commission jobs and reversing Macron's calls for greater EU unity and assertiveness on defence.\n\nA clear RN victory would also bring uncertainty as to where France stands on the Russia-Ukraine war. Le Pen has a history of pro-Russian sentiment and while the party now says it would help Ukraine defend itself against Russian invaders, it has also set out red lines, such as refusing to provide long-range missiles.\n\n'SPLIT VOTE FAVOURS RN'\n\nOpinion polls have suggested the RN has a comfortable lead of 33-36% of the popular vote, with a hastily assembled left-wing coalition, the New Popular Front, in second place on 28-31% and Macron's centrist alliance in third on 20-23%.\n\nThe New Popular Front includes a wide range of parties, from the moderate centre-left to the hard-left, eurosceptic, anti-NATO party France Unbowed, led by one of Macron's most vitriolic opponents, Jean-Luc Melenchon.\n\nHow the poll numbers will translate into seats in the National Assembly is hard to predict because of how the election works, said Vincent Martigny, professor of political science at the University of Nice and the Ecole Polytechnique.\n\nCandidates can be elected in the first round if they win an absolute majority of votes in their constituency, but that is rare. Most constituencies will need a second round involving all candidates who received votes from at least 12.5% of registered voters in the first round.

France's trajectory and see the far-right party of Marine Le Pen take power in a historic first.\n\nPresident Emmanuel Macron stunned the nation by calling snap polls after the far-right National Rally (RN) party's strong showing in European Parliament elections this month.\n\nMany voters said they were concerned about the future.\n\n\"I don't recognise my country anymore,\" Roxane Lebrun, 40, said in the southwestern city of Bordeaux.\n\nJulien Martin, a 38-year-old architect, added: \"These are not easy elections, the results are very uncertain, and the repercussions could be serious for society.\"\n\nMacron and his wife Brigitte cast their ballots in Le Touquet in northern France.\n\nOn Monday, the French president plans to convene a government meeting to decide the next course of action, sources have told AFP.\n\nMost polls show the RN party on course to win the largest number of seats in the National Assembly, parliament's lower house -- although it remains unclear if it will secure an outright majority.\n\nFinal opinion polls have given the RN between 35 percent and 37 percent of the vote -- against 27.5-29 percent for the left-wing New Popular Front alliance, and 20-21 percent for Macron's centrist camp.\n\nIf the RN obtains an absolute majority, party chief Jordan Bardella, Le Pen's 28-year-old protege with no governing experience, could become prime minister in a tense \"cohabitation\" with Macron.", "source": {"uri": "urdupoint.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "UrduPoint"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/France", "type":

It was, he said later, the \"most responsible solution\".\n\nWhat was Macron thinking?\n\nApparently Mr Macron had been thinking about calling an election for months, but it came out of the blue even for his closest colleagues.\n\nFrance is on the cusp of a massive event, with the Paris Olympics running from 26 July to 11 August. It has now had a lightning-fast election campaign as well.\n\nMr Macron clearly wanted to break a logjam, after his failure to secure an absolute majority in the National Assembly in June 2022. Passing laws has become a real headache - he had to force through pension reforms without a vote while tougher immigration rules required National Rally support.\n\n\"France needs a clear majority if it is to act in serenity and harmony,\" Mr Macron argues. And yet he has left French politics and his own party in turmoil.\n\nHis centrist Ensemble alliance of Renaissance, Horizons and MoDem is languishing in the polls, behind a swiftly formed left-wing New Popular Front, made up of Socialists, Greens, Communists and the far-left France Unbowed (LFI).\n\n\"He killed off the presidential majority,\" said Horizons leader and ex-Prime Minister Edouard Philippe.\n\n\"This decision has created everywhere in our country, in the French people, worry, incomprehension, sometimes anger,\" says Finance Minister Bruno Le Maire.\n\nWhy are these elections so significant?\n\nFor the first time in France, National Rally could win power, despite widespread appeals to voters to steer clear of extremes.\n\nRN is led by 28-year-old Jordan Bardella and in parliament by Marine Le Pen, who has fought for the presidency three times and lost each time.\n\nBut each time she won more votes. Now the polls says her party could become the biggest in France, falling short of an absolute majority.\n\nMs Le Pen also has an eye on the next presidential election in three years' time.\n\nHow do French elections work?\n\nThere are 577 seats in the National Assembly, including 13 overseas districts and 11 constituencies that represent French expats abroad. For an absolute majority a party needs 289.\n\nThe Macron alliance had only 250 seats in the outgoing Assembly and had to build support from other parties every time to pass a law.\n\nThe first round eliminates all candidates who fail to win the support of 12.5% of locally registered voters.\n\nAnyone who scores more than 50% of the vote with a turnout of at least a quarter of the local electorate wins automatically. That normally happens only in a handful of constituencies, but the RN believes this time it could win dozens.\n\nThe second round is a series of run-offs fought either by two, three or sometimes four candidates.\n\nBecause turnout is expected to be high, Ipsos pollster Brice Teinturier estimates at least 250 seats could become three-way races next Sunday.\n\nSome candidates may drop out before 7 July to give an ally a better chance of stopping a rival from winning, for example from the far right.\n\nWhat will happen?\n\nThe two-round system means nothing is certain, but political expert J\u00e9r\u00f4me Jaffr\u00e9 says there is a real risk for the Macron camp that many of their MPs will either not qualify at all for the run-offs or scraping through in third place.\n\nRN have 88 seats in the outgoing parliament, but polls suggest they could win 220 to 260.\n\nUntil now voters have traditionally used \"le vote utile\" - tactical voting - to form a \"barrage\" and keep the far right out.\n\nBut that barrage is this time more likely to benefit the left than Mr Macron's Ensemble. And many voters in the centre might prefer RN over the Popular Front, because of the dominance of Jean-Luc M\u00e9lenchon's far-left France Unbowed.\n\nWhat if Macron's party loses?\n\nWhoever wins, Mr Macron has said he will not resign as president.\n\nIf his party loses, and National Rally wins, then the question is whether RN can win an absolute majority of 289 seats, or a relative majority similar to that held since 2022 by the Macron camp.\n\nAn RN victory could open the door to almost three years of \"cohabitation\", or power-sharing, when the president of one party heads the state and another party runs the government.\n\nIt's happened before, with domestic policy in the hands of the prime minister and foreign and defence policy in the hands of the president.\n\nUnder the constitution it is Mr Macron who decides who leads the next government. And Mr Bardella says he will not become prime minister if RN doesn't secure that absolute majority: \"I don't want to be the president's assistant.\"\n\nA relative majority, he said, would leave him unable to act: \"I'm not going to sell the French people measures or actions that I couldn't follow through.\"\n\nBut Mr Macron does have to reflect the make-up of the new Assembly, so if National Rally are the predominant party he could find it hard to choose someone else.\n\nParty campaign posters proclaim Mr Bardella as prime minister. He has a big presence on TikTok but his biggest job has been as a member of the European Parliament since 2019.\n\nHas cohabitation happened in France before?\n\nNot for more than 20 years, as parliamentary elections now come hard on the heels of presidential votes, and voting preferences do not change much within that time.\n\nThere have been three periods of cohabitation in the past:\n\n1997-2002 Socialist Lionel Jospin was prime minister under centre-right President Jacques Chirac\n\n1993-95 Centre-right Prime Minister Edouard Balladour worked with Socialist President Fran\u00e7ois Mitterrand during his second term\n\n1986-88 Jacques Chirac was prime minister under President Fran\u00e7ois Mitterrand\n\nBut nothing has really prepared France for the kind of cohabitation that could occur after 7 July.\n\nIs National Rally still far-right?\n\nFor years Marine Le Pen has sought to \"de-diabolise\" or detoxify her party from the antisemitic and extremist roots of her father, Jean-Marie Le Pen, and his fellow founders of the National Front, which she renamed as National Rally.\n\nMuch of its focus now is on the cost-of-living crisis, but many of its strict anti-immigration policies remain and a ruling this year by the Council of State, France's highest court for administration, confirmed it could be considered \"extreme right\".\n\nFrance football captain Kylian Mbapp\u00e9 has warned his compatriots \"the extremes are at the gates of power\", prompting Mr Bardella to hit back at multimillionaire sports figures \"giving lessons to people struggling to make ends meet\".\n\nMr Bardella wants to ban French dual nationals from sensitive strategic posts, calling them \"half-nationals\". He also wants to limit social welfare for immigrants and get rid of the automatic right to French citizenship for children with foreign-born parents.\n\nBut a planned ban on wearing headscarves in public is for now not a priority.\n\nAnti-Nato and anti-EU policies have also been softened and National Rally's close ties with Vladimir Putin's Russia have been quietly dropped.\n\nLeaving the EU has not been on the agenda since 2022. Instead, Mr Bardella focuses on cutting VAT (sales tax) on energy and a list of 100 essential goods and repealing the Macron pension reforms in a matter of months.\n\nWhat does the left promise?\n\nThe New Popular Front is an unlikely alliance of Socialists, Greens, Communists and France Unbowed.\n\nThey have promised to scrap the Macron pension and immigration reforms and their platform is otherwise based on the idea that \"it's either the far right, or us\".\n\nPresident Macron has attacked the group as being \"totally immigrationist\" and allowing people to change gender at their town hall, an accusation that has prompted allegations of transphobia.\n\nThe Popular Front has promised to fight antisemitism, even though it includes candidates who have been accused of making antisemitic remarks.", "source": {"uri": "yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo"}, "authors": [{"uri": "paul_kirby@yahoo.com", "name": "Paul Kirby", "type": "author", "isAgency":

eurosceptic party of Marine Le Pen sweep to power in a historic first.\n\nDonning chic black suits and shades, the couple arrived at the Paris polling station holding hands before meeting with other voters and staff inside.\n\nPolls opened at 6am and will close at 4pm in small towns and cities, with a 6pm finish in the bigger cities, when the first exit polls for the night and seat projections for the decisive second round a week later are expected.\n\nVoters in France's overseas territories cast their ballots earlier this weekend - with some 49million people eligible to vote in the historic snap election.\n\nFrench former president Nicolas Sarkozy (L) and his wife Carla Bruni-Sarkozy ( R) arrive to vote for the first round of parliamentary elections in Paris, on June 30,

pictured inside the Paris polling station as the first day of voting commences\n\nThe election has been shaping up as a showdown between the right-wing National Rally (RN) and the left-wing New Popular Front (NFP), which is dominated by the hard-left France Unbowed.\n\nWhile polls suggest support for Le Pen's RN has strengthened in recent days, the outcome of the two-round election, called three weeks ago by French president Emmanuel Macron, remains uncertain.\n\nOne poll carried out by Les Echos newspaper suggested the RN was on track to scoop 37 per cent of the national vote - up to two points from more than a week ago.\n\nAnother poll carried out by BFM TV predicted the far-right party could win between 260 and 295 seats out of the 577 up for grabs in the National Assembly.\n\nPolls suggest the left-wing NFP could net 28 per cent of the vote, while Macron's centrist bloc follows behind at 20 per cent.\n\nOfficial campaigning for the first-round vote ended at midnight on Friday, and following Sunday's much-anticipated vote, campaigning efforts will resume on Monday for another five days before voters are called back to the polls for a final second-round ballot on July 7.\n\n'We are going to win an absolute majority,' said Le Pen in a newspaper interview on Wednesday, predicting that her prot\u00e9g\u00e9, 28-year-old Jordan Bardella would be prime

does win an absolute majority, French diplomacy could be headed for an unprecedented period of turbulence: with Macron - who has said he will continue his presidency until the end of his term in 2027 - and Bardella jostling for the right to speak for France.\n\nBardella has already indicated he would challenge Macron on global issues and unveiled his party's manifesto in a press conference on June 24.\n\nHe declared the RN would demand a huge cut of between \u20ac2 billion and \u20ac3 billion in France's contributions to Europe - part of a wider plan to implement what he called 'realistic, credible' economic policies as France battles spiralling national debt.\n\nFrance could lurch from being a pillar of the EU to a thorn in its side, demanding a rebate of the French contribution to the EU budget, clashing with Brussels over European Commission jobs and reversing Macron's calls for greater EU unity and assertiveness on defence.\n\nA clear RN victory would also bring uncertainty as to where France stands on the Russia-Ukraine war.\n\nLe Pen has a history of pro-Russian sentiment and while the party now says it would help Ukraine defend itself against Russian invaders, it has also set out red lines, such as refusing to provide long-range missiles.\n\nBardella's unveiling of the RN manifesto came as Emmanuel Macron warned France faces 'civil war' if either the hard-right or hard-left scores a big win in parliamentary elections.\n\nMacron had claimed the policies of the RN and France Unbowed divided and isolated people, which would ultimately lead to conflict between different communities ahead of today's first round of voting.\n\nSpeaking on the Generation Do It Yourself podcast, the French president said: 'I think that the solutions given by the far right are out of the question, because it is categorising people in terms of their religion or origins and that is why it leads to division and to civil war'.\n\nLeaders of both left and right condemned the president's remarks.\n\nFrench president Emmanuel Macron was slammed for using a 'strategy of fear' after he warned a 'civil war' could be sparked if a populist or hard-left party wins the snap election\n\nFar-right National Rally party president Jordan Bardella, right, leaves with far-right leader Marine Le Pen after a press conference, Monday, June 24, 2024 in Paris\n\nEric Ciotti, the leader of the conservative Republicans, who sparked outrage among allies by personally agreeing an election pact with the RN, accused the French president of being irresponsible.\n\n'This is a strategy of fear,' he said, speaking on BFMTV-RMC.\n\nMarine Le Pen said Macron's argument was 'weak' and showed 'he thinks he's lost this election'.\n\nSpeaking about France Unbowed, he added on the podcast: 'But that one as well, there is a civil war behind that because you are solely categorising people in terms of their religious outlook or the community they belong to'.\n\nHere, Macron was referring to accusations that France Unbowed positions itself to attract Muslim voters through its critical stance on Israel's war in Gaza.\n\nFollowing the comments, Patrick Kanner, head of the Socialists in the Senate, said: 'We are faced with someone who no longer controls anything.'\n\nJean-Luc Melenchon, the head of France Unbowed, also criticised Macron, saying on Monday night: 'He's always there to set things on fire.\n\n'A president should not say that'.", "source": {"uri": "dailymail.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "Daily Mail Online"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

Following Sunday's vote, campaigning will resume on Monday for another five days before voters are called back to the polls for a final, decisive second-round ballot on 7 July.\n\nMuch could change in the five days between rounds, particularly if candidates embrace tactical alliances and withdrawals in order to block the far-right from winning a majority.\n\nIn recent days candidates from the leftwing coalition and Macron's centrist alliance have scrambled to remind voters that the RN, launched in the early 1970s as the National Front, once included in its ranks former members of a Waffen-SS military unit under Nazi command during the second world war.\n\nThe party was long seen as rife with antisemitic, homophobic and racist views, and widely regarded as a danger to democracy that needed to be kept out of mainstream politics. While Marine Le Pen, Jean-Marie Le Pen's daughter, has spent much of the past decade working to soften the party's image, its core message remains one of deep hostility to immigration and the so-called Islamisation of society.\n\nThe party has vowed to drastically slash immigration and bar dual nationals from certain state jobs, along with promises to cut taxes on energy, exempt people under the age of 30 from income tax and work towards abolishing Macron's pension reform.\n\nAhead of Sunday's first round, Le Pen urged voters to go out and vote. \"Victory is within our grasp, so let's seize this historic opportunity and get out and vote!\" she wrote on social media.\n\nMost analysts suggest the most likely outcome is a polarised parliament, where consensus between the larger far-right and leftwing blocs, and a smaller number of Macron's allies would be nearly impossible, leading to political paralysis.\n\nIf the RN wins a majority, party chief Jordan Bardella, Le Pen's 28-year-old protege who has no governing experience, could become prime minister in a fraught cohabitation with Macron.\n\nThe result could pit the two men - who have vastly different visions of France's future - against each other. One example is France's strong support for Ukraine, championed by Macron since Russia's 2022 invasion. Bardella has said he would use his powers as prime minister to stop Macron from continuing to supply long-range weapons to Ukraine.\n\nFollowing Sunday's first-round vote, Macron is planning to convene a government meeting to decide the further course of action, government sources told AFP.\n\nThe president's shock decision to call parliamentary elections has sparked dissent among his allies and cast Europe's second-biggest economy into uncertainty. Even so, Macron has stood by his decision, reportedly hoping it would force voters to confront whether they were ready to allow the far-right to tighten its grip on power.\n\nIn the lead-up to Sunday's first round vote, Macron sought to hammer home this point, warning that France risks being plunged into a \"civil war\" if either of his \"extreme\" opponents win a majority.\n\nThe president has insisted he will serve out the remainder of his second term until 2027, regardless of which party wins.", "source": {"uri": "ca.news.yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo"}, "authors":

Following Sunday's vote, campaigning will resume on Monday for another five days before voters are called back to the polls for a final, decisive second-round ballot on 7 July.\n\nMuch could change in the five days between rounds, particularly if candidates embrace tactical alliances and withdrawals in order to block the far-right from winning a majority.\n\nIn recent days candidates from the leftwing coalition and Macron's centrist alliance have scrambled to remind voters that the RN, launched in the early 1970s as the National Front, once included in its ranks former members of a Waffen-SS military unit under Nazi command during the second world war.\n\nThe party was long seen as rife with antisemitic, homophobic and racist views, and widely regarded as a danger to democracy that needed to be kept out of mainstream politics. While Marine Le Pen, Jean-Marie Le Pen's daughter, has spent much of the past decade working to soften the party's image, its core message remains one of deep hostility to immigration and the so-called Islamisation of society.\n\nThe party has vowed to drastically slash immigration and bar dual nationals from certain state jobs, along with promises to cut taxes on energy, exempt people under the age of 30 from income tax and work towards abolishing Macron's pension reform.\n\nAhead of Sunday's first round, Le Pen urged voters to go out and vote. \"Victory is within our grasp, so let's seize this historic opportunity and get out and vote!\" she wrote on social media.\n\nMost analysts suggest the most likely outcome is a polarised parliament, where consensus between the larger far-right and leftwing blocs, and a smaller number of Macron's allies would be nearly impossible, leading to political paralysis.\n\nIf the RN wins a majority, party chief Jordan Bardella, Le Pen's 28-year-old protege who has no governing experience, could become prime minister in a fraught cohabitation with Macron.\n\nThe result could pit the two men - who have vastly different visions of France's future - against each other. One example is France's strong support for Ukraine, championed by Macron since Russia's 2022 invasion. Bardella has said he would use his powers as prime minister to stop Macron from continuing to supply long-range weapons to Ukraine.\n\nFollowing Sunday's first-round vote, Macron is planning to convene a government meeting to decide the further course of action, government sources told AFP.\n\nThe president's shock decision to call parliamentary elections has sparked dissent among his allies and cast Europe's second-biggest economy into uncertainty. Even so, Macron has stood by his decision, reportedly hoping it would force voters to confront whether they were ready to allow the far-right to tighten its grip on power.\n\nIn the lead-up to Sunday's first round vote, Macron sought to hammer home this point, warning that France risks being plunged into a \"civil war\" if either of his \"extreme\" opponents win a majority.\n\nThe president has insisted he will serve out the remainder of his second term until 2027, regardless of which party wins.", "source": {"uri": "theguardian.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Guardian"},

Her party has a high-spending economic programme and seeks to reduce immigration.\n\nIf the RN does win an absolute majority, French diplomacy could be headed for an unprecedented period of turbulence: with Macron - who has said he will continue his presidency until the end of his term in 2027 - and Bardella jostling for the right to speak for France.\n\nFrance has had three periods of \"cohabitation\" - when the president and government are from opposite political camps - in its post-war history, but none with such radically divergent world views competing at the top of the state.\n\nBardella has already indicated he would challenge Macron on global issues. France could lurch from being a pillar of the EU to a thorn in its side, demanding a rebate of the French contribution to the EU budget, clashing with Brussels over European Commission jobs and reversing Macron's calls for greater EU unity and assertiveness on defence.\n\nA clear RN victory would also bring uncertainty as to where France stands on the Russia-Ukraine war. Le Pen has a history of pro-Russian sentiment and while the party now says it would help Ukraine defend itself against Russian invaders, it has also set out red lines, such as refusing to provide long-range missiles.\n\nOpinion polls have suggested the RN has a comfortable lead of 33-36% of the popular vote, with a hastily assembled left-wing coalition, the New Popular Front, in second place on 28-31% and Macron's centrist alliance in third on 20-23%.\n\nThe New Popular Front includes a wide range of parties, from the moderate centre-left to the hard-left, eurosceptic, anti-NATO party France Unbowed, led by one of Macron's most vitriolic opponents, Jean-Luc Melenchon.\n\nHow the poll numbers will translate into seats in the National Assembly is hard to predict because of how the election works, said Vincent Martigny, professor of political science at the University of Nice and the Ecole Polytechnique.\n\nCandidates can be elected in the first round if they win an absolute majority of votes in their constituency, but that is rare. Most constituencies will need a second round involving all candidates who received votes from at least 12.5% of registered voters in the first round. The top scorer wins.\n\n\"If you have a very high level of participation you might have a third or fourth party that is getting into the struggle. So then of course there's a risk of split voting and we know that the split vote favours the National Rally,\" said Martigny.\n\nFor decades, as the far right steadily gained popularity, voters and parties who did not support it would unite against it whenever it edged closer to national power, but that may not hold true this time.\n\nMartigny said no one knew whether candidates from Macron's camp would consider dropping out of the second round to give rivals from the left a chance of beating the RN, or the reverse.\n\nLe Pen and Bardella have sought to make their party's image more acceptable to the mainstream, for example by denouncing antisemitism. Le Pen's father Jean-Marie Le Pen, founder and long-term leader of the RN's forerunner, had a history of overtly antisemitic comments.\n\nBut critics say the RN's courting of Jews is just a cover allowing it to deny accusations of racism while constantly stigmatising Muslims and foreigners.\n\n(Additional reporting by Paris bureau; Writing by Estelle Shirbon; Editing by Frances Kerry)",

Her party has a high-spending economic programme and seeks to reduce immigration.\n\nA woman screamed \"It's shameful, it's shameful\" as Bardella arrived to cast his vote in Garches near Paris. \"They even invited the leftists,\" he said.\n\nIf the RN does win an absolute majority, French diplomacy could be headed for an unprecedented period of turbulence: with Macron - who has said he will continue his presidency until the end of his term in 2027 - and Bardella jostling for the right to speak for France.\n\nFrance has had three periods of \"cohabitation\" - when the president and government are from opposite political camps - in its post-war history, but none with such radically divergent world views competing at the top of the state.\n\nBardella has already indicated he would challenge Macron on global issues. France could lurch from being a pillar of the EU to a thorn in its side, demanding a rebate of the French contribution to the EU budget, clashing with Brussels over European Commission jobs and reversing Macron's calls for greater EU unity and assertiveness on defence.\n\nA clear RN victory would also bring uncertainty as to where France stands on the Russia-Ukraine war. Le Pen has a history of pro-Russian sentiment and while the party now says it would help Ukraine defend itself against Russian invaders, it has also set out red lines, such as refusing to provide long-range missiles.\n\nIn H\u00e9nin-Beaumont, a town in Le Pen's constituency in northern France where she may be re-elected in the first round, 67-year-old Denis Ledieu said people were suffering due to the long-term deindustrializaton of the region.\n\n\"So if the (RN) promises them things, then why not? They want to try it out, I think,\" he said.\n\nAcross France, early turnout figures were higher than in the 2022 legislative vote, at 25.9% by midday, compared with 18.43% two years ago, the interior ministry said.\n\nOpinion polls have suggested the RN has a comfortable lead of 33%-36% of the popular vote, with a hastily assembled left-wing coalition, the New Popular Front, in second place on 28%-31% and Macron's centrist alliance in third on 20%-23%.\n\nThe New Popular Front includes a wide range of parties, from the moderate centre-left to the hard-left, eurosceptic, anti-NATO party France Unbowed, led by one of Macron's most vitriolic opponents, Jean-Luc Melenchon.\n\nHow the poll numbers will translate into seats in the National Assembly is hard to predict because of how the election works, said Vincent Martigny, professor of political science at the University of Nice and the Ecole Polytechnique.\n\nCandidates can be elected in the first round if they win an absolute majority of votes in their constituency, but that is rare. Most constituencies will need a second round involving all candidates who received votes from at least 12.5% of registered voters in the first round. The top scorer wins.\n\n\"If you have a very high level of participation you might have a third or fourth party that is getting into the struggle. So then of course there's a risk of split voting and we know that the split vote favours the National Rally,\" Martigny said.\n\nFor decades, as the far right steadily gained popularity, voters and parties who did not support it would unite against it whenever it edged closer to national power, but that may not hold true this time.\n\nMartigny said no one knew whether candidates from Macron's camp would consider dropping out of the second round to give rivals from the left a chance of beating the RN, or the reverse.\n\nLe Pen and Bardella have sought to make their party's image more acceptable to the mainstream, for example by denouncing antisemitism. Le Pen's father Jean-Marie Le Pen, founder and long-term leader of the RN's forerunner, had a history of overtly antisemitic comments.\n\nBut critics say the RN's courting of Jews is just a cover allowing it to deny accusations of racism while constantly stigmatising Muslims and foreigners.\n\n(Additional reporting by Ardee Napolitano and Janis Laizans in H\u00e9nin-Beaumont and Clotaire Achi,

France will hold an early legislative election in two rounds on June 30 and July 7 2024, following President Emmanuel Macrons decision which was triggered by his party's heavy defeat to the far-right National Rally in the 2024 European Parliament election.\n\nNurphoto | Nurphoto | Getty Images\n\nFrench voters are heading to the polls on Sunday for the first round of voting in a snap parliamentary election that could see the far-right National Rally group become the biggest party in France's National Assembly, polls suggest.\n\nFrance's President Emmanuel Macron shocked the electorate and political pundits in early June when he called the ballot after his Renaissance party suffered a drubbing in European Parliament elections at the hands of National Rally, led by Jordan Bardella and veteran right-wing politician Marine Le Pen.\n\nFrench far-right Rassemblement National (RN) party President and lead MEP Jordan Bardella (R) gives his electoral card to vote at a polling station in the first round of parliamentary elections in Garches, suburb of Paris, on June 30, 2024.\n\nJulien De Rosa | Afp | Getty Images\n\nCalling the snap election, which involves two rounds of polling on Sunday and on July 7, Macron said the vote would provide \"clarification\" and that \"France needs a clear majority to act in serenity and harmony.\"\n\nAnalysts said Macron's shock move was likely based on the gamble that, even if National Rally performs well, a potentially chaotic and disordered period in power will reduce the likelihood that his rival Le Pen will assume French leadership in 2027.\n\nClose watchers of French politics also note that Macron is ultimately betting on French citizens fearing a far-right government and voting against the nationalist and anti-immigration party.\n\nBut voter polls in June have consistently put National Rally ahead in the race, predicting the party will take around 35% of the vote, ahead of the leftist New Popular Front bloc with around 25-26% of the ballot and Macron's centrist Together alliance, in third place with around 19% of the vote.\n\nEven if a hung parliament is the most likely outcome of the vote -- with no single party looking as if it can achieve an absolute majority of 289 seats in the 577-seat National Assembly -- a strong showing for National Rally will put pressure on Macron to appoint a prime minister from the party.\n\nThat new PM -- who in this scenario would likely be the 28-year-old National Rally President Jordan Bardella -- would then have a significant say over France's domestic and economic policy, while President Macron would remain in charge of foreign policy and defense.\n\nMarine Le Pen, President of the National Rally group in the National Assembly, joins Jordan Bardella, President of the National Rally (Rassemblement National), at the final rally before the upcoming European Parliament election on June 9th, held at Le D\u00f4me de Paris - Palais des Sports, on June 2, 2024.\n\nNurphoto | Nurphoto | Getty Images\n\nIn any case, such an outcome would force ideologically different (and often opposed) politicians into an uneasy and awkward \"cohabitation\" where government is likely fractious and unstable, prompting some concern among economists as to how the vote could affect the euro zone's second-largest economy.\n\n\"The market has reacted negatively to the election uncertainty, with French equities underperforming and the France-Germany 10-year yield spread widening,\" Peter Garnry, head of Strategy at Saxo Bank, said in a note Monday.\n\n\"Despite this, some views suggest the market may be overreacting, drawing parallels to Italy's experience under Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni, whose initially feared policies were more pragmatic than expected,\" he noted.\n\nDeal-making\n\nPolitical analysts point out that a period of hard bargaining is likely to follow the election, as parties look to forge alliances that would enable them to achieve parliamentary majority and govern as fractiously as possible. It could be a torturous process, analysts warn.\n\n\"As with the 2022 elections, no party or bloc is likely to secure enough seats to form a majority government, although some polls give the RN an outside chance of doing so. The next government is highly likely to require some form of negotiation between different parties,\" George Dyson, senior analyst at Control Risks said in analysis Monday.\n\n\"In the event that the RN secures enough votes to come close to forming a government, it will potentially be able to secure support from dissident members of the [center-right] Republicans to secure a majority or argue that no other government is feasible.\"\n\nDyson noted that, as current polling suggests that the united left bloc will be the second largest in parliament after the RN, the next administration may also conceivably be a left-wing government that can cobble together support from the Republicans and Macron's centrist Renaissance party.\n\n\"Macron will likely push for support from centrist parties to put forwards a candidate of his choosing for prime minister, but the parties would be unlikely to provide their support as his party is projected to perform very poorly,\" Dyson said.\n\nFrench President Emmanuel Macron looks on after delivering a speech to the Nexus Institute in the Amare theatre in The Hague on April 11, 2023 as part of a state visit to the Netherlands.\n\nLudovic Marin | AFP | Getty Images\n\nEven if a new prime minister were supported by centrist parties, the government would be \"subject to regular confidence votes and will have to engage in complex consensus-building every time it seeks to pass legislation that is even remotely divisive,\" Dyson added.\n\nA far-right government with a parliamentary majority would meanwhile find itself at odds ideologically with the president, \"who would likely use his position to undermine its policy plans,\" Dyson added. \"A similar but less dramatic situation would likely occur between a left-wing prime minister and the president.\"\n\n\"In all cases, this will result in heightened political uncertainty and instability. It will also result in backtracking and changes to announced policy plans amid repeated negotiating and consensus building, creating regulatory uncertainty for businesses,\" Dyson said.\n\nREAD

Her eurosceptic, anti-immigrant party was a longtime pariah but is now closer to power than it has ever been.\n\nPolls open at 0600 GMT, closing at 1600 GMT in small towns and cities, and at 1800 GMT in the bigger cities, when the first exit polls for the night and seat projections for the decisive second round a week later are expected.\n\nHowever the electoral system can make it hard to estimate the precise distribution of seats in the 577-seat National Assembly, and the final outcome will not be known until the end of voting on July 7.\n\n\"We are going to win an absolute majority,\" said Le Pen in a newspaper interview on Wednesday, predicting that her prot\u00e9g\u00e9, 28-year-old Jordan Bardella would be prime minister. Her party has a high-spending economic programme and seeks to reduce immigration.\n\nIf the RN does win an absolute majority, French diplomacy could be headed for an unprecedented period of turbulence: with Macron - who has said he will continue his presidency until the end of his term in 2027 - and Bardella jostling for the right to speak for France.\n\nFrance has had three periods of \"cohabitation\" - when the president and government are from opposite political camps - in its post-war history, but none with such radically divergent world views competing at the top of the state.\n\nBardella has already indicated he would challenge Macron on global issues. France could lurch from being a pillar of the EU to a thorn in its side, demanding a rebate of the French contribution to the EU budget, clashing with Brussels over European Commission jobs and reversing Macron's calls for greater EU unity and assertiveness on defence.\n\nA clear RN victory would also bring uncertainty as to where France stands on the Russia-Ukraine war. Le Pen has a history of pro-Russian sentiment and while the party now says it would help Ukraine defend itself against Russian invaders, it has also set out red lines, such as refusing to provide long-range missiles.\n\n'SPLIT VOTE FAVOURS RN'\n\nOpinion polls have suggested the RN has a comfortable lead of 33-36% of the popular vote, with a hastily assembled left-wing coalition, the New Popular Front, in second place on 28-31% and Macron's centrist alliance in third on 20-23%.\n\nThe New Popular Front includes a wide range of parties, from the moderate centre-left to the hard-left, eurosceptic, anti-NATO party France Unbowed, led by one of Macron's most vitriolic opponents, Jean-Luc Melenchon.\n\nHow the poll numbers will translate into seats in the National Assembly is hard to predict because of how the election works, said Vincent Martigny, professor of political science at the University of Nice and the Ecole Polytechnique.\n\nCandidates can be elected in the first round if they win an absolute majority of votes in their constituency, but that is rare. Most constituencies will need a second round involving all candidates who received votes from at least 12.5% of registered voters in the first round. The top scorer wins.\n\n\"If you have a very high level of participation you might have a third or fourth party that is getting into the struggle. So then of course there's a risk of split voting and we know that the split vote favours the National Rally,\" said Martigny.\n\nFor decades, as the far right steadily gained popularity, voters and parties who did not support it would unite against it whenever it edged closer to national power, but that may not hold true this time.\n\nMartigny said no one knew whether candidates from Macron's camp would consider dropping out of the second round to give rivals from the left a chance of beating the RN, or the reverse.\n\nLe Pen and Bardella have sought to make their party's image more acceptable to the mainstream, for example by denouncing antisemitism. Le Pen's father Jean-Marie Le Pen, founder and long-term leader of the RN's forerunner, had a history of overtly antisemitic comments.\n\nBut critics say the RN's courting of Jews is just a cover allowing it to deny accusations of racism while constantly stigmatising Muslims and foreigners.

Her eurosceptic, anti-immigrant party was a longtime pariah but is now closer to power than it has ever been.\n\nPolls open at 8am local time (2pm in Singapore), closing at 6pm in small towns and cities, and at 8pm in the bigger cities, when the first exit polls for the night and seat projections for the decisive second round a week later are expected.\n\nHowever the electoral system can make it hard to estimate the precise distribution of seats in the 577-seat National Assembly, and the final outcome will not be known until the end of voting on July 7.\n\n\"We are going to win an absolute majority,\" said Ms Le Pen in a newspaper interview on Wednesday, predicting that her prot\u00e9g\u00e9, 28-year-old Jordan Bardella would be prime minister. Her party has a high-spending economic programme and seeks to reduce immigration.\n\nIf the RN does win an absolute majority, French diplomacy could be headed for an unprecedented period of turbulence: with Mr Macron - who has said he will continue his presidency until the end of his term in 2027 - and Mr Bardella jostling for the right to speak for France.\n\nFrance has had three periods of \"cohabitation\" - when the president and government are from opposite political camps - in its post-war history, but none with such radically divergent world views competing at the top of the state.\n\nMr Bardella has already indicated he would challenge Mr Macron on global issues. France could lurch from being a pillar of the EU to a thorn in its side, demanding a rebate of the French contribution to the EU budget, clashing with Brussels over European Commission jobs and reversing Macron's calls for greater EU unity and assertiveness on defence.\n\nA clear RN victory would also bring uncertainty as to where France stands on the Russia-Ukraine war. Ms Le Pen has a history of pro-Russian sentiment and while the party now says it would help Ukraine defend itself against Russian invaders, it has also set out red lines, such as refusing to provide long-range missiles.\n\nOpinion polls have suggested the RN has a comfortable lead of 33 to 36 per cent of the popular vote, with a hastily assembled left-wing coalition, the New Popular Front, in second place on 28 to 31 per cent and Macron's centrist alliance in third on 20 to 23 per cent.\n\nThe New Popular Front includes a wide range of parties, from the moderate centre-left to the hard-left, eurosceptic, anti-Nato party France Unbowed, led by one of Macron's most vitriolic opponents, Mr Jean-Luc Melenchon.\n\nHow the poll numbers will translate into seats in the National Assembly is hard to predict because of how the election works, said political science professor at the University of Nice and the Ecole Polytechnique Vincent Martigny.\n\nCandidates can be elected in the first round if they win an absolute majority of votes in their constituency, but that is rare. Most constituencies will need a second round involving all candidates who received votes from at least 12.5 per cent of registered voters in the first round. The top scorer wins.\n\n\"If you have a very high level of participation you might have a third or fourth party that is getting into the struggle. So then of course there's a risk of split voting and we know that the split vote favours the National Rally,\" said Prof Martigny.\n\nFor decades, as the far right steadily gained popularity, voters and parties who did not support it would unite against it whenever it edged closer to national power, but that may not hold true this time.\n\nProf Martigny said no one knew whether candidates from Mr Macron's camp would consider dropping out of the second round to give rivals from the left a chance of beating the RN, or the reverse.\n\nMs Le Pen and Mr Bardella have sought to make their party's image more acceptable to the mainstream, for example by denouncing antisemitism. Ms Le Pen's father Jean-Marie Le Pen, founder and long-term leader of the RN's forerunner, had a history of overtly antisemitic comments.\n\nBut critics say the RN's courting of Jews is just a cover allowing it to deny accusations of racism while constantly stigmatising Muslims and foreigners.

When they don't, the government can grind to a halt - a prospect that could haunt Paris as it prepares to host the summer Olympics next month.\n\nFrance most recently had such a government - known as \"cohabitation\" - when right-wing President Jacques Chirac called snap polls and was forced to appoint a socialist, Lionel Jospin, as prime minister, who stayed in the post for five years.\n\nThe first round of votes eliminates weaker candidates ahead of the second round next Sunday. If a candidate wins an absolute majority of votes in the first ballot on a 25% turnout, they win the seat. Typically, only a handful of deputies will be elected this way - but most will go to a second round.\n\nOnly those who win more than 12.5% of ballots cast by registered voters are allowed to stand in the second round. Often this is fought between two candidates, but sometimes three or four. Some candidates choose to drop out at this stage to give their allies a better chance of victory.\n\nMost voters will choose one of three blocs: the RN-led far-right alliance; the New Popular Front (NFP), a recently formed left-wing coalition; and Macron's centrist Ensemble.\n\nThe RN bloc is headed by Jordan Bardella, the 28-year-old party leader handpicked by Le Pen, who has striven to polish the image of a party historically ridden with racism and antisemitism that proliferated under the decades-long leadership of her father, Jean-Marie Le Pen.\n\nUntil recently, the prospect of a far-right government was unthinkable. In the past, opposition parties have made marriages of convenience in an attempt to block the RN - under its previous name, the National Front - from entering government. Now, within a couple of weeks, Bardella could become France's prime minister - and Europe's youngest in more than two centuries.\n\nOn the left, a previously fractious cluster of parties have recently banded together to form the New Popular Front - a coalition meant to resurrect the original Popular Front that prevented fascists from gaining power in 1936. The broad alliance comprises more radical figures like Jean-Luc Melenchon, three-time presidential candidate and leader of the France Unbowed party, as well as moderate leaders like Place Publique's Raphael Glucksmann.\n\nMeanwhile, outgoing French Prime Minister Gabriel Attal - who was only appointed to his post by Macron in January - is representing Macron's centrist Ensemble alliance. Attal was reportedly among the last of Macron's inner circle to learn that a snap election was imminent.\n\nPolls will close at 8 p.m. local time (2 p.m. ET) Sunday, with the full results expected early Monday.", "source": {"uri": "ca.news.yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Rally", "type": "org", "score":

France could lurch from being a pillar of the EU to a thorn in its side, demanding a rebate of the French contribution to the EU budget, clashing with Brussels over European Commission jobs and reversing Macron's calls for greater EU unity and assertiveness on defence.\n\nA clear RN victory would also bring uncertainty as to where France stands on the Russia-Ukraine war. Le Pen has a history of pro-Russian sentiment and while the party now says it would help Ukraine defend itself against Russian invaders, it has also set out red lines, such as refusing to provide long-range missiles.\n\n'Split vote favours RN'\n\nOpinion polls have suggested the RN has a comfortable lead of 33-36% of the popular vote, with a hastily assembled left-wing coalition, the New Popular Front, in second place on 28-31% and Macron's centrist alliance in third on 20-23%.\n\nThe New Popular Front includes a wide range of parties, from the moderate centre-left to the hard-left, eurosceptic, anti-NATO party France Unbowed, led by one of Macron's most vitriolic opponents, Jean-Luc Melenchon.\n\nHow the poll numbers will translate into seats in the National Assembly is hard to predict because of how the election works, said Vincent Martigny, professor of political science at the University of Nice and the Ecole Polytechnique.\n\nCandidates can be elected in the first round if they win an absolute majority of votes in their constituency, but that is rare. Most constituencies will need a second round involving all candidates who received votes from at least 12.5% of registered voters in the first round. The top scorer wins.\n\n\"If you have a very high level of participation you might have a third or fourth party that is getting into the struggle. So then of course there's a risk of split voting and we know that the split vote favours the National Rally,\" said Martigny.\n\nFor decades, as the far right steadily gained popularity, voters and parties who did not support it would unite against it whenever it edged closer to national power, but that may not hold true this time.\n\nMartigny said no one knew whether candidates from Macron's camp would consider dropping out of the second round to give rivals from the left a chance of beating the RN, or the reverse.\n\nLe Pen and Bardella have sought to make their party's image more acceptable to the mainstream, for example by denouncing antisemitism. Le Pen's father Jean-Marie Le Pen, founder and long-term leader of the RN's forerunner, had a history of overtly antisemitic comments.\n\nBut critics say the RN's courting of Jews is just a cover allowing it to deny accusations of racism while constantly stigmatising Muslims and foreigners.", "source": {"uri": "deccanherald.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Deccan Herald"}, "authors":

Voting in a number of overseas territories had already started on Saturday due to the time difference. The first projections are expected shortly after 8 pm.\n\nMacron called the snap election after the far-right National Rally (RN) made large gains in elections to the European Parliament at the beginning of this month.\n\nThe RN is leading in pre-election polling ahead of the new leftist alliance, the New Popular Front (NPF), recently established to contest the elections. The Ensemble (Together) alliance, led by Macron's Renaissance party, is trailing in third place.\n\nRecent polls put Macron's centrist camp in third place with between 20% and 20.5%. Le Pen's RN and its allies were clearly ahead with 36% to 36.5%, followed by the NPF with 29%.\n\nIf the RN secures a majority in the 577-member National Assembly, Macron will be compelled to appoint a prime minister from its ranks to secure a stable Cabinet.\n\nCandidates securing an absolute majority in the first round are elected to the assembly, but in most constituencies the victor will emerge only after the second round on July 7.\n\nForecasts predict that the right-wing nationalists could become the strongest force in the National Assembly. Whether it could also be enough for an absolute majority is unclear - also because local alliances are often formed between the two rounds of voting, which influence the outcome. While the left could remain stable, Macron's centrist camp is likely to lose seats.\n\nSuch an outcome would have serious consequences.\n\nThe National Assembly is one of two French chambers of parliament. It is involved in legislation and can topple the government with a vote of no confidence.\n\nIf a bloc other than Macron's centrist camp were to win an absolute majority, Macron would de facto be forced to appoint a prime minister from its ranks. There would then be a so-called cohabitation. Macron's power would shrink significantly and the prime minister would become more important.\n\nThe right-wing nationalists are explicitly aiming to win the election and assume government responsibility. RN party leader Jordan Bardella is set to become prime minister, replacing Macron's incumbent Gabriel Attal.\n\nThe election is being followed with interest in Brussels and Berlin.\n\nGerman businesses are concerned about the consequences of the election if the extreme right or the extreme left come to power.\n\n\"When analysing the economic policy announcements of the right and the left, German and French companies come to the same conclusion: France's attractiveness would suffer,\" said Patrick Brandmaier, managing director of the Franco-German Chamber of Industry and Commerce, in Paris.\n\nMacron's second and final term in office ends in 2027. A sharp decline in support for his Renaissance-led bloc is certain to limit his effectiveness.\n\nNational Rally's Marine Le Pen is seen as a serious contender in the next presidential elections.",

Voter participation is a key factor in this election because it will help determine how many of President Emmanuel Macron's Ensemble candidates qualify for next week's final round of voting.\n\nMacron called for the unexpected legislative poll earlier this month after losing European parliamentary elections to the far-right Rassemblement National (RN) by a wide margin.\n\nAlthough the move stunned the public and angered many even in his own camp, Macron defended it as a \"moment of clarification\" for citizens to decide who they wanted to govern the country given the steady rise of Marine Le Pen's RN party. Macron also argued that the National Assembly, where his centrist alliance lost its outright majority in 2022, was riven by \"disorder\" that made legislating difficult.\n\nBut Macron's extraordinary gamble to call snap elections looks set to backfire.\n\nAlthough seat projections are difficult to make given the two-round voting format, pollsters say the RN may win an outright majority of 289 out of 577 seats in the assembly. That would force Macron into an uncomfortable power-sharing government known as a \"cohabitation\" and compel him to pick Le Pen's 28-year-old prot\u00e9g\u00e9 Jordan Bardella as prime minister.\n\nPolls opened at 8am local time, and will close at 6pm in small towns and 8pm in big cities when exit polls will be unveiled. The final results will not be known until after the second round on July 7.\n\nMany French voters have come to reject Macron, who they see as elitist and out of touch, and prefer Le Pen's RN for its emphasis on cost of living issues and wages, on top of its traditional anti-immigration stance. Public opinion has also drifted rightward in the past decade as identity politics moved centre stage with the RN casting France's Muslim minority as a threat to the secular values of the republic.\n\nAn Ipsos poll on Friday showed Le Pen's RN on track to win the first round with 32 per cent of voting intentions, while a leftwing alliance known as the Nouveau Front Populaire (NFP) was at 29 per cent. Ensemble was set to come in third with 20 per cent of the vote.\n\nThe election may also end in a hung parliament in which there is no majority behind a prime minister who can survive a no-confidence vote. Gridlock would ensue, and Macron cannot call for another dissolution of parliament for a year.\n\nIf the RN triumphs and forces a cohabitation with Macron after more than 50 years in opposition, it will mark the consecration for Le Pen's decade-long effort to \"detoxify\" the party her father co-founded with a former soldier in the French unit of the Nazi's Waffen-SS.\n\nIn a cohabitation, the RN would run the government, domestic affairs and set the budget, while Macron would remain chief of the armed forces and set foreign policy. There have been three cohabitations in France's postwar history, but none involving parties with such diametrically opposite views.\n\nLe Pen and Bardella have both signalled in recent days that they would challenge the president's authority including on defence and foreign policy -- a prospect which is likely to alarm allies and markets alike.\n\nThe NFP alliance -- consisting of the far-left La France Insoumise (LFI) led by Jean-Luc M\u00e9lenchon, the centre-left Socialists, the Greens and the Communists -- has a heavy tax-and-spend economic programme and has cast itself as the only way to block the RN. But its factions have different views on many issues and have been unable to settle on a candidate for prime minister. The three-time presidential candidate M\u00e9lenchon has indicated he wants the job, but his allies disagree.\n\nThe two-round format complicates seat projections. Candidates who rack up an absolute majority in the first round win their seat outright -- a rare occurrence. Most of the 577 districts will be decided in a run-off next Sunday between candidates who won at least 12.5 per cent of registered voters in the first round.\n\nTurnout in parliamentary elections has usually hovered around 50 per cent, though pollsters expect a higher participation on Sunday. The higher the turnout, the more chances for Macron's centrist candidates to make it into the second round, resulting potentially in hundreds of three-way run-offs.\n\nParties will have 48 hours after the first round to decide whether to maintain their candidates for the run-offs, and pressure will mount on Macron's candidates and the left's to tactically drop out to stave off the RN.", "source":

When they don't, the government can grind to a halt - a prospect that could haunt Paris as it prepares to host the summer Olympics next month.\n\nFrance most recently had such a government - known as \"cohabitation\" - when right-wing President Jaques Chirac called snap polls and was forced to appoint a socialist, Lionel Jospin, as prime minister, who stayed in the post for five years.\n\nThe first round of votes eliminates weaker candidates ahead of the second round next Sunday. If a candidate wins an absolute majority of votes in the first ballot on a 25% turnout, they win the seat. Typically, only a handful of deputies will be elected this way - but most will go to a second round.\n\nOnly those who win more than 12.5% of ballots cast by registered voters are allowed to stand in the second round. Often this is fought between two candidates, but sometimes three or four. Some candidates choose to drop out at this stage to give their allies a better chance of victory.\n\nRN leader Jordan Bardella (left), French prime minister Gabriel Attal (center) and France Unbowed MP Manuel Bompard (right) take part in a televised debate, June 25, 2024.\n\nDimitar Dilkoff/AFP/Pool/Getty Images\n\nMost voters will choose one of three blocs: the RN-led far-right alliance; the New Popular Front (NFP), a recently-formed left-wing coalition; and Macron's centrist Ensemble.\n\nThe RN bloc is headed by Jordan Bardella, the 28-year-old party leader handpicked by Le Pen, who has striven to polish the image of a party historically ridden with racism and antisemitism that proliferated under the decades-long leadership of her father, Jean-Marie Le Pen.\n\nUntil recently, the prospect of a far-right government was unthinkable. In the past, opposition parties have made marriages of convenience in an attempt to block the RN - under its previous name, the National Front - from entering government. Now, within a couple of weeks, Bardella could become France's prime minister - and Europe's youngest in more than two centuries.\n\nOn the left, a previously fractious cluster of parties have recently banded together to form the New Popular Front - a coalition meant to resurrect the original Popular Front that prevented fascists from gaining power in 1936. The broad alliance comprises more radical figures like Jean-Luc Melenchon, three-time presidential candidate and leader of the France Unbowed party, as well as moderate leaders like Place Publique's Raphael Glucksmann.\n\nMeanwhile, outgoing French prime minister Gabriel Attal - who was only appointed to his post by Macron in January - is representing Macron's centrist Ensemble alliance. Attal was reportedly among the last of Macron's inner circle to learn that a snap election was imminent.\n\nPolls will close at 8 p.m. local time (2 p.m. ET) Sunday, with the full results expected early Monday.", "source": {"uri": "cnn.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "CNN"}, "authors": [{"uri": "christian_edwards@cnn.com", "name": "Christian Edwards", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}],

Her Eurosceptic, anti-immigrant party was a long-time pariah but is now closer to power than it has ever been.\n\nPolls open at 6am GMT (2pm Hong Kong time), closing at 4pm GMT in small towns and cities, and at 6pm GMT in the bigger cities, when the first exit polls for the night and seat projections for the decisive second round a week later are expected.\n\nHowever the electoral system can make it hard to estimate the precise distribution of seats in the 577-seat National Assembly, and the final outcome will not be known until the end of voting on July 7.\n\n\u201cWe are going to win an absolute majority,\u201d said Le Pen in a newspaper interview on Wednesday, predicting that her prot\u00e9g\u00e9, 28-year-old Jordan Bardella would be prime minister. Her party has a high-spending economic programme and seeks to reduce immigration.\n\nIf the RN does win an absolute majority, French diplomacy could be headed for an unprecedented period of turbulence: with Macron \u2013 who has said he will continue his presidency until the end of his term in 2027 \u2013 and Bardella jostling for the right to speak for France.\n\nFrance has had three periods of \u201ccohabitation\u201d \u2013 when the president and government are from opposite political camps \u2013 in its post-war history, but none with such radically divergent world views competing at the top of the state.\n\nBardella has already indicated he would challenge Macron on global issues. France could lurch from being a pillar of the EU to a thorn in its side, demanding a rebate of the French contribution to the EU budget, clashing with Brussels over European Commission jobs and reversing Macron\u2019s calls for greater EU unity and assertiveness on defence.\n\nA clear RN victory would also bring uncertainty as to where France stands on the Russia-Ukraine war. Le Pen has a history of pro-Russian sentiment and while the party now says it would help Ukraine defend itself against Russian invaders, it has also set out red lines, such as refusing to provide long-range missiles.\n\nOpinion polls have suggested the RN has a comfortable lead of 33 to 36 per cent of the popular vote, with a hastily assembled left-wing coalition, the New Popular Front, in second place on 28 to 31 per cent and Macron\u2019s centrist alliance in third on 20 to 23 per cent.\n\nThe New Popular Front includes a wide range of parties, from the moderate centre-left to the hard-left, Eurosceptic, anti-Nato party France Unbowed, led by one of Macron\u2019s most vitriolic opponents, Jean-Luc Melenchon.\n\nHow the poll numbers will translate into seats in the National Assembly is hard to predict because of how the election works, said Vincent Martigny, professor of political science at the University of Nice and the Ecole Polytechnique.\n\nCandidates can be elected in the first round if they win an absolute majority of votes in their constituency, but that is rare. Most constituencies will need a second round involving all candidates who received votes from at least 12.5 per cent of registered voters in the first round. The top scorer wins.\n\n\u201cIf you have a very high level of participation you might have a third or fourth party that is getting into the struggle. So then of course there\u2019s a risk of split voting and we know that the split vote favours the National Rally,\u201d said Martigny.\n\nFor decades, as the far-right steadily gained popularity, voters and parties who did not support it would unite against it whenever it edged closer to national power, but that may not hold true this time.\n\nMartigny said no one knew whether candidates from Macron\u2019s camp would consider dropping out of the second round to give rivals from the left a chance of beating the RN, or the reverse.\n\nLe Pen and Bardella have sought to make their party\u2019s image more acceptable to the mainstream, for example by denouncing antisemitism. Le Pen\u2019s father Jean-Marie Le Pen, founder and long-term leader of the RN\u2019s forerunner, had a history of overtly antisemitic comments.\n\nBut critics say the RN\u2019s courting of Jews is just a cover allowing it to deny accusations of racism while constantly stigmatising Muslims and foreigners.", "source": {"uri": "scmp.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "South China Morning Post"},

If the RN does win an absolute majority, French diplomacy could be headed for an unprecedented period of turbulence: with Macron - who has said he will continue his presidency until the end of his term in 2027 - and Bardella jostling for the right to speak for France.\n\nFrench voters cast their ballots on Sunday in the first round of a snap parliamentary election that could usher in the country's first far-right government since World War Two, a potential sea change at the heart of the European Union.\n\nPresident Emmanuel Macron stunned the country when he called the vote after his centrist alliance was crushed in European elections this month by Marine Le Pen's National Rally (RN). Her eurosceptic, anti-immigrant party was a longtime pariah but is now closer to power than it has ever been. Polls open at 0600 GMT, closing at 1600 GMT in small towns and cities, and at 1800 GMT in the bigger cities, when the first exit polls for the night and seat projections for the decisive second round a week later are expected.\n\nHowever the electoral system can make it hard to estimate the precise distribution of seats in the 577-seat National Assembly, and the final outcome will not be known until the end of voting on July 7. \"We are going to win an absolute majority,\" said Le Pen in a newspaper interview on Wednesday, predicting that her prot\u00e9g\u00e9, 28-year-old Jordan Bardella would be prime minister. Her party has a high-spending economic programme and seeks to reduce immigration.\n\nIf the RN does win an absolute majority, French diplomacy could be headed for an unprecedented period of turbulence: with Macron - who has said he will continue his presidency until the end of his term in 2027 - and Bardella jostling for the right to speak for France. France has had three periods of \"cohabitation\" - when the president and government are from opposite political camps - in its post-war history, but none with such radically divergent world views competing at the top of the state.\n\nBardella has already indicated he would challenge Macron on global issues. France could lurch from being a pillar of the EU to a thorn in its side, demanding a rebate of the French contribution to the EU budget, clashing with Brussels over European Commission jobs and reversing Macron's calls for greater EU unity and assertiveness on defence. A clear RN victory would also bring uncertainty as to where France stands on the Russia-Ukraine war. Le Pen has a history of pro-Russian sentiment and while the party now says it would help Ukraine defend itself against Russian invaders, it has also set out red lines, such as refusing to provide long-range missiles.\n\n'SPLIT VOTE FAVOURS RN' Opinion polls have suggested the RN has a comfortable lead of 33-36% of the popular vote, with a hastily assembled left-wing coalition, the New Popular Front, in second place on 28-31% and Macron's centrist alliance in third on 20-23%.\n\nThe New Popular Front includes a wide range of parties, from the moderate centre-left to the hard-left, eurosceptic, anti-NATO party France Unbowed, led by one of Macron's most vitriolic opponents, Jean-Luc Melenchon. How the poll numbers will translate into seats in the National Assembly is hard to predict because of how the election works, said Vincent Martigny, professor of political science at the University of Nice and the Ecole Polytechnique.\n\nCandidates can be elected in the first round if they win an absolute majority of votes in their constituency, but that is rare. Most constituencies will need a second round involving all candidates who received votes from at least 12.5% of registered voters in the first round. The top scorer wins. \"If you have a very high level of participation you might have a third or fourth party that is getting into the struggle. So then of course there's a risk of split voting and we know that the split vote favours the National Rally,\" said Martigny.\n\nFor decades, as the far right steadily gained popularity, voters and parties who did not support it would unite against it whenever it edged closer to national power, but that may not hold true this time. Martigny said no one knew whether candidates from Macron's camp would consider dropping out of the second round to give rivals from the left a chance of beating the RN, or the reverse.\n\nLe Pen and Bardella have sought to make their party's image more acceptable to the mainstream, for example by denouncing antisemitism. Le Pen's father Jean-Marie Le Pen, founder and long-term leader of the RN's forerunner, had a history of overtly antisemitic comments. But critics say the RN's courting of Jews is just a cover allowing it to deny accusations of racism while constantly stigmatising Muslims and foreigners.

The election has caused France to be uncertain and has scared its European neighbors and the financial markets.\n\nLes Echos newspaper released a new Opinion Way poll on Friday that showed the National Rally could get as much as 37% of the vote. This is two percentage points more than the poll's previous score from last week.\n\nThe expected vote total for Macron's moderate Together party was 20%, which is two points less than the previous report. The left-wing group New Popular Front had the same 28% of the vote as before.\n\nIn a different poll put together by Elabe, BFM TV found that the RN and its allies could get between 260 and 295 seats in the new parliament. This would put them over the 289-seat threshold needed for an absolute majority, which would give them a clear mandate to rule.\n\nIt's hard to make accurate seat projections because the outcome rests on how 577 constituencies across France vote. Also, after Sunday's first round, candidates who are against the RN may work together to pull their names from the race in order to beat far-right candidates in the second round on July 7.\n\nTo win in the first round, a candidate needs to get an absolute majority of the votes cast as well as votes from at least 25% of the eligible voters in the district. It's hard to do this, and most districts have to go to a second round of voting. The winner in the second round is the person who got the most votes.\n\nThe idea of either an RN-led government or a split parliament has scared the financial markets. On Friday, the risk premium on French government bonds rose to its highest level since the euro zone crisis in 2012.\n\nIf the National Rally won the election outright, they would have to \"cohabit\" with Macron for the rest of his term, until 2027. This would be the first time that a French president had to share power with a party that is not part of the major political party.\n\nThe RN has toned down some of its anti-EU views and promised to be responsible with money, but it's still not clear how it will pay for its election promises or what its strong doubts about the EU will mean for its future unity.\n\nRacism is at the heart of the party's \"French first\" policies, even though Le Pen is trying to clean up the party she received from her racist father, Jean-Marie.\n\nIn the last TV debate on Thursday, Macron's Prime Minister Gabriel Attal said that his RN opponent Jordan Bardella was still letting racist speech happen in his far-right camp. Bardella denied the allegation.\n\nThe party has done well because people are angry at Macron. Macron's choice to run for president in 2017 as the leader of a new, broad-based centrist movement changed French politics and was meant to stop the rise of radical parties.\n\nPeople say that he made changes that were good for business, but many French voters think that he didn't care about their worries about the rising cost of living and worsening public services.\n\nLe Pen hinted at the kinds of fights that living together might cause on Friday when she said that an RN prime minister would block Macron's choice for the French official at the European Commission in Brussels.\n\nShe told Europe 1 radio, \"The prime minister, not the president, is the one who gets to choose the French commissioner.\" A foreign source said Thursday that Macron backed Thierry Breton for a new term. Breton is a former businessman who now oversees the internal markets at the Commission.\n\nFrance's Macron Calls Snap Election After Huge Losses in EU Elections\n\nGlobal Unemployment to Decline

Or will he serve France to far-right on platter?", "body": "French President Emmanuel Macron had called snap parliamentary elections with the hope that the voters would rally around his centrist coalition to stop the surge of far-right in the country. The surveys do not suggest it's happening.\n\nVoters in France are casting their ballots in the first round of elections on Sunday (June 30). The second round will be held on July 7.\n\nSince the announcement of polls, surveys have shown that the far-right bloc led by National Rally (RN) of Marine Le Pen is going to emerge as the single-largest party and Macron's centrists could be relegated to a distant third.\n\nEarlier this month, Macron dissolved the parliament and called snap elections after Le Pen's RN won the European Parliament elections in the country. It polls more than double the votes than Macron's centrist coalition. In a shock-address from the presidential palace, Macron then said the people have spoken and must be heard through the parliamentary elections.\n\n\"I have decided to give you back the choice of our parliamentary future through the vote. I am therefore dissolving the National Assembly,\" said Macron.\n\nThe choice of the French public does not appear to be what Macron would have thought. The condition is such that his Renaissance (RE) party appears to be out of the fight and the contest appears to be between the RE and the New Popular Front, a newly-formed coalition of leftist parties .\n\nMacron's centrists staring at rout, say polls\n\nThe Le Pen-led RN is set to win nearly the double of votes than Macron's bloc, according to the latest surveys.\n\nAs per the opinion poll published just two days before the voting on Friday in Les Echos newspaper, the RN was set to win 37 per cent of the popular vote as against 20 per cent of Macron's bloc.\n\nA week before, the RN was projected to win 35 per cent of the vote and Macron's bloc 22.\n\nIn both the polls, the newly-formed left-wing bloc New Popular Front (NPF) was set to win 28 per cent of the vote.\n\nThe figures are in line with other polls published since the announcement of the elections . Previously, the polls by Ipsos, Odoxa, and Opinionway-Vae Solis have also similarly shown that RN is on its way to be the single-largest party, followed by the leftist coalition NPF, and Macron's RE-led bloc relegated to a distant third.\n\nDid Macron misjudge French public's mood?\n\nFrance, like much of Europe, is in the throes of a far-right surge -- or so the flood of banner headlines suggest.\n\nThe right-wing forces are indeed on a march in France but neither all of these parties 'far-right' -- extremists -- nor the popular anger a result of a widespread acceptance of far-right beliefs. It is a mix of frustration with status quo of years of leftist and centrist rule, the concerns around immigration unaddressed by the centrists and leftists, economic insecurities, and certainly rising acceptance and mainstreaming of right-wing ideas.\n\nThen, what would explain Macron's decision to call elections right after a defeat from the right-wing parties in the European Union elections?\n\nMacron appears to have been driven by the idea that faced with the choice of a far-right surge, whose antisemitic and neo-Nazi associations have shocked many, and the left-wing forces who will hike taxes and bring unpopular spending plans, the French public would rally around Macron's pragmatic right-leaning centrist bloc. As polls suggest, it appears to have been a miscalculation.\n\nThe New York Times has reported that the chatter in Paris is that Macron has played a \"wild gamble\" after having \"lost touch with reality\" with his \"blinding ego\". The paper reported that people are struggling to understand how Macron could risk so much. The stakes are unprecedented. A far-right victory would mean the takeover of domestic polity by a fundamentally different dispensation. Even though Macron will remain in office till 2027 and, as president, will be in charge of foreign and defence policies, a RN government would mean he would have a constant tussle at home.\n\nAt a time when Macron has supported Ukraine to a hilt amid the worst security threat to the continent since World War II, the takeover of France by Europe sceptic RN, whose leader Le Pen has praised Russian leader Vladimir Putin in the past and has expressed questions over the support of Ukraine, could be disastrous for the agenda of Macron's presidency.\n\nSwasti Rao, a scholar of Europe at the Manohar Parrikar Institute for Defence Studies and Analyses (MP-IDSA), says that the upcoming phase of 'cohabitation' would not be easy for Macron. Cohabitation is the notion in France when the presidency and the parliament are controlled by different parties.\n\n\"Macron, as president, may remain in charge of foreign or defence policies, but he would lose the domestic agenda. He would also lose strict control over the country and government's finances. Both of these developments could derail his defence spending plans and foreign policy objectives, such as the assistance to Ukraine in terms of financial aid or weapon deliveries or training of personnel. The pressure on him to resign as his party would have lost popular vote would also rise,\" said Rao, an Associate Fellow at the Europe and Eurasia Center at MP-IDSA.\n\nHow to understand Macron's unpopularity, far-right's surge?\n\nMacron, who has been elected as the President of France twice and who has never lost, appears to have been driven into a corner. How did it come to this?\n\nFor starters, the centrist Macron faced double whammy. On immigration and national security, he initiated tough policies. That alienated sections of left-leaning voters. For many on the right, however, he was not stern enough. As voters from both sides of the spectrum drifted to extreme positions, the centrist platform found itself facing challenges from converging left-wing parties and the rising right-wing party RN of Le Pen.\n\nRao of the MP-IDSA, however, stresses that the European or French right-wing is not the MAGA-type right-wing as seen in the United States. She says that the European right-wing forces have a moderating effect once they come to power.\n\nRao tells Firstpost, \"Being in the government has a sobering effect on you. If you have to govern, you have to sober up. You may say you want to ban immigrants but, once you are in power, you have to face the reality that Europe is an ageing society and it needs immigrants. The demographic decline is way too clear in Italy. After coming to power, Italian Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni has moved from her rhetoric against immigration in general to checking illegal immigration. She has largely moderated just like any other mainstream leader. The same moderation is expected to an extent to France's National Rally if and when it comes to power.\"\n\nWhile France's shares the concerns over immigration and like in Italy or Germany, Rao says France also faces anti-incumbency that has been in making for more than a year now -- France was hit with major violence over proposed pension reforms last year.\n\n\"The anxiety around immigration is a major contributor to the support for right-wing parties in Europe. In France, the support for the far-right is further driven by anti-incumbency against Macron. The EU election results and the results of the French parliamentary elections should make the European centrists realise that if they will not address immigration or look into other grievances of people, the anxious voters will keep turning to the right-wing,\" says Rao.", "source": {"uri": "firstpost.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Firstpost"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

The outcome may determine whether Macron's centrist coalition retains power or if France faces a period of political cohabitation with the far-right National Rally (RN), led by Marine Le Pen.\n\nVoting commenced at 8 am local time (2 am ET), marking the start of the process to elect the 577 members of the National Assembly. This election, scheduled three years ahead of the regular term, follows a significant setback for Macron's Renaissance party in the recent European Parliament elections, where the RN emerged victorious. Responding swiftly to this defeat, Macron opted for the snap election, the first in France since 1997, acknowledging the electorate's message, as reported by CNN. Regardless of the election's outcome, Macron has committed to serving until the next presidential elections in 2027. The National Assembly, responsible for enacting domestic legislation ranging from social policies to economic reforms, plays a crucial role alongside the president, who oversees foreign affairs, European policies, and defence strategies.\n\nThe prospect of political \"cohabitation,\" where the president and parliament are from different political camps, looms large. Such a scenario, historically challenging for governance, could complicate matters for France as it prepares to host the upcoming summer Olympics. France has experienced cohabitation before, notably during President Jacques Chirac's tenure, when a conservative president worked alongside a socialist prime minister appointed after snap elections. This historical precedent underscores the potential challenges of divided governance.\n\nThe electoral process involves two rounds: the current first round, which narrows down the field, and a subsequent round where candidates compete for the majority needed to secure parliamentary seats. Candidates must secure more than 12.5 per cent of the vote to advance to the second round, where final outcomes are decided, according to CNN. The electorate faces a choice among several political blocs: the RN-led far-right coalition, the New Popular Front (NFP) representing the left, and Macron's centrist Ensemble alliance. Each bloc presents distinct visions for France's future, appealing to voters with diverse ideological leanings.\n\nLeading the RN bloc is Jordan Bardella, handpicked by Marine Le Pen to lead the party's efforts to broaden its appeal beyond its historically contentious issues of racism and antisemitism. Bardella's leadership marks a significant shift as the RN seeks mainstream acceptance and potentially positions itself to lead the government. On the left, the NFP has emerged as a coalition uniting various factions, from staunch progressives like Jean-Luc Melenchon to more moderate figures such as Raphael Glucksmann. This coalition aims to revive the spirit of the original Popular Front, which historically countered fascist influences in French politics.\n\nRepresenting Macron's centrist Ensemble alliance is outgoing Prime Minister Gabriel Attal, appointed just months before the snap election was announced. Attal, like Macron, faces the challenge of retaining support amid a competitive electoral landscape reshaped by recent political developments. Polling stations will close at 8 pm local time (2 pm ET) on Sunday, with final results expected early the following day. The election's outcome will not only determine the composition of the National Assembly but also set the tone for Macron's presidency going forward, influencing his ability to implement key policies and navigate France's role in global affairs.\n\nThe anticipation surrounding these elections reflects broader concerns about the direction of French politics and its implications for Europe. As voters cast their ballots, the stakes are high, with potential ramifications extending well beyond domestic policy to shape France's international standing and alliances, CNN reported.

France votes in first round of snap polls", "body": "French voters are now casting their ballots in the initial round of the country's unexpected parliamentary elections, a pivotal event that could reshape President Emmanuel Macron's political landscape, CNN reported.\n\nIMAGE: French President Emmanuel Macron leaves a voting booth, as he visits a polling station to vote in the first round of the early French parliamentary elections, in Le Touquet-Paris-Plage, France, June 30, 2024. Photograph: Yara Nardi/Pool/Reuters\n\nThe outcome may determine whether Macron's centrist coalition retains power or if France faces a period of political cohabitation with the far-right National Rally, led by Marine Le Pen.\n\nVoting commenced at 8 am local time (2 am ET), marking the start of the process to elect the 577 members of the National Assembly.\n\nThis election, scheduled three years ahead of the regular term, follows a significant setback for Macron's Renaissance party in the recent European Parliament elections, where the RN emerged victorious.\n\nResponding swiftly to this defeat, Macron opted for the snap election, the first in France since 1997, acknowledging the electorate's message, as reported by CNN.\n\nRegardless of the election's outcome, Macron has committed to serving until the next presidential elections in 2027.\n\nThe National Assembly, responsible for enacting domestic legislation ranging from social policies to economic reforms, plays a crucial role alongside the president, who oversees foreign affairs, European policies, and defence strategies.\n\nThe prospect of political \"cohabitation,\" where the president and parliament are from different political camps, looms large.\n\nSuch a scenario, historically challenging for governance, could complicate matters for France as it prepares to host the upcoming summer Olympics.\n\nFrance has experienced cohabitation before, notably during President Jacques Chirac's tenure, when a conservative president worked alongside a socialist prime minister appointed after snap elections.\n\nThis historical precedent underscores the potential challenges of divided governance.\n\nThe electoral process involves two rounds: the current first round, which narrows down the field, and a subsequent round where candidates compete for the majority needed to secure parliamentary seats. Candidates must secure more than 12.5 percent of the vote to advance to the second round, where final outcomes are decided, according to CNN.\n\nThe electorate faces a choice among several political blocs: the RN-led far-right coalition, the New Popular Front representing the left, and Macron's centrist Ensemble alliance. Each bloc presents distinct visions for France's future, appealing to voters with diverse ideological leanings.\n\nLeading the RN bloc is Jordan Bardella, handpicked by Marine Le Pen to lead the party's efforts to broaden its appeal beyond its historically contentious issues of racism and antisemitism.\n\nBardella's leadership marks a significant shift as the RN seeks mainstream acceptance and potentially positions itself to lead the government.\n\nOn the left, the NFP has emerged as a coalition uniting various factions, from staunch progressives like Jean-Luc Melenchon to more moderate figures such as Raphael Glucksmann.\n\nThis coalition aims to revive the spirit of the original Popular Front, which historically countered fascist influences in French politics.\n\nRepresenting Macron's centrist Ensemble alliance is outgoing Prime Minister Gabriel Attal, appointed just months before the snap election was announced. Attal, like Macron, faces the challenge of retaining support amid a competitive electoral landscape reshaped by recent political developments.\n\nPolling stations will close at 8 pm local time (2 pm ET) on Sunday, with final results expected early the following day.\n\nThe election's outcome will not only determine the composition of the National Assembly but also set the tone for Macron's presidency going forward, influencing his ability to implement key policies and navigate France's role in global affairs.\n\nThe anticipation surrounding these elections reflects broader concerns about the direction of French politics and its implications for Europe.\n\nAs voters cast their ballots, the stakes are high, with potential ramifications extending well beyond domestic policy to shape France's international standing and alliances, CNN reported.", "source": {"uri": "rediff.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Rediff.com India Ltd."}, "authors": [{"uri": "senjo_m_r@rediff.com",

The vote, which begins on Sunday, July 30, has been unanimously described by analysts as \"high-stakes\". If the National Rally emerges as the winner, - RN) led by Marine Le Pen - as polls predict - will be the first time France has had a far-right government since World War II and the Nazi occupation, Euronews has warned.\n\nMacron's strategy of creating a climate of fear could backfire on him.\n\nThe theory of radicalization was spread as a \"blessing\" by Emmanuel Macron last week, declaring in a popular podcast that France was at risk of \"civil war\" if Le Pen's anti-immigration party or his left-wing New Popular Front coalition won. He warned that if either party came to power, chaos and division would ensue. Dismissing two diametrically opposed political movements, he said that the national ultimatum classifies people according to religion and origin, which leads to stigma and cultivating a climate of discord.\n\nAmong the groups that make up the New Popular Front, Macron took issue with M\u00e9lenchon's France Insoumise, accusing it of doing what Le Pen did, in reverse. He said the radical left also categorized people according to their religious profile or the communities they belonged to, thus isolating them from the broader national community. M\u00e9lenchon responded that Macron's policies were fueling civil war, citing unrest in New Caledonia, a French-controlled territory in the Pacific.\n\nHe repeated the same smear tactic in his remarks from Brussels, during a summit of EU leaders, saying that \"unbridled racism and anti-Semitism\" had taken off in France.\n\nBut political analysts suggest that Macron's strategy of stirring up a climate of fear could backfire on him. So far, Macron has insisted on taking risks, presenting the centrist liberals in the Together party, under his leadership, as the only rational force capable of stopping the collapse of French society.\n\nAntoine Bristel, director of the Jean Jaur\u00e8s Foundation think tank, told the Guardian that since Macron called the election, it has been very difficult to make safe assessments of France's political future. \"Macron has become increasingly unpredictable,\" he said. \"He seems to be running the country like a Netflix series - and every episode has to end with a cliffhanger about what happens next.\"\n\nMacron called parliamentary elections after his centrist Masi party was defeated by the National Rally in the European elections, saying they would \"clarify\" the political landscape. But even those close to the president admit that many of his voters are uncomfortable with the resulting political turmoil and feel Macron himself created the chaos.\n\nThe exact results of the two-round election are difficult to predict, with turnout expected to be particularly high in the first round. However, in the latest opinion polls, the far-right National Rally party appears to be in first place - with 35-37%. It is followed by the left-wing coalition of the New Popular Front (France Insoumise, Communist Party, Greens, Socialists) with 28%. \"With Macron\" is in third place, with no more than 20% in the polls.\n\nPolitical analysts say France is entering uncharted territory. If Le Pen's party manages to move from its current 88 seats to an absolute majority of 289, it will form a far-right government and Macron will have to share power. The other scenario is that the National Coalition wins the most seats but falls short of an absolute majority. Macron could then find himself facing a deadlocked parliament, unable to form a strong majority to govern Europe's second-largest economy.", "source": {"uri": "thevalleypost.com", "dataType": "news",

It could be a torturous process, analysts warn.\n\n\"As with the 2022 elections, no party or bloc is likely to secure enough seats to form a majority government, although some polls give the RN an outside chance of doing so. The next government is highly likely to require some form of negotiation between different parties,\" George Dyson, senior analyst at Control Risks said in analysis Monday.\n\n\"In the event that the RN secures enough votes to come close to forming a government, it will potentially be able to secure support from dissident members of the [center-right] Republicans to secure a majority or argue that no other government is feasible.\"\n\nDyson noted that, as current polling suggests that the united left bloc will be the second largest in parliament after the RN, the next administration may also conceivably be a left-wing government that can cobble together support from the Republicans and Macron's centrist Renaissance party.\n\n\"Macron will likely push for support from centrist parties to put forwards a candidate of his choosing for prime minister, but the parties would be unlikely to provide their support as his party is projected to perform very poorly,\" Dyson said.\n\nEven if a new prime minister were supported by centrist parties, the government would be \"subject to regular confidence votes and will have to engage in complex consensus-building every time it seeks to pass legislation that is even remotely divisive,\" Dyson added.\n\nA far-right government with a parliamentary majority would meanwhile find itself at odds ideologically with the president, \"who would likely use his position to undermine its policy plans,\" Dyson added. \"A similar but less dramatic situation would likely occur between a left-wing prime minister and the president.\"\n\n\"In all cases, this will result in heightened political uncertainty and instability. It will also result in backtracking and changes to announced policy plans amid repeated negotiating and consensus building, creating regulatory uncertainty for businesses,\" Dyson said.", "source": {"uri": "nbcnewyork.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "NBC New York"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Rally", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "National Rally"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elections_to_the_European_Parliament", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Elections to the European Parliament"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emmanuel_Macron", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Emmanuel Macron"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Renaissance", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Renaissance"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electoral_district", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Electoral district"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/France", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "France"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jordan_Bardella", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Jordan Bardella"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Assembly_(France)", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "National Assembly (France)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Far-right_politics", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Far-right politics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marine_Le_Pen", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Marine Le Pen"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Politics_of_France", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Politics of France"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Snap_election", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Snap election"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_election", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "General election"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Centrism", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Centrism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Right-wing_politics", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Right-wing politics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Politician", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Politician"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/One-party_state", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "One-party state"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Majority_government", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Majority government"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cohabitation_(government)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Cohabitation (government)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hung_parliament", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Hung parliament"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Opposition_to_immigration", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Opposition to immigration"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Majority", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Majority"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foreign_policy", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Foreign policy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economic_policy", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Economic policy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prime_minister", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Prime minister"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eurozone", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Eurozone"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Italy", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Italy"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Italy"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Giorgia_Meloni", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Giorgia Meloni"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Campaigns_and_Elections", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Campaigns and Elections", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Parties", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Parties", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Parties/Planning", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Parties/Planning", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Democracy", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Democracy", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 90}], "image": "https://media.nbcnewyork.com/2024/06/107432694-1719302936973-gettyimages-2158513064-widak-2024fren240624_npmci.jpeg?quality=85&strip=all&resize=1200%2C675", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9692876", "eventUri": "eng-9692876", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-07-07", "textStart": 831, "textEnd": 837}], "sentiment": -0.1294117647058823, "wgt": 154, "relevance": 1}

What's at stake?", "body": "French far-right Rassemblement National (RN) leader and Member of Parliament Marine Le Pen is escorted by France's President Emmanuel Macron after talks at the presidential Elysee Palace, France. File Image/Reuters\n\nToday (June 30) is one of France's most consequential political moments in recent history, as it votes in legislative elections, which will unfold in two rounds on June 30 and July 7.\n\nThe outcome of these elections holds profound implications not only for the nation itself but also for its role within the broader European context. At stake is the potential ascendance of the far-right National Rally (RN) to a parliamentary majority, a scenario that could significantly reshape domestic policies and international relations under the leadership of Marine Le Pen's party.\n\nHow did it come to this?\n\nThe decision to call for early elections by French President Emmanuel Macron came swiftly on the heels of a devastating defeat for his centrist Renaissance party in the European Parliament elections.\n\nThis surprise move, unprecedented in recent French political history, was motivated by Macron's desire to regain control amid a political landscape increasingly dominated by polarization and populist sentiments.\n\nIn Macron's own words, the call for elections was a response to the need for a new coalition that could better reflect the diverse political spectrum of France, while countering what he termed the \"extremist fever\" pervading the country.\n\nHis party's inability to secure a parliamentary majority has necessitated frequent resort to presidential decrees to pass legislation, a practice that has strained relations with opposition parties and stirred public discontent.\n\nWhat is the electoral process in France?\n\nThe French parliamentary elections operate under a two-round system, where candidates vie for 577 seats in the National Assembly.\n\nTo secure victory in the first round, a candidate must obtain more than 50 per cent of the vote and the support of at least 25 per cent of registered voters.\n\nAlso Read: Who is Jordan Bardella, 28-yr-old Marine Le Pen prot\u00e9g\u00e9 who could be France's next PM?\n\nFailing this, the top two candidates proceed to a runoff, joined by any who garnered at least 12.5 per cent of registered voters, ensuring a competitive second round.\n\nHistorically designed to curb extreme political influences, this system now faces a pivotal test with the rising mainstream acceptance of the RN, which currently holds 88 seats in parliament but seeks to expand its influence significantly.\n\nWho are the key players in the French elections?\n\nThe contenders in this electoral showdown represent a spectrum of ideologies and strategic alignments. Macron's Renaissance, the largest party in the current assembly with over 170 MPs, champions a centrist, pro-European stance but has faltered in public approval amidst contentious reforms. Polling at 19 per cent, its electoral prospects are uncertain amid shifting alliances and voter sentiment.\n\nIn contrast, the RN, led by Marine Le Pen and her protege Jordan Bardella, has emerged as the leading opposition force with a polling percentage of 33 per cent. Despite efforts to moderate its image, RN remains rooted in populist, nationalist rhetoric and advocates policies such as a \"national preference\" for French citizens and stringent immigration controls.\n\nThe left-wing coalition, Nouveau Front Populaire (NFP), comprising Jean-Luc M\u00e9lenchon's France Unbowed, Socialists, Communists, and Greens, presents a formidable alternative with a potential to garner up to 30 per cent of the vote. Their platform promises to roll back Macron's reforms on pensions and immigration, highlighting a stark choice between the far-right RN and their progressive agenda.\n\nWhat may be the outcome?\n\nForecasts for the election outcomes remain speculative given the volatile political climate. Analysts predict that while RN may not secure an absolute majority, it could significantly bolster its parliamentary representation, potentially tripling its current seat count.\n\nThis scenario would thrust Macron into a precarious position of negotiating legislative compromises with opposition parties, possibly leading to a gridlocked government and political instability.\n\nAlso Read: Macron Warns of a Civil War in France\n\nMoreover, the prospect of \"cohabitation,\" where a president and prime minister hail from opposing parties, looms large, a situation not witnessed since Jacques Chirac and Lionel Jospin's tenure in the late 1990s.\n\nMacron's ability to appoint a prime minister agreeable to a potentially adversarial parliament could determine the efficacy of governance in the coming years.\n\nHow will France's role be affected in the EU?\n\nBeyond domestic ramifications, a shift towards a more polarised parliament could impact France's role within the European Union and its global alliances. Issues such as economic policies, defence commitments, and international diplomacy would be subject to heightened scrutiny and negotiation, potentially influencing France's stance on critical international matters.\n\nWhether France leans towards a far-right majority, a leftist resurgence, or a fractured coalition, the results will undoubtedly reverberate across Europe, influencing policies and alliances in an increasingly divided geopolitical environment. The eyes of Europe are keenly fixed on the forthcoming electoral verdict, anticipating its implications for the future of French democracy and its broader continental impact.", "source": {"uri":

When they don't, the government can grind to a halt - a prospect that could haunt Paris as it prepares to host the summer Olympics next month.\n\nFrance most recently had such a government - known as \"cohabitation\" - when right-wing President Jaques Chirac called snap polls and was forced to appoint a socialist, Lionel Jospin, as prime minister, who stayed in the post for five years.\n\nThe first round of votes eliminates weaker candidates ahead of the second round next Sunday. If a candidate wins an absolute majority of votes in the first ballot on a 25% turnout, they win the seat. Typically, only a handful of deputies will be elected this way - but most will go to a second round.\n\nOnly those who win more than 12.5% of ballots cast by registered voters are allowed to stand in the second round. Often this is fought between two candidates, but sometimes three or four. Some candidates choose to drop out at this stage to give their allies a better chance of victory.\n\nMost voters will choose one of three blocs: the RN-led far-right alliance; the New Popular Front (NFP), a recently-formed left-wing coalition; and Macron's centrist Ensemble.\n\nThe RN bloc is headed by Jordan Bardella, the 28-year-old party leader handpicked by Le Pen, who has striven to polish the image of a party historically ridden with racism and antisemitism that proliferated under the decades-long leadership of her father, Jean-Marie Le Pen.\n\nUntil recently, the prospect of a far-right government was unthinkable. In the past, opposition parties have made marriages of convenience in an attempt to block the RN - under its previous name, the National Front - from entering government. Now, within a couple of weeks, Bardella could become France's prime minister - and Europe's youngest in more than two centuries.\n\nOn the left, a previously fractious cluster of parties have recently banded together to form the New Popular Front - a coalition meant to resurrect the original Popular Front that prevented fascists from gaining power in 1936. The broad alliance comprises more radical figures like Jean-Luc Melenchon, three-time presidential candidate and leader of the France Unbowed party, as well as moderate leaders like Place Publique's Raphael Glucksmann.\n\nMeanwhile, outgoing French prime minister Gabriel Attal - who was only appointed to his post by Macron in January - is representing Macron's centrist Ensemble alliance. Attal was reportedly among the last of Macron's inner circle to learn that a snap election was imminent.\n\nPolls will close at 8 p.m. local time (2 p.m. ET) Sunday, with the full results expected early Monday.\n\nThe-CNN-Wire\n\n\u2122 & \u00a9 2024 Cable News Network, Inc., a Warner Bros.

President Emmanuel Macron reacted immediately by calling a national vote and stunning his country.\n\nA high turnout is expected among 49 million voters for such a pivotal election and polls close in the big cities at 20:00 (18:00GMT), when the first exit polls come out.\n\nThis is a two-round election, and most of the National Assembly's 577 seats will not be decided until the second-round run-off vote next Sunday.\n\nThe campaign only lasted 20 days, and that also benefited RN, which quickly refined its existing promises on immigration, crime and insecurity as well as tax cuts to tackle the cost-of-living crisis.\n\nJordan Bardella wants to be RN's first prime minister, and his party is confident of winning dozens of constituencies outright in the first round.\n\nBut he says he will only take the job if the party secures an absolute parliamentary majority of 289 seats. The alternative would be a hung parliament and stalemate.\n\nAs soon as the first results come in on Sunday evening, National Rally's opponents will have to decide who to back in run-off battles across France, in a bid to ensure that absolute majority does not happen.\n\nIf the polls are right, many of the run-offs will pit the National Rally against a hastily cobbled together left-wing alliance called New Popular Front, which believes it could even win the election.\n\nBut because of the expected high turnout, three parties could qualify for the second-round battles in as many as 250 constituencies, according to Brice Teinturier of Ipsos polling institute.\n\nIn previous elections, parties from across the spectrum have united to keep the far right out. That raises the question of whether one of the candidates will drop out in those triangular races to unify the anti-RN vote.\n\nRN's leaders have worked hard for years to shed their extremist image. Alongside policies for giving French citizens \"national preference\" for jobs and housing, they want to cut VAT on energy and allow under-30s to escape income tax.\n\nIn Franconville, north of Paris, a teacher called Agn\u00e8s complains about the breakdown of discipline in French schools and likes Jordan Bardella's plans for \"a big bang in authority\" in education. \"I'll either vote right or far right. I like Bardella's charisma,\" she says.\n\nShe also has no problem with RN's plans to abolish droit du sol, the right to automatic French citizenship for children born to foreign parents if those children have spent five years in France - from the age of 11 to 18 when they are entitled to a apply for French citizenship.\n\nPresident Macron's Ensemble alliance is widely expected to haemorrhage seats, and Gabriel Attal's days as prime minister appear numbered, even though polls suggest he remains the most popular politician in France.\n\n\"The Macron era is over,\" Fran\u00e7ois Hollande declared ahead of the vote.\n\nMr Hollande, the former French president who was Mr Macron's boss and mentor, is standing for parliament again - now as a New Popular Front candidate.\n\nHowever, even Macron allies are angry with his snap election gamble.\n\nFrance was not due another election for three more years, and it had far better ways of spending the summer than going through an abbreviated and intense election campaign.\n\nAll of France has been gearing up for the Paris Olympics which start on 26 July.\n\nMetro stations like Concorde have been shut, and restrictions are in place close to any of the Games sites.\n\nThe police and military were already stretched and the interior minister has warned of potential violence after the second round.\n\nMr Macron is set to meet his prime minister and other members of the government on Monday to decide their next move.\n\nUntil now their mantra has been \"ni-ni\" - neither back RN nor the left-wing New Popular Front in the second round, because of the involvement of France Unbowed (LFI), which is condemned by opponents as far-left and some of its members have been accused of antisemitism.\n\nPresident Macron has said only his Ensemble alliance has the power to block both \"the extreme right and the extreme left\". He says the far right categorises people by their religion or origin, while the left judges them by the community they belong to.\n\nLast week, on a hot evening in Meaux, east of Paris, one of LFI's most senior figures, Mathilde Panot, told supporters they were \"the only focus of resistance\" remaining to the rise of the far right, accusing the Macron alliance of opening the gates of power to RN.\n\n\"We're not extreme, what is extreme is Mr Macron's extreme liberalism which has brought about the rise of the extreme right,\" she told the BBC.\n\nThe New Popular Front also includes more moderate parties, including the Socialists and the Greens, whose leader Marine Tondelier has called for a unified stance to stop Mr Bardella becoming prime minister.\n\nSome of France's best-known young stars have urged voters to steer clear of the extremes, from NBA sensation Victor Wembanyama and football captain Kylian Mbapp\u00e9 to YouTube influencer Squeezie.\n\nBut the divisions between the parties are deep and the time extremely short for any concerted action to keep RN at bay.\n\n\"I worry for our country,\" said Aur\u00e9lie, outside a market in Le Plessis Bouchard, to the north of Paris. She is unimpressed by the nationalist policies RN has. \"Patriotism isn't nationalism, it's not the same.\"", "source": {"uri": "namibian.com.na", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Namibian"},

But even figures close to the president acknowledge that many of his own voters are uneasy over the resulting political turmoil and feel Macron himself has created chaos.\n\nThe exact results of the two-round election, with a high turnout expected in the first round on Sunday, are complex to predict. But the RN is riding on a wave of support. Polls show the party taking the greatest share of seats, followed by the left alliance, ahead of Macron's centrists.\n\nPolitical analysts say France is entering uncharted waters. If Le Pen's party manages to go from its current 88 seats to an absolute majority of 289, it would form a far-right government and Macron would have to share power. Equally, the RN could win the largest number of seats but fall short of an absolute majority. Macron could then find himself with a hung parliament unable to produce a stable majority to govern the European Union's second economy and its top military power.\n\nChristelle Craplet, director of opinion at BVA pollsters, said that \"the dynamique for the RN is strong\". She described a polarised mood in France. \"Many of Macron's core electorate are wondering why he dissolved parliament and called this election,\" she said.\n\n\"There is incomprehension and anxiety, particularly among older voters who make up the core of Macron's electorate. But equally, RN voters feel a sense of hope and satisfaction at this election. RN voters want change. Polling shows it's not just passing anger or disgust at politics, they adhere to the party's positions, saying they want to see things change in France, that they're let down by political parties and feel why not try the RN.\"\n\nShe said: \"On the left, voters are also expressing a great deal of worry, because the left in France has historically constructed itself in opposition to the RN.\"\n\nMacron's lack of popularity is at the centre of the election race. Centrist candidates for his Renaissance party have deliberately published posters without his name or face. \"People detest you,\" the former Renaissance MP Patrick Vignal was reported by Le Monde to have told Macron, summing up the mood on the ground. Most centrists wanted Macron to keep a low-profile during the campaign, to avoid the sense of a referendum against the president, but he has continued to give interviews and make public comments almost daily.\n\nMacron was first elected in 2017 on a vow to defend progressive ideals and revolutionise the workings of French politics. Many voters he won from the centre-left have felt increasingly alienated during his second term, after he forced through of a rise in the pension age, as well as a hardline immigration law. Macron's promise, in a recent letter to the French people, to govern differently, has not been taken seriously by voters.\n\nBristielle said that a feeling of rejection of Macron had been building over time and this was seen in his one-time voters from the centre-left. \"That feeling is very linked to his personality and his way of doing politics, particularly [in] his second term. It is about pension changes, immigration law, but also what is seen to be a lack of willing on environmental issues and even on feminism, such as his support for G\u00e9rard Depardieu.\" Macron faced anger from feminists and the left last year when he described the actor D\u00e9pardieu - who is under formal investigation for rape and was at the time facing fresh scrutiny for sexist comments - as the target of a \"manhunt\".\n\nThe political scientist J\u00e9r\u00f4me Jaffr\u00e9 told Le Figaro last week there was a \"visceral hostility\" towards Macron among working-class voters. The president had hoped that the lightning three-week campaign would help him recover the support he lost in the European elections; instead, polls suggest it has fallen further.\n\nWhether the left alliance can now make solid gains in parliament will depend on the results of the runoffs on 7 July.", "source": {"uri": "theguardian.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Guardian"}, "authors":

But he will have to pick a prime minister from the party or alliance with the most seats in the National Assembly, regardless of how divergent their policies are from his own.\n\nHere are some of the key party figure heads in the campaign:\n\nJordan Bardella, far-right National Rally party\n\nThe sharp-suited Bardella, 28, has Italian roots. He was raised by his mother in social housing in the hardscrabble northern outskirts of Paris but attended a semi-private Catholic school.\n\nHis working class background has become a selling point. \"I'm in politics for everything I lived through back there,\" he told newspaper Le Monde.\n\nBardella joined Marine Le Pen's far-right party aged 16. Seven years later, Le Pen picked him to lead her party's charge in the 2019 European elections. Members elected him party president in November 2022.\n\nThe battle-hardened Le Pen and youthful, sharp-witted Bardella have formed a formidable political tag team.\n\nBardella has used his TikTok account, which has 1.7 million followers, to attract younger, social media-savvy voters.\n\nThe pair have broadened the party's appeal beyond its historic redoubts of the Mediterranean coast and the northern rust belt, pitching it as a defender of family incomes, jobs and French identity.\n\nBardella casts himself as a potential \"prime minister for purchasing power,\" pledging to cut VAT on power and fuel and scrap income tax for the under-30s. His opponents say he lacks professional experience, having gone into politics at a young age, and that his economic plans are unrealistic.\n\nGabriel Attal, centrist 'Together' alliance\n\nAt 35, Gabriel Attal became France's youngest post-war prime minister when Macron appointed him in January.\n\nSometimes dubbed \"baby Macron,\" Attal faces the daunting task of saving his boss's presidency and political movement.\n\nDisaffected voters nationwide are shifting support to the far-right and a new left-wing alliance in anger at Macron's policies and personality, with the president often perceived as arrogant and disconnected from daily hardships.\n\nAttal's political rise has been meteoric under Macron. Having joined the Socialist Party aged 17, he became a household name in French politics after being named government spokesman during the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nAttal went on to serve as budget minister and spent a few months at the helm of the education ministry before Macron made him head of government in an attempt to fend off the far-right.\n\nAttal's first move as education minister in 2023 was to ban the Muslim abaya in state schools, earning himself a popularity boost among conservative voters despite hailing from the left.\n\nLeft-wing figures\n\nThere is no single obvious contender to be prime minister on the left, where a wide range of parties have formed a New Popular Front (NFP) in an attempt to join forces against the RN.\n\nThe NFP has not said who would be its pick for prime minister.\n\nThe following are some of its best-known figures:\n\nJean-luc Melenchon, hard-left France Unbowed party\n\nMelenchon, 72, has been a fixture in French left-wing politics for decades and held ministerial posts in past governments, when he was a member of the Socialist Party.\n\nHe ran for president in 2012, 2017 and 2022, improving his score each time. He came third in 2022, just behind far-right leader Marine Le Pen. Macron won that election.\n\nA fiery orator, Melenchon is one of the most divisive figures in French politics, enthusing and horrifying voters with his unbridled tax-and-spend proposals, class war rhetoric and controversial foreign policy positions, especially on Gaza. Critics accuse him of antisemitism, which he denies.\n\nRaphael Glucksmann, Socialist party\n\nGlucksmann, 44, headed the Socialist list of candidates in the European elections this month. It obtained nearly 14 percent of the vote, just behind Macron's Together group. This was considered a sign of revival for a party that governed France in past decades but had recently fallen into electoral oblivion.\n\nThe son of a philosopher, Glucksmann attended prestigious schools and had a career in journalism and broadcasting before branching out in a variety of directions, including being an adviser to then Georgian president Mikheil Saakashvili.\n\nHe advocates strong European support for Ukraine in its resistance against Russia's invasion.\n\nLaurent Berger, former CFDT trade union leader\n\nBerger, 55, is a former head of one of France's main trade unions, the moderate CFDT. He has a track record of strong opposition to the far-right RN.\n\nBerger has said he does not want to be prime minister, but others on the left have put his name forward, saying he could be a unifying figure and a popular alternative to Melenchon.\n\nRead more:\n\nFrance's high-stakes elections begin with far-right leading pre-election polls\n\nMacron dissolves parliament, calls for snap

far-right party of Marine Le Pen take power in a historic first.\n\n\"These are not easy elections, the results are very uncertain, and the repercussions could be serious for society\", said Julien Martin, a 38-year-old architect in the southwestern city of Bordeaux.\n\nVoters lined up to cast their ballots in France's Pacific territory of New Caledonia, where tensions remain high following last month's deadly riots.\n\nBy midday local time, turnout in the archipelago, which is located between Australia and Fiji, stood at 32.4 percent, compared to 13.06 percent recorded during the 2022 legislative polls.\n\nFormer president Nicolas Sarkozy, Greens party leader Marine Tondelier and former prime minister and Macron ally Edouard Philippe were among the first high-profile politicians to vote.\n\nMost polls show the RN on course to win the largest number of seats in the National Assembly, parliament's lower house, although it remains unclear if the party will secure an outright majority.\n\nFinal opinion polls have given the RN between 35 percent and 37 percent of the vote, against 27.5-29 percent for the left-wing New Popular Front alliance and 20-21 percent for Macron's centrist camp.\n\nIf the RN obtains an absolute majority, party chief Jordan Bardella, Le Pen's 28-year-old protege with no governing experience, could become prime minister in a tense

The RN leads strongly with 36 percent of the vote, followed by the left-wing Nouveau Front Populaire (NFP) bloc with 28.5 percent, followed by Macron's centrist Alliance Ensemble with 21 percent.\n\nIf the results echo the polls, Macron may have to live with an antagonistic prime minister, no matter who is elected.\n\nVoting opens at 06:00 GMT and is expected to end at 16:00 GMT in most of the country, but polling stations in Paris and other major cities will remain open until 18:00 GMT.\n\nTo win a majority in the National Assembly, a party or alliance needs 289 seats, just over halfway in the House of Representatives. Macron's outgoing coalition fell short of that number, limiting his ability to push his legislative agenda.\n\nFor the decision on any of the 577 countries to be announced on Sunday, July 30, two conditions must be met. First, voting participation must be at least 25 percent. Second, a candidate must win an absolute majority of the votes cast.\n\nIn a multi-party system like France's, this usually means that many, if not most, races go to a second round of voting, this time scheduled for July 7.\n\nOnly those candidates who secure at least 12.5 percent of the vote in the first round can advance to the second round, effectively narrowing the field of contestants.\n\nTraditionally, National Assembly elections are held immediately after the presidential vote, and thus reflect the same popular mood. The result is a prime minister from the same political party as the president, who can then implement policies with a strong mandate.\n\nBut those power dynamics have now shifted, and for the first time in 22 years, France will have a state of coexistence: a deeply unpopular president governing alongside a government elected as a vote of discontent against Macron himself.\n\nIt will mark the beginning of a new way of governing and the end of the presidential agenda, said Emmanuel Dupuy, president of the Institute for European Perspectives and Security Studies, a think tank on diplomacy and political analysis. Macronism has already almost collapsed and will emerge from the election completely wiped out, he said.\n\nMacron first came to power in 2017 riding a wave of support as he vowed to create a centrist bloc, bringing the left and moderate right together. But it wasn't long before his language began to sound too restrained to the ears of people in the suburbs, he took on the nickname Jupiter. His economic reforms were too right-wing to the liberals who had previously supported him; and his style of government was seen as too despotic by many voters on the right and the left.\n\nNow, the election could mark the end of Jupiters solo show, as France looks set to enter a new political era.\n\nHe runs the country like a CEO of a company, said Samantha de Bendern, fellow at Chatham House. But a country is not a company and he failed to build alliances with partners Macron is a loner, de Bendern said.\n\nOne of the starkest signals of his isolation was the Yellow Vest movement, a period of violent protests in 2018. What began as lower-middle-income workers outraged by planned increases in oil taxes turned into in a broader movement against presidents, there was perceived bias in favor of the elite. His second term was marked by a hotly contested bill in 2023 to raise the country's pension by two years, which turned into another major domestic challenge as he faced widespread opposition.\n\nAnd while he won a second term in 2022 in good measure by scaring, rather than attracting, voters about the possibility of a far-right takeover of the presidency, the tactic seems to have tired many. There is a sense of anger that people are fed up with showing this fear for Le Pen while being forced to vote for Macron to keep the far right at bay, de Bendern said.\n\nMeanwhile, Le Pen has meticulously crafted a so-called de-demonization de-diabolization strategy over the past two decades, aimed at broadening the party's base while toning down her radical discourse to distance herself from many of the references that had made her RN very toxic for some voters.\n\nThe party has long been associated with notorious racist, xenophobic and anti-Semitic slurs. Her father, Jean-Marie Le Pen, once convicted of hate speech after he said Nazi gas chambers were a detail of history, was expelled from the party in 2015. Le Pen convinced the moderate right that she was not a threat to democracy and conquered areas traditionally close to the extreme left, especially in the Communist Party, promising social welfare policies and strict restrictions on migrants.\n\nmany [by voting NR] are expressing their opposition to a system that they feel is depriving them of what they deserve in favor of people, mostly foreigners, who are receiving benefits that are not due, said Baptiste Roger-Lacan, historian and political analyst with a focus on right-wing parties in Europe.\n\nToday, the party's candidate for prime minister is Jordan Bardella, an impeccably dressed 28-year-old who looks like a cross between The Wolf of Wall Street and Superman's alter ego, Clark Kent. However, he comes from the suburbs and talks to his tens of thousands of followers not only on the street, but also on TikTok. He has no experience in government.\n\nOn the other hand, the center-left parties have united under the New Popular Front. Its most vocal cause has been its support for the Palestinian cause amid the war in Gaza, a position that has gained the group popularity among young voters and the Muslim community.\n\nIn contrast, NR has strongly supported Israel by condemning pogroms on Israeli soil and attacking the leader of the leftist La France Insoumise party, Jean-Luc Melenchon, for failing to call the October 7 Hamas attack on Israel terrorism, something that caused friction. within the block itself.\n\nThe most serious consequence of a victory for the RN will be on the home front. While the party now says anti-Semitism is a left-wing problem, it has shifted its focus against immigrants and Muslims. France is home to the largest Muslim community in Europe, with families based there for several generations.\n\nWhile Bardella did not specify what specific legislation he would push to combat Islamic ideologies, he said that in the past the party would work to ban the wearing of the Islamic headscarf in public spaces and make it easier to close mosques.\n\nThe RN has also made its top priority the adoption of strict border controls, the abolition of birthright citizenship, a practice that has for centuries granted citizenship to those born in France of foreign parents, and the introduction via constitutional referendum of national preference , a system. by which one would be excluded from benefiting from social security rights unless one had a French passport.\n\nIt is clear that NR is still xenophobic, so every foreigner has something to lose, every foreigner who does not have a European heritage will have something to lose if NR is elected, said Roger-Lacan.\n\nWith his eyes on power, Bardella has softened or overturned some of the party's traditional positions. He took a U-turn against Ukraine, saying he was committed to continuing to provide military support to Kiev, while rejecting accusations by critics that some party members have ties to the Kremlin.\n\nHowever, given Macron's steadfast stance on Ukraine and France's role as a pillar of the European Union, a government led by Bardella that is less committed to the European project would mark a difference.\n\nDuring a press conference on Monday, Bardella said he opposes sending French troops and weaponry capable of striking targets on Russian soil.\n\nHe is at a stage where he is trying to appease the non-NR electorate, and possibly future EU partners, but it is clear that the party winning power would add a lot of tension between France and the rest of the EU, he said. Roger-Lacan, who is also former deputy editor-in-chief at the Le Grand Continent think tank.\n\nUnlike Italian Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni, who had moved towards more Atlantic, pro-NATO, pro-EU positions years before her election victory in 2022, explains Roger-Lacan, the conversion of NRs sounds extremely contextual.\n\nHowever, if the far right wins the election, observers note, it may end up refraining from creating much of a stir if it wins the election, as the group is playing the long game. His ultimate goal: capture the presidency in 2027.", "source": {"uri": "exbulletin.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "ExBulletin"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

The French President, who returned Friday afternoon from the EU Summit in Brussels on the presidential Falcon 8X he uses for short trips, will certainly be contemplating how diminished his international power and influence will be at the next meeting with his counterparts.\n\nAttempting to mitigate the initial shock, he gambled on early parliamentary elections. He hoped to reverse the situation created by the results of the European elections, which had a resounding impact across Europe and even reached Washington and Beijing. However, the short span of just 20 days that followed did not work in favor of the political risk he took.\n\nMany quickly spoke of a masterstroke, which his team had been considering for some time as plan B in anticipation of a broad defeat in the European elections, believing it would turn the game in his favor. Judging by the poll results, this strategy, if it existed, has collapsed.\n\nThe slogan \"no to extremes\" and the president's warnings of impending civil war seem to have fallen flat. Some jokes even circulated when Fran\u00e7ois Hollande, Macron's predecessor, appeared as a candidate, a man Macron had served as Minister of Economy before deciding to go his own way and run for the \u00c9lys\u00e9e Palace, forcing Hollande into early retirement. Many here speak of the twists of history and the cold dish of revenge. Conversely, the extremes gained ground in the polls, while the centrist space, though united, found itself a suffocating minority squeezed between the far-right and the leftist front.\n\nD\u00e9gage: Get Out\n\nMacron has been making tactical errors, continuing to ignore the transformation of Marine Le Pen and her party, as well as the strong dynamic and tradition of the French Left. More crucially, his own star seems to be waning. The narrative of the visionary reformer that elevated him to the presidency in 2017 was tested and severely wounded by the prolonged and bloody clashes with the \"yellow vests,\" the farmers' tractors, the fearful and insecure French citizens due to the immigration surge and terrorist threats, with the final straw being his announcements about French military involvement in Ukraine. According to \"The Economist,\" the French are driven by a rebellious spirit, a d\u00e9gagiste spirit (d\u00e9gage in French means get out), the outcome of which no one can predict.\n\nThus, despite genuine concerns about the uncharted waters France may enter from July 7 onward - which many French people perceive more as scaremongering than a real threat - Macron risks becoming the second exception, after Jacques Chirac in 1997, to the tradition of French presidents who consolidate their dominance when they dissolve the National Assembly.\n\nThe questions are harsh and anxiety-inducing. The next NATO Summit is just 10 days away, right after the second round of the French elections. This is followed by the 235th anniversary of the French Revolution with a grand parade on the Champs-\u00c9lys\u00e9es, and shortly after, the opening of the Olympic Games. With which prime minister beside or behind him will Macron find himself?\n\nUnknown Factor: Abstention\n\nThe world's attention has been focused on France for weeks. Speculations about the next day's political landscape in the country are rampant. What pollsters couldn't accurately answer until the last moment is whether the victory momentum of the National Rally will turn into a triumph tonight and a majority in the Assembly ahead of next Sunday's second round. Le Pen's party's victory is undisputed. But will it be enough?\n\nAn unpredictable factor here is abstention. Analysts suggest that the French may choose to send a message of dissatisfaction by abstaining up to 50% in the European elections but revert to their \"factory settings\" when thinking and voting nationally, preventing the right from rising to power. But is this true? Or has the National Rally's momentum become unstoppable with the political techniques of the second round?\n\nA wave of change or a wall of deterrence? What will prevail tonight, and more importantly, next Sunday? The French, as Macron and the Left hope, are still frightened by the idea of the former National Front (Front National - FN), now the National Rally (Rassemblement National - RN), rising to power.\n\nHowever, in all previous elections, they have steadily strengthened Le Pen and her associates. From 13.2% in the 2017 parliamentary elections to 18.7% in 2022, with recent polls projecting them to 34%-35.5%. In the European elections, they surged from 23.3% in 2019 to 31.4% recently. And in the presidential elections, with Marine Le Pen herself leading, they reached the second round in 2017 and 2022, garnering 34% and 42% respectively. They are now not far from 50%.\n\nMacron-Left Alliance?\n\nPollsters estimate that higher voter turnout means diminished hopes for Le Pen's chosen candidate, Jordan Bardella, to seize the prime ministerial scepter. However, the ballot box will ultimately have the final say. According to \"Le Monde,\" estimates put voter turnout between 60% and 65%, significantly higher than in 2022.\n\nThe situation is quite complex due to the peculiar French electoral system. This system leads to intense clashes between the first and second rounds, where alliances will be necessary. The country is divided into 577 single-member constituencies, and in each of these, a candidate needs 50% of the vote to be elected in the first round. Otherwise, the top two candidates, as well as those who garner more than 12.5% of registered voters in the constituency, advance to the second round.\n\nThus, with a 50% abstention rate, few constituencies are expected to have \"clear-cut\" results, as a third party will likely be involved in the second round. The numbers don't add up. Therefore, a head-to-head between the top two candidates is inevitable. But with reduced abstention, at 40% or 35%, there will be more constituencies where more than two candidates will compete in the second round.\n\nSince the RN will be the leading party, for it not to win the seat with a relative majority, the third party will have to withdraw in favor of the second party after the first round. This is already being widely discussed both within Macron's camp and the leftist alliance. In the direct contests between Le Pen's party and candidates from Macron's camp or the Left in 2022, the scale tipped in favor of the RN. However, the Left was divided then. In any case, a safe prediction is impossible.\n\nBeyond alliances, many believe the leftist front will need to have settled on a prime ministerial candidate for the second Sunday, facing Bardella and Gabriel Attal. This would address a pending issue that, if left to post-election negotiations, discourages voters. Will it be the socialist Rapha\u00ebl Glucksmann, who successfully led the European election list, or someone else? That remains to be seen...\n\nBased on the polls, Le Pen and Bardella's RN, along with their allies, the Republicans of \u00c9ric Ciotti (LR - Ciotti), are expected to approach 260-280 seats in the new National Assembly, up from just 88 in the outgoing one.The New People's Front (NFP) of the Left, with 29% today, is expected to secure around 170-180 seats (up from 151), and Macron's faction (Ensemble) is expected to have approximately 100 seats (down from 249) with about 20% of the vote tonight. Smaller parties are expected to shrink. An absolute majority requires 289 seats out of a total of 577. However, these predictions are highly tentative due to the peculiarities of the electoral system, which has often led to significant forecasting errors in the past.", "source": {"uri":

This election, scheduled three years ahead of the regular term, follows a significant setback for Macron's Renaissance party in the recent European Parliament elections, where the RN emerged victorious. Responding swiftly to this defeat, Macron opted for the snap election, the first in France since 1997, acknowledging the electorate's message, as reported by CNN.\n\nRegardless of the election's outcome, Macron has committed to serving until the next presidential elections in 2027. The National Assembly, responsible for enacting domestic legislation ranging from social policies to economic reforms, plays a crucial role alongside the president, who oversees foreign affairs, European policies, and defence strategies.\n\nAlso Read | Pakistan Bomb Blast: 18 Injured in Explosion at Wedding Ceremony in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Province.\n\nThe prospect of political \"cohabitation,\" where the president and parliament are from different political camps, looms large. Such a scenario, historically challenging for governance, could complicate matters for France as it prepares to host the upcoming summer Olympics.\n\nFrance has experienced cohabitation before, notably during President Jacques Chirac's tenure, when a conservative president worked alongside a socialist prime minister appointed after snap elections. This historical precedent underscores the potential challenges of divided governance.\n\nThe electoral process involves two rounds: the current first round, which narrows down the field, and a subsequent round where candidates compete for the majority needed to secure parliamentary seats. Candidates must secure more than 12.5 per cent of the vote to advance to the second round, where final outcomes are decided, according to CNN.\n\nThe electorate faces a choice among several political blocs: the RN-led far-right coalition, the New Popular Front (NFP) representing the left, and Macron's centrist Ensemble alliance. Each bloc presents distinct visions for France's future, appealing to voters with diverse ideological leanings.\n\nLeading the RN bloc is Jordan Bardella, handpicked by Marine Le Pen to lead the party's efforts to broaden its appeal beyond its historically contentious issues of racism and antisemitism. Bardella's leadership marks a significant shift as the RN seeks mainstream acceptance and potentially positions itself to lead the government.\n\nOn the left, the NFP has emerged as a coalition uniting various factions, from staunch progressives like Jean-Luc Melenchon to more moderate figures such as Raphael Glucksmann. This coalition aims to revive the spirit of the original Popular Front, which historically countered fascist influences in French politics.\n\nRepresenting Macron's centrist Ensemble alliance is outgoing Prime Minister Gabriel Attal, appointed just months before the snap election was announced. Attal, like Macron, faces the challenge of retaining support amid a competitive electoral landscape reshaped by recent political developments.\n\nPolling stations will close at 8 pm local time (2 pm ET) on Sunday, with final results expected early the following day. The election's outcome will not only determine the composition of the National Assembly but also set the tone for Macron's presidency going forward, influencing his ability to implement key policies and navigate France's role in global affairs.\n\nThe anticipation surrounding these elections reflects broader concerns about the direction of French politics and its implications for Europe. As voters cast their ballots, the stakes are high, with potential ramifications extending well beyond domestic policy to shape France's international standing and alliances, CNN reported.

This election was unexpectedly called by President Emmanuel Macron after the far-right National Rally (RN) made significant gains in the recent European parliamentary elections. Polls indicate that the RN is poised for another strong performance, potentially securing a plurality or even a majority of seats in the French Parliament.Thank you for reading this post, don't forget to subscribe!\n\nThe stakes are high. In France, the president relies on a parliamentary majority to enact major domestic policies. Without this majority, Macron's ability to govern effectively will be severely limited. Should the RN secure an outright majority, it could begin implementing its far-right agenda, leaving Macron with few options to counteract their policies.\n\nMarine Le Pen, the long-time leader of the RN, has consistently been Macron's main rival in the past two presidential elections. Her party's rise as the primary alternative to Macron's centrism is unsurprising to many observers. Macron's decision to call this election early is widely seen as a response to his declining popularity and the RN's growing appeal.\n\nHowever, the ascent of the RN is also deeply concerning. Not long ago, the party's extremist views made it widely unpopular in France. When Jean-Marie Le Pen, the party's founder, advanced to the second round of the 2002 presidential election, the nation united against him, resulting in his landslide defeat. Despite Marine Le Pen's efforts to soften the party's image, its core policies remain highly radical, including discriminatory \"national priority\" laws against immigrants.\n\nThe real story of this election is not merely a rejection of Macron but the far-right's transformation into a viable political option. The RN's success can be attributed to its strategic rebranding and Macron's missteps. Macron underestimated the RN, assuming that its extreme views would prevent it from gaining widespread support. His belief that French voters would always prefer his centrist stance over Le Pen's extremism appears to have been a miscalculation.\n\nThe RN's rise can be traced back to Jean-Marie Le Pen's shift from outright fascism to electoral politics centered on anti-immigration rhetoric. Marine Le Pen further distanced the party from its Nazi-sympathizing past by focusing on cultural issues and expelling her father from the party when his comments became too controversial. She rebranded the National Front as the National Rally in 2018, helping to shed its toxic legacy.\n\nDespite these changes, the RN's policies remain extreme. Marine Le Pen has moderated the party's image without significant policy shifts, maintaining its commitment to xenophobic and nationalist agendas. This rebranding, coupled with Macron's unpopularity and the decline of traditional political parties, has positioned the RN as the leading alternative.\n\nMacron's strategy of co-opting far-right rhetoric on immigration has backfired. Rather than winning over far-right supporters, it has normalized their discourse and made the RN appear more mainstream.

The alternative would be a hung parliament and stalemate.\n\nAs soon as the first results come in on Sunday evening, National Rally's opponents will have to decide who to back in run-off battles across France, in a bid to ensure that absolute majority does not happen.\n\nIf the polls are right, many of the run-offs will pit the National Rally against a hastily cobbled together left-wing alliance called New Popular Front, which believes it could even win the election.\n\nIn previous elections, parties from across the spectrum have united to keep the far right out and voters have held their noses to do so.\n\nBut RN's leaders have worked hard for years to shed their extremist image. Alongside policies for giving French citizens \"national preference\" for jobs and housing, they want to cut VAT on energy and allow under-30s to escape income tax.\n\nIn Franconville, north of Paris, a teacher called Agn\u00e8s complains about the breakdown of discipline in French schools and likes Jordan Bardella's plans for \"a big bang in authority\" in education. \"I'll either vote right or far right. I like Bardella's charisma,\" she says.\n\nShe also has no problem with RN's plans to abolish droit du sol, the right to automatic French citizenship for children born to foreign parents if those children have spent five years in France - from the age of 11 to 18 when they are entitled to a apply for French citizenship.\n\nPresident Macron's Ensemble alliance is widely expected to haemorrhage seats, and Gabriel Attal's days as prime minister appear numbered, even though polls suggest he remains the most popular politician in France.\n\n\"The Macron era is over,\" Fran\u00e7ois Hollande declared ahead of the vote.\n\nMr Hollande, the former French president who was Mr Macron's boss and mentor, is standing for parliament again - now as a New Popular Front candidate.\n\nHowever, even Macron allies are angry with his snap election gamble.\n\nFrance was not due another election for three more years, and it had far better ways of spending the summer than going through an abbreviated and intense election campaign.\n\nThe national football team faces Belgium in the last 16 of Euro 2024 on Monday, and all of France has been gearing up for the Paris Olympics which start on 26 July.\n\nMetro stations like Concorde have been shut, and restrictions are in place close to any of the Games sites.\n\nThe police and military were already stretched and the interior minister has warned of potential violence after the second round.\n\nMr Macron is set to meet his prime minister and other members of the government on Monday to decide their next move.\n\nUntil now their mantra has been \"ni-ni\" - neither back RN nor the left-wing New Popular Front, because of the involvement of France Unbowed (LFI), which is condemned by opponents as far-left and some of its members have been accused of antisemitism.\n\nPresident Macron has said only his Ensemble alliance has the power to block both \"the extreme right and the extreme left\". He says the far right categorises people by their religion or origin, while the left judges them by the community they belong to.\n\nLast week, on a hot evening in Meaux, east of Paris, one of LFI's most senior figures, Mathilde Panot told supporters they were \"the only focus of resistance\" remaining to the rise of the far right, accusing the Macron alliance of opening the gates of power to RN.\n\n\"We're not extreme, what is extreme is Mr Macron's extreme liberalism which has brought about the rise of the extreme right,\" she told the BBC.\n\nThe New Popular Front also includes more moderate parties, including the Socialists and the Greens, whose leader Marine Tondelier has called for a unified stance to stop Mr Bardella becoming prime minister.\n\nSome of France's best-known young stars have urged voters to steer clear of the extremes, from NBA sensation Victor Wembanyama and football captain Kylian Mbapp\u00e9 to YouTube influencer Squeezie.\n\nBut the divisions between the parties are deep and the time extremely short for any concerted action to keep RN at bay.\n\n\"I worry for our country,\" said Aur\u00e9lie, outside a market in Le Plessis Bouchard, to the north of Paris. She is unimpressed by the nationalist policies RN has. \"Patriotism isn't nationalism, it's not the same.\"", "source": {"uri": "yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo"}, "authors": [],

President Macron's centrist Together alliance faces a tough challenge. Key figures like Jordan Bardella from RN and Gabriel Attal from Together are central to this high-stakes political battle.\n\nFrance is the closest it has been to having a far-right government since World War Two, with the anti-immigrant National Rally (RN) riding high in opinion polls ahead of the first round of snap parliamentary elections on Sunday.\n\nPresident Emmanuel Macron dissolved parliament and called the election after his centrist Together alliance was trounced by the RN in European elections. Macron will remain president after the parliamentary election, the second round of which is on July 7. But he will have to pick a prime minister from the party or alliance with the most seats in the National Assembly, regardless of how divergent their policies are from his own.\n\nHere are some of the key party figureheads in the campaign: JORDAN BARDELLA, FAR-RIGHT NATIONAL RALLY PARTY\n\nThe sharp-suited Bardella, 28, has Italian roots. He was raised by his mother in social housing in the hardscrabble northern outskirts of Paris but attended a semi-private Catholic school. His working class background has become a selling point. \"I'm in politics for everything I lived through back there,\" he told newspaper Le Monde.\n\nBardella joined Marine Le Pen's far-right party aged 16. Seven years later, Le Pen picked him to lead her party's charge in the 2019 European elections. Members elected him party president in November 2022. The battle-hardened Le Pen and youthful, sharp-witted Bardella have formed a formidable political tag team. Bardella has used his TikTok account, which has 1.7 million followers, to attract younger, social media-savvy voters.\n\nThe pair have broadened the party's appeal beyond its historic redoubts of the Mediterranean coast and the northern rust belt, pitching it as a defender of family incomes, jobs and French identity. Bardella casts himself as a potential \"prime minister for purchasing power\", pledging to cut VAT on power and fuel and scrap income tax for the under-30s. His opponents say he lacks professional experience, having gone into politics at a young age, and that his economic plans are unrealistic.\n\nGABRIEL ATTAL, CENTRIST 'TOGETHER' ALLIANCE At 35, Gabriel Attal became France's youngest post-war prime minister when Macron appointed him in January.\n\nSometimes dubbed \"baby Macron\", Attal faces the daunting task of saving his boss's presidency and political movement. Disaffected voters nationwide are shifting support to the far right and a new left-wing alliance in anger at Macron's policies and personality, with the president often perceived as arrogant and disconnected from daily hardships.\n\nAttal is France's first openly gay prime minister. His political rise has been meteoric under Macron. Having joined the Socialist Party aged 17, he became a household name in French politics after being named government spokesman during the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nAttal went on to serve as budget minister and spent a few months at the helm of the education ministry before Macron made him head of government in an attempt to fend off the far-right. Attal's first move as education minister in 2023 was to ban the Muslim abaya in state schools, earning himself a popularity boost among conservative voters despite hailing from the left.\n\nLEFT-WING FIGURES There is no single obvious contender to be prime minister on the left, where a wide range of parties have formed a New Popular Front (NFP) in an attempt to join forces against the RN.\n\nThe NFP has not said who would be its pick for prime minister. The following are some of its best-known figures: JEAN-LUC MELENCHON, HARD-LEFT FRANCE UNBOWED PARTY\n\nMelenchon, 72, has been a fixture in French left-wing politics for decades and held ministerial posts in past governments, when he was a member of the Socialist Party. He ran for president in 2012, 2017 and 2022, improving his score each time. He came third in 2022, just behind far-right leader Marine Le Pen. Macron won that election.\n\nA fiery orator, Melenchon is one of the most divisive figures in French politics, enthusing and horrifying voters with his unbridled tax-and-spend proposals, class war rhetoric and controversial foreign policy positions, especially on Gaza. Critics accuse him of antisemitism, which he denies. RAPHAEL GLUCKSMANN, SOCIALIST PARTY\n\nGlucksmann, 44, headed the Socialist list of candidates in the European elections this month. It obtained nearly 14% of the vote, just behind Macron's Together group. This was considered a sign of revival for a party that governed France in past decades but had recently fallen into electoral oblivion. The son of a philosopher, Glucksmann attended prestigious schools and had a career in journalism and broadcasting before branching out in a variety of directions, including being an adviser to then Georgian president Mikheil Saakashvili.\n\nHe advocates strong European support for Ukraine in its resistance against Russia's invasion. LAURENT BERGER, FORMER CFDT TRADE UNION LEADER\n\nBerger, 55, is a former head of one of France's main trade unions, the moderate CFDT. He has a track record of strong opposition to the far-right RN. Berger has said he does not want to be prime minister, but others on the left have put his name forward, saying he could be a unifying figure and a popular alternative to Melenchon.\n\n(This story has

After President Emmanuel Macron unexpectedly called a snap parliamentary election, they will cast their first vote for candidates to the 577-seat National Assembly, ahead of a second round on July 7th. Polls suggest that Mr Macron's centrists might collapse, losing half their 250 seats, or worse. Marine Le Pen's hard-right could reach close to a majority, up from 88 seats today. Her party has never been so close to governing France.\n\nThis is an election that captures many of the political dynamics across Europe, as politicians of the liberal centre attempt to fend off the rise of the extremes. In France, the two-round parliamentary system has in the past kept fringe parties a minority electoral force; a cordon sanitaire thwarted governing alliances with them. Neither Ms Le Pen's National Rally (RN), nor its previous incarnation under her father, the far-right National Front, has ever come near to holding power at national level.\n\nToday's vote could change this. The latest polls, published on June 28th, showed Ms Le Pen's hard-right RN in a commanding lead. The Economist's poll tracker gave her a first-round poll average of 37%. It put the four-party left-wing alliance, the New Popular Front (NFP), in second place, on 29%. Mr Macron's centrist alliance trailed in third place, with 21%. If the polls are right, his party faces a calamitous first-round result. Candidates in each constituency need the backing of at least 12.5% of registered voters to make it through to the final vote. Most second-round projections expect a hung parliament, with the possibility of a slim majority for the RN.\n\nThe French choice at this election is stark. Three blocs dominate. The first is Mr Macron's centrist alliance. It has campaigned, broadly, on a programme of policy stability, mixed with the promise of a change to Mr Macron's top-down and solitary governing style. Many of the president's candidates have distanced themselves, not from his policies but from him. On the campaign trail, in street markets and at caf\u00e9s, many candidates sensed early on a strong personal rejection of Mr Macron, and kept his image off their flyers. Their pitch is to stick with pro-European, business-friendly policies, but to listen more to voters and put parliament back at the centre of decision-making.\n\nThe second big bloc is Ms Le Pen's RN, whose candidate for the job of prime minister is her 28-year-old prot\u00e9g\u00e9 Jordan Bardella. It proposes an abrupt break with the status quo. Positioning itself as the party that stands up for ordinary people against the technocrats in Paris and Brussels, the RN has tried to shrug off its past xenophobic and antisemitic image, and instead sound reasonable and look presentable. It retains signature anti-immigration pledges nonetheless, including a promise to end the right to French citizenship for those born to foreign parents on French soil. These are combined with popular promises to lower VAT on energy bills and motor fuel from 20% to 5.5%, bring back the wealth tax, lower the pension age, and pay less into the European Union. The RN also wants to end French support for Ukraine's membership of the EU and stop sending the country long-range cruise missiles that could reach Russian soil. Some members of the centre-right Republicans party, as well as the far-right Reconquest party, are also part of this bloc.\n\nThe left-wing alliance, the NFP, forms the third bloc. It reaches from moderate social-democratic Socialists and Greens to anti-capitalists and former Trotskyists on the hard left. Against expectations, this alliance was stitched together fast, and agreed swiftly on a common electoral programme that tilts strongly to the left. Under the deal, Jean-Luc M\u00e9lenchon's Unsubmissive France secured the highest number of candidates, followed by the Socialists. The NFP promises to bring back the wealth tax, raise the minimum wage by 14%, introduce a tax on \"super profits\", increase inheritance tax and scrap the flat tax on investment income. On foreign policy, it wants immediate recognition of the Palestinian state, and makes no mention of France's relationship to NATO, which parties disagree vehemently on.\n\nThe drift of votes away from the centre carries a painful paradox for the president. When Mr Macron was first elected in 2017, on a wave of pro-European optimism, youthful energy and a sense of political renewal, he vowed on election night that he would \"do everything\" to make sure that there \"was no longer any reason to vote for the extremes\". Yet his forging of a broad centrist movement, which borrowed talent from the moderate left and right, ended up weakening reasonable alternatives to the centre. The Socialists are dominated by Mr M\u00e9lenchon's party within the alliance. The Republicans are split, after their president, Eric Ciotti, jumped over the cordon sanitaire to join up with Ms Le Pen's RN.\n\nFirst-round results on Sunday evening will provide a first guide to how close Ms Le Pen might get to forming a majority. An even better sense will come at the end of July 2nd, when qualifying candidates will have to decide whether to stay in the race, or to stand down under tactical arrangements in order to keep the RN out. Meanwhile, the French go to the polls today in a mood of fatigue, anger, sadness and fear, according to a poll for the Fondation Jean-Jaur\u00e8s, a think-tank. The outcome looks set to plunge the country into a period of deep uncertainty.", "source": {"uri": "economist.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Economist"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

In the last legislative elections, there were 30 candidates of all stripes.\"\n\nFrance faces a stark choice in its upcoming election, with a leading pollster showing the far-right National Rally ahead with 36% of the vote, followed by the leftist New Popular Front coalition at 29%. Macron's coalition trails at third with 19.5%, according to Ipsos. The surge in the right and the collapse of the center is sending shock waves across France, with some analysts warning that the deep disillusionment underpinning these numbers goes beyond France.\n\nMacron called the snap election a day after his party was crushed by the far right during June's European parliamentary elections. His decision was widely seen as an attempt to spook voters away from the political extremes, but a lightning-fast, three-week campaign has failed to turn the tide.\n\n\"The center has imploded,\" said Samantha de Bendern, a geopolitical commentator for the news outlet La Chaine Info. \"Macron miscalculated. He was hoping the moderate left and moderate right would both come to him. Instead, they've both joined the extremes.\n\n\"We are in uncharted territory. We are jumping off the cliff and we don't know if our parachute is working, or even if we have a parachute,\" she said.\n\nNational Rally, also known by its French acronym RN, is led by Marine Le Pen, who has softened her party's image in recent years by abandoning hostility toward the NATO alliance and the idea of a French exit from the European Union. Her party remains committed to its central doctrine of \"France for the French,\" giving citizens priority over nonnationals for jobs, housing and social welfare.\n\nOriginally called the National Front, the party's founding president, Jean-Marie Le Pen, Marine's father, was openly racist and convicted multiple times of making antisemitic comments and dismissing the Holocaust as a \"detail\" of history. Even as Marine Le Pen tried to steer the party away from its most extreme positions, RN has maintained an anti-immigration stance with strong Islamophobic undertones that it has tied to issues of order and security. Some members of RN continue to express racist, antisemitic or homophobic views, and according to a report published Thursday by the French National Consultative Commission on Human Rights, 54 percent of National Rally supporters described themselves as racist.\n\nEmmanuel Delaval, who has lived in Source-Seine for 50 years, says people are \"much more ready\" to say they will vote far right. \"The RN have changed considerably, it's no longer the National Front,\" he says. \"That's not to say I am voting for them.\n\n\"The choice is very, very, very difficult,\" he said.\n\nHis friend, Dmitry Fouks, from the neighboring village of Trouhaut, is less coy about his feelings. \"People don't believe in politics anymore, they don't believe in France, and they certainly don't believe in Europe,\" he says.\n\nJordan Bardella, a clean-cut, media-savvy 28-year-old and loyal Le Pen prot\u00e9g\u00e9 who was elected president of National Rally in 2022, would be poised to become prime minister should the party secure enough seats. Bardella has promised to crack down on migration and, in a speech Monday, said among his priorities was to \"put France back on its feet\" by introducing what he called \"a necessary law against Islamist ideologies.\"\n\nIn 2022, Le Pen called the hijab a \"uniform of totalitarian ideology,\" saying she would like to ban the Muslim headscarf from all public places\n\n\"One of the main drivers of the vote is identity, the feeling that French people don't recognize their own face anymore, don't dress as they used to,\" said Sebastien Maillard, an associate fellow at the U.K. think tank Chatham House, noting that France has among the largest Muslim and Jewish communities in the European Union.\n\n\"Also, there's an element of 'Why don't we give it a try.'\" Maillard said of the tilt toward the far right. \"They're not as scary as they used to be.\"\n\nNational Rally has also proposed measures aimed at benefiting the working class. Bardella, who was raised in a disadvantaged suburb of Paris, touts his working-class roots, resonating with voters struggling with rising prices and perceptions of inequality between cities, which have benefited from Macron's pro-business agenda, and the areas outside them, which have not. Bardella has said he will reverse Macron's pension reform and reinstate a tax on financial wealth abolished by the president, while slashing taxes on energy and fuel.\n\nAntoine Hoareau is a member of the Socialist Party and serves as deputy mayor of Dijon, a city 25 miles from Source-Seine. But he grew up in the village, where his uncle and cousins still live, and where he owns a home.\n\n\"There is a real divide between the cities and the towns outside,\" Hoareau says. \"There is no immigration here, to buy bread you have to go 10 kilometers. There are no doctors. No public transport. These are low income families that live here. It's a social problem.\n\n\"They are watching right wing channels and they really play up immigration and crime and people watch and think there is a big problem even though there is no problem with that here.\"\n\nFollow the Seine from its source northwest to the sprawling city of Paris, and Anne Hidalgo, mayor of the capital and also a member of the Socialist Party, says she fears for her country's future in the face of such extremism, calling Le Pen a huge risk for the country.\n\n\"People in France say we don't have experience with these people, but we had the experience. We had the experience during the Second World War. ... It is a very, very big risk for democracy, for minorities, for women,\" she told NBC News. (During World War II, France's Vichy government collaborated with the Nazis.)\n\nWith National Rally widely expected to fall short of the 279 seats required for a majority, a hung Parliament appears the most likely outcome for France, setting up the possibility of political paralysis and damaging inaction.\n\n\"Either we have no government, a technocratic government, or we haggle for months over who should be prime minister,\" added de Bendern. \"A year and one day after the dissolution of Parliament, Macron can call new parliamentary elections, so we will have a year of chaos.\"\n\n\"We could be going into the Olympics without a prime minister,\" she added.\n\nHow such political instability may affect the Olympics, which begin in Paris less than three weeks after the vote, appears to be another error in Macron's timing.\n\nSecurity concerns are already heightened across Europe amid the wars in Ukraine and the Middle East and a spate of politically motivated attacks. In May, a man in southern France was arrested over a plan to attack a soccer stadium that will be used during the Olympics. Security has already ramped upin the capital, with some metro stations closed.\n\nMacron's Interior Minister G\u00e9rald Darmanin has said that French authorities are working on the assumption that violent protests could take place following both the first and second rounds of elections (June 30 and July 7). \"It's possible that there will be extremely strong tensions,\" Darmanin told RTL radio, adding that authorities were preparing for a \"highly inflammable\" situation.\n\nThat tension is exacerbated by ourside outsiders targeting French voters. A report by Recorded Future's Insikt Group, which examines trends in malware evolution, has said the French elections continue to be targeted by operations linked to Russia and Iran. These operations include cloned impersonations of French media organizations.\n\nAlso included were eurosceptic and populist political positions, dissuading support for Ukraine by amplifying skepticism towards Western alliances, while praising the RN for its willingness to engage in a dialogue with Russia to end the war. Before the invasion, RN maintained close ties with Russia, and Bardella said in a debate last week that RN would continue to support Ukraine, but would not send long-range missiles or French troops.\n\nThe report said that the overall effect of the disinformation campaigns on French public opinion has been \"negligible\" due to minimal online engagement.\n\nWhile the Olympics are ordinarily a unifying celebration of diversity, they may well take place under an overtly xenophobic government, or no government at all.\n\nWith his presidential term running until 2027, Macron is not on the ballot. Still, the parliamentary elections will serve as a referendum on his pro-business, centrist vision of France. A supporter of assertive French foreign policy, he's been a strong backer of Ukraine in its war against the Russian invasion.\n\nHe told the podcast \"Generation Do It Yourself\" on Tuesday that both left- and right-wing parties risked bringing \"civil war\" to France in another bid to scare voters back to the center.\n\nHe has said that he would stay in office until his term ends, regardless of the outcome of the election, but all signs point toward either a tense power-sharing arrangement with a prime minister from an opposing, likely antagonistic party, or a government without a stable majority.\n\n\"Macron is gambling France,\" Maillard said. \"He's saying to the people, 'You may have voted for the far right in the European elections, but this is for real.' But that's a dangerous gamble, because maybe the French will say, 'Yes, we really do want this.'\"", "source": {"uri": "nbcnews.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "NBC News"}, "authors": [],

In the first, voters tend to choose with their hearts not their heads, picking the candidate who best reflects their values.\n\nBut if no candidate secures a 50 per cent majority, which is often the case, the vote goes to a run-off.\n\nTo qualify for the July run-off, candidates need first-round votes amounting to at least 12.5 per cent of registered voters, and the top scorer wins the second round.\n\nAt this point \"le vote utile\", tactical voting, often comes into play. Sometimes a weaker candidate steps aside so it becomes a two-horse race, for example between a mainstream candidate and a far-Right candidate. This can allow voters of various views to band together to block a rival whom they deem beyond the pale.\n\nThe alliance which manages to secure a majority in the lower house of parliament then forms a government to serve under the president.\n\nWhen will the results be announced?\n\nVoting ends at 8pm local time (7pm BST), when pollsters publish nationwide projections based on a partial vote count.\n\nThese are usually reliable, with official results trickling in from 8pm.\n\nVote counting is usually fast and efficient and the winners of all, or nearly all, seats will be known by the end of the evening.\n\nWho is in the running?\n\nAccording to the polls, the frontrunner in this race is the hard-Right National Rally, led by Marine Le Pen in parliament and overall by Jordan Bardella, a youthful, energetic new face in the party.\n\nIn second place is a Left-wing alliance, the Popular Front, formed from centre-Left, hard-Left and Green parties.\n\nTrailing them both in third place is Mr Macron's centrist alliance Ensemble, which has been on the ropes since losing its absolute majority in parliament in 2022.\n\nAnd that is why this election feels like such a gamble for the French leader: the polls suggest he will fail to secure a majority and wind up as a lame duck president.\n\nIf so, he will presumably remain in office, but will have little influence over domestic policy-making and only some control over foreign policy and defence.\n\nIf Mr Macron doesn't secure a majority, which seems likely at this stage, he will have to engage in a French political system called \"cohabitation\".\n\nWhat is cohabitation?\n\nWhen the president's own alliance has no majority, he must appoint a prime minister from the alliance which beat him; this is very rare.\n\nIt has happened only three times in the history of the modern Republic, once when Jacques Chirac, conservative president, appointed Lionel Jospin, the socialist prime minister, in 1997.\n\nWhoever that prime minister might be - the polls suggest the National Rally leader - they will be accountable to parliament, lead the government and introduce bills.\n\nThe president retains some authority over foreign policy, such as holding the nuclear codes, and in theory they can veto the prime minister's laws, though parliament can overrule this with its majority.\n\nIf the National Rally secures an absolute majority, Mr Macron will be left as a lame duck.\n\nWhat if Macron manages to secure a majority?\n\nIn this highly unlikely scenario, the Macron presidency bounces back: he can retake control of his parliament, appoint an Ensemble prime minister and forge ahead with his reforms.\n\nHe will be able to claim a decisive defeat over Ms Le Pen and her ilk and congratulate himself on a gamble that paid off.\n\nBut the polls currently suggest that is not the direction France is heading in.\n\nWhat are the possible outcomes?\n\nThis is an election like no other in France: campaign time is short, the electoral landscape is shaken, and so other scenarios cannot be excluded.\n\nThese include a paralysed National Assembly divided into three groups with no one party dominating it, or an alliance of mainstream parties to keep the hard-Right out of power. An absolute majority requires at least 289 seats.\n\nMs Le Pen's National Rally could run a minority government if it wins the most seats without reaching that threshold, but 28-year-old party leader Mr Bardella has said he wants an absolute majority as without it he will not be able to carry out reforms.\n\nWhy has Emmanuel Macron called an election?\n\nCritics of Mr Macron will argue this was a hubristic move that dooms his leadership and will hasten the rise of the hard-Right in France.\n\nMs Le Pen has for years been working hard to clean up her party's image and style herself as the co-leader of a new party of government. Now that goal is tantalisingly close, thanks in large part to Mr Macron's decision.\n\nHowever, the French president was already under immense pressure from the National Rally due to its soaring popularity over the course of his presidency. In calling the election now, he has an opportunity to take the initiative and fight on his own terms.\n\nAnd at first this tactic did seem effective: it initially threw the French Right into total disarray as they argued over the shape of their anti-Macron alliance.\n\nUnfortunately for the president, it did not catch the French Left off-guard in the same way; they swiftly formed a cogent alliance which is consistently polling in second place, ahead of Mr Macron.", "source": {"uri": "telegraph.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Telegraph"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Rally", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "National Rally"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elections_to_the_European_Parliament", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Elections to the European Parliament"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emmanuel_Macron", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Emmanuel Macron"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parliament", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Parliament"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Two-round_system", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Two-round system"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marine_Le_Pen", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Marine Le Pen"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/France", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "France"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lower_house", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Lower house"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Majority", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Majority"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_election", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "General election"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Assembly_(France)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "National Assembly (France)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prime_minister", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Prime minister"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jordan_Bardella", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Jordan Bardella"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cohabitation_(government)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Cohabitation (government)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lame_duck_(politics)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Lame duck (politics)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Popular_Front_(France)", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Popular Front (France)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foreign_policy", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Foreign policy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Centrism", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Centrism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/British_Summer_Time", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "British Summer Time"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Left-wing_politics", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Left-wing politics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/French_Left", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "French Left"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lionel_Jospin", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Lionel Jospin"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minority_government", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Minority government"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jacques_Chirac", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Jacques Chirac"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/President_of_France", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "President of France"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Veto", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Veto"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Socialism", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Socialism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conservatism", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Conservatism"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Campaigns_and_Elections", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Campaigns and Elections", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Government/Parliaments_and_Legislatures", "label": "dmoz/Society/Government/Parliaments and Legislatures", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Democracy", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Democracy", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Online_Issues_Polls", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Online Issues Polls", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 94}], "image": "https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/world-news/2024/06/29/TELEMMGLPICT000383803267_17196793843830_trans_NvBQzQNjv4BqgsaO8O78rhmZrDxTlQBjdLdu0TL-Cg_AMOUqySXmFgU.jpeg?impolicy=logo-overlay", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9692876", "eventUri": "eng-9692876", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-06-30", "textStart": 1063, "textEnd": 1070}, {"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-07-07", "textStart": 1097, "textEnd": 1103}], "sentiment": 0.02745098039215677, "wgt": 145, "relevance": 1}

The message to the French people appears to be one of rejecting what he saw as a protest vote for Marine Le Pen's populists, defying the voters to give it a repeat performance for something that actually matters, the French Parliament.\n\nMacron has some reason to feel this way, not least because the two-round French electoral system of the Fifth Republic -- today's votes will be resolved with a second ballot next Sunday -- was designed to disadvantage non-mainstream parties. But Le Pen's National Rally (RN) has been content to play the long game, and improves its standing every election.\n\nAs is common in European elections, there is over a dozen parties and groups thought likely to pick up seats, and make up the next national parliament. While the Presidency has executive control, as discussed as length in the French newspapers this week the Parliament holds onto the purse strings and making Le Pen's man, Jordan Bardella, Prime Minister could block President Macron from governing meaningfully.\n\nAs it is, the last major poll before election day suggested RN could be in line to grab a third of the votes. The late-stage polling also shows a real surge of interest in this election from voters themselves, with turnout predicted to be as much as a fifth higher than the last election.\n\nWhatever happens between today's knockout round and next Sunday's decider, be assured violent street protests are likely to follow. A pretty naked bid to scare the public into backing his globalist-managerialism leadership this week saw President Macron threaten \"civil war\" if the common man was foolish enough to vote against him. Unions are threatening to strike if Le Pen's RN win, and the left wing coalition representing a rainbow of interests from pro-Brussels centrists to literal hardline communists have sworn \"resistance\" -- we can probably assume of the black-bloc kind -- to Le Pen.\n\nBeyond such immediate concerns, the question remains what this unexpected snap election means for France. French broadsheet Le Figaro cites Elysee Palace gossip that President Macron's camp is already preparing to call another fresh election if he loses, which by all indication he will. An insider cited said there was no way Macron would leave RN's Bardella as Prime Minister and would seek to see him dismissed as soon as possible.\n\nJust one problem, though. Under the French constitution, elections must have a 12-month gap before being re-run, so the Palace is allegedly looking at winter 2025 to try and again prop up Macron's mandate.

Macron argued that he couldn't ignore the results while also warning that \"the rise of nationalists and demagogues\" was threatening France and Europe.\n\nFundamentally, Macron is forcing voters to make up their minds about whether they prefer his pro-business, pro-Europe, pro-Ukraine vision for France or Le Pen's agenda of dramatically cutting migration, stepping back from European Union rules and undoing some of Macron's pension reforms.\n\nIt could put National Rally into a position where it would have to govern for the first time, creating a tangible track record ahead of the 2027 presidential election, when Macron won't be able to run due to term limits.\n\nSunday's voting will be the first round, with runoffs on 7 July.\n\nHere are the main issues to watch:\n\nAs of Friday -- the last day polling companies were allowed to publish projections ahead of the vote -- National Rally and its allies had a strong lead, on course to get 36.2% of the vote, according to Bloomberg's poll of polls.\n\nA left-wing alliance -- including the Socialists, Communists, Greens and the far-left France Unbowed -- was on track to get 28.3% while Macron's centrist group was projected to get 20.4%.\n\nFirst round vote shares don't tell the full story -- the decisive factor shaping the next government is the distribution of seats in the 577-member National Assembly after the second round.\n\nWhile the two-round ballot makes seat predictions tricky, the National Rally and its allies are projected to become the biggest group in the lower house of parliament with between 238 and 281 members, according to Bloomberg's final poll of polls before the blackout on Friday evening.\n\nWhen the first round results are in on Sunday, polling companies will have much more data to refine those projections. That will be crucial information for parties to set their campaign strategies, and for investors trying to assess what kind of instability is coming.\n\nA significantly greater number of people are expected to cast ballots than in several prior legislative elections, according to surveys. That's important in France's system, because it raises the chances of more than two candidates making it to the second round, creating less predictable three- or even occasional four-way races, known as triangulaires and quadrangulaires.\n\nIn 2022, there were only eight triangulaires. This time, the number could swell to between 160 and 200, according to a poll of 2,005 adults by Odoxa 26-27 June.\n\nThe interior ministry will publish interim figures for turnout at midday and 17:00.\n\nAny group that is able to get an absolute majority of 289 or more seats will control the lower-house of parliament. It can easily pass laws and a government backed by that group would be safe from the threat of no-confidence votes.\n\nIf the group that gets a majority is from a different party than the president, which has happened three times since France's current form of republic came into effect in 1958, it results in type of power-sharing arrangement called cohabitation. The president generally selects the leader of the party that obtained the majority as prime minister. But a combination involving the National Rally would be the first time it's involved a party that's never governed before.\n\nIf a group gets the most seats but is short of an absolute majority, then it could form a minority government -- like Macron's current situation. But that also depends on the president, who has sole authority to appoint a prime minister.\n\nA hung parliament would make it difficult to legislate since the government would need to find extra votes outside of its party for every bill. If the government were to use a constitutional provision that allows it to bypass a vote, it would open itself up to a no-confidence vote and could be overturned if rival parties came together.\n\nNational Rally President Jordan Bardella has said he would refuse the job if his party and its allies don't get an outright majority in the National Assembly.\n\nMacron's decision to call the election triggered turmoil in markets in France, leading to an equity selloff that initially wiped almost $200 billion off the value of stocks.\n\nThe yield on 10-year government notes at one point on Friday rose to the highest since November. That widened the extra yield investors demanded for French debt over similar German government bonds to 86 basis points -- the most since 2012. The benchmark CAC 40 stock index meanwhile fell to its lowest since January.\n\nThe three leading groups in the elections are proposing radically different paths for France.\n\nMacron's party stands for continuity, with more pro-business tax cuts and reforms, along with a commitment to curb spending. Responding to concerns of voters, his group has added pledges to improve the incomes of low earners by tweaking taxation, and measures to help home-buyers.\n\nThe National Rally has promised to cut immigration, toughen France's stance on law and order with more prison places and minimum sentencing, and cut value-added taxes on energy and fuel. Following a sell-off in French assets, the party has delayed some of its more costly measures -- potentially indefinitely depending on a review of public finances.\n\nThe New Popular Front has the most radical economic program. In the short run, it says it would freeze prices of consumer staples, abolish Macron's pension reform and raise the minimum wage 14% and public sector salaries 10%. The extra annual spending, which is forecast to reach \u20ac150 billion in 2027, would be entirely financed by taxing businesses, finance, and the wealthiest.", "source": {"uri": "luxtimes.lu",

Macron, who has a presidential mandate until 2027, has said he won't step down before the end of his term.\n\nYet the prospect of a defeat in parliamentary elections means he may have to share power with a prime minister from a rival political party, possibly far-right National Rally's president Jordan Bardella. Macron announced the surprise vote earlier this month after his centrist alliance suffered a crushing defeat in EU elections.\n\nHe argued his aliance has not held a parliamentary majority since 2022, even while having the most seats. The situation forced him into political maneuvering to pass bills. Voters in the two-round ballot on Sunday and July 7 are to choose who they'll send to the National Assembly, leading to the formation of a new government.\n\nMacron defeated National Rally's leader Marine Le Pen twice in presidential elections, in 2017 and 2022.\n\nMoments after his first victory, then aged 39, he slowly walked to the stage in the courtyard of the Louvre Museum in Paris to the sound of the European anthem \"Ode to Joy.\" There he declared of Le Pen's voters: \"I will do everything... so that they don't have any reason anymore to vote for the extremes.\"\n\nAlso Read: | How France's snap legislative elections are shaping up\n\nMacron's centrist political startup that he promoted then as \"neither right- nor left-wing\" crushed traditional rivals, the Socialist Party and the conservative Republicans.\n\nIn 2022, as he defeated Le Pen again but with a smaller margin, Macron acknowledged French people voted \"not to support my ideas, but rather to block those of the far right\". Now, his centrist alliance's existence is under threat. Polls show top contenders in the parliamentary race are mostly candidates from the far right and the broad leftwing coalition, the New Popular Front.\n\nFormer Prime Minister Edouard Philippe recently said Macron \"has killed the presidential majority\".\n\nEarly Friday, following an EU summit in Brussels, Macron justified his decision to dissolve the National Assembly.\n\n\"It was indispensable to ask (voters) for a clarification. And I don't think we can pursue ambitious policies without involving the people,\" he said.\n\nAsked about a National Rally lawmaker who argued that dual nationals such as a French-Moroccan former minister shouldn't be members of the government, Macron answered: \"It says a lot about what's at stake.\" He recalled France's ideals of \"Liberty, Equality, Fraternity\".\n\nAlso Read: | France elections: What is cohabitation?\n\n\"Overt racism or antisemitism says something about a profound betrayal of what France is, of its values, of what our Republic is. And that's something we have to fight with force, and we have to be outraged at,\" Macron said. \"Because it's not about politics, it's not just about a vote. It's about the very possibility of living together.\" \"I'll never give up\" on fighting the far right \"whatever is happening,\" Macron said.\n\nAsked whether he discussed French elections with Macron, German Chancellor Olaf Scholz said in Brussels \"it would be very strange if I wouldn't speak to my friend Emmanuel Macron about it. That's what we do.\" Scholz, who belongs to the centre-left Social Democrats, added: \"Of course I hope that, for example, parties that are politically closer to me do better than others. ... We shouldn't anticipate the result.\"\n\nMacron argued in a news conference earlier this month that his economic achievements speak for themselves. Unemployment has fallen from over 10 per cent to 7.5 per cent and France has been ranked the most attractive European country for foreign investment in recent years.\n\nYet his time in office has been marred by major turbulence, from the yellow vest protests against perceived social and economic injustice to the COVID-19 pandemic, the war in Ukraine and last year's riots triggered by the deadly police shooting of a teen.\n\nAlso Read: | Macron warns podcast of 'civil war' risk as French elections loom\n\nWhatever the outcome, Macron's move to call snap elections already leaves France weakened on the European stage, according to Lisa Thomas-Darbois, deputy director of France studies at the Paris-based Institut Montaigne think tank. It \"has provoked a certain amount of fear on the part of our European and international partners\", she said. \"We can see that, just in terms of our interest rates on the financial markets, our credibility is somewhat diminished.\"\n\n\"Is it because we're potentially facing a political deadlock for a year? Or is it because we potentially could have the National Rally in power? We can't really say at this stage,\" she said. \"What is certain is that the National Rally's stance is not likely to be reassuring in terms of France's image in the years to come.\"", "source":

Instead, he has emboldened her. The president's hazardous strategy has failed. Now France stands on the brink of its first far-right government since 1945.\"\n\nDuring his first term, the French president made unpopular decisions, earning him the nickname \"president of the rich.\" These included abolishing wealth taxes, introducing a flat tax on capital income, lowering the tax rate for corporations, restricting access to unemployment benefits, raising the minimum retirement age, and cutting housing benefits for the poor.\n\nBut this shift by Macron to the right, the specialist explained, far from harming the far right, has strengthened it, and proof of this was its recent success in the European elections at the beginning of June, in which Marine Le Pen's party obtained 31.4% of the votes, more than double the 14.6% of Macron's party.\n\nFurthermore, Macron's failed strategy has also managed to strengthen the most radical left, as the socialists, communists, greens and France Unbound have formed a New Popular Front, which, according to a recent poll, could obtain 28% of the votes in the next legislative elections, behind the 36% of the National Rally.\n\nFassin concludes, \"Macron's gamble may lead to an unexpected outcome - whether a victory for the left or an ungovernable alliance with the right. Shortly after dissolving parliament, the president joked casually about his decision: 'I'm delighted. I threw my unpinned grenade in their legs. Now we'll see how they're doing.' His cynical gesture could end up hurting him more than his opponents.\"\n\nOne of the critical issues in the election is Macron's unrelenting support for the Kiev regime, especially his efforts to send French and European troops to Ukraine. In February, the French president stated at a press conference after the Paris Conference on Ukraine that the leaders of Western countries discussed the possibility of sending ground troops to Kiev. However, it was not possible to reach a consensus.\n\nThis was then followed by Macron, in an interview with The Economist magazine in March, not ruling out sending troops to Ukraine if he received a request from Kiev and if Russia breaks the front line. Moscow, in turn, warned that all French soldiers in Ukraine, both instructors and mercenaries, would be legitimate targets for the Russian Armed Forces.\n\nMacron's claims earned him criticism from prominent opponents, such as Marine Le Pen, who stated that the president \"is playing the warlord, but it is about the lives of our children that he speaks so carelessly.\"\n\nMore recently, Jordan Bardella, leader of the National Rally party, represented by Marine Le Pen in the Lower House of the French Parliament, declared earlier this month that he is against sending the military to Ukraine.\n\n\"There are red lines that the President of the Republic has crossed, but that I will not cross tomorrow as Prime Minister of a 'government of coexistence.' I, unlike the President, am against sending French troops and soldiers to Ukraine,\" Bardella commented in a speech broadcast on the BFMTV television channel on June 19, adding that most French people also reject Macron's decision.\n\n\"That can have tragic consequences, and I do not want France to be directly involved in a conflict with a nuclear power, which would represent a risk to world peace and the stability of our country,\" he said.\n\nBardella focuses on wanting to fix France's myriads of issues, from a cost-of-living crisis for ordinary French to dealing with mass migration and radical Islam in the country. These are issues that have been hurting the French but neglected by Macron as he attempts, and fails, to forge himself as a 21st-century Napoleon and creates the conditions for the National Rally party to gain power.", "source": {"uri": "weeklyblitz.net", "dataType": "news", "title": "Blitz"}, "authors": [{"uri": "ahmed_adel@weeklyblitz.net", "name": "Ahmed Adel", "type": "author", "isAgency":

National Rally has received an early boost in the French elections with three of its candidates already qualifying for the second round of voting in overseas territories.\n\nFrance flocked to the polls on Sunday for a high-stakes snap election that could see Ms Le Pen's National Rally win control of the parliament.\n\nThree MPs from the hard-Right have already made it to next week's run-off in the French overseas territories of Martinique and Guadeloupe, where voting opens earlier than the mainland.\n\nSome 49 million people were registered to vote in what has become a proxy referendum on President Emmanuel Macron's leadership after seven years in the \u00c9lys\u00e9e Palace.\n\nThe final polls published on Friday before the first found of voting saw support for the National Rally reach a record 36-37 per cent.\n\nThis could pave the way for Jordan Bardella, 28, to become France's youngest prime minister after a second run-off vote next Sunday.\n\nIt would mark the first time the hard-Right have been in power in France for the first time since the Nazi occupation during the second world war.\n\nPolls opened at 8am local time across France and will close around 12 hours later.\n\nIt is immediately followed by the first official prediction published by the interior ministry at 8pm local time, the results of which are usually reliable.\n\nPresident Macron called the snap election three weeks ago after his centrist alliance suffered a humiliating defeat, when the National Rally secured twice as many votes as his own bloc.\n\nElections for the 577 seats in France's National Assembly are contested over two rounds.\n\nSome 4,000 candidates are competing in the first round of voting on Sunday, but they must meet specific thresholds to proceed to the second run-off state, held a week later, on July 7.\n\nMost polls show National Rally winning the most number of seats, but there are questions whether the party will secure an outright majority.\n\nThe Left-wing New Popular Front is polling between 27.5-29 per cent and President Macron's centrist coalition is predicted to win between 20-21 per cent of the vote, according to the final opinion polls.\n\nIf National Rally does obtain an outright majority, it would put Mr Bardella in a tense \"cohabitation\" with Macron, which analysts believe could lead to deadlock and political instability.\n\nBut there is also the prospect of a hung parliament with the same blockages expected.\n\nThe Paris stock exchange suffered its biggest monthly decline in two years in June, dropping by 6.4 per cent, according to figures released on Friday as the final opinion polls were published.", "source": {"uri": "ca.news.yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

Though their terms in office did not overlap, they share many similar personal characteristics, including charisma and the perceived status of \"insurgent\" in the ways they won control of their nations' top political offices.\n\nIn 2017, the dynamic, daring Macron upended the longstanding French political duopoly of the right-of-center Republicans and the left-of-center Socialists to win power. Obama also rocked the political boat in the US, yet even at the start of Macron's first presidential term, some commentators wondered whether there might be another, later parallel to be drawn between the two leaders: the \"end game\" of their respective presidencies.\n\nMore specifically, whether just as the populist, right-wing maverick Donald Trump succeeded Obama as US president in 2017, Macron's popularity might decline to such a degree in the 2020s that his successor would be the far-right, euroskeptic leader of the National Rally, Marine Le Pen, who finished in second place at the 2017 and 2022 elections.\n\nFast forward to 2024, and the possibility of Le Pen becoming the next French president is increasingly plausible. For those who did not see this coming, the European Parliament election results this month suggested it was a growing possibility; her National Rally party won the most votes by far across France, double the amount for its closest rival, Macron's centrist alliance. In so doing, the National Rally came first in more than 90 percent of communes, or local districts.\n\nIt was this debacle that prompted Macron on June 9 to take the biggest gamble of his presidency so far by dissolving the National Assembly, the lower house of the nation's parliament, and calling a snap national election. It will take place in two stages, on June 30 and July 7.\n\nIt is possible that Macron's centrist alliance might defy the polls, which predict it will come third behind a victorious National Rally, which is seeking to co-opt the votes of moderate, right-of-center Republicans. Second place would likely go to the united left, comprising the radical, leftist Unbowed France, the Greens and the Communists.\n\nHowever, the key question, according to most polls, is not whether National Rally, which currently has 88 seats in the National Assembly, will win the most votes but whether it can secure the 289 seats it needs for an overall majority, which would be a huge slap in the face for Macron.\n\nThere is no firm consensus on why Macron chose to call a snap election given the risks that are in play.\n\nAndrew Hammond\n\nIt would leave him to potentially limp on in the office of president until 2027 during a period of so-called \"co-habitation\" with a far-right government or, a much more unlikely scenario, resign as Charles De Gaulle did in 1969.\n\nThere is no firm consensus on why Macron chose to call a snap election given the risks that are in play. However, there might possibly be some method to what many consider his political madness.\n\nFirstly, the president has lacked a parliamentary majority since the 2022 election and was heading for a no confidence motion later this year over the budget that would have probably seen his centrist government fall anyway. Macron previously said: \"It is better to write history than to submit to it.\" From this perspective, his decision represents a bold, proactive choice to force a dissolution on his own terms.\n\nA second probable reason why Macron decided to call an election is his belief that if the National Rally does win and forms a government with powers over domestic policy, including tax and spending, this could undercut the party's popularity as it faces the reality of wielding power in a tight fiscal context. This might reduce the possibility of a Le Pen presidential victory in 2027.\n\nMacron's calculations here might well have been that if National Rally remained outside of power, the party and Le Pen herself might continue to grow increasingly popular and win the presidency, possibly comfortably, in 2027. This would be a massive blow to his legacy, just as the election of Trump was to Obama's in the US. It might even potentially result in the collapse of \"Macronism\" as a centrist political project.\n\nWhile Macron's success, or otherwise, in foiling Le Pen's presidential prospects will not be clear until 2027, his election gamble is already having not only political consequences but significant economic ones for France. Markets have been volatile and Finance Minister Bruno Le Maire has warned that a National Rally victory would spark a financial crisis in the eurozone's second-largest economy due to tens of billions of euros of proposed extra borrowing.\n\nSpecifically, Le Maire cited the possibility of a \"Truss-style scenario.\" This referred to Liz Truss, the former UK prime minister, and the crisis in the bond markets that ultimately led to her departure from 10 Downing Street in October 2022, after only 50 days in office.\n\nMeanwhile, the European Commission warned last week that France's economic plans imply spiraling debt levels that demonstrate \"high risks over the medium term.\" According to its baseline 10-year projection, the EU expects France's debt ratio to rise to about 139 percent of gross domestic product by 2034, compared with about 110 percent now.\n\nMacron's gamble is therefore a huge one, politically and economically. While the results on July 7 will give the first indication of whether he is vindicated for his roll of the dice or not, a full assessment of the outcomes of his decision might not be clear until the 2027 elections.", "source": {"uri": "arabnews.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Arab News"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Rally", "type": "org",

French farmers traditionally vote right, not extreme right. But as the mood of the nation lurches away from the center, so too might Source-Seine.\n\nSophie Louet, mayor of Source-Seine, says candidates representing centrists in the mold of President Emmanuel Macron are nowhere to be seen in the hamlet -- an extreme example of a trend occurring throughout the country, the world's seventh-largest economy.\n\n\"Far right, far left ... and between them nothing,\" she said, speaking of the four candidates on the ballot for the region in the first round of elections, which are being held on Sunday. \"It's very destabilizing. In the last legislative elections, there were 30 candidates of all stripes.\"\n\nFrance faces a stark choice in its upcoming election, with a leading pollster showing the far-right National Rally ahead with 36% of the vote, followed by the leftist New Popular Front coalition at 29%. Macron's coalition trails at third with 19.5%, according to Ipsos. The surge in the right and the collapse of the center is sending shock waves across France, with some analysts warning that the deep disillusionment underpinning these numbers goes beyond France.\n\nMacron called the snap election a day after his party was crushed by the far right during June's European parliamentary elections. His decision was widely seen as an attempt to spook voters away from the political extremes, but a lightning-fast, three-week campaign has failed to turn the tide.\n\n\"The center has imploded,\" said Samantha de Bendern, a geopolitical commentator for the news outlet La Chaine Info. \"Macron miscalculated. He was hoping the moderate left and moderate right would both come to him. Instead, they've both joined the extremes.\n\nNational Rally, also known by its French acronym RN, is led by Marine Le Pen, who has softened her party's image in recent years by abandoning hostility toward the NATO alliance and the idea of a French exit from the European Union. Her party remains committed to its central doctrine of \"France for the French,\" giving citizens priority over nonnationals for jobs, housing and social welfare.\n\nOriginally called the National Front, the party's founding president, Jean-Marie Le Pen, Marine's father, was openly racist and convicted multiple times of making antisemitic comments and dismissing the Holocaust as a \"detail\" of history. Even as Marine Le Pen tried to steer the party away from its most extreme positions, RN has maintained an anti-immigration stance with strong Islamophobic undertones that it has tied to issues of order and security. Some members of RN continue to express racist, antisemitic or homophobic views, and according to a report published Thursday by the French National Consultative Commission on Human Rights, 54 percent of National Rally supporters described themselves as racist.\n\nA 'difficult' choice\n\nEmmanuel Delaval, who has lived in Source-Seine for 50 years, says people are \"much more ready\" to say they will vote far right. \"The RN have changed considerably, it's no longer the National Front,\" he said. \"That's not to say I am voting for them.\"\n\n\"The choice is very, very, very difficult,\" he said.\n\nHis friend, Dmitry Fouks, from the neighboring village of Trouhaut, is less coy about his feelings. \"People don't believe in politics anymore, they don't believe in France, and they certainly don't believe in Europe,\" he said.\n\nJordan Bardella, a clean-cut, media-savvy 28-year-old and loyal Le Pen prot\u00e9g\u00e9 who was elected president of National Rally in 2022, would be poised to become prime minister should the party secure enough seats. Bardella has promised to crack down on migration and, in a speech Monday, said among his priorities was to \"put France back on its feet\" by introducing what he called \"a necessary law against Islamist ideologies.\"\n\nIn 2022, Le Pen called the hijab a \"uniform of totalitarian ideology,\" saying she would like to ban the Muslim headscarf from all public places\n\n\"One of the main drivers of the vote is identity, the feeling that French people don't recognize their own face anymore, don't dress as they used to,\" said Sebastien Maillard, an associate fellow at the U.K. think tank Chatham House, noting that France has among the largest Muslim and Jewish communities in the European Union.\n\n\"Also, there's an element of 'Why don't we give it a try.'\" Maillard said of the tilt toward the far right. \"They're not as scary as they used to be.\"\n\nNational Rally has also proposed measures aimed at benefiting the working class. Bardella, who was raised in a disadvantaged suburb of Paris, touts his working-class roots, resonating with voters struggling with rising prices and perceptions of inequality between cities, which have benefited from Macron's pro-business agenda, and the areas outside them, which have not. Bardella has said he will reverse Macron's pension reform and reinstate a tax on financial wealth abolished by the president, while slashing taxes on energy and fuel.\n\nAntoine Hoareau is a member of the Socialist Party and serves as deputy mayor of Dijon, a city 25 miles from Source-Seine. But he grew up in the village, where his uncle and cousins still live, and where he owns a home.\n\n\"There is a real divide between the cities and the towns outside,\" Hoareau says. \"There is no immigration here, to buy bread you have to go 10 kilometers. There are no doctors. No public transport. These are low income families that live here. It's a social problem.\n\n\"They are watching right wing channels and they really play up immigration and crime and people watch and think there is a big problem even though there is no problem with that here.\"\n\nFollow the Seine from its source northwest to the sprawling city of Paris, and Anne Hidalgo, mayor of the capital and also a member of the Socialist Party, says she fears for her country's future in the face of such extremism, calling Le Pen a huge risk for the country.\n\n\"People in France say we don't have experience with these people, but we had the experience. We had the experience during the Second World War. ... It is a very, very big risk for democracy, for minorities, for women,\" she told NBC News. (During World War II, France's Vichy government collaborated with the Nazis.)\n\nWith National Rally widely expected to fall short of the 279 seats required for a majority, a hung Parliament appears the most likely outcome for France, setting up the possibility of political paralysis and damaging inaction.\n\n\"Either we have no government, a technocratic government, or we haggle for months over who should be prime minister,\" added de Bendern. \"A year and one day after the dissolution of Parliament, Macron can call new parliamentary elections, so we will have a year of chaos.\"\n\n\"We could be going into the Olympics without a prime minister,\" she added.\n\nHow such political instability may affect the Olympics, which begin in Paris less than three weeks after the vote, appears to be another error in Macron's timing.\n\nSecurity concerns are already heightened across Europe amid the wars in Ukraine and the Middle East and a spate of politically motivated attacks. In May, a man in southern France was arrested over a plan to attack a soccer stadium that will be used during the Olympics. Security has already ramped upin the capital, with some metro stations closed.\n\nMacron's Interior Minister G\u00e9rald Darmanin has said that French authorities are working on the assumption that violent protests could take place following both the first and second rounds of elections (June 30 and July 7). \"It's possible that there will be extremely strong tensions,\" Darmanin told RTL radio, adding that authorities were preparing for a \"highly inflammable\" situation.\n\nThat tension is exacerbated by ourside outsiders targeting French voters. A report by Recorded Future's Insikt Group, which examines trends in malware evolution, has said the French elections continue to be targeted by operations linked to Russia and Iran. These operations include cloned impersonations of French media organizations.\n\nAlso included were eurosceptic and populist political positions, dissuading support for Ukraine by amplifying skepticism towards Western alliances, while praising the RN for its willingness to engage in a dialogue with Russia to end the war. Before the invasion, RN maintained close ties with Russia, and Bardella said in a debate last week that RN would continue to support Ukraine, but would not send long-range missiles or French troops.\n\nThe report said that the overall effect of the disinformation campaigns on French public opinion has been \"negligible\" due to minimal online engagement.\n\nWhile the Olympics are ordinarily a unifying celebration of diversity, they may well take place under an overtly xenophobic government, or no government at all.\n\nWith his presidential term running until 2027, Macron is not on the ballot. Still, the parliamentary elections will serve as a referendum on his pro-business, centrist vision of France. A supporter of assertive French foreign policy, he's been a strong backer of Ukraine in its war against the Russian invasion.\n\nHe told the podcast \"Generation Do It Yourself\" on Tuesday that both left- and right-wing parties risked bringing \"civil war\" to France in another bid to scare voters back to the center.\n\nHe has said that he would stay in office until his term ends, regardless of the outcome of the election, but all signs point toward either a tense power-sharing arrangement with a prime minister from an opposing, likely antagonistic party, or a government without a stable majority.\n\n\"Macron is gambling France,\" Maillard said. \"He's saying to the people, 'You may have voted for the far right in the European elections, but this is for real.' But that's a dangerous gamble, because maybe the French will say, 'Yes, we really do want this.'\"\n\nKeir Simmons and Chapman Bell reported from Source-Seine, Nancy Ing reported from Paris and

25%.\n\nAll candidates whose votes are less than 12.5% of registered voters are eliminated from the race and will not qualify for the second round.\n\nA run-off can be between two or more candidates

Opinion polls suggest a potential win for the far right, making this vote crucial. The elections determine who runs the government, how legislative power is distributed, and the potential political landscape for President Macron's remaining term.\n\nFrance holds the first round of parliamentary elections on Sunday. Opinion polls show the far right could win the two-round legislative vote that concludes on July 7. Here are some key facts about the election and what comes next.\n\nHOW DOES THE VOTE WORK? France has 49 million registered voters. There are 577 constituency contests, one for each seat in the National Assembly, the lower house of parliament.\n\nCandidates with an absolute majority of votes in their constituency are elected in the first round. In most cases no candidate meets this criteria and a second round is held. To qualify for the run-off, candidates need first-round votes amounting to at least 12.5% of registered voters.\n\nThe top scorer wins the second round. WHEN WILL THE RESULTS BE ANNOUNCED?\n\nVoting in the first round ends at 8 p.m. (1800 GMT) on Sunday, when pollsters publish nationwide projections based on a partial vote count. These are usually reliable. Official results start trickling in from 8 p.m. Vote counting is usually fast and efficient, and the winners of all, or nearly all, seats will be known by the end of the evening. WHO WILL RUN THE GOVERNMENT?\n\nThe president names the prime minister, usually from the party with most seats. For the first time in France's post-war history, the far right could win, opinion polls show, with a left-wing union seen winning the second-biggest group and President Emmanuel Macron's centrist alliance coming third.\n\nBut this is an election like no other in France, campaign time is short, the electoral landscape is shaken, and other scenarios cannot be excluded. These include a paralysed assembly divided into three groups with no one dominating it or an alliance of mainstream parties to keep the far right out of power.\n\nAn absolute majority requires at least 289 seats. Marine Le Pen's National Rally (RN) could run a minority government if it wins the most seats without reaching that threshold, but 28-year-old party leader Jordan Bardella said it wanted an absolute majority or would not be able to carry out reforms.\n\nWHAT HAPPENS NEXT? France has had three periods of \"cohabitation,\" where the government is of a different political stripe from the president, in its post-war history.\n\nThe government has most of the power on the domestic front, but the president is the head of the military and wields influence abroad. However, the division of power on foreign policy is not clear cut and that could be an issue for France's stance on the war in Ukraine or European Union policy. Macron will have to deal with the new parliament for at least a year, after which he can call another snap election.\n\nMacron won a second mandate in April 2022 and is president for three more years. Neither parliament nor the government can force him out before that.

But he will have to pick a prime minister from the party or alliance with the most seats in the National Assembly, regardless of how divergent their policies are from his own.\n\nHere are some of the key party figureheads in the campaign:\n\nJORDAN BARDELLA, FAR-RIGHT NATIONAL RALLY PARTY\n\nThe sharp-suited Bardella, 28, has Italian roots. He was raised by his mother in social housing in the hardscrabble northern outskirts of Paris but attended a semi-private Catholic school.\n\nHis working class background has become a selling point. \"I'm in politics for everything I lived through back there,\" he told newspaper Le Monde.\n\nBardella joined Marine Le Pen's far-right party aged 16. Seven years later, Le Pen picked him to lead her party's charge in the 2019 European elections. Members elected him party president in November 2022.\n\nThe battle-hardened Le Pen and youthful, sharp-witted Bardella have formed a formidable political tag team. Bardella has used his TikTok account, which has 1.7 million followers, to attract younger, social media-savvy voters.\n\nThe pair have broadened the party's appeal beyond its historic redoubts of the Mediterranean coast and the northern rust belt, pitching it as a defender of family incomes, jobs and French identity.\n\nBardella casts himself as a potential \"prime minister for purchasing power\", pledging to cut VAT on power and fuel and scrap income tax for the under-30s. His opponents say he lacks professional experience, having gone into politics at a young age, and that his economic plans are unrealistic.\n\nGABRIEL ATTAL, CENTRIST 'TOGETHER' ALLIANCE\n\nAt 35, Gabriel Attal became France's youngest post-war prime minister when Macron appointed him in January.\n\nSometimes dubbed \"baby Macron\", Attal faces the daunting task of saving his boss's presidency and political movement.\n\nDisaffected voters nationwide are shifting support to the far right and a new left-wing alliance in anger at Macron's policies and personality, with the president often perceived as arrogant and disconnected from daily hardships.\n\nAttal is France's first openly gay prime minister.\n\nHis political rise has been meteoric under Macron. Having joined the Socialist Party aged 17, he became a household name in French politics after being named government spokesman during the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nAttal went on to serve as budget minister and spent a few months at the helm of the education ministry before Macron made him head of government in an attempt to fend off the far-right.\n\nAttal's first move as education minister in 2023 was to ban the Muslim abaya in state schools, earning himself a popularity boost among conservative voters despite hailing from the left.\n\nLEFT-WING FIGURES\n\nThere is no single obvious contender to be prime minister on the left, where a wide range of parties have formed a New Popular Front (NFP) in an attempt to join forces against the RN.\n\nThe NFP has not said who would be its pick for prime minister. The following are some of its best-known figures:\n\nJEAN-LUC MELENCHON, HARD-LEFT FRANCE UNBOWED PARTY\n\nMelenchon, 72, has been a fixture in French left-wing politics for decades and held ministerial posts in past governments, when he was a member of the Socialist Party.\n\nHe ran for president in 2012, 2017 and 2022, improving his score each time. He came third in 2022, just behind far-right leader Marine Le Pen. Macron won that election.\n\nA fiery orator, Melenchon is one of the most divisive figures in French politics, enthusing and horrifying voters with his unbridled tax-and-spend proposals, class war rhetoric and controversial foreign policy positions, especially on Gaza. Critics accuse him of antisemitism, which he denies.\n\nRAPHAEL GLUCKSMANN, SOCIALIST PARTY\n\nGlucksmann, 44, headed the Socialist list of candidates in the European elections this month. It obtained nearly 14% of the vote, just behind Macron's Together group. This was considered a sign of revival for a party that governed France in past decades but had recently fallen into electoral oblivion.\n\nThe son of a philosopher, Glucksmann attended prestigious schools and had a career in journalism and broadcasting before branching out in a variety of directions, including being an adviser to then Georgian president Mikheil Saakashvili.\n\nHe advocates strong European support for Ukraine in its resistance against Russia's invasion.\n\nLAURENT BERGER, FORMER CFDT TRADE UNION LEADER\n\nBerger, 55, is a former head of one of France's main trade unions, the moderate CFDT. He has a track record of strong opposition to the far-right RN.\n\nBerger has said he does not want to be prime minister, but others on the left have put his name forward, saying he could be a unifying figure and a popular alternative to Melenchon.

No such alliance exists now but Macron has urged parties to unite to keep out the far-right.\n\n-- offering the job to the left, if an alliance including the far-left, Socialist Party and Greens emerges as the second-biggest group, as opinion polls suggest. The left could then try to form a minority government.\n\nWOULD ANY OF THOSE OPTIONS WORK?\n\nIf the RN wins the highest share of the vote and accepts the prime minister post, a period of 'cohabitation' with Macron would begin. That has happened three times in France's modern political history, but with mainstream parties. The RN could struggle to get reforms adopted.\n\nIf the RN is the largest party in parliament, but is not in power, it could block or modify government proposals. The constitution gives the government some tools to circumvent that, but with limits.\n\nIf the RN secures a majority, it largely guarantees it getting the prime minister job as it could on its own force any government it disagrees with to resign.\n\nWHAT HAPPENS IF THERE IS NO DEAL?\n\nIt's possible that none of the three groups -- the far-right, centrist and left -- will be big enough to govern alone, reach a coalition deal or get assurances it can run a viable minority government.\n\nIn such a case, France would risk political paralysis, with little or no legislation being adopted and a caretaker government running basic daily affairs.\n\nCOULD MACRON RESIGN?\n\nMacron has ruled this out, but it could become an option if everything is blocked. Neither parliament nor the government could force him to do that.\n\nWHAT WON'T HAPPEN UNDER ANY SCENARIO\n\nThe constitution says there can be no new parliamentary election for another year, so an immediate repeat vote is not an option.\n\nWHAT ELSE SHOULD YOU KNOW?\n\nThe outcome of French parliamentary elections is hard to predict because they involve 577 separate contests, one per seat. An unusual, short campaign could mean the result differs from what surveys are projecting.", "source": {"uri": "timeslive.co.za", "dataType": "news", "title": "Times LIVE"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Rally", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "National Rally"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emmanuel_Macron", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Emmanuel Macron"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prime_minister", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Prime minister"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Far-right_politics", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Far-right politics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constitution", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Constitution"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Opinion_poll", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Opinion poll"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/France", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "France"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jordan_Bardella", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Jordan Bardella"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Majority", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Majority"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Opposition_to_immigration", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Opposition to immigration"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Convention_on_Human_Rights", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "European Convention on Human Rights"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parliamentary_group", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Parliamentary group"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euroscepticism", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Euroscepticism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paris", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minority_government", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Minority government"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Far-left_politics", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Far-left politics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Socialist_Party_(France)", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Socialist Party (France)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Greens", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Australian Greens"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Health_Organization", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "World Health Organization"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strike_action", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Strike action"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Belgium", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Belgium"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Belgium"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caretaker_government", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Caretaker government"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cohabitation_(government)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Cohabitation (government)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coalition_government", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Coalition government"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Centrism", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Centrism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parliament", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Parliament"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reuters", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Reuters"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Parties", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Parties", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Parties/Planning", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Parties/Planning", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Democracy", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Democracy", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/GS8S4lfdnVnOuot6l-K1eZEFVZQhe7Wb8ahGUa4Qt8UeRFLcok5pfHUkHZ13Sjjh-BRInyn0_quYD7IaSNO_cuZrkc3IOUELOi0=s1000", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9692876", "eventUri": "eng-9692876", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-07-07", "textStart": 509, "textEnd": 515}], "sentiment": 0.05882352941176472, "wgt": 137, "relevance": 1}

Macron argued that he couldn't ignore the results while also warning that \"the rise of nationalists and demagogues\" was threatening France and Europe.\n\nFundamentally, Macron is forcing voters to make up their minds about whether they prefer his pro-business, pro-Europe, pro-Ukraine vision for France or Le Pen's agenda of dramatically cutting migration, stepping back from European Union rules and undoing some of Macron's pension reforms.\n\nIt could put National Rally into a position where it would have to govern for the first time, creating a tangible track record ahead of the 2027 presidential election, when Macron won't be able to run due to term limits.\n\nSunday's voting will be the first round, with runoffs on July 7.\n\nAs of Friday -- the last day polling companies are allowed to publish projections ahead of the vote -- National Rally and its allies had a strong lead, on course to get 36.2% of the vote, according to Bloomberg's poll of polls.\n\nA left-wing alliance -- including the Socialists, Communists, Greens and the far-left France Unbowed -- was on track to get 28.3% while Macron's centrist group was projected to get 20.4%.\n\nSeat Projections\n\nFirst round vote shares don't tell the full story -- the decisive factor shaping the next government is the distribution of seats in the 577-member National Assembly after the second round.\n\nWhile the two-round ballot makes seat predictions tricky, the National Rally and its allies are projected to become the biggest group in the lower house of parliament with between 238 and 281 members, according to Bloomberg's final poll of polls before the blackout on Friday evening.\n\nWhen the first round results are in on Sunday, polling companies will have much more data to refine those projections. That will be crucial information for parties to set their campaign strategies, and for investors trying to assess what kind of instability is coming.\n\nTurnout\n\nA significantly greater number of people are expected to cast ballots than in several prior legislative elections, according to surveys. That's important in France's system, because it raises the chances of more than two candidates making it to the second round, creating less predictable three- or even occasional four-way races, known as triangulaires and quadrangulaires.\n\nIn 2022, there were only eight triangulaires. This time, the number could swell to between 160 and 200, according to a poll of 2,005 adults by Odoxa June 26-27.\n\nThe interior ministry will publish interim figures for turnout at midday and 5 p.m.\n\nCohabitation or minority government\n\nAny group that is able to get an absolute majority of 289 or more seats will control the lower-house of parliament. It can easily pass laws and a government backed by that group would be safe from the threat of no-confidence votes.\n\nIf the group that gets a majority is from a different party than the president, which has happened three times since France's current form of republic came into effect in 1958, it results in type of power-sharing arrangement called cohabitation. The president generally selects the leader of the party that obtained the majority as prime minister. But a combination involving the National Rally would be the first time it's involved a party that's never governed before.\n\nIf a group gets the most seats but is short of an absolute majority, then it could form a minority government -- like Macron's current situation. But that also depends on the president, who has sole authority to appoint a prime minister.\n\nA hung parliament would make it difficult to legislate since the government would need to find extra votes outside of its party for every bill. If the government were to use a constitutional provision that allows it to bypass a vote, it would open itself up to a no-confidence vote and could be overturned if rival parties came together.\n\nNational Rally President Jordan Bardella has said he would refuse the job if his party and its allies don't get an outright majority in the National Assembly.\n\nMarkets\n\nMacron's decision to call the election triggered turmoil in markets in France, leading to an equity selloff that initially wiped almost $200 billion off the value of stocks.\n\nThe yield on 10-year government notes at one point on Friday rose to the highest since November. That widened the extra yield investors demanded for French debt over similar German government bonds to 86 basis points -- the most since 2012. The benchmark CAC 40 stock index meanwhile fell to its lowest since January.\n\nPolicies\n\nThe three leading groups in the elections are proposing radically different paths for France.\n\nMacron's party stands for continuity, with more pro-business tax cuts and reforms, along with a commitment to curb spending. Responding to concerns of voters, his group has added pledges to improve the incomes of low earners by tweaking taxation, and measures to help home-buyers.\n\nThe National Rally has promised to cut immigration, toughen France's stance on law and order with more prison places and minimum sentencing, and cut value-added taxes on energy and fuel. Following a sell-off in French assets, the party has delayed some of its more costly measures -- potentially indefinitely depending on a review of public finances.\n\nThe New Popular Front has the most radical economic program. In the short run, it says it would freeze prices of consumer staples, abolish Macron's pension reform and raise the minimum wage 14% and public sector salaries 10%. The extra annual spending, which is forecast to reach \u20ac150 billion in 2027, would be entirely financed by taxing businesses, finance, and the wealthiest.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek", "source": {"uri": "ca.finance.yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo!

Dominated by the Le Pen family, their journey from the 1972 founding of the National Front to the current leadership under Jordan Bardella marks a significant political shift in France.\n\nAfter decades as political pariahs, the far right in France may finally have a chance to form a national government after a two-round legislative vote that begins on Sunday and will conclude on July 7.\n\nFollowing are historical highlights of a movement that has been dominated by the Le Pen family for more than half a century. 1972\n\nFormer soldier Jean-Marie Le Pen founds the National Front, a fringe far-right party comprised of veterans from the Algerian war and French collaborators from the Vichy regime. 1974\n\nLe Pen runs in the presidential election, but garners less than 1% of the vote. Two years later, his home in Paris is attacked with a bomb. No culprit is ever found. 1981\n\nLe Pen is unable to secure enough backers to run for the presidential election, won by leftist Fran\u00e7ois Mitterrand. In the following years, Le Pen gradually attracts new supporters. 1986\n\nThe party wins its first seats in the National Assembly. 1987\n\nLe Pen makes disparaging comments about gay men with AIDS, part of a lifelong tendency to spark outrage with racist, antisemitic and homophobic slurs that often land him in legal jeopardy but which win support among a part of the electorate. 1988\n\nLe Pen wins 14.4% of votes in the presidential election. The following year, the National Front wins more than 10% of votes in European elections. It also begins to zero in on Islam and Muslim immigrants as one of its major political concerns. 1995\n\nThe National Front wins three city halls in the south, Toulon, Orange and Marignane, underlining its growing electoral support. 2002\n\nLe Pen runs for president and wins 16.86% of votes, enough to put him into a second-round run-off against Jacques Chirac. The strong showing sends shockwaves through France and there is widespread disgust that such a far-right party could do so well. Politicians from the right and left come together to prevent Le Pen from winning the second round. Chirac wins over 80% of votes in the run-off. 2008\n\nA court hands Le Pen a three-month suspended prison sentence and a fine of 10,000 euros for saying the Nazi occupation of France was \"not particularly inhumane\". 2011\n\nLe Pen's daughter Marine Le Pen becomes the new leader of the National Front after a period in which the party performs badly in polls and faces growing financial pressures. 2012\n\nMarine Le Pen makes a first, unsuccessful run for the presidency. 2014\n\nThe National Front has a breakthrough election year, winning control of 11 town halls and also taking first place in European Parliament elections. 2015\n\nJean Marie Le Pen is suspended from the party after describing the Holocaust as \"a detail\" of World War Two. That same year, he is expelled by his daughter from the party. 2017\n\nMarine Le Pen runs for the presidency again, but loses to Emmanuel Macron. After that she increases efforts to make the party more palatable to a wider electorate, seeking to distance it from its racist and antisemitic past, and also give its lawmakers a more professional veneer, with media training and a slick social media presence. In 2018, she changes the party's name to National Rally (RN). 2022\n\nJordan Bardella, a 28-year-old protege of Marine Le Pen, is chosen to be the new president of the RN. June 2024\n\nBardella leads the party in the European Parliament elections, handing out a drubbing to Macron's party and prompting the president to call a snap legislative vote. Bardella is the RN's prime ministerial candidate.\n\n(This story has not been edited by Devdiscourse staff and is auto-generated from a syndicated feed.)", "source": {"uri": "devdiscourse.com",

The alternative would be a hung parliament and stalemate.\n\nAs soon as the first results come in on Sunday evening, National Rally's opponents will have to decide who to back in run-off battles across France, in a bid to ensure that absolute majority does not happen.\n\nIf the polls are right, many of the run-offs will pit the National Rally against a hastily cobbled together left-wing alliance called New Popular Front, which believes it could even win the election.\n\nBut because of the expected high turnout, three parties could qualify for the second-round battles in as many as 250 constituencies, according to Brice Teinturier of Ipsos polling institute.\n\nIn previous elections, parties from across the spectrum have united to keep the far right out. That raises the question of whether one of the candidates will drop out in those triangular races to unify the anti-RN vote.\n\nIn Franconville, north of Paris, a teacher called Agn\u00e8s complains about the breakdown of discipline in French schools and likes Jordan Bardella's plans for \"a big bang in authority\" in education. \"I'll either vote right or far right. I like Bardella's charisma,\" she says.\n\nShe also has no problem with RN's plans to abolish droit du sol, the right to automatic French citizenship for children born to foreign parents if those children have spent five years in France - from the age of 11 to 18 when they are entitled to a apply for French citizenship.\n\nPresident Macron's Ensemble alliance is widely expected to haemorrhage seats, and Gabriel Attal's days as prime minister appear numbered, even though polls suggest he remains the most popular politician in France.\n\nMr Hollande, the former French president who was Mr Macron's boss and mentor, is standing for parliament again - now as a New Popular Front candidate.\n\nHowever, even Macron allies are angry with his snap election gamble.\n\nFrance was not due another election for three more years, and it had far better ways of spending the summer than going through an abbreviated and intense election campaign.\n\nAll of France has been gearing up for the Paris Olympics which start on 26 July.\n\nMetro stations like Concorde have been shut, and restrictions are in place close to any of the Games sites.", "source": {"uri": "tvcnews.tv", "dataType": "news",

Opinion polls show the far right could win the two-round legislative vote that concludes on July 7.\n\nHere are some key facts about the election and what comes next.\n\nHOW DOES THE VOTE WORK?\n\nFrance has 49 million registered voters. There are 577 constituency contests, one for each seat in the National Assembly, the lower house of parliament.\n\nCandidates with an absolute majority of votes in their constituency are elected in the first round. In most cases no candidate meets this criteria and a second round is held.\n\nTo qualify for the run-off, candidates need first-round votes amounting to at least 12.5% of registered voters.\n\nThe top scorer wins the second round.\n\nWHEN WILL THE RESULTS BE ANNOUNCED?\n\nVoting in the first round ends at 8 p.m. (1800 GMT) on Sunday, when pollsters publish nationwide projections based on a partial vote count. These are usually reliable. Official results start trickling in from 8 p.m. Vote counting is usually fast and efficient, and the winners of all, or nearly all, seats will be known by the end of the evening.\n\nWHO WILL RUN THE GOVERNMENT?\n\nThe president names the prime minister, usually from the party with most seats.\n\nFor the first time in France's post-war history, the far right could win, opinion polls show, with a left-wing union seen winning the second-biggest group and President Emmanuel Macron's centrist alliance coming third.\n\nBut this is an election like no other in France, campaign time is short, the electoral landscape is shaken, and other scenarios cannot be excluded.\n\nThese include a paralysed assembly divided into three groups with no one dominating it or an alliance of mainstream parties to keep the far right out of power.\n\nAn absolute majority requires at least 289 seats.\n\nMarine Le Pen's National Rally (RN) could run a minority government if it wins the most seats without reaching that threshold, but 28-year-old party leader Jordan Bardella said it wanted an absolute majority or would not be able to carry out reforms.\n\nWHAT HAPPENS NEXT?\n\nFrance has had three periods of \"cohabitation,\" where the government is of a different political stripe from the president, in its post-war history.\n\nThe government has most of the power on the domestic front, but the president is the head of the military and wields influence abroad. However, the division of power on foreign policy is not clear cut and that could be an issue for France's stance on the war in Ukraine or European Union policy.\n\nMacron will have to deal with the new parliament for at least a year, after which he can call another snap election.\n\nMacron won a second mandate in April 2022 and is president for three more years. Neither parliament nor the government can force him out before that.\n\nEditing by Janet Lawrence and Andrew Heavens", "source": {"uri": "reuters.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Reuters"}, "authors": [{"uri": "ingrid_melander@reuters.com", "name": "Ingrid Melander", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/France", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "France"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Two-round_system", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Two-round system"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electoral_district", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Electoral district"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Far-right_politics", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Far-right politics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Majority", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Majority"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Assembly_(France)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "National Assembly (France)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lower_house", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Lower house"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reuters", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Reuters"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Rally", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "National Rally"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emmanuel_Macron", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Emmanuel Macron"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Centrism", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Centrism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parliament", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Parliament"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Health_Organization", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "World Health Organization"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prime_minister", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Prime minister"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Left-wing_politics", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Left-wing politics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Opinion_poll", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Opinion poll"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Belgium", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Belgium"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Belgium"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russian_invasion_of_Ukraine", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Russian invasion of Ukraine"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/What_Happens_Next?_(band)", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "What Happens Next?

In the first, voters tend to choose with their hearts not their heads, picking the candidate who best reflects their values.\n\nBut if no candidate secures a 50 per cent majority, which is often the case, the vote goes to a run-off.\n\nTo qualify for the July run-off, candidates need first-round votes amounting to at least 12.5 per cent of registered voters, and the top scorer wins the second round.\n\nAt this point \"le vote utile\", tactical voting, often comes into play. Sometimes a weaker candidate steps aside so it becomes a two-horse race, for example between a mainstream candidate and a far-Right candidate. This can allow voters of various views to band together to block a rival whom they deem beyond the pale.\n\nThe alliance which manages to secure a majority in the lower house of parliament then forms a government to serve under the president.\n\nVoting ends at 8pm local time (7pm BST), when pollsters publish nationwide projections based on a partial vote count.\n\nThese are usually reliable, with official results trickling in from 8pm.\n\nVote counting is usually fast and efficient and the winners of all, or nearly all, seats will be known by the end of the evening.\n\nAccording to the polls, the frontrunner in this race is the hard-Right National Rally, led by Marine Le Pen in parliament and overall by Jordan Bardella, a youthful, energetic new face in the party.\n\nIn second place is a Left-wing alliance, the Popular Front, formed from centre-Left, hard-Left and Green parties.\n\nTrailing them both in third place is Mr Macron's centrist alliance Ensemble, which has been on the ropes since losing its absolute majority in parliament in 2022.\n\nAnd that is why this election feels like such a gamble for the French leader: the polls suggest he will fail to secure a majority and wind up as a lame duck president.\n\nIf so, he will presumably remain in office, but will have little influence over domestic policy-making and only some control over foreign policy and defence.\n\nIf Mr Macron doesn't secure a majority, which seems likely at this stage, he will have to engage in a French political system called \"cohabitation\".\n\nWhen the president's own alliance has no majority, he must appoint a prime minister from the alliance which beat him; this is very rare.\n\nIt has happened only three times in the history of the modern Republic, once when Jacques Chirac, conservative president, appointed Lionel Jospin, the socialist prime minister, in 1997.\n\nWhoever that prime minister might be - the polls suggest the National Rally leader - they will be accountable to parliament, lead the government and introduce bills.\n\nThe president retains some authority over foreign policy, such as holding the nuclear codes, and in theory they can veto the prime minister's laws, though parliament can overrule this with its majority.\n\nIf the National Rally secures an absolute majority, Mr Macron will be left as a lame duck.\n\nIn this highly unlikely scenario, the Macron presidency bounces back: he can retake control of his parliament, appoint an Ensemble prime minister and forge ahead with his reforms.\n\nHe will be able to claim a decisive defeat over Ms Le Pen and her ilk and congratulate himself on a gamble that paid off.\n\nBut the polls currently suggest that is not the direction France is heading in.\n\nThis is an election like no other in France: campaign time is short, the electoral landscape is shaken, and so other scenarios cannot be excluded.\n\nThese include a paralysed National Assembly divided into three groups with no one party dominating it, or an alliance of mainstream parties to keep the hard-Right out of power. An absolute majority requires at least 289 seats.\n\nMs Le Pen's National Rally could run a minority government if it wins the most seats without reaching that threshold, but 28-year-old party leader Mr Bardella has said he wants an absolute majority as without it he will not be able to carry out reforms.\n\nCritics of Mr Macron will argue this was a hubristic move that dooms his leadership and will hasten the rise of the hard-Right in France.\n\nMs Le Pen has for years been working hard to clean up her party's image and style herself as the co-leader of a new party of government. Now that goal is tantalisingly close, thanks in large part to Mr Macron's decision.\n\nHowever, the French president was already under immense pressure from the National Rally due to its soaring popularity over the course of his presidency. In calling the election now, he has an opportunity to take the initiative and fight on his own terms.\n\nAnd at first this tactic did seem effective: it initially threw the French Right into total disarray as they argued over the shape of their anti-Macron alliance.\n\nUnfortunately for the president, it did not catch the French Left off-guard in the same way; they swiftly formed a cogent alliance which is consistently polling in second place, ahead of Mr Macron.", "source": {"uri": "yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Rally", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "National Rally"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emmanuel_Macron", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Emmanuel Macron"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parliament", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Parliament"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Two-round_system", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Two-round system"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/France", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "France"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lower_house", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Lower house"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marine_Le_Pen", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Marine Le Pen"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elections_to_the_European_Parliament", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Elections to the European Parliament"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Majority", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Majority"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_election", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "General election"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Assembly_(France)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "National Assembly (France)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prime_minister", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Prime minister"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jordan_Bardella", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Jordan Bardella"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cohabitation_(government)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Cohabitation (government)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lame_duck_(politics)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Lame duck (politics)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Popular_Front_(France)", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Popular Front (France)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foreign_policy", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Foreign policy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Centrism", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Centrism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/British_Summer_Time", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "British Summer Time"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Left-wing_politics", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Left-wing politics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/French_Left", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "French Left"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lionel_Jospin", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Lionel Jospin"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minority_government", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Minority government"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jacques_Chirac", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Jacques Chirac"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/President_of_France", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "President of France"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Veto", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Veto"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Socialism", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Socialism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conservatism", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Conservatism"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Campaigns_and_Elections", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Campaigns and Elections", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Activism/Strategies", "label": "dmoz/Society/Activism/Strategies", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Democracy", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Democracy", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Online_Issues_Polls", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Online Issues Polls", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 94}], "image": "https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/f.18_cX8PU9418Caqnbalg--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyMDA7aD03NTA7Y2Y9d2VicA--/https://media.zenfs.com/en/the_telegraph_258/786e3b79b0c49ade8f6bc4b0327a38cd", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9692876", "eventUri": "eng-9692876", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-06-30", "textStart": 877, "textEnd": 884}, {"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-07-07", "textStart": 911, "textEnd": 917}], "sentiment": 0.0980392156862746, "wgt": 135, "relevance": 1}

NR leads strongly with 36 percent of the vote, followed by left-wing bloc Nouveau Front Populaire (NFP) at 28.5 percent, trailed by Macron's centrist alliance - Ensemble - with 21 percent.\n\nIf the results echo the polls, Macron might have to cohabitate with an antagonistic prime minister, regardless of who is elected.\n\nVoting opens at 06:00 GMT and is expected to end at 16:00 GMT in most of the country, but polling stations in Paris and other major cities will stay open until 18:00 GMT.\n\nTo win a majority in the National Assembly, a party or alliance needs 289 seats -- just over the halfway mark in the House. Macron's outgoing coalition fell short of that number, limiting its ability to push through its legislative agenda.\n\nFor the verdict on any of the 577 seats to be called on Sunday, July 30, two conditions need to be met. First, the voter turnout needs to be at least 25 percent. Second, a candidate needs to win an absolute majority of votes cast.\n\nIn a multiparty system like France's, that typically means that many, if not most, contests go to a second round of voting - scheduled this time for July 7.\n\nOnly those candidates who secure at least 12.5 percent of the vote in the first round can stand in the second round, effectively narrowing the field of contestants.\n\nTraditionally, National Assembly elections are held straight after the presidential vote, and so reflect the same popular mood. The result is a prime minister from the same political party as the president, who then can implement policies with a strong mandate.\n\nBut those power dynamics have now shifted and for the first time in 22 years, France will have a state of cohabitation: a deeply unpopular president ruling alongside a government elected in as a vote of dissatisfaction against Macron himself.\n\n\"It will mark the beginning of a new way of governing and the end of the presidential agenda,\" said Emmanuel Dupuy, president of the Institute for European Perspective and Security Studies, a think tank on diplomacy and political analysis. \"Macronism has already almost collapsed and it will exit the election totally wiped out,\" he said.\n\nMacron first came to power in 2017 riding a wave of support, as he pledged to create a centrist bloc, lacing the moderate left and right together. But it didn't take long before his language started sounding too aloof to the ears of people in the suburbs - he got the nickname Jupiter. His economic reforms were too right wing to liberals who had previously backed him; and his way of governing was seen as too despotic by many right and left voters.\n\nNow, the election could mark an end to Jupiter's solo show, as France looks set to enter a new political era.\n\n\"He runs the country like a CEO of a company,\" said Samantha de Bendern, associate fellow at Chatham House. \"But a country is not a company and he failed to build alliances with partners - Macron is a loner,\" de Bendern said.\n\nOne of the starkest signals of his isolation was the Yellow Vest movement - a period of violent protests in 2018. What started as workers on lower-middle incomes infuriated by planned increases in diesel taxes snowballed into a wider movement against the president's perceived bias in favour of the elite. His second mandate was marked by a highly contested bill in 2023 to raise the country's retirement by two years which turned into another huge domestic challenge as he faced widespread opposition.\n\nAnd while he won a second mandate in 2022 - in good measure by scaring, rather than attracting, voters over the prospect of the far right taking over the presidency - the tactic seems to have tired many. \"There is a feeling of anger - people are fed up with showing this scare for Le Pen while being forced to vote for Macron to keep out the far right,\" de Bendern said.\n\nMeanwhile, Le Pen has meticulously crafted a so-called dediabolisation - de-demonisation - strategy over the past two decades, aimed at broadening the party's base while tempering its radical discourse to distance itself from many references that had made the NR too toxic to several voters.\n\nThe party has long been associated with notorious racists, and xenophobic and anti-Semitic slurs. Her father, Jean-Marie Le Pen, once convicted of hate speech for saying that Nazi gas chambers were \"a detail of history\", was expelled from the party in 2015. Le Pen convinced the moderate right instead that she was not a threat to democracy and conquered areas traditionally close to the far left, especially in the Communist Party, promising social welfare policies and tight restrictions on migrants.\n\n\"Many [by voting NR] are expressing their opposition to a system that they feel is depriving them of what they deserve in favour of people, mostly foreigners, who are getting benefits that are not due,\" said Baptiste Roger-Lacan, historian and political analyst with a focus on far-right parties in Europe.\n\nToday, the party's candidate to be the country's prime minister is Jordan Bardella, an impeccably dressed 28-year-old man who looks like a mix between a Wolf of Wall Street and Superman's alter ego Clark Kent. Yet he comes from the suburbs and speaks to his tens of thousands of followers not just on the street but also on TikTok. He has no experience in governance.\n\nOn the other side, far to centre-left parties have united under the New Popular Front. Its most vocal cause has been its support for the Palestinian cause amid the war in Gaza, a position that has earned the grouping popularity among young voters and the Muslim community.\n\nBy contrast, the NR has firmly supported Israel condemning \"pogroms on Israeli soil\" and attacking the leader of the far-left La France Insoumise party, Jean-Luc Melenchon, for failing to call the October 7 Hamas attack on Israel \"terrorism\" - something that has caused friction within the bloc itself.\n\nThe most serious repercussion of a win for the NR is going to be on the domestic front. While the party now says anti-Semitism is a problem of the left-wing party, it has shifted its focus against migrants and Muslims. France is home to Europe's biggest Muslim community, with families settled there for several generations.\n\nWhile Bardella did not specify what \"specific legislation\" he would push for to fight \"Islamist ideologies\", he said in the past the party would work to ban the wearing of the Islamic headscarf in public spaces and to make it easier to close mosques.\n\nThe RN has also made its top priority the adoption of stringent border controls, the scrapping of birthright citizenship - a practice that for centuries has been granting citizenship to those born in France to foreign parents - and the introduction via constitutional referendum of the \"national preference\", a system by which someone would be excluded benefits from social security rights unless with a French passport.\n\n\"Clearly the NR is still xenophobic so any foreigner has something to lose, any foreigner who has not a European heritage would have to lose something if the NR were to be elected,\" Roger-Lacan said.\n\nWith his eyes on power, Bardella has been softening or reversing some of the party's traditional positions. He made a U-turn on Ukraine saying he was committed to keep providing military support to Kyiv, while pushing back against critics' allegations of some party members' links to the Kremlin.\n\nStill, considering Macron's unwavering stance on Ukraine and France's role as a pillar of the European Union, a Bardella-led government not committed as much to the European project, would mark a shift.\n\nDuring a news conference on Monday, Bardella said he opposes sending French troops and weaponry capable of striking targets on Russian soil.\n\n\"He is in a phase where is trying to reassure the non-NR electorate, and possibly future EU partners, but clearly the party gaining power would add a lot of tension between France and the rest of the EU,\" said Roger-Lacan, who is also former deputy editor-in-chief at the think tank Le Grand Continent.\n\nUnlike Italian Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni, who had transitioned towards more Atlantic, pro-NATO, pro-EU positions years before her election victory in 2022, Roger-Lacan explains, the NR's conversion \"sounds extremely contextual\".\n\nStill, should the far right win the elections, observers note, it could end up abstaining from creating too much tremor, should it win the elections, as the group is playing the long game. It's ultimate goal: capturing the presidency in 2027.", "source": {"uri": "aljazeera.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Al Jazeera Online"}, "authors": [{"uri": "virginia_pietromarchi@aljazeera.com",

An unusual, short campaign could mean the result differs from what surveys are projecting.\n\nFrance voted on Sunday in the first round of a snap parliamentary election which opinion polls forecast the far-right National Rally could win without an absolute majority.\n\nWhat happens then, and can political paralysis be avoided after the election, the second round of which is on July 7?\n\nSHORT ANSWER: NO ONE KNOWS FOR SURE\n\nArticle 8 of the constitution says the president appoints the prime minister, but does not say which criteria he should use.\n\nIn practice, President Emmanuel Macron would be expected to offer the job to the leading parliamentary group - which opinion polls suggest will be the eurosceptic, anti-immigration National Rally (RN).\n\nRN CHIEF BARDELLA TO BE PRIME MINISTER?\n\nThe RN has said party leader Jordan Bardella is its candidate for prime minister but has also said it will turn down the job if it and its allies together do not win an absolute majority of at least 289 seats.\n\nSince the constitution does not say how he should choose his prime minister, Macron could in any case, in theory, try to pull together an anti-RN alliance and offer the job to another party, or someone who is not politically affiliated.\n\nIF NOT BARDELLA, WHO?\n\nThe constitution does not provide any specific answer.\n\nOptions would include:\n\n- trying to strike an alliance of mainstream parties. No such alliance exists now but Macron has urged parties to unite to keep out the far-right.\n\n- offering the job to the left, if an alliance including the far-left, Socialist Party and Greens emerges as the second-biggest group, as opinion polls suggest. The left could then try to form a minority government.\n\nWOULD ANY OF THOSE OPTIONS WORK?\n\nIf the RN wins the highest share of the vote and accepts the prime minister post, a period of 'cohabitation' with Macron would begin. That has happened three times in France's modern political history, but with mainstream parties. The RN could struggle to get reforms adopted.\n\nALSO READ | How France's snap legislative elections are shaping up\n\nIf the RN is the largest party in parliament, but is not in power, it could block or modify government proposals. The constitution gives the government some tools to circumvent that, but with limits.\n\nIf the RN secures a majority, it largely guarantees it getting the prime minister job as it could on its own force any government it disagrees with to resign.\n\nWHAT HAPPENS IF THERE IS NO DEAL?\n\nIt's possible that none of the three groups - the far-right, centrist and left - will be big enough to govern alone, reach a coalition deal or get assurances it can run a viable minority government.\n\nIn such a case, France would risk political paralysis, with little or no legislation being adopted and a caretaker government running basic daily affairs.\n\nCOULD MACRON RESIGN?\n\nMacron has ruled this out, but it could become an option if everything is blocked. Neither parliament nor the government could force him to do that.\n\nWHAT WON'T HAPPEN UNDER ANY SCENARIO\n\nThe constitution says there can be no new parliamentary election for another year, so an immediate repeat vote is not an option.\n\nWHAT ELSE SHOULD YOU KNOW?\n\nThe outcome of French parliamentary elections is hard to predict because they involve 577 separate contests, one per seat. An unusual, short campaign could mean the result differs from what surveys are projecting.", "source": {"uri": "indianexpress.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Indian Express"}, "authors": [{"uri": "reuters@indianexpress.com", "name": "Reuters", "type": "author", "isAgency": true}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Rally", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "National Rally"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Majority", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Majority"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emmanuel_Macron", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Emmanuel Macron"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prime_minister", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Prime minister"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constitution", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Constitution"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Opinion_poll", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Opinion poll"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/France", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "France"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Far-right_politics", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Far-right politics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Convention_on_Human_Rights", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "European Convention on Human Rights"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parliamentary_group", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Parliamentary group"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Norway", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Norway"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Norway"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jordan_Bardella", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Jordan Bardella"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minority_government", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Minority government"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Opposition_to_immigration", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Opposition to immigration"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Far-left_politics", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Far-left politics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Socialist_Party_(France)", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Socialist Party (France)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Greens", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Australian Greens"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Health_Organization", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "World Health Organization"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strike_action", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Strike action"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euroscepticism", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Euroscepticism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Belgium", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Belgium"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Belgium"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caretaker_government", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Caretaker government"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cohabitation_(government)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Cohabitation (government)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coalition_government", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Coalition government"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Centrism", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Centrism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parliament", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Parliament"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics", "wgt": 22}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Socialism", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Socialism", "wgt": 17}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Campaigns_and_Elections", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Campaigns and Elections", "wgt": 23}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Government_Operations", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Government Operations", "wgt": 19}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Online_Issues_Polls", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Online Issues Polls", "wgt": 19}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 56}], "image": "https://images.indianexpress.com/2024/06/emmanuel-macron.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9692876", "eventUri": "eng-9692876", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-07-07", "textStart": 499, "textEnd": 505}], "sentiment": 0.0117647058823529, "wgt": 134, "relevance": 1}

France is about to hold a snap elections to the National Assembly (the lower house of parliament), which distinctive feature is an extremely brief (less than three weeks) election campaign that would overlap with preparations for the Olympics due to kick off in Paris on July 26.\n\nA total of 577 seats are up for grabs for the centrist presidential coalition, the right-wing National Rally (RN) and the leftist New Popular Front.\n\nA candidate wins the seat if he or she secures a majority of votes in the first ballot. Only the candidates who garnered at least 12.5% of the votes in the first round are allowed to participate in the second one. Those win who secure more votes.\n\nFrench President Emmanuel Macron called a snap election on June 9 after the presidential coalition had been trounced in elections to the European Parliament.\n\nBy holding the snap parliamentary election, the French president hopes to expand the political base of the ruling bloc in order to ensure reliable support for his policies among lawmakers.\n\nHowever, the results of recent opinion polls do not show that Macron's supporters have been able to improve their ratings. According to the polls, the presidential coalition may come third, trailing behind both right-wing and left-wing opponents. The National Rally has a widening lead in the rankings, and is followed by New Popular Front, which is also ahead of the ruling party.\n\nAccording to political analysts, Macron supporters' performance was affected by the French people's discontent caused by economic woes and high inflation. The 2023 pension reform, which raised the retirement age from 62 to 64 years, was also unpopular and sparked mass protests among trade unions.\n\nIn addition, Paris' statements that there are no red lines in the Ukraine conflict, including the plans to deploy French soldiers to Ukraine and send missiles to Kiev, have gained no support either.\n\nFrance's top three political forces in the European Parliament elections are vying for 577 seats in the National Assembly.\n\nThe centrists, as during the European Parliament elections, have teamed up around the president. French Prime Minister Gabriel Attal, 35, tops the list of candidates.\n\nThe right-wing National Rally is led by Jordan Bardella, the 28-year-old leader of the party. Marine Le Pen nominated him as candidate for prime minister.\n\nThe coalition of leftist forces - the New Popular Front - brought together the party 'La France Insoumise' (France Unbowed) founded by Jean-Luc Melenchon, the Socialists led by Olivier Faure, Fabien Roussel's French Communist Party and the Green party led by Marine Tondelier.\n\nThe three blocs can nominate their leaders as prime minister. Under the constitution, the prime minister is appointed by the president, whose political future is not affected by the agenda of this election. Macron, who cannot run for a third term, has previously reiterated that he will remain in office until his term ends in 2027.", "source": {"uri": "tass.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "TASS"},

Voting in a number of overseas territories has already started.\n\nMacron called early elections after the far-right National Rally (RN) made large gains in elections to the European Parliament at the beginning of this month.\n\nThe RN is leading in pre-election polling ahead of the new leftist alliance, the New Popular Front (NPF), recently established to contest the elections. Renaissance is trailing in third place.\n\nIf the RN secures a majority in the 577-member National Assembly, Macron will be compelled to appoint a prime minister from its ranks to secure a stable cabinet.\n\nCandidates securing an absolute majority in the first round are elected to the assembly, but in most constituencies the victor will emerge only after the second round on July 7.\n\nMacron's second and final term in office ends in 2027. A sharp decline in support for Renaissance is certain to limit his effectiveness. The RN's Marine Le Pen is seen as a serious contender in the next presidential elections. - Bernama, dpa", "source": {"uri": "thesun.my", "dataType": "news", "title": "thesun.my"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Rally", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "National Rally"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emmanuel_Macron", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Emmanuel Macron"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plurality_(voting)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Plurality (voting)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Assembly_(France)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "National Assembly (France)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Renaissance", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Renaissance"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lower_house", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Lower house"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paris", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elections_to_the_European_Parliament", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Elections to the European Parliament"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/British_Overseas_Territories", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "British Overseas Territories"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Far-right_politics", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Far-right politics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Left-wing_politics", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Left-wing politics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Majority", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Majority"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bernama", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Bernama"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prime_minister", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Prime minister"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electoral_district", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Electoral district"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deutsche_Presse-Agentur", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Deutsche Presse-Agentur"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cabinet_(government)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Cabinet (government)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marine_Le_Pen", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Marine Le Pen"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Campaigns_and_Elections", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Campaigns and Elections", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Government/Parliaments_and_Legislatures", "label": "dmoz/Society/Government/Parliaments and Legislatures", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Democracy", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Democracy", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Online_Issues_Polls", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Online Issues Polls", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 58}], "image": "https://thesun.my/binrepository/480x320/0c35/480d250/none/11808/WOPQ/france-overseas-ncaledonia-politics-vote-060526_4307015_20240630144059.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9692876", "eventUri": "eng-9692876", "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-07-07", "textStart": 1099, "textEnd": 1105}], "sentiment": 0.2313725490196079, "wgt": 133, "relevance": 1}

Two years later, his home in Paris is attacked with a bomb. No culprit is ever found.\n\nLe Pen is unable to secure enough backers to run for the presidential election, won by leftist Fran\u00e7ois Mitterrand. In the following years, Le Pen gradually attracts new supporters.\n\nThe party wins its first seats in the National Assembly.\n\nLe Pen makes disparaging comments about gay men with AIDS, part of a lifelong tendency to spark outrage with racist, antisemitic and homophobic slurs that often land him in legal jeopardy but which win support among a part of the electorate.\n\nLe Pen wins 14.4% of votes in the presidential election. The following year, the National Front wins more than 10% of votes in European elections. It also begins to zero in on Islam and Muslim immigrants as one of its major political concerns.\n\nThe National Front wins three city halls in the south, Toulon, Orange and Marignane, underlining its growing electoral support.\n\nLe Pen runs for president and wins 16.86% of votes, enough to put him into a second-round run-off against Jacques Chirac. The strong showing sends shockwaves through France and there is widespread disgust that such a far-right party could do so well. Politicians from the right and left come together to prevent Le Pen from winning the second round. Chirac wins over 80% of votes in the run-off.\n\nA court hands Le Pen a three-month suspended prison sentence and a fine of 10,000 euros for saying the Nazi occupation of France was \"not particularly inhumane\".\n\nLe Pen's daughter Marine Le Pen becomes the new leader of the National Front after a period in which the party performs badly in polls and faces growing financial pressures.\n\nMarine Le Pen makes a first, unsuccessful run for the presidency.\n\nThe National Front has a breakthrough election year, winning control of 11 town halls and also taking first place in European Parliament elections.\n\nJean Marie Le Pen is suspended from the party after describing the Holocaust as \"a detail\" of World War Two. That same year, he is expelled by his daughter from the party.\n\nMarine Le Pen runs for the presidency again, but loses to Emmanuel Macron. After that she increases efforts to make the party more palatable to a wider electorate, seeking to distance it from its racist and antisemitic past, and also give its lawmakers a more professional veneer, with media training and a slick social media presence. In 2018, she changes the party's name to National Rally (RN).\n\nJordan Bardella, a 28-year-old protege of Marine Le Pen, is chosen to be the new president of the RN.\n\nBardella leads the party in the European Parliament elections, handing out a drubbing to Macron's party and prompting the president to call a snap legislative vote. Bardella is the RN's prime ministerial candidate.\n\n(Reporting by Gabriel StargardterEditing by Frances Kerry)", "source": {"uri": "theprint.in", "dataType": "news", "title": "ThePrint"}, "authors":

The RN, long a marginal force in French politics, now stands on the brink of a historic breakthrough, potentially securing a majority in the National Assembly. This development is not just a seismic shift for France but a moment of reckoning for Europe and democracies worldwide. The polls indicate that the RN could secure up to 37 per cent of the vote, a rise that reflects deep-seated discontent with the current political order. The centrist bloc, led by President Emmanuel Macron, appears to be losing ground, and the left-wing New Popular Front remains stagnant.\n\nThis fragmentation of traditional political forces underscores the growing polarisation in France. Several factors have contributed to this surge. Mr Macron's presidency, marked by probusiness reforms and a perceived aloofness from the struggles of ordinary citizens, has left many feeling alienated. Issues like the rising cost of living and deteriorating public services have created fertile ground for populist rhetoric. Ms Le Pen has skilfully capitalised on these grievances, softening the party's image and broadening its appeal beyond its traditional base. The implications of an RN-led government are profound. For France, it would mean a dramatic shift in domestic and foreign policy. Despite efforts to moderate its stance, the RN's core positions remain deeply Eurosceptic and nationalistic. A government led by the RN could strain France's relationship with the European Union, posing a significant challenge to the bloc's cohesion at a time when unity is crucial.\n\nThe RN's fiscal policies also raise concerns about economic stability, as promises of increased public spending clash with the need for fiscal responsibility. Moreover, the potential for political paralysis looms large. Should the RN fall short of an outright majority, France could face a hung Parliament. This scenario would lead to a fraught \"cohabitation\" between Mr Macron and an emboldened far-right, creating legislative gridlock and undermining effective governance. The stakes are high, and the uncertainty is palpable. The rise of the RN is not an isolated phenomenon. Across Europe and beyond, far-right and populist movements are gaining traction, fuelled by economic anxiety, cultural shifts, and a sense of disenfranchisement. This trend poses a direct challenge to the liberal democratic order established after World War II.\n\nIt calls into question the effectiveness of mainstream political parties in addressing the needs and concerns of constituents. The outcome of France's Parliamentary elections will resonate far beyond its borders. It is a pivotal contest that could reshape the country's future and alter the trajectory of European politics. The rise of the RN reflects broader global trends that challenge the foundations of democracy and demand a renewed commitment to addressing the root causes of populism.

In the immediate aftermath, Macron dissolved the French parliament and announced snap legislative elections, the first round of which take place today.

If they win, political paralysis may ensue, complicated by President Macron's choice of prime minister. If no coalition or minority government forms, France risks political stagnation. The unpredictable outcome could shape future governance.\n\nFrance voted on Sunday in the first round of a snap parliamentary election which opinion polls forecast the far-right National Rally could win without an absolute majority. What happens then, and can political paralysis be avoided after the election, the second round of which is on July 7?\n\nSHORT ANSWER: NO ONE KNOWS FOR SURE Article 8 of the constitution says the president appoints the prime minister, but does not say which criteria he should use.\n\nIn practice, President Emmanuel Macron would be expected to offer the job to the leading parliamentary group - which opinion polls suggest will be the eurosceptic, anti-immigration National Rally (RN). RN CHIEF BARDELLA TO BE PRIME MINISTER?\n\nThe RN has said party leader Jordan Bardella is its candidate for prime minister but has also said it will turn down the job if it and its allies together do not win an absolute majority of at least 289 seats. Since the constitution does not say how he should choose his prime minister, Macron could in any case, in theory, try to pull together an anti-RN alliance and offer the job to another party, or someone who is not politically affiliated.\n\nIF NOT BARDELLA, WHO? The constitution does not provide any specific answer.\n\nOptions would include: - trying to strike an alliance of mainstream parties. No such alliance exists now but Macron has urged parties to unite to keep out the far-right.\n\n- offering the job to the left, if an alliance including the far-left, Socialist Party and Greens emerges as the second-biggest group, as opinion polls suggest. The left could then try to form a minority government. WOULD ANY OF THOSE OPTIONS WORK?\n\nIf the RN wins the highest share of the vote and accepts the prime minister post, a period of 'cohabitation' with Macron would begin. That has happened three times in France's modern political history, but with mainstream parties. The RN could struggle to get reforms adopted. If the RN is the largest party in parliament, but is not in power, it could block or modify government proposals. The constitution gives the government some tools to circumvent that, but with limits.\n\nIf the RN secures a majority, it largely guarantees it getting the prime minister job as it could on its own force any government it disagrees with to resign. WHAT HAPPENS IF THERE IS NO DEAL?\n\nIt's possible that none of the three groups - the far-right, centrist and left - will be big enough to govern alone, reach a coalition deal or get assurances it can run a viable minority government. In such a case, France would risk political paralysis, with little or no legislation being adopted and a caretaker government running basic daily affairs.\n\nCOULD MACRON RESIGN? Macron has ruled this out, but it could become an option if everything is blocked. Neither parliament nor the government could force him to do that.\n\nWHAT WON'T HAPPEN UNDER ANY SCENARIO The constitution says there can be no new parliamentary election for another year, so an immediate repeat vote is not an option.\n\nWHAT ELSE SHOULD YOU KNOW? The outcome of French parliamentary elections is hard to predict because they involve 577 separate contests, one per seat. An unusual, short campaign could mean the result differs from what surveys are projecting.

But he will have to pick a prime minister from the party or alliance with the most seats in the National Assembly, regardless of how divergent their policies are from his own.\n\nHere are some of the key party figureheads in the campaign:\n\nThe sharp-suited Bardella, 28, has Italian roots. He was raised by his mother in social housing in the hardscrabble northern outskirts of Paris but attended a semi-private Catholic school.\n\nHis working class background has become a selling point. \"I'm in politics for everything I lived through back there,\" he told newspaper Le Monde.\n\nBardella joined Marine Le Pen's far-right party aged 16. Seven years later, Le Pen picked him to lead her party's charge in the 2019 European elections. Members elected him party president in November 2022.\n\nThe battle-hardened Le Pen and youthful, sharp-witted Bardella have formed a formidable political tag team. Bardella has used his TikTok account, which has 1.7 million followers, to attract younger, social media-savvy voters.\n\nThe pair have broadened the party's appeal beyond its historic redoubts of the Mediterranean coast and the northern rust belt, pitching it as a defender of family incomes, jobs and French identity.\n\nBardella casts himself as a potential \"prime minister for purchasing power\", pledging to cut VAT on power and fuel and scrap income tax for the under-30s. His opponents say he lacks professional experience, having gone into politics at a young age, and that his economic plans are unrealistic.\n\nAt 35, Gabriel Attal became France's youngest post-war prime minister when Macron appointed him in January.\n\nSometimes dubbed \"baby Macron\", Attal faces the daunting task of saving his boss's presidency and political movement.\n\nDisaffected voters nationwide are shifting support to the far right and a new left-wing alliance in anger at Macron's policies and personality, with the president often perceived as arrogant and disconnected from daily hardships.\n\nAttal is France's first openly gay prime minister.\n\nHis political rise has been meteoric under Macron. Having joined the Socialist Party aged 17, he became a household name in French politics after being named government spokesman during the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nAttal went on to serve as budget minister and spent a few months at the helm of the education ministry before Macron made him head of government in an attempt to fend off the far-right.\n\nAttal's first move as education minister in 2023 was to ban the Muslim abaya in state schools, earning himself a popularity boost among conservative voters despite hailing from the left.\n\nThere is no single obvious contender to be prime minister on the left, where a wide range of parties have formed a New Popular Front (NFP) in an attempt to join forces against the RN.\n\nThe NFP has not said who would be its pick for prime minister. The following are some of its best-known figures:\n\nJEAN-LUC MELENCHON, HARD-LEFT FRANCE UNBOWED PARTY\n\nMelenchon, 72, has been a fixture in French left-wing politics for decades and held ministerial posts in past governments, when he was a member of the Socialist Party.\n\nHe ran for president in 2012, 2017 and 2022, improving his score each time. He came third in 2022, just behind far-right leader Marine Le Pen. Macron won that election.\n\nA fiery orator, Melenchon is one of the most divisive figures in French politics, enthusing and horrifying voters with his unbridled tax-and-spend proposals, class war rhetoric and controversial foreign policy positions, especially on Gaza. Critics accuse him of antisemitism, which he denies.\n\nGlucksmann, 44, headed the Socialist list of candidates in the European elections this month. It obtained nearly 14% of the vote, just behind Macron's Together group. This was considered a sign of revival for a party that governed France in past decades but had recently fallen into electoral oblivion.\n\nThe son of a philosopher, Glucksmann attended prestigious schools and had a career in journalism and broadcasting before branching out in a variety of directions, including being an adviser to then Georgian president Mikheil Saakashvili.\n\nHe advocates strong European support for Ukraine in its resistance against Russia's invasion.\n\nBerger, 55, is a former head of one of France's main trade unions, the moderate CFDT. He has a track record of strong opposition to the far-right RN.\n\nBerger has said he does not want to be prime minister, but others on the left have put his name forward, saying he could be a unifying figure and a popular alternative to Melenchon.\n\n(Reporting by Richard Lough and Estelle Shirbon; Editing by Janet Lawrence)", "source": {"uri": "theprint.in", "dataType": "news", "title":

If the opinion polls are correct Marine Le Pen's National Rally will be the big winner in the first round of the parliamentary elections. A poll on Friday had the NR on 36.5 per cent - seven and a half per cent ahead of the left-wing Popular Front coalition, with Emmanuel Macron's centrist union third on 20.5 per cent of the vote share.\n\nThe polls were spot on at the start of the month, predicting a landslide victory for the NR in the European elections that duly transpired - so it seems probable that once again one in three voters will cast their ballot for a party that was formerly called the National Front. Its former leader Jean-Marie Le Pen is still alive but no longer capable of managing his own affairs after suffering a heart attack in 2023. Earlier this year he was placed under the legal protection of his three daughters: Marie-Caroline, Yann and Marine.\n\nWhen Le Pen does finally expire there will be many on the left who celebrate, as they did in Britain in 2013 when Margaret Thatcher died. He is without a doubt the most reviled politician of the Fifth Republic - but Jean-Marie Le Pen is also one of its most influential. None of what Marine Le Pen has achieved would have been possible without her father. He helped found the National Front in 1972, as a party that spoke for the white working-class - a demographic he sensed was being marginalised by a political class that was becoming more bourgeois and more European.\n\nLast year the radio station France Culture broadcast a seven-part series examining the life of Jean-Marie Le Pen, entitled 'The National Obsession'. It was for the most part a balanced biography, drawing on the observations of historians and journalists to chart Le Pen's rise from the son of a fisherman to a presidential candidate. The final episode included an excerpt from a speech made by Charles de Gaulle (described as Le Pen's 'mortal enemy') at the Royal Albert Hall in November 1941: 'We are French people of all origins, all conditions, all opinions, who have decided to unite in the fight for our country. All have done so voluntarily, purely and simply.' The point the programme wanted to make was that de Gaulle unified France while Le Pen divided it through his bigotry.\n\nLe Pen was indeed a divisive man who disparaged Jews, Muslims and others he considered un-French. That was the reason he was unable to break down the 'cordon sanitaire' erected by the political class after his party polled 14.5 per cent in the 1988 presidential election. He claimed the result would herald a 'radical transformation' of French politics, but it didn't. Nor was there any transformation in 2002 when Le Pen stunned France by reaching the second round of the presidential election. There should have been change, prompted by soul-searching on the part of the ruling elite as to why the National Front had polled 4.8 million votes.\n\nInstead, the incumbent president, Jacques Chirac, refused to meet Le Pen in the traditional television debate before the second round of voting. It would not be possible, said Chirac, to have 'a debate worthy of democracy'. So much for de Gaulle's depiction of France as a nation where 'people of all origins, conditions and opinions' are considered equal. That was certainly not the case in 21st Century France. Refusing to engage with Le Pen in 2002 was Chirac's first error; his second was to ignore the result of the 2005 Referendum on the European Constitution. 55 per cent of French voted no to the Constitution. But the political class, which was overwhelmingly in favour, ratified it anyway. They assumed the people would shrug and soon forget this act of monumental treachery.\n\nJean-Marie Le Pen was one of the few political figures who campaigned for the 'no' vote. In a speech shortly before the referendum he declared that 'France is on the brink of economic, social, political and moral bankruptcy.' He blamed mass immigration and mass deindustrialisation. The former he described as 'that taboo subject that no one dares talk about for fear of being demonised', but Le Pen warned that the migrants arriving in Europe 'are only the vanguard of a tidal wave that is already swelling around the world with misery, overpopulation and the wild hope of El Dorado'.\n\nAs for deindustrialisation, Le Pen said that since the 1970s, France's industrial workforce had halved from six to three million, and the decline would continue as China grew in strength. 'Europe is not about prosperity, full employment and social progress,' said Le Pen. 'It's about unemployment, job insecurity, relocations and the destruction of French businesses.' Le Pen cited a couple of statistics to support his claim: France's public deficit in 2004 had increased to 3.7 per cent of GDP, and the public debt now stood at 65.6 per cent of GDP. Twenty years later, France's budget deficit is 5.5 per cent and its public debt is 112.4 per cent.\n\nChirac's third error has been inherited by all his predecessors: Nicolas Sarkozy, Francois Hollande and Emmanuel Macron. They assumed that the National Front would remain a protest party incapable of breaking through the cordon sanitaire into the mainstream. Jean-Marie Le Pen's boast of 'radically transforming' French politics never came to fruition because his rhetoric and his personality were too confrontational.\n\nHis daughter has learned from her father's flaws. On succeeding him as president in January 2011 she set about 'de-demonising' the party; in other words, making it more respectable, particularly for the middle-class. There is no longer any shame about voting for a party she renamed the National Rally in 2018. Marine Le Pen has also prospered from the mistakes of her political opponents, whose only response to the rise of the National Rally is to insult and belittle its voters.\n\nYet no one has been as helpful to Le Pen as Emmanuel Macron. When he called the snap election three weeks ago he assumed with his customary arrogance that the country would rally to the president. But if the polls are right, it's the National Rally to whom they'll rally. Never was a political party more aptly named.", "source": {"uri": "spectator.us", "dataType": "news", "title": "Spectator USA"}, "authors": [{"uri": "gavin_mortimer@spectator.us", "name": "Gavin

No such alliance exists now but Macron has urged parties to unite to keep out the far-right.\n\n- offering the job to the left, if an alliance including the far-left, Socialist Party and Greens emerges as the second-biggest group, as opinion polls suggest. The left could then try to form a minority government.\n\nIf the RN wins the highest share of the vote and accepts the prime minister post, a period of 'cohabitation' with Macron would begin. That has happened three times in France's modern political history, but with mainstream parties.

It has evolved, adapted and endured. But it could face its most severe test yet as a result of President Emmanuel Macron's extraordinary decision to call a snap national election, to be held over two rounds on this Sunday, 30 June, and a week later on 7 July.\n\nThe map of European countries that have always been democracies since the end of the Second World War mostly just covers a few constitutional monarchies in north-west Europe and Scandinavia. West Germany, for example, did not become a fully sovereign state until 1955 and the French Fourth Republic collapsed in 1958.\n\nIts Parliament dissolved itself, leaving General De Gaulle to write a new constitution, because the French Army had made it clear that otherwise there would be a military coup. In effect it was a military coup, albeit a swift and bloodless one. De Gaulle disappointed some of his fellow Generals by devising a new Fifth Republic that would free its colonies and become an enduring a democracy.\n\nIf it survives for another four years, it will become the longest-lasting French Republic. But will it? It's been through a lot, with its President for 14 years, the Socialist Fran\u00e7ois Mitterrand, first appointing Communists to his government and later 'cohabiting' with a Gaullist Prime Minister.\n\nIn this century, the republic has relied on 'Republican Solidarity' to endure. That's a grand term for a political deal, the understanding that the parties now known as the Republicans (heirs to the Gaullists) and the Socialists, plus President Macron's centrist Ensemble alliance, will back one another rather than give the far-right or far-left a taste of power.\n\nMost obviously, Marine Le Pen, like her father before her, was defeated when she reached the second round of Presidential elections and faced a single opponent, as only the top two candidates aren't eliminated after the first round. In a National Assembly election, any candidate who secured at least 12.5% of the vote in the first round can stay in the fight -or can withdraw in favour of a better placed candidate in line with the principle of Republican Solidarity.\n\nThe effectiveness of that principle is about to be tested as never before. If the polls are even roughly accurate, Le Pen's National Rally will win the first round of the snap National Assembly election. Its triumph in France in the European election led to Emmanuel Macron's gamble that enough French voters will come to their senses, as he sees it, leaving room for Republican Solidarity to kick in for the second round.\n\nMarine Le Pen's prot\u00e9g\u00e9, Jordan Bardella, has stated that he will only become Prime Minister if the National Rally wins an absolute parliamentary majority -at least 289 seats- over the two rounds of the election. Of course, in saying that, he wants to maximise his party's support in order to win as many seats outright as possible in the first round, as a candidate who gets more than half the vote is elected without a second-round vote week later.\n\nBut in a second round the National Rally's candidates will likely most often be up against the New Popular Front. It's in second place in the polls and embraces most of political spectrum from centre-left to far(ish)-left, with Greens and regionalist parties included. Big losers will be Macron's centrist Ensemble, likely to finish third. Even if the President successfully orders his candidates to withdraw in favour of the left, there's no guarantee that their voters will follow orders.\n\nThe Republicans appear to be heading for a rather distant fourth place. Both its politicians and its voters are divided over whether their next step should be to throw their lot in with Le Pen or to stay true to Republican Solidarity. Perhaps Macron half-expects to be forced into 'cohabitation' with a National Rally prime minister and hopes the experience of having the party in government will dissuade votes from choosing Marine Le Pen as his successor in the 2027 presidential election.\n\nThat is the size of his gamble. He hasn't just bet the farm -his presidency and his legacy- on the outcome of a National Assembly election that he did not have to call, he's bet the French Fifth Republic itself.", "source": {"uri":

No such alliance exists now but Macron has urged parties to unite to keep out the far-right.\n\n- offering the job to the left, if an alliance including the far-left, Socialist Party and Greens emerges as the second-biggest group, as opinion polls suggest. The left could then try to form a minority government.\n\nWOULD ANY OF THOSE OPTIONS WORK?\n\nIf the RN wins the highest share of the vote and accepts the prime minister post, a period of 'cohabitation' with Macron would begin. That has happened three times in France's modern political history, but with mainstream parties. The RN could struggle to get reforms adopted.\n\nIf the RN is the largest party in parliament, but is not in power, it could block or modify government proposals.

The 577 deputies are directly elected for five years and vote on laws. There is also a second chamber of parliament, the Senate, which plays a secondary role and is elected at a different time.\n\nIf the chambers cannot agree, the government can give the National Assembly the final say on legislation. Macron's centrist alliance held the most seats in the National Assembly before it was dissolved, but not an absolute majority.\n\nHow important is a majority for Macron?\n\nThe last two years have been plagued by bickering and infighting, showing that governing without an absolute majority in the National Assembly is difficult.\n\nBut a majority would be particularly important for Macron for one big reason: The lower house can topple the government with a vote of no confidence.\n\nShould a camp other than Macron's receive an absolute majority, which polls believe is possible, the president would therefore effectively be forced to appoint a head of government from their ranks.\n\nThe far-right nationalists have hopes of coming into government. Even if Macron's own job is not at stake in the election, his position would be significantly weakened in such a scenario.\n\nHow does the election work?\n\nThe lawmakers are elected directly by the people in their district.\n\nWhoever receives more than half of the votes cast in their constituency on Sunday wins a seat in parliament - provided this corresponds to at least a quarter of the registered voters there.\n\nBut very few will manage this feat in the first round.\n\nMost seats are allocated in a run-off election a week later. That's when the top two vote-getters will face off, along with any other candidate that received the support of at least 12.5% of all registered voters in the district.\n\nIf several candidates make it through to the run-off, it is common for contenders to drop out of the race. This tactic has been used to consolidate voters and block victories by far-right candidates.\n\nWhen will the results be known?\n\nSince members of parliament are elected district-by-district - not on the basis of proportional representation - there is no official national-level result.\n\nNevertheless, election analysts will add up all the ballots cast in the individual constituencies to come up with a percentage breakdown of voter support for each party or political alliance.\n\nBut as virtually no seats are allocated in the first round and the political winds can change in the second round, it is difficult to draw any conclusions from this result.\n\nThe unusual nature of a snap election in France makes predicting the final outcome even harder. That's because normally parliamentary elections quickly follow a presidential election - and support for parties largely mirrors each other in each election.", "source": {"uri": "yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emmanuel_Macron", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Emmanuel Macron"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Assembly_(France)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "National Assembly (France)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parliament", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Parliament"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Majority", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Majority"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Centrism", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Centrism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Far-right_politics", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Far-right politics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elections_to_the_European_Parliament", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Elections to the European Parliament"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assembly_of_the_Republic_(Portugal)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Assembly of the Republic (Portugal)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Direct_election", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Direct election"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/French_Parliament", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "French Parliament"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Senate", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Australian Senate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Two-round_system", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Two-round system"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lower_house", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Lower house"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/France", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "France"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Motion_of_no_confidence", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Motion of no confidence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nationalism", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Nationalism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Member_of_parliament", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Member of parliament"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Snap_election", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Snap election"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proportional_representation", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Proportional representation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parliamentary_group", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Parliamentary group"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electoral_district", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Electoral district"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Campaigns_and_Elections", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Campaigns and Elections", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Government/Parliaments_and_Legislatures", "label": "dmoz/Society/Government/Parliaments and Legislatures", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Democracy", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Democracy", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Online_Issues_Polls", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Online Issues Polls", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 87}], "image": "https://media.zenfs.com/en/dpa_international_526/fdca07f65de0e943ef085706f31dd867", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9692876", "eventUri": "eng-9692876", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.03529411764705892, "wgt": 121, "relevance": 1}

The outcome of the election will probably remain unknown till next week's second round.\n\nBut while in all previous elections, voters from across the political spectrum have rallied against the far right, this will probably not be the case this time round due to the inroads made by National Rally among conservative voters who previously backed the centre right Republicans. The embattled leader of the Republicans, Eric Ciotti, broke with tradition earlier this month to back the National Rally's bid to power.\n\nThis suggests President Emmanuel Macron's gamble to call an immediate election after his party's debacle in the European Parliament election and turn it into a stark choice between his centrist 'together' movement and the far right has not paid off. A quickly assembled coalition of socialist, communist and green parties has emerged as the main alternative to the far right.\n\nThe election will be a major test for Marine Le Pen's 'de-demonisation' strategy which saw the party widening its appeal by abandoning her father (and party founder) Jean Marie Le Pen thuggish antics and presenting the 28-year-old Jordan Bardella as the party's poster boy candidate for prime minister, without diluting the party's anti-immigrant and overtly nationalistic platform.\n\nThe far-right paradox\n\nMaria Pisani, a human rights activist and academic is sceptical of the de-demonisation strategy, noting that the National Rally's platform is \"unapologetically anti-immigrant and far right\". Its values remain antithetical to European values like human rights, she says.\n\n\"The fact that we are talking of a possible far right victory in one of Europe's biggest economies speaks volumes on the dire times we live in... this was unimaginable just a decade ago,\" she notes.\n\nShe adds that the party's \"fetish\" for the nation state is paradoxical in a world transformed by neo liberal globalisation.\n\n\"They try to give the impression that by voting for them people can regain control over their lives but what they are offering is not actual control but an illusion of being in control,\" Pisani says.\n\nThe only way through which people can have control over corporations, she adds, is through greater international cooperation on planetary issues like climate change.\n\nPisani also fears that migrants are once again being used as a scapegoat for problems created by neo liberalism for which the far right does not have answers.\n\nShe also notes that the EU's green new deal and measures aimed at addressing climate change have joined immigration as the b\u00eate noire of the right.\n\n\"This is paradoxical especially when one considers that climate change is one of the reasons contributing to forced migration from regions suffering the brunt of climate change,\" she says.\n\nPisani is apprehensive on the global impact of a far-right victory in France. \"This is not happening in a vacuum especially when one considers the increased likelihood of a Trump victory in the USA.\"\n\nThis right-wing drift is bound to have implications on major decisions on climate change and the response to the Russian invasion of Ukraine.\n\nThe far right's inroads among centrist voters\n\nNationalist MP and former minister Carmelo Mifsud Bonnici, while critical of the National Rally's anti-immigrant drift, is less dismissive of Jordan Bardella's inroads among moderate voters who traditionally voted for the centre-right.\n\nHe thinks that Marine Le Pen and Jordan Bardella are appealing to voters who reject unrestrained laissez faire economics, thus occupying a niche vacated by the political centre which has been too keen on embracing the market.\n\nBut Mifsud Bonnici is still concerned by Le Pen's divisive message. \"The question remains; is this a convenient make over or a move to a more social conscious and moderate right?\"\n\nHe describes Macron's decision to call snap elections in the aftermath of the European election as a \"rushed\" one which is likely to backfire on the political centre. \"The gamble has failed as instead of affirming the strength of the political centre it has polarised the electorate between two strong blocks: A right wing one which includes far right elements and a left wing one which includes the far left.\"\n\nBut he does not exclude that in a hung parliament, the traditional parties of the centre left (the socialists) and the centre right (the republicans) may reclaim their autonomy and create a new centrist alignment.\n\nHe also notes that Macron's presidency is becoming increasingly chaotic adding that even some of Macron's lieutenants who have ambitions of their own are now considering the President's brand toxic.\n\n\"The decline had started even before his 2022 victory over Le Pen, which was narrower than that in 2017, but now we have entered a phase of accelerated decline,\" Mifsud Bonnici says.\n\nHe also believes that the National Rally is also successfully courting the Catholic traditionalist vote alienated by Macron's decision to entrench abortion rights in the French constitution, even if Marine Le Pen herself has threaded carefully on this issue not to alienate more liberal voters. In fact, Le Pen had voted in favour of the constitutional change proposed by Macron while arguing that it was unnecessary.\n\nThe most crucial post war election\n\nAuthor and broadcaster Charles Xuereb, describes today's election as one of the most crucial post-war elections in French history which could have \"extremely tough\" implications and may even produce a hung parliament.\n\nHe also sees a risk that the result could dent Macron's stature on the European stage especially if he is forced to consider cohabitation with the extreme right.\n\nBut he also notes that Macron will still be President until 2027 even if his party loses.\n\n\"Certainly, it is the personal relation between the two that determines the success of cohabitation... the president has room to manoeuvre to oppose the prime minister, without going too far,\" Xuereb says, quoting legal expert Didier Maus, in Le Figaro this week.\n\nXuereb also thinks that when calling a snap election, Macron was also banking on the feel good atmosphere in Paris, with the Tour de France starting yesterday, the possibility of France's Euro football team advancing to reach the finals on 14 July, which is French National Day, and the upcoming windfall of the Olympic Games in less than a month.\n\nHe also notes growing apprehension on the electoral promises of both the far right and the far left. Bardella is promising to immediately lower the level of VAT on energy bills and fuel, concede tax breaks, to raise salaries by 10% and reverse Macron's pension reform.\n\n\"Details on financial arrangements, however, remain vague,\" Xuereb says.\n\nBut according to Xuereb the most contentious proposal made by the National Rally is abolishing the right to French nationality for those born to foreign parents on French soil.\n\nBut even the left-wing New Popular Front is creating shockwaves by promising to raise the minimum wage by 13%, bring back the wealth tax, cap energy prices and reverse pensions to start at 60 down from 66, as legislated recently.\n\n\"The business lobby exclaimed that this is madness, even when compared to NF's proposals,\" Xuereb says.\n\nBut he also sees signs of hope for the embattled French President. \"Last Thursday there was a huge demonstration for Libert\u00e9! in Paris attended by many NGOs, including women's, anti-racist and ecological movements, and this offers a ray of hope for Macron.\"\n\nThe demonstrators warned that the extreme right would govern by fear and encouraged the public not to abstain, using the slogan Nous, on vote!\"\n\nBut surveys, \"which could go wrong, appear to show that voters have forgotten Macron's attainments when inflation and joblessness as well as energy bills during the pandemic were brought down\".\n\nThe French electoral system explained\n\nToday the French will be electing the members of the national assembly and will not be electing a new President.\n\nEmmanuel Macron whose term will expire in 2027 will remain in charge of national security and foreign policy.\n\nHe will also have the power to name the next prime minister but crucially the latter will also have to enjoy a majority in the national assembly.\n\nThe outcome of the election will not be determined today because French elections are determined in two rounds of voting.\n\nToday French voters will mark their preferred candidate contesting their constituency with an \"X\". Those candidates who win 50% or more of the vote are immediately elected. But in those constituencies were none of the candidates manage to garner such a majority, the top two candidates and any other candidate who got the support of at least 12.5% of registered voters will go to a second ballot due on 7 July. The candidate with the most votes in the second round will become a member of parliament. The system is meant to favour mainstream parties who enjoy broad support.\n\nIn past elections it also meant that parties from the left to the centre right would unite to block the election of the far right to parliament. But this seems more unlikely in this election, in which a significant part of the centre-right Republicans including party leader Ciotti are backing Bardella's party.", "source": {"uri":

President Emmanuel Macron reacted immediately by calling a national vote and stunning his country.A high turnout is expected among 49 million voters for such a pivotal election and polls close in the big cities at 20:00 (18:00GMT), when the first exit polls come out.This is a two-round election, and most of the National Assembly's 577 seats will not be decided until the second-round run-off vote next Sunday.The campaign only lasted 20 days, and that also benefited RN, which quickly refined its existing promises on immigration, insecurity as well as tax cuts to tackle the cost-of-living crisis.Jordan Bardella wants to be RN's first prime minister, and his party is confident of winning dozens of constituencies outright in the first round.But he says he will only take the job if the party secures an absolute parliamentary majority of 289 seats. The alternative would be a hung parliament and stalemate.As soon as the first results come in on Sunday evening, National Rally's opponents will have to decide who to back in run-off battles across France, in a bid to ensure that absolute majority does not happen. THOMAS SAMSON/POOL/AFP If the polls are right, many of the run-offs will pit the National Rally against a hastily cobbled together left-wing alliance called New Popular Front, which believes it could even win the election.But because of the expected high turnout, three parties could qualify for the second-round battles in as many as 250 constituencies, according to Brice Teinturier of Ipsos polling institute.In previous e ...", "source": {"uri": "rocketnews.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "RocketNews | Top News Stories From Around the Globe"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Rally", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "National Rally"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Two-round_system", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Two-round system"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jordan_Bardella", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Jordan Bardella"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elections_to_the_European_Parliament", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Elections to the European Parliament"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BBC_News", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "BBC News"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_election", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "General election"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emmanuel_Macron", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Emmanuel Macron"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Far-right_politics", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Far-right politics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marine_Le_Pen", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Marine Le Pen"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paris", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exit_poll", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Exit poll"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prime_minister", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Prime minister"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voter_turnout", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Voter turnout"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immigration", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Immigration"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Majority_government", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Majority government"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hung_parliament", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Hung parliament"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ipsos", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Ipsos"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Majority", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Majority"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electoral_district", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Electoral district"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Left-wing_politics", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Left-wing politics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agence_France-Presse", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Agence France-Presse"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/France", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "France"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Campaigns_and_Elections", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Campaigns and Elections", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Government/Parliaments_and_Legislatures", "label": "dmoz/Society/Government/Parliaments and Legislatures", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Democracy", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Democracy", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Online_Issues_Polls", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Online Issues Polls", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 92}], "image": null, "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9692876", "eventUri": "eng-9692876", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.411764705882353, "wgt": 120, "relevance": 1}

Traditionally, the president holds sway over foreign policy, defense, and EU appointments, areas now contested by Le Pen.\n\nIn a recent interview, Le Pen underscored her intent to wield substantial influence, questioning Macron's authority as commander-in-chief and emphasizing the prime minister's role in pivotal decisions such as military deployments, notably concerning Ukraine. Macron, known for his pro-Ukraine stance amid tensions with Russia, faces opposition from Le Pen, who has historically leaned towards Kremlin-friendly policies.\n\nThe contest extends beyond defense. Le Pen has also challenged Macron's prerogative to appoint France's European commissioner, a critical position influencing EU policy and economic strategy.\n\nConstitutional scholars point to inherent ambiguities in France's separation of powers, where presidential authority intersects with prime ministerial governance, especially concerning budgetary control and policy implementation. This complexity threatens to stall decision-making, with potential implications for France's stability and international relations.\n\nWith election dynamics evolving, Macron's camp defends constitutional norms, invoking the legacy of Charles de Gaulle to underscore presidential responsibilities. Meanwhile, Le Pen's National Rally, emboldened by electoral gains, prepares to assert its influence, setting the stage for a contentious period in French politics and its global ramifications.\n\nAs Sunday's election approaches, the clash between Macron and Le Pen over executive authority portends a pivotal juncture for France, raising concerns within the EU and NATO about the nation's future strategic course amid political upheaval.", "source": {"uri": "naija247news.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Naija247news"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marine_Le_Pen", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Marine Le Pen"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emmanuel_Macron", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Emmanuel Macron"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/France", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "France"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Rally", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "National Rally"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foreign_policy", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Foreign policy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Separation_of_powers", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Separation of powers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prime_minister", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Prime minister"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Union", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "European Union"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paris", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commander-in-chief", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Commander-in-chief"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Commission", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "European Commission"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ukraine", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Ukraine"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Ukraine"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russia", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Russia"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Russia"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Politics_of_France", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Politics of France"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Executive_(government)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Executive (government)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_de_Gaulle", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Charles de Gaulle"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NATO", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "NATO"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Government", "label": "dmoz/Society/Government", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Campaigns_and_Elections", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Campaigns and Elections", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Democracy", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Democracy", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Activism/Petitions", "label": "dmoz/Society/Activism/Petitions", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 91}], "image": "https://naija247news.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/NewLogoNaija2021-1.png", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9692876", "eventUri": "eng-9692876", "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.01960784313725483, "wgt": 117, "relevance": 1}

The alternative would be a hung parliament and stalemate.As soon as the first results come in on Sunday evening, National Rally's opponents will have to decide who to back in run-off battles across France, in a bid to ensure that absolute majority does not happen. THOMAS SAMSON/POOL/AFP If the polls are right, many of the run-offs will pit the National Rally against a hastily cobbled together left-wing alliance called New Popular Front, which believes it could even win the election.In previous elections, parties from across the spectrum have united to keep the far right out and voters have held their noses to do so.But RN's leaders have worked hard for years to shed their extremist image.

It also wants to \"immediately recognize the Palestinian state\" and stop \"the French government's guilty support\" for Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's government.

The centrist, pro-EU and pro-NATO alliance aims to make France's economy and workforce more competitive. The alliance is a staunch supporter of Ukraine's fight against Russian forces. It currently holds 250 seats.\n\nThe center-right Republicans are pro-business, but they're a party that has shrunk massively after ruling France for decades. Currently, they hold 61 seats.\n\nMarine Le Pen's far-right National Rally, projected to win the most number of seats this election, is anti-immigration and anti-EU. The coalition is known to have political and financial ties to Russia. It currently holds 88 seats.

In a multiparty system like France's, these two conditions mean a second round of voting will most likely happen in some constituencies on July 7.Only those candidates who will secure at least 12.5% of the vote in the first round can compete in the second one, which effectively narrows the field of contestants.A popular French saying says: \"In the first round you vote with your heart, in the second - with your head.\"'Cohabitation'If a political force other than Macron's center-right alliance gets a majority, he will have to appoint a prime minister belonging to that bloc - a situation called \"cohabitation\" in France.Under cohabitation, the French government would implement policies that diverge from the president's stance.What Do Party Leaders Say Macron, for his part, confirmed he would not step down if his party suffers in the vote, adding that he \"does not intend to campaign more than [he did] in 2017 and 2022.\"", "source": {"uri": "sputnikglobe.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Sputnik International"}, "authors": [{"uri": "oleg_burunov@sputnikglobe.com", "name": "Oleg Burunov", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Rally", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "National Rally"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Assembly_(France)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "National Assembly (France)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/French_language", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "French language"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Far-right_politics", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Far-right politics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marine_Le_Pen", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Marine Le Pen"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Centre-right_politics", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Centre-right politics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Majority", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Majority"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multi-party_system", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Multi-party system"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emmanuel_Macron", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Emmanuel Macron"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voter_turnout", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Voter turnout"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electoral_district", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Electoral district"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Left-wing_politics", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Left-wing politics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paris", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/France", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "France"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cohabitation_(government)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Cohabitation (government)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Government_of_France", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Government of France"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prime_minister", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Prime minister"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Campaigns_and_Elections", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Campaigns and Elections", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Activism/Strategies", "label": "dmoz/Society/Activism/Strategies", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Democracy", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Democracy", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Online_Issues_Polls", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Online Issues Polls", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 86}], "image": "https://cdn1.img.sputnikglobe.com/images/sharing/article/eng/1119181687.jpg?10545789921719720064", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9692876", "eventUri": "eng-9692876", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-06-30", "textStart": 164, "textEnd": 171}, {"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-07-07", "textStart": 997, "textEnd": 1003}], "sentiment": 0.5450980392156863, "wgt": 112, "relevance": 1}

Official results, published by the Interior Ministry, will come in throughout the night.\n\nHere is what to expect.\n\nThe voting happens in two rounds, and participation is expected to be high.\n\nFrance's 577 electoral districts -- one for each seat -- cover the mainland, overseas departments and territories, and French citizens living abroad.

The party's 28-year-old MEP Jordan Bardella is in the running to become France's youngest ever Prime Minister.\n\nThe National Rally's Jordan Bardella is likely to be appointed as the next Prime Minister if his party secure an absolute majority. Alamy Alamy\n\nCandidates must earn at least 12.5% of the votes from their constituencies to retain their place in the race. Any candidate with more than 50% of the vote after the first round is automatically elected.\n\nThe remaining candidates then go through into the second round. In France there is one seat per constituency and often three or four people are left in the race after the first round.\n\nThe candidates with the highest percentage of votes after the second round are then elected to the National Assembly.\n\nFrench citizens living in Ireland who are registered to vote can do so at one of three polling stations, two in Dublin and one in Cork. Online voting and polls in the country's oversea territories opened for a day earlier this week.\n\nAs France votes electronically, the earliest projections of the official results are likely to be announced shortly after polls close tonight at 8pm.\n\nThe results of the first round will also indicate just how popular the extremist parties - who have dominated headlines in France in recent weeks - have performed against the incumbent centrist Government.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFront page of the Franc Tireurin magazine ahead of the election head-to-head with Jordan Bardella (left) and Gabriel Attal. Alamy Alamy\n\nCurrent local polling, which can be used as a snapshot of public opinion at one particular time, shows that the National Rally - an anti-immigrant, Eurosceptic and far-right party - are most popular with the public at 35%.\n\nMacron's Ensemble have fallen within the last year, according to a number of polls, and current sit at just 15%.\n\nThe Socialist Party, which is the largest party in the coalition of left and far-left leaning parties 'The Popular Front, is currently polling in third place on 14%.\n\nPrime Minister Gabriel Attal's Ensemble party are likely to lose a number of seats ahead of the election today. Alamy Alamy\n\nIn comparison, after the last election, almost exactly two years ago, the centrist coalition Ensemble won around 35% of the vote while the National Rally won around 17.5% of the vote. Ensemble also lost it's governing majority during that same election.\n\nIf the National Rally win the 289 seats needed to form an absolute majority, the young Jordan Bardella could be appointed as Prime Minister by his rival Macron.\n\nHowever, local reporting suggests that his constituency, near Paris, may not even elect him.\n\nThe President of France is the head of Government and is elected every five years. Macron's position is not under threat during this election.\n\nThe Prime Minister is second-highest office and is in charge of the Council of Ministers, or the cabinet, who are directed by the President to oversee the implementation of new laws.\n\nIf one party secures a majority in the parliament, their members are more likely to be appointed to ministerial positions, by the President, as the positions are subject and proportional to the outcome of the elections.\n\nBardella has said if he will only take over the Prime Ministerial role from the Ensemble's Gabriel Attal if his party secure's an absolute majority, to avoid being what he called the \"President's assistant\".\n\nReaders like you are keeping these stories free for everyone...

It had just 88 seats in the outgoing parliament.\n\nPatrick (full name withheld) is not an immigrant himself and has little to worry about if the regime changes as predicted, hailing as he does from the French aristocracy. He does not, however, hide his shock at the surge of support for the far-right. \"Everybody I have known all my life has voted for either the traditional right or the centrist parties. Now suddenly I find everybody talking about giving the far right a chance! Have they all gone mad, I wonder!\" he exclaims during a chat at a caf\u00e9.\n\nPart of the shock stems from Macron's gamble in calling for a snap poll. Nobody, least of all Macron's own MPs, was prepared for it.\n\nOf course, Macron's own position remains relatively secure, whatever be the result, and he can on paper remain President for the rest of his term, ending 2027. As president, he retains the power to appoint the prime minister. But if the RN gets an absolute majority, he will have no choice but to appoint the party's nominee.", "source": {"uri": "nationalheraldindia.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "National Herald"}, "authors": [{"uri": "uttam_sengupta@nationalheraldindia.com", "name": "Uttam Sengupta", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Rally", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "National Rally"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Far-right_politics", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Far-right politics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vichy_France", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Vichy France"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_election", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "General election"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parliament", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Parliament"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Right_of_asylum", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Right of asylum"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_War_II", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "World War II"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marine_Le_Pen", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Marine Le Pen"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nazism", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Nazism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paris", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/India", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "India"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/France", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "France"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aristocracy", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Aristocracy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Majority", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Majority"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lower_house", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Lower house"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Centrism", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Centrism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prime_minister", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Prime minister"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Campaigns_and_Elections", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Campaigns and Elections", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Parties", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Parties", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Democracy", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Democracy", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Online_Issues_Polls", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Online Issues Polls", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Home/Entertaining/Holidays", "label": "dmoz/Home/Entertaining/Holidays", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 48}], "image": "https://media.assettype.com/nationalherald%2F2024-06%2F2f6dd3db-4363-4676-a410-dca4389269b0%2FMLP_officiel.jpeg?rect=0%2C0%2C1199%2C629&w=1200&ar=40%3A21&auto=format%2Ccompress&ogImage=true&mode=crop&enlarge=true&overlay=false&overlay_position=bottom&overlay_width=100", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9692876", "eventUri": "eng-9692876", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-06-30", "textStart": 310, "textEnd": 317}], "sentiment": 0.08235294117647052, "wgt": 108, "relevance": 1}

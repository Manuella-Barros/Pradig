{"id": 225047770, "title": "State Assembly approves streamlining West Valley College tuition waiver", "text": "West Valley students will soon receive automatic tuition waivers for community college classes, thanks to a bill that passed in the state Assembly on May 22. The West Valley Mission Community College District currently offers free tuition to students in its service area, which includes Campbell, Los Gatos, Saratoga and parts of San Jose. But the process to waive tuition involved filling out multiple forms that could be burdensome for applicants, officials said. Starting Jan. 1, 2025, AB 3158 will simplify the process for getting free tuition: Students will only need to provide their address and fill out the Free Application for Federal Student Aid or the California DREAM Act application to qualify. State Assemblymember Marc Berman introduced the bill in February on recommendations from district officials like chancellor Bradley Davis. Berman said the legislation removes financial deterrents for prospective students and makes it easier for the district to utilize the funds it has set aside for the waivers. \u201cThis bill will streamline the process, making free education a reality and empowering our staff to focus on what they do best: nurturing the minds and talents of our students,\u201d Davis said in a press release. The legislation will sunset on July 1, 2030,unless it\u2019s renewed, Berman said. \u201cThis bill also grants our district the flexibility to update our internal policies in administering the waiver program, enabling us to streamline the process for students however needed,\u201d Story-Yetto said. Tuition in the district currently comes in at $46 per unit for California residents, which adds up to $1,104 each year for the 12 credits students need each semester to count as full time. \u201cThat\u2019s a lot of money for students that are struggling to get by month to month or week to week, and it\u2019s great that West Valley and Mission stepped up and said \u2018Hey, we have the local resources to be able to waive these tuition fees, so we want to do that to help our students,\u2019\u201d Berman said. The San Mateo Community College District implemented a similar policy in 2022, Berman said.", "summary": "Process will be simplified for students beginning Jan. 1, 2025.", "url": "https://www.mercurynews.com/2024/05/29/state-assembly-approves-streamlining-west-valley-college-tuition-waiver/", "image": "https://www.mercurynews.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/SJM-L-AUTISTIC-0607-15.jpg?w=1024", "video": null, "publish_date": "2024-05-29 14:04:08", "author": "Isha Trivedi", "authors": ["Isha Trivedi"], "language": "en", "source_country": "us", "sentiment": -0.115}

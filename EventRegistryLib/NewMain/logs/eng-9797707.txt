of which there are expected to be up to eight across England by 2026 - will be routinely asked about taking part in the trial, as part of discussions with health specialists.\n\nNHS England had previously expected to have a study into the use of puberty blockers - which pause the physical changes of puberty such as breast development or facial hair - in place by December 2024.\n\nThe NHS announced in March that children would no longer be prescribed puberty blockers at gender identity clinics, with the then-Conservative government saying this would help ensure care is based on evidence and is in the \"best interests of the child\".\n\nIn May a ban on puberty blockers was introduced by that government with emergency legislation, preventing the prescription of the medication from European or private prescribers and restricting NHS provision to within clinical trials.\n\nA challenge to that ruling, brought by campaigners who said they were concerned for the safety and welfare of young trans people in the UK, failed last month when the High Court ruled the ban was lawful.\n\nThe new clinical trial will consider the potential benefits and harms of puberty suppressing hormones for children and young people.\n\nThe Cass Review had recommended that consent should \"routinely be sought\" for all children and young people for enrolment in a research study with follow-up into adulthood.\n\nIt is understood that NSHE's plans are for a discussion of the clinical trial to be a standard requirement with every child patient, ensuring it is fully integrated into young people's gender care.\n\nNumbers have not been set out for minimum participants - both those receiving puberty blockers and not receiving them - but they are expected to be \"substantial\".\n\nHealth officials believe that, due to the expected large size of the trial, which will study a population under one health system, the results into what has become a controversial issue will be awaited with interest worldwide.\n\nIn a piece for the British Medical Journal (BMJ) on publication of her report in April, Dr Hilary Cass concluded that the pillars of gender medicine are \"built on shaky foundations\", with evidence found to be severely lacking on the impacts of puberty blockers and hormone treatments.", "source": {"uri": "guernseypress.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Guernsey Press"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Puberty_blocker", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Puberty blocker"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Health_Service", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "National Health Service"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NHS_England", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "NHS England"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medication", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Medication"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gender_identity", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Gender identity"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gender", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Gender"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breast_development", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Breast development"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Puberty", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Puberty"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Facial_hair", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Facial hair"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Clinical trial"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/England", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "England"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "England"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/High_Court_of_Justice", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "High Court of Justice"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prescription_drug", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Prescription drug"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Welfare", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Welfare"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transgender", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Transgender"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Kingdom", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hilary_Cass", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Hilary Cass"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NHS_Gender_Identity_Development_Service", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "NHS Gender Identity Development Service"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_BMJ", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "The BMJ"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hormone_therapy", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Hormone therapy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hormone", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Hormone"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medicine", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Medicine"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Health/Reproductive_Health", "label": "dmoz/Health/Reproductive Health", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Health", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Health", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Specific_Substances/Tobacco", "label": "dmoz/Health/Specific Substances/Tobacco", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Reproductive_Health/Pregnancy_and_Birth", "label": "dmoz/Health/Reproductive Health/Pregnancy and Birth", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Reproductive_Health/Abortion", "label": "dmoz/Health/Reproductive Health/Abortion", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Health", "label": "news/Health", "wgt": 74}], "image": "https://www.guernseypress.com/resizer/v2/AERONVHUORFCPDCZKDAOKSCZRY.jpg?auth=10feeb76396abbd9023c4252f14028d3b15402b58f444b17f9c408238aafbdcf&width=1200&height=900", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9797707", "eventUri": "eng-9797707", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.1215686274509804, "wgt": 213, "relevance": 1}

She says she regrets taking puberty blockers at the age of 13 years\n\n'These emails strongly suggest that the FDA not only participated in those campaigns but actively knew that advancing them was endangering children,' Cruz told The Daily Signal.\n\nLawyer Ian Prior called the emails 'shocking and unacceptable.'\n\nIan Prior, the AFL lawyer leading the case, called the emails 'shocking and unacceptable.'\n\n'The advocates of these brutal practices on children claim that they are necessary to prevent suicide and depression,' Prior said.\n\n'In reality, the treatments themselves cause the very thing they claim they are trying to prevent.'\n\nRepublican lawmakers have outlawed puberty blockers and other types of trans care for minors in nearly two dozen states.\n\nThe row is expected to feature in the election fight between Kamala Harris, the Democratic Vice President who backs trans causes, and former Republican president Donald Trump, who vows to ban gender-affirming care for kids.\n\nNorway, Finland, Sweden, Holland, and the UK are among a growing list of European countries that have restricted or wholesale stopped trans interventions on children.\n\nRead More Major gym chain hit by huge backlash for allowing transgender woman into female locker room\n\nIn a landmark British report in April, top pediatrician Dr Hilary Cass made more than 30 recommendations to overhaul public health services in a bid to improve care offered to trans youth.\n\nHer report took almost four years to produce and found children 'caught in the middle' of a toxic row over treatment have been set on a path to irreversible change.\n\nShe said evidence for using of puberty blockers and cross-sex hormones relied heavily on 'shaky foundations' and associated guidelines were not supported by science.\n\nAFL lawyer Prior said the US should mirror its trans-Atlantic allies and outlaw medical 'barbarism.'\n\n'It's time for the federal government to follow the lead of Europe in banning these experiments on children,' he said.\n\nThe legal action group, which is headed by former Trump administration officials, on Monday made a public records request to see all internal FDA correspondence about the drugs.", "source": {"uri": "dailymail.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "Daily Mail Online"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

of which there are expected to be up to eight across England by 2026 - will be routinely asked about taking part in the trial, as part of discussions with health specialists.\n\nNHS England had previously expected to have a study into the use of puberty blockers - which pause the physical changes of puberty such as breast development or facial hair - in place by December 2024.\n\nThe first stage of the trial - recruiting participants in England and Wales - is now instead expected to begin in early 2025, subject to academic approval, meaning children involved will be able to start accessing blockers at that stage.\n\nThe NHS announced in March that children would no longer be prescribed puberty blockers at gender identity clinics, with the then-Conservative government saying this would help ensure care is based on evidence and is in the \"best interests of the child\".\n\nIn May a ban on puberty blockers was introduced by that government with emergency legislation, preventing the prescription of the medication from European or private prescribers and restricting NHS provision to within clinical trials.\n\nA challenge to that ruling, brought by campaigners who said they were concerned for the safety and welfare of young trans people in the UK, failed last month when the High Court ruled the ban was lawful.\n\nThe new clinical trial will consider the potential benefits and harms of puberty suppressing hormones for children and young people.\n\nThe Cass Review had recommended that consent should \"routinely be sought\" for all children and young people for enrolment in a research study with follow-up into adulthood.\n\nIt is understood that NSHE's plans are for a discussion of the clinical trial to be a standard requirement with every child patient, ensuring it is fully integrated into young people's gender care.\n\nNumbers have not been set out for minimum participants - both those receiving puberty blockers and not receiving them - but they are expected to be \"substantial\".\n\nHealth officials believe that, due to the expected large size of the trial, which will study a population under one health system, the results into what has become a controversial issue will be awaited with interest worldwide.\n\nIn a piece for the British Medical Journal (BMJ) on publication of her report in April, Dr Hilary Cass concluded that the pillars of gender medicine are \"built on shaky foundations\", with evidence found to be severely lacking on the impacts of puberty blockers and hormone treatments.", "source": {"uri": "ca.news.yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Puberty_blocker", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Puberty blocker"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NHS_England", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "NHS England"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gender", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Gender"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breast_development", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Breast development"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/England_and_Wales", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "England and Wales"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Health_Service", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "National Health Service"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Puberty", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Puberty"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Facial_hair", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Facial hair"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Clinical trial"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/England", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "England"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "England"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medication", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Medication"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/High_Court_of_Justice", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "High Court of Justice"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prescription_drug", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Prescription drug"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gender_identity", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Gender identity"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Welfare", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Welfare"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transgender", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Transgender"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Kingdom", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hilary_Cass", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Hilary Cass"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NHS_Gender_Identity_Development_Service", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "NHS Gender Identity Development Service"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_BMJ", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "The BMJ"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hormone_therapy", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Hormone therapy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hormone", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Hormone"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medicine", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Medicine"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Health/Reproductive_Health", "label": "dmoz/Health/Reproductive Health", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Health", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Health", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Specific_Substances/Tobacco", "label": "dmoz/Health/Specific Substances/Tobacco", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Reproductive_Health/Pregnancy_and_Birth", "label": "dmoz/Health/Reproductive Health/Pregnancy and Birth", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Reproductive_Health/Abortion", "label": "dmoz/Health/Reproductive Health/Abortion", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Health", "label": "news/Health", "wgt": 76}], "image": "https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/9DLOJDnWxgYMuVGM5K_YBQ--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyMDA7aD02NzU7Y2Y9d2VicA--/https://media.zenfs.com/en/pa_viral_news_uk_120/91ef279b6fcf31faa3feb533b4d47c68", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9797707", "eventUri": "eng-9797707", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.07450980392156858, "wgt": 196, "relevance": 1}

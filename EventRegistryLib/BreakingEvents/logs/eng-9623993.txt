(AP) -- Wisconsin Attorney General Josh Kaul filed felony forgery charges Tuesday against two attorneys and an aide who helped submit paperwork falsely saying that former President Donald Trump had won the battleground state in 2020.\n\nThe charges were filed against Trump attorneys Kenneth Chesebro, 62, and Jim Troupis, 70, and former Trump aide Mike Roman, 51, who allegedly delivered Wisconsin's fake elector paperwork to a Pennsylvania congressman's staffer in order to get them to then-Vice President Mike Pence on Jan. 6, 2021.\n\nAll three are due in Dane County Circuit Court on Sept. 19, according to court records. They each face one felony count punishable by up to six years in prison and fines of up to $10,000.\n\nTroupis and Chesebro did not return voicemail messages left Tuesday. Roman did not have an attorney listed in court records.\n\nKaul, a Democrat, has faced pressure to bring action against the 10 fake electors, who have yet to be charged with any criminal wrongdoing. He has previously suggested that he was relying on federal investigators while also not ruling out a state probe.\n\nDemocratic Gov. Tony Evers offered a one-word response to news of the charges being filed: \"Good.\"\n\nElectors are people appointed to represent voters in presidential elections. The winner of the popular vote in each state determines which party's electors are sent to the Electoral College, which meets in December after the election to certify the outcome.\n\nThe fake elector efforts are central to an August federal indictment filed against Trump alleging he tried to overturn results of the 2020 election. Federal prosecutors, investigating his conduct related to the Jan. 6, 2021, U.S. Capitol riot, have also said the scheme originated in Wisconsin. Trump also faces charges in Georgia and has denied wrongdoing.\n\nMichigan and Nevada have also criminally charged fake electors.\n\nChesebro and Roman were among the 18 people indicted along with Trump in August in a sprawling racketeering indictment in Georgia. They're accused of participating in a wide-ranging scheme to try to illegally overturn the 2020 election in that state.\n\nChesebro in October pleaded guilty to one felony charge of conspiracy to commit filing false documents after reaching a deal with prosecutors. Roman has pleaded not guilty to racketeering and conspiracy charges related to a plan to have Republican electors meet and cast Electoral College votes for Trump even though Biden had won Georgia.\n\nThe Wisconsin electors, Chesebro and Troup all settled a civil lawsuit that was brought against them last year.\n\nDocuments released as part of those settlements showed that the strategy in Wisconsin replicated moves in six other swing states.\n\nTrump lost Wisconsin to Biden, a Democrat, by fewer than 21,000 votes. Trump carried Wisconsin by a similar margin in 2016.\n\nWisconsin is one of a handful of swing states again this year.\n\nGovernment and outside investigationshave uniformly found there was no evidence of widespread voter fraud that could have swung the 2020 election. But Trump has continued to spread falsehoods about the election, particularly in Wisconsin.\n\n___\n\nAssociated Press writer Kate Brumback in Atlanta contributed to this report.", "source": {"uri":

(AP) -- Wisconsin Attorney General Josh Kaul filed felony forgery charges Tuesday against two attorneys and an aide who helped submit paperwork falsely saying that former President Donald Trump had won the battleground state in 2020.\n\nThe charges were filed against attorneys Kenneth Chesebro, 62, and Jim Troupis, 70, and former Trump aide Mike Roman, 51, who allegedly delivered Wisconsin's fake elector paperwork to a Pennsylvania congressman's staffer in order to get them to then-Vice President Mike Pence on Jan. 6, 2021.\n\nAll three are due in Dane County Circuit Court on Sept. 19, according to court records. They each face one felony count punishable by up to six years in prison and fines of up to $10,000.\n\nTroupis and Chesebro did not return voicemail messages left Tuesday. Roman did not have an attorney listed in court records.\n\nKaul, a Democrat, has faced pressure to bring action against the 10 fake electors, who have yet to be charged with any criminal wrongdoing. He has previously suggested that he was relying on federal investigators while also not ruling out a state probe.\n\nDemocratic Gov. Tony Evers offered a one-word response to news of the charges being filed: \"Good.\"\n\nElectors are people appointed to represent voters in presidential elections. The winner of the popular vote in each state determines which party's electors are sent to the Electoral College, which meets in December after the election to certify the outcome.\n\nThe fake elector efforts are central to an August federal indictment filed against Trump alleging he tried to overturn results of the 2020 election. Federal prosecutors, investigating his conduct related to the Jan. 6, 2021, U.S. Capitol riot, have also said the scheme originated in Wisconsin. Trump also faces charges in Georgia and has denied wrongdoing.\n\nMichigan and Nevada have also criminally charged fake electors.\n\nChesebro and Roman were among the 18 people indicted along with Trump in August in a sprawling racketeering indictment in Georgia. They're accused of participating in a wide-ranging scheme to illegally overturn the 2020 election in that state.\n\nChesebro in October pleaded guilty to one felony charge of conspiracy to commit filing false documents after reaching a deal with prosecutors. Roman has pleaded not guilty to racketeering and conspiracy charges related to a plan to have Republican electors meet and cast Electoral College votes for Trump even though Biden had won Georgia.\n\nThe 10 Wisconsin electors, Chesebro and Troupis, who was Trump's attorney in Wisconsin, all settled a civil lawsuit that was brought against them last year.\n\nDocuments released as part of those settlements showed that the strategy in Wisconsin replicated moves in six other swing states.\n\nThe complaint goes into detail largely citing those documents, interviews and testimony given to Congress about how the fake elector scheme was hatched.\n\nThe complaint details how Chesebro emailed a memo on Nov. 18, 2020, to Troupis and others arguing that electors representing Trump should meet on Dec. 14, 2020, to preserve the Trump-Pence electoral slate in case a court or Legislature would determine them to be the winners.\n\nChesebro argued in a subsequent memo that the Trump electors could be counted by Congress if court challenges to his loss were still pending. Troupis sent both memos to the Trump White House, according to the complaint.\n\nOn Dec. 9, 2020, Chesebro emailed Troupis a memo with instructions for the Dec. 14, 2020, elector meetings. Two days later, Chesebro emailed Trump aide Roman details of the plan, the complaint said.\n\nDuring or around the time of the Dec. 14, 2020, meeting, Chesebro sent a message to Troupis and Roman that said, \"WI meeting of the 'real' electors is a go!!!,\" the complaint said. Troupis responded with a \"thumbs up\" emoji, the complaint said.\n\nThe complaint also details how the fake elector slate was delivered to Chesebro from Wisconsin to Washington, D.C., on Jan. 5, 2021, by Alesha Guenther, a law student working part-time at the Republican Party of Wisconsin. Roman told Guenther to deliver the paperwork only to Chesebro.\n\n\"5 mins until I make the drop,\" Guenther texted at one point, according to the complaint. \"I feel like a drug dealer.\"\n\nOnce Chesebro was given the documents, he emailed Roman to let him know he had them.\n\nRoman then arranged for a congressional staff member to meet Chesebro and take the document. Chesebro sent Roman a message confirming that it had been done, the complaint said.\n\nTrump lost Wisconsin to Biden, a Democrat, by fewer than 21,000 votes. Trump carried Wisconsin by a similar margin in 2016.\n\nGovernment and outside investigationshave uniformly found there was no evidence of widespread voter fraud that could have swung the 2020 election.

Wisconsin Attorney General Josh Kaul filed felony forgery charges against Chesebro, Jim Troupis and an aide who submitted paperwork falsely saying that former President Donald Trump had won the battleground state in 2020.\n\nMADISON, Wis. (AP) -- Wisconsin Attorney General Josh Kaul filed felony forgery charges Tuesday against two attorneys and an aide who helped submit paperwork falsely saying that former President Donald Trump had won the battleground state in 2020.\n\nThe charges were filed against attorneys Kenneth Chesebro, 62, and Jim Troupis, 70, and former Trump aide Mike Roman, 51, who allegedly delivered Wisconsin's fake elector paperwork to a Pennsylvania congressman's staffer in order to get them to then-Vice President Mike Pence on Jan. 6, 2021.\n\nAll three are due in Dane County Circuit Court on Sept. 19, according to court records. They each face one felony count punishable by up to six years in prison and fines of up to $10,000.\n\nTroupis and Chesebro did not return voicemail messages left Tuesday. Roman did not have an attorney listed in court records.\n\nKaul, a Democrat, has faced pressure to bring action against the 10 fake electors, who have yet to be charged with any criminal wrongdoing. He has previously suggested that he was relying on federal investigators while also not ruling out a state probe.\n\nDemocratic Gov. Tony Evers offered a one-word response to news of the charges being filed: \"Good.\"\n\nElectors are people appointed to represent voters in presidential elections. The winner of the popular vote in each state determines which party's electors are sent to the Electoral College, which meets in December after the election to certify the outcome.\n\nThe fake elector efforts are central to an August federal indictment filed against Trump alleging he tried to overturn results of the 2020 election. Federal prosecutors, investigating his conduct related to the Jan. 6, 2021, U.S. Capitol riot, have also said the scheme originated in Wisconsin. Trump also faces charges in Georgia and has denied wrongdoing.\n\nMichigan and Nevada have also criminally charged fake electors.\n\nChesebro and Roman were among the 18 people indicted along with Trump in August in a sprawling racketeering indictment in Georgia. They're accused of participating in a wide-ranging scheme to illegally overturn the 2020 election in that state.\n\nChesebro in October pleaded guilty to one felony charge of conspiracy to commit filing false documents after reaching a deal with prosecutors. Roman has pleaded not guilty to racketeering and conspiracy charges related to a plan to have Republican electors meet and cast Electoral College votes for Trump even though Biden had won Georgia.\n\nThe 10 Wisconsin electors, Chesebro and Troupis, who was Trump's attorney in Wisconsin, all settled a civil lawsuit that was brought against them last year.\n\nDocuments released as part of those settlements showed that the strategy in Wisconsin replicated moves in six other swing states.\n\nThe complaint goes into detail largely citing those documents, interviews and testimony given to Congress about how the fake elector scheme was hatched.\n\nThe complaint details how Chesebro emailed a memo on Nov. 18, 2020, to Troupis and others arguing that electors representing Trump should meet on Dec. 14, 2020, to preserve the Trump-Pence electoral slate in case a court or Legislature would determine them to be the winners.\n\nChesebro argued in a subsequent memo that the Trump electors could be counted by Congress if court challenges to his loss were still pending. Troupis sent both memos to the Trump White House, according to the complaint.\n\nOn Dec. 9, 2020, Chesebro emailed Troupis a memo with instructions for the Dec. 14, 2020, elector meetings. Two days later, Chesebro emailed Trump aide Roman details of the plan, the complaint said.\n\nDuring or around the time of the Dec. 14, 2020, meeting, Chesebro sent a message to Troupis and Roman that said, \"WI meeting of the 'real' electors is a go!!!,\" the complaint said. Troupis responded with a \"thumbs up\" emoji, the complaint said.\n\nThe complaint also details how the fake elector slate was delivered to Chesebro from Wisconsin to Washington, D.C., on Jan. 5, 2021, by Alesha Guenther, a law student working part-time at the Republican Party of Wisconsin. Roman told Guenther to deliver the paperwork only to Chesebro.\n\n\"5 mins until I make the drop,\" Guenther texted at one point, according to the complaint. \"I feel like a drug dealer.\"\n\nOnce Chesebro was given the documents, he emailed Roman to let him know he had them.\n\nRoman then arranged for a congressional staff member to meet Chesebro and take the document. Chesebro sent Roman a message confirming that it had been done, the complaint said.\n\nTrump lost Wisconsin to Biden, a Democrat, by fewer than 21,000 votes. Trump carried Wisconsin by a similar margin in 2016.\n\nGovernment and outside investigationshave uniformly found there was no evidence of widespread voter fraud that could have swung the 2020 election. But Trump has continued to spread falsehoods about the election, particularly in Wisconsin.\n\nAssociated Press writer Kate Brumback in Atlanta contributed to this report.", "source": {"uri":

AP Photo/Morry Gash, File\n\nMADISON, Wis. -- Wisconsin Attorney General Josh Kaul filed felony forgery charges Tuesday against two attorneys and an aide who helped submit paperwork falsely saying that former President Donald Trump had won the battleground state in 2020.\n\nThe charges were filed against attorneys Kenneth Chesebro, 62, and Jim Troupis, 70, and former Trump aide Mike Roman, 51, who allegedly delivered Wisconsin's fake elector paperwork to a Pennsylvania congressman's staffer in order to get them to then-Vice President Mike Pence on Jan. 6, 2021.\n\nAll three are due in Dane County Circuit Court on Sept. 19, according to court records. They each face one felony count punishable by up to six years in prison and fines of up to $10,000.\n\nTroupis and Chesebro did not return voicemail messages left Tuesday. Roman did not have an attorney listed in court records.\n\nKaul, a Democrat, has faced pressure to bring action against the 10 fake electors, who have yet to be charged with any criminal wrongdoing. He has previously suggested that he was relying on federal investigators while also not ruling out a state probe.\n\nRelated Settlement in Wisconsin fake elector case offers new details on the strategy by Trump lawyers\n\nDemocratic Gov.

The winner of the popular vote in each state determines which party's electors are sent to the Electoral College, which meets in December after the election to certify the outcome.\n\nThe fake elector efforts are central to an August federal indictment filed against Trump alleging he tried to overturn results of the 2020 election. Federal prosecutors, investigating his conduct related to the Jan. 6, 2021, U.S. Capitol riot, have also said the scheme originated in Wisconsin.

They're accused of participating in a wide-ranging scheme to try to illegally overturn the 2020 election in that state.\n\nChesebro in October pleaded guilty to one felony charge of conspiracy to commit filing false documents after reaching a deal with prosecutors. Roman has pleaded not guilty to racketeering and conspiracy charges related to a plan to have Republican electors meet and cast Electoral College votes for Trump even though Biden had won Georgia.\n\nThe 10 Wisconsin electors, Chesebro and Troupis, who was Trump's attorney in Wisconsin, all settled a civil lawsuit that was brought against them last year.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDocuments released as part of those settlements showed that the strategy in Wisconsin replicated moves in six other swing states.\n\nTrump lost Wisconsin to Biden, a Democrat, by fewer than 21,000 votes.

Trump sought recounts in Dane and Milwaukee counties, which confirmed Biden's win. Trump sued and the state Supreme Court upheld the results on a 4-3 vote on Dec. 14, 2020.\n\nLess than an hour later, Democrats met in the state Capitol to cast the state's 10 electoral votes for Biden. Chesebro was in the room during the meeting.\n\nAt the same time, the fake electors gathered in another part of the Capitol to fill out paperwork claiming Trump had won. They submitted their filings to Congress, the National Archives, a federal judge and then-Wisconsin Secretary of State Doug La Follette.\n\nAt the time, the fake electors said they held the meeting to ensure the state's electoral votes were cast for Trump if a court later determined he was the true winner of the state.\n\nThe plan was spelled out by Chesebro in a memo dated Nov. 18, 2020 -- the same day Trump asked for recounts in Dane and Milwaukee counties.\n\nChesebro sent the memo to Troupis, the attorney who oversaw Trump's post-election legal strategy in Wisconsin and is also a defendant. It's unclear whether Chesebro worked for Trump or someone else. Chesebro sent a second memo on the matter on Dec. 9, 2020, after state officials certified Biden as the victor in Wisconsin.\n\nIn Wisconsin, the group of 10 Republicans who signed the paperwork included then-Republican Party of Wisconsin chairman Andrew Hitt and Wisconsin Elections Commissioner Bob Spindell.\n\nIn December, the group of false electors settled a civil lawsuit filed by the real Biden electors against them over their role in the scheme. As part of the settlement, the false Trump electors acknowledged their actions were part of an attempt to overturn an election.\n\nAccording to communication released by Chesebro and Troupis as part of the lawsuit, Roman was in contact with Troupis on Jan. 6, 2021 and U.S. Sen. Ron Johnson's chief of staff in order to pass along the slates of Wisconsin's false electors to Pence, who ultimately rejected the offer.\n\nCourt records show Chesebro, Troupis and Roman are due in court on Sept. 19.\n\nIn a one word statement on the charges, Democratic Gov. Tony Evers said: \"Good.\"\n\nMore: Court records from Trump attorneys Troupis and Chesebro reveal depth of fake elector scheme\n\nThis story will be updated.\n\nMolly Beck can be reached at

(AP) -- Wisconsin Attorney General Josh Kaul filed felony forgery charges Tuesday against two attorneys and an aide who helped submit paperwork falsely saying that former President Donald Trump had won the battleground state in 2020.\n\nThe charges were filed against attorneys Kenneth Chesebro, 62, and Jim Troupis, 70, and former Trump aide Mike Roman, 51, who allegedly delivered Wisconsin's fake elector paperwork to a Pennsylvania congressman's staffer in order to get them to then-Vice President Mike Pence on Jan. 6, 2021.\n\nAll three are due in Dane County Circuit Court on Sept. 19, according to court records. They each face one felony count punishable by up to six years in prison and fines of up to $10,000.\n\nTroupis and Chesebro did not return voicemail messages left Tuesday. Roman did not have an attorney listed in court records.\n\nKaul, a Democrat, has faced pressure to bring action against the 10 fake electors, who have yet to be charged with any criminal wrongdoing. He has previously suggested that he was relying on federal investigators while also not ruling out a state probe.\n\nDemocratic Gov. Tony Evers offered a one-word response to news of the charges being filed: \"Good.\"\n\nElectors are people appointed to represent voters in presidential elections. The winner of the popular vote in each state determines which party's electors are sent to the Electoral College, which meets in December after the election to certify the outcome.\n\nThe fake elector efforts are central to an August federal indictment filed against Trump alleging he tried to overturn results of the 2020 election. Federal prosecutors, investigating his conduct related to the Jan. 6, 2021, U.S. Capitol riot, have also said the scheme originated in Wisconsin. Trump also faces charges in Georgia and has denied wrongdoing.\n\nMichigan and Nevada have also criminally charged fake electors.\n\nChesebro and Roman were among the 18 people indicted along with Trump in August in a sprawling racketeering indictment in Georgia. They're accused of participating in a wide-ranging scheme to illegally overturn the 2020 election in that state.\n\nChesebro in October pleaded guilty to one felony charge of conspiracy to commit filing false documents after reaching a deal with prosecutors. Roman has pleaded not guilty to racketeering and conspiracy charges related to a plan to have Republican electors meet and cast Electoral College votes for Trump even though Biden had won Georgia.\n\nThe 10 Wisconsin electors, Chesebro and Troupis, who was Trump's attorney in Wisconsin, all settled a civil lawsuit that was brought against them last year.\n\nDocuments released as part of those settlements showed that the strategy in Wisconsin replicated moves in six other swing states.\n\nThe complaint goes into detail largely citing those documents, interviews and testimony given to Congress about how the fake elector scheme was hatched.\n\nThe complaint details how Chesebro emailed a memo on Nov. 18, 2020, to Troupis and others arguing that electors representing Trump should meet on Dec. 14, 2020, to preserve the Trump-Pence electoral slate in case a court or Legislature would determine them to be the winners.\n\nChesebro argued in a subsequent memo that the Trump electors could be counted by Congress if court challenges to his loss were still pending. Troupis sent both memos to the Trump White House, according to the complaint.\n\nOn Dec. 9, 2020, Chesebro emailed Troupis a memo with instructions for the Dec. 14, 2020, elector meetings. Two days later, Chesebro emailed Trump aide Roman details of the plan, the complaint said.\n\nDuring or around the time of the Dec. 14, 2020, meeting, Chesebro sent a message to Troupis and Roman that said, \"WI meeting of the 'real' electors is a go!!!,\" the complaint said. Troupis responded with a \"thumbs up\" emoji, the complaint said.\n\nThe complaint also details how the fake elector slate was delivered to Chesebro from Wisconsin to Washington, D.C., on Jan. 5, 2021, by Alesha Guenther, a law student working part-time at the Republican Party of Wisconsin. Roman told Guenther to deliver the paperwork only to Chesebro.\n\n\"5 mins until I make the drop,\" Guenther texted at one point, according to the complaint. \"I feel like a drug dealer.\"\n\nOnce Chesebro was given the documents, he emailed Roman to let him know he had them.\n\nRoman then arranged for a congressional staff member to meet Chesebro and take the document. Chesebro sent Roman a message confirming that it had been done, the complaint said.\n\nTrump lost Wisconsin to Biden, a Democrat, by fewer than 21,000 votes. Trump carried Wisconsin by a similar margin in 2016.\n\nGovernment and outside investigationshave uniformly found there was no evidence of widespread voter fraud that could have swung the 2020 election. But Trump has continued to spread falsehoods about the election, particularly in Wisconsin.\n\n___\n\nAssociated Press writer Kate Brumback in Atlanta contributed to this report.", "source": {"uri":

Trump sought recounts in Dane and Milwaukee counties, which confirmed Biden's win. Trump sued and the state Supreme Court upheld the results on a 4-3 vote on Dec. 14, 2020.\n\nLess than an hour later, Democrats met in the state Capitol to cast the state's 10 electoral votes for Biden. Chesebro was in the room during the meeting.\n\nAt the same time, the fake electors gathered in another part of the Capitol to fill out paperwork claiming Trump had won. They submitted their filings to Congress, the National Archives, a federal judge and then-Wisconsin Secretary of State Doug La Follette.\n\nAt the time, the fake electors said they held the meeting to ensure the state's electoral votes were cast for Trump if a court later determined he was the true winner of the state.\n\nThe plan was spelled out by Chesebro in a memo dated Nov. 18, 2020 -- the same day Trump asked for recounts in Dane and Milwaukee counties.\n\nChesebro sent the memo to Troupis, the attorney who oversaw Trump's post-election legal strategy in Wisconsin and is also a defendant. It's unclear whether Chesebro worked for Trump or someone else. Chesebro sent a second memo on the matter on Dec. 9, 2020, after state officials certified Biden as the victor in Wisconsin.\n\nIn Wisconsin, the group of 10 Republicans who signed the paperwork included then-Republican Party of Wisconsin chairman Andrew Hitt and Wisconsin Elections Commissioner Bob Spindell.\n\nIn December, the group of false electors settled a civil lawsuit filed by the real Biden electors against them over their role in the scheme. As part of the settlement, the false Trump electors acknowledged their actions were part of an attempt to overturn an election.\n\nAccording to communication released by Chesebro and Troupis as part of the lawsuit, Roman was in contact with Troupis on Jan. 6, 2021 and U.S. Sen. Ron Johnson's chief of staff in order to pass along the slates of Wisconsin's false electors to Pence, who ultimately rejected the offer.\n\nCourt records show Chesebro, Troupis and Roman are due in court on Sept. 19.\n\nIn a one word statement on the charges, Democratic Gov. Tony Evers said: \"Good.\"", "source": {"uri": "fdlreporter.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Reporter"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Josh_Kaul", "type":

Trump sought recounts in Dane and Milwaukee counties, which confirmed Biden's win. Trump sued and the state Supreme Court upheld the results on a 4-3 vote on Dec. 14, 2020.\n\nLess than an hour later, Democrats met in the state Capitol to cast the state's 10 electoral votes for Biden. Chesebro was in the room during the meeting.\n\nAt the same time, the fake electors gathered in another part of the Capitol to fill out paperwork claiming Trump had won. They submitted their filings to Congress, the National Archives, a federal judge and then-Wisconsin Secretary of State Doug La Follette.\n\nAt the time, the fake electors said they held the meeting to ensure the state's electoral votes were cast for Trump if a court later determined he was the true winner of the state.\n\nThe plan was spelled out by Chesebro in a memo dated Nov. 18, 2020 -- the same day Trump asked for recounts in Dane and Milwaukee counties.\n\nChesebro sent the memo to Troupis, the attorney who oversaw Trump's post-election legal strategy in Wisconsin and is also a defendant. It's unclear whether Chesebro worked for Trump or someone else. Chesebro sent a second memo on the matter on Dec. 9, 2020, after state officials certified Biden as the victor in Wisconsin.\n\nIn Wisconsin, the group of 10 Republicans who signed the paperwork included then-Republican Party of Wisconsin chairman Andrew Hitt and Wisconsin Elections Commissioner Bob Spindell.\n\nIn December, the group of false electors settled a civil lawsuit filed by the real Biden electors against them over their role in the scheme. As part of the settlement, the false Trump electors acknowledged their actions were part of an attempt to overturn an election.\n\nAccording to communication released by Chesebro and Troupis as part of the lawsuit, Roman was in contact with Troupis on Jan. 6, 2021 and U.S. Sen. Ron Johnson's chief of staff in order to pass along the slates of Wisconsin's false electors to Pence, who ultimately rejected the offer.\n\nCourt records show Chesebro, Troupis and Roman are due in court on Sept. 19.\n\nIn a one word statement on the charges, Democratic Gov. Tony Evers said: \"Good.\"\n\nMore: Court records from Trump attorneys Troupis and Chesebro reveal depth of fake elector scheme", "source": {"uri": "yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo"},

In October, Chesebro pleaded guilty to one count of conspiracy to commit filing false documents.\n\nChesebro agreed to five years of probation, $5,000 in restitution, community service hours and to write an apology letter to the citizens of Georgia. He will also have to testify truthfully and cannot have contact with witnesses or other co-defendants.\n\nThe Jan. 6 Committee said Chesebro was one of the architects of the fake elector scheme not only here in Georgia, but in at least six other swing states across the country.\n\nOn Tuesday, Wisconsin Attorney General Josh Kaul filed charges against Chesebro, Jim Troupis, 70, and former Trump aide Mike Roman, who is also under the Georgia indictment as well.\n\nRELATED STORIES:\n\nRoman allegedly delivered Wisconsin's fake elector paperwork to a Pennsylvania congressman's staffer in order to get them to then-Vice President Mike Pence on Jan. 6, 2021.\n\nMichigan and Nevada have also criminally charged fake electors.\n\nThe 10 Wisconsin electors, Chesebro and Troupis, who was Trump's attorney in Wisconsin, all settled a civil lawsuit that was brought against them last year.\n\nDocuments released as part of those settlements showed that the strategy in Wisconsin replicated moves in six other swing states.\n\nTrump lost Wisconsin to Biden, a Democrat, by fewer than 21,000 votes. Trump carried Wisconsin by a similar margin in 2016.\n\nWisconsin is one of a handful of swing states again this year.\n\nGovernment and outside investigations have uniformly found there was no evidence of widespread voter fraud that could have swung the 2020 election.

The crime is a class H felony punishable by a fine of up to $10,000 and up to six years in prison.\n\nChesebro was the architect of the fake elector plan. Five days after the election, he emailed Troupis, a retired judge who was leading the Trump campaign's legal efforts in Wisconsin, to muse about the possibility of throwing out Joe Biden's win in Wisconsin and appointing a Trump slate of electors. The two developed the scheme over the next few months. Chesebro would later work with Roman to coordinate the efforts across states and to get the slates of fake electors to Washington.\n\nChesebro pleaded guilty to conspiracy to filing false documents for his role in the scheme in a separate case in Georgia earlier this year. Roman faces charges in Georgia and is also a defendant in an Arizona case.\n\nThis is the first time Troupis, who sits on a judicial ethics panel in Wisconsin, has been charged.\n\nWisconsin governor Tony Evers, a Democrat, released a one-word statement praising the charges. \"Good,\" he said.\n\nThe Wisconsin complaint lays out how Chesebro, Troupis and Roman - a Trump campaign aide - coordinated to draft false electoral certificates to be signed by swing state Republicans for Trump and the former vice-president, Mike Pence. The men debated the language to be used on the false elector certificates, considering adding language to qualify that the unofficial slate of electors were contingents in the event that somehow the election results in those key swing states changed before the election was certified.\n\nIn Wisconsin, the complaint notes, the false elector documents contained \"no qualifying language\" and presented the Trump-Pence electors as duly elected.\n\nOn 14 December, the day that the Wisconsin false electors convened, Chesebro celebrated in messages to Troupis and Roman: \"WI meeting of the *real* electors is a go!!!\"\n\nEven as Wisconsin's slate of false Trump electors submitted their electoral certificates, their chances of reversing the results of the 2020 election appeared increasingly slim. By a narrow 4-3 ruling, the Wisconsin supreme court on 14 December tossed Trump's lawsuit attempting to overturn the election, accusing the campaign of \"challenging the rulebook adopted before the season began\".\n\nChesebro and Troupis were not ready to give up.\n\nIn the days after the Wisconsin Trump electors met to submit their unofficial certificates, the two men flew to Washington DC to meet with Trump.\n\nOn 17 December, Chesebro acknowleged in a message to Roman that the scheme was looking \"less plausible\". Still, he argued, the Electoral Count Act could be \"weaponized\" to deliver Trump the election.\n\nThe charges in Wisconsin come after prosecutors in four other swing states - Arizona, Georgia, Nevada and Michigan - have filed criminal charges against those involved in the fake elector plot.\n\nUnlike his counterpart in the other states, Kaul did not file charges against the fake electors themselves. Earlier this year, Wisconsin's 10 fake electors reached a settlement in a civil suit in which they agreed to never serve as presidential electors again in an election involving Trump. They also acknowledged Biden's win.\n\nThe indictments come as Trump has successfully maneuvered to delay the two criminal cases he faces for subverting the 2020 election until after November.",

They faced a lawsuit from Democratic electors.\n\nThe 10 Republicans reached a settlement in that case, in which they acknowledged their actions were part of an attempt to overturn an election. Kaul could still file charges against them, but it looks unlikely.\n\nHere's what to know about the three people facing charges and their alleged roles in the scheme:\n\nWho is Kenneth Chesebro?\n\nChesebro is a Wisconsin Rapids native and a former campaign attorney for Trump. CNN reported in December that Chesebro was cooperating with investigators in four states, including Wisconsin. At that point, Kaul had not confirmed whether he was investigating the scheme.\n\nChesebro was the lead architect of the 2020 fake elector plan. Chesebro spelled out the plan in a memo dated Nov. 18, 2020 -- the same day Trump asked for recounts in Dane and Milwaukee counties.\n\nIt's unclear whether Chesebro worked for Trump or someone else. Chesebro sent a second memo on the matter on Dec. 9, 2020, after state officials certified President Joe Biden as the victor in Wisconsin.\n\nChesebro has entered into agreements in several states to give him some protection from prosecution. He has pleaded guilty in Georgia to conspiracy to commit filing false documents.\n\nChesebro was also revealed as the anonymous \"BadgerPundit\" account on X, formerly Twitter. He used the account to urge Republicans to use Trump electors or Republican-led state legislatures to overturn Trump's loss.\n\nWho is Jim Troupis?\n\nJim Troupis is a former Dane County Circuit Court judge from Cross Plains who was hired by Trump's campaign to oversee recounts. He received those memos from Chesebro.\n\nIn a settlement in the case filed by Democratic electors, Chesebro and Troupis did not admit wrongdoing but agreed to not prepare \"alternate electoral votes\" in future campaigns. Troupis paid an undisclosed amount as part of that agreement.\n\nEmails released by Troupis and Cheesebro in that settlement showed they coordinated legal strategies during recounts of ballots in Dane and Milwaukee counties, during which Troupis sought to throw out thousands of absentee ballots that were cast in person through early voting.\n\nWho is Mike Roman?\n\nMike Roman is a former Trump aide who allegedly delivered the fake elector paperwork to congressional staffers in order to get them to Vice President Mike Pence, who ultimately rejected them.\n\nRecords released as part of the settlement show Roman was in contact with Troupis on Jan. 6, 2021, and U.S. Sen. Ron Johnson's chief of staff in order to pass along the slates of Wisconsin's false electors to Pence.\n\nJohnson has maintained he did not know he was trying to deliver fake elector packets to Pence despite texts released in the settlement showing he was explicitly told the documents were about the electors.\n\nWhat are they charged with, and what happens next?\n\nKaul has filed the felony forgery charges in Dane County Circuit Court. Court records show Chesebro, Troupis and Roman are due in court on Sept. 19.\n\nWho are Wisconsin's fake electors?\n\nWhile the three Trump associates above are now charged in Wisconsin, the 10 people who signed documents agreeing to be electors for Trump were not.

The three are set to make their initial appearances in Dane County Circuit Court on Sept. 19, court records show. The charge carries a sentence of up to six years in prison and a fine of up to $10,000.\n\n\"The criminal complaint in this case alleges that the defendants were part of a conspiracy to present a certificate of purported electoral votes from individuals who were not Wisconsin's duly appointed electors,\" Wisconsin Attorney General Josh Kaul said in a statement. \"The Wisconsin Department of Justice is committed to protecting the integrity of our electoral process.\"\n\nThe indictment alleges that Chesebro sent a memo on Nov., 18, 2020, to Troupis and others that encouraged presidential and vice presidential electors representing Trump and then-Vice President Mike Pence to meet and cast their electoral votes on Dec. 14, 2020, when legitimate members of the Electoral College would meet to certify the results of their states' elections.\n\nChesebro, an attorney, wrote and sent to Troupis another six-page memo in December 2020 that laid out a plan for organizing Trump's supporters to serve as fake electors after that year's presidential election in crucial swing states where he lost. He explained in the memo that the false elector votes would be counted by Pence during a joint session of Congress on Jan. 6, 2021, according to the indictment.\n\nThe indictment states that after receiving Chesebro's memo, Troupis said he planned to get it \"circulated at the White House.\" He later told Chesebro that he sent it to \"the real decisionmakers\" at the White House, court records show. The indictment goes on to lay out additional communications between the three co-defendants, including about the false elector certificates that were to be signed on Dec. 14 by the Trump electors from Wisconsin.\n\nAn email Chesebro sent to Trump campaign officials, Roman and the Republican National Committee on Dec. 11 identified Troupis as \"the one who floated early on the idea of the electors voting on Dec. 14,\" according to the indictment.\n\nTen electors for Trump and Pence, as well as Chesebro, met at the Wisconsin State Capitol on Dec. 14 and cast their Electoral College votes for the two Republicans, according to the court filing. Chesebro sent Troupis and Roman separate, identical messages stating, \"WI meeting of the *real* electors is a go!!!\" prosecutors said, as well as a photograph of the meeting.\n\nThe alleged efforts to overturn the results of the 2020 election to keep Trump in office have led to indictments in several battleground states, including Arizona, Michigan, Nevada and Georgia. Trump is facing 10 charges in an election-related case brought by prosecutors in Fulton County, Georgia, as well as federal charges in Washington, D.C., stemming from the alleged efforts to subvert the transfer of presidential power. He has pleaded not guilty to all counts.\n\nCheseboro, too, was charged in the sprawling racketeering case in Georgia. He pleaded guilty in October to one count of conspiracy to commit filing false documents. Prosecutors said he devised the strategy to appoint alternate electors in several states, which was part of the broader plot to overturn the results of the 2020 election.\n\nRoman, a longtime GOP operative, served as director of Election Day operations for Trump's 2020 campaign and was also charged in Fulton County. He faces seven counts there related to the fake elector scheme and has pleaded not guilty. Roman also was indicted in Arizona on charges stemming from the alleged attempt to keep Trump in office for a second term.\n\nTroupis briefly served as a circuit court judge in Wisconsin and represented Trump in the state during the last presidential election.\n\nAttorneys for the three men could not immediately be reached for comment.\n\nIn response to reports of the charges, Wisconsin Gov. Tony Evers, a Democrat, said, \"Good.\"", "source": {"uri": "cbsnews.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "CBS News"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

They use a state law suggesting that Chesebro, Troupis and Roman acted knowingly when they worked to collect and submit the false elector documentation.\n\nIn a press release announcing the charges, the Department of Justice said the charges are \"punishable by a fine not to exceed $10,000 or imprisonment not to exceed six years, or both.\"\n\n\"The criminal complaint in this case alleges that the defendants were part of a conspiracy to present a certificate of purported electoral votes from individuals who were not Wisconsin's duly appointed electors,\" Kaul said in the release.\n\nChesebro is considered the mastermind behind the plot, which extended to multiple swing states that Trump had lost in the days following the 2020 presidential election. In a memo he sent to Troupis, who was then the lead attorney for the Trump campaign in Wisconsin, he laid out a strategy to use \"alternate\" electors to contest the election results.\n\nChesebro and Troupis recently settled a civil lawsuit related to their actions in Wisconsin.\n\nIn December, the 10 Wisconsin Republicans who signed onto the false elector documents also settled that lawsuit, which alleged the plot helped pave the way to the deadly Jan. 6 riots at the U.S. Capitol. The false electors admitted no wrongdoing but said their actions were \"part of an attempt to improperly overturn the 2020 presidential election results.\"\n\nDefendants in that case have said they were attempting to preserve Trump's legal options as court cases challenging the election results made their way through the courts. Dozens of cases focused on the presidential election in both state and federal courts were either tossed or resolved in favor of President Joe Biden's victory in the contested battleground states.\n\nGov. Tony Evers responded to the news Tuesday with a one-word statement: \"Good.\"\n\nRoman, the third person charged, is a former Trump campaign aide who was also indicted in Trump's federal election interference case in Georgia.\n\nThe three men are due in court on Sept. 19, according to public court documents.\n\nThe announcement of the charges come five days after Trump was found guilty in New York criminal court of falsifying business records in a hush money payout during his 2016 campaign. Republican Sen. Ron Johnson - who reportedly called for Wisconsin's GOP-held Legislature, not voters, to determine the 2020 outcome - posted on X linking the two events.\n\n\"Now Democrats are weaponizing Wisconsin's judiciary,\" he wrote. \"Apparently conservative lawyers advising clients is illegal under Democrat tyranny.\"\n\nIn addition to Wisconsin, charges related to the false elector schemes have also been filed in Arizona, Nevada, Michigan and Georgia.\n\nRoman has been charged in both Arizona and Georgia, and Chesebro has pleaded guilty to charges in Georgia.\n\nThe plot allegedly was born in Wisconsin, however, with Troupis and Chesebro using Wisconsin as a testing ground for a strategy that expanded to other battleground states.\n\nThe 10 Wisconsin Republicans who signed their names to documentation include sitting Wisconsin Elections Commissioner Bob Spindell and former Wisconsin GOP Chair Andrew Hitt.\n\nHitt has alleged the group was \"tricked\" into thinking they were providing a contingency for the Republican candidate in the event that legal challenges went through. He said they were following the advice of lawyers when they met on Dec. 14, 2020 -- the constitutionally mandated day for state electors to cast ballots for the winner in a presidential race -- and did not know that they were part of a broader scheme.\n\n\"It's clear now that those documents were used on Jan. 6 to, at the very least, help create the chaos of that day,\" he said in a December

They faced a lawsuit from Democratic electors.\n\nThe 10 Republicans reached a settlement in that case, in which they acknowledged their actions were part of an attempt to overturn an election. Kaul could still file charges against them, but it looks unlikely.\n\nHere's what to know about the three people facing charges and their alleged roles in the scheme:\n\nChesebro is a Wisconsin Rapids native and a former campaign attorney for Trump. CNN reported in December that Chesebro was cooperating with investigators in four states, including Wisconsin. At that point, Kaul had not confirmed whether he was investigating the scheme.\n\nChesebro was the lead architect of the 2020 fake elector plan. Chesebro spelled out the plan in a memo dated Nov. 18, 2020 -- the same day Trump asked for recounts in Dane and Milwaukee counties.\n\nIt's unclear whether Chesebro worked for Trump or someone else. Chesebro sent a second memo on the matter on Dec. 9, 2020, after state officials certified President Joe Biden as the victor in Wisconsin.\n\nChesebro has entered into agreements in several states to give him some protection from prosecution. He has pleaded guilty in Georgia to conspiracy to commit filing false documents.\n\nChesebro was also revealed as the anonymous \"BadgerPundit\" account on X, formerly Twitter. He used the account to urge Republicans to use Trump electors or Republican-led state legislatures to overturn Trump's loss.\n\nJim Troupis is a former Dane County Circuit Court judge from Cross Plains who was hired by Trump's campaign to oversee recounts. He received those memos from Chesebro.\n\nIn a settlement in the case filed by Democratic electors, Chesebro and Troupis did not admit wrongdoing but agreed to not prepare \"alternate electoral votes\" in future campaigns. Troupis paid an undisclosed amount as part of that agreement.\n\nEmails released by Troupis and Cheesebro in that settlement showed they coordinated legal strategies during recounts of ballots in Dane and Milwaukee counties, during which Troupis sought to throw out thousands of absentee ballots that were cast in person through early voting.\n\nMike Roman is a former Trump aide who allegedly delivered the fake elector paperwork to congressional staffers in order to get them to Vice President Mike Pence, who ultimately rejected them.\n\nRecords released as part of the settlement show Roman was in contact with Troupis on Jan. 6, 2021, and U.S. Sen. Ron Johnson's chief of staff in order to pass along the slates of Wisconsin's false electors to Pence.\n\nJohnson has maintained he did not know he was trying to deliver fake elector packets to Pence despite texts released in the settlement showing he was explicitly told the documents were about the electors.\n\nKaul has filed the felony forgery charges in Dane County Circuit Court. Court records show Chesebro, Troupis and Roman are due in court on Sept. 19.\n\nWhile the three Trump associates above are now charged in Wisconsin, the 10 people who signed documents agreeing to be electors for Trump were not. Those include:\n\nMore: Here are the 10 people who participated in Wisconsin's fake elector scheme in 2020\n\nJournal Sentinel reporter Molly Beck contributed to this story.", "source": {"uri":

The news was first reported by WISN's Matt Smith.\n\nAttorney General Josh Kaul will formerly announce legal action in the \"unappointed electors\" case at a news conference Tuesday afternoon.\n\nAccording to previous reports, two attorneys for then-President Donald Trump orchestrated a plan for fake electors to file paperwork falsely saying the Republican won Wisconsin in a strategy to overturn Joe Biden's 2020 victory there and in other swing states, according to a lawsuit settlement reached back in March.\n\nUnder their agreements, Kenneth Chesebro and Jim Troupis turned over more than 1,400 pages of documents, emails, and text messages, along with photos and video, offering a detailed account of the scheme's origins in Wisconsin. The communications show how they, with coordination from Trump campaign officials, replicated the strategy in six other states including Georgia, where Chesebro has already pleaded guilty to charges stemming from the 2020 election.\n\n.............\n\nRead more: https://www.wbay.com/2024/06/04/charges-filed-against-three-people-2020-fake-electors-scheme/", "source": {"uri": "democraticunderground.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Democratic Underground"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trump_fake_electors_plot", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Trump fake electors plot"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Josh_Kaul", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Josh Kaul"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Attorney_General", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "United States Attorney General"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wisconsin", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Wisconsin"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Wisconsin"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_House_Select_Committee_on_the_January_6_Attack", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States House Select Committee on the January 6 Attack"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WISN-TV", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "WISN-TV"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WBAY-TV", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "WBAY-TV"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Master_of_Arts", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Master of Arts"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Biden", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swing_state", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Swing state"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lawsuit", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Lawsuit"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republican_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Republican Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump_2016_presidential_campaign", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump 2016 presidential campaign"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2020_United_States_presidential_election", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "2020 United States presidential election"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Georgia_(U.S._state)", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Georgia (U.S. state)"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Georgia (U.S. state)"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues", "wgt": 9}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Business", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Business", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Software/File_Management", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Software/File Management", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Activism", "label": "dmoz/Society/Activism", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Activism/Media", "label": "dmoz/Society/Activism/Media", "wgt": 9}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 85}], "image": null, "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9623993", "eventUri": "eng-9623993", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.0980392156862745, "wgt": 203, "relevance": 1}

In a memo he sent to Troupis, who was then the lead attorney for the Trump campaign in Wisconsin, he laid out a strategy to use \"alternate\" electors to contest the election results.\n\nChesebro and Troupis recently settled a civil lawsuit related to their actions in Wisconsin.\n\nIn December, the 10 Wisconsin Republicans who signed onto the false elector documents also settled that lawsuit, which alleged the plot helped pave the way to the deadly Jan. 6 riots at the U.S. Capitol. The false electors admitted no wrongdoing but said their actions were \"part of an attempt to improperly overturn the 2020 presidential election results.\"\n\nDefendants in that case have said they were attempting to preserve Trump's legal options as court cases challenging the election results made their way through the courts. Dozens of such cases in both state and federal courts were either tossed or resolved in favor of President Joe Biden's victory in the contested battleground states.\n\nGov.

He said they were following the advice of lawyers when they met on Dec. 14, 2020 -- the constitutionally mandated day for state electors to cast ballots for the winner in a presidential race -- and did not know that they were part of a broader scheme.\n\n\"It's clear now that those documents were used on Jan. 6 to, at the very least, help create the chaos of that day,\" he said in a December

(Alyssa Pointer/Getty Images)\n\nWisconsin's attorney general, Josh Kaul, filed felony forgery charges Tuesday against one of former President Donald Trump's aides and two attorneys who worked on the scheme to have fake electors overturn the 2020 election.\n\nThe charges against the three men -- Kenneth Chesebro, Jim Troupis, and Michael Roman -- are classified as class H felonies, punishable by a fine of up to $10,000 and up to six years in prison.\n\nState prosecutors first filed the charges against anyone who appeared to be involved in the scheme, wherein 10 Wisconsin Republicans met in the state capitol and signed paperwork falsely claiming to be legitimate electors for Trump after Biden won.\n\nChesebro orchestrated the overall scheme, the Guardian reported. He emailed Troupis, the former judge who represented Trump in Wisconsin during the 2020 election, five days after the election to discuss overturning Biden's 21,000 vote victory in Wisconsin. Over the next few months, the two developed the fake electors scheme.\n\nLater, Chesebro worked with Roman, Trump's former director of election day operations, who delivered the fake elector paperwork to a Pennsylvania congressman's staffer, aiming for it to reach Vice President Mike Pence on Jan. 6, 2021. Trump was able to seek a recount in Dane and Milwaukee counties only to confirm Biden's win, the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel reported.\n\nThe criminal complaint filed against Chesebro and Roman detailed a text exchange between the two about changing the language in their fake elector certificates to be more conditional than the ones that were ultimately signed by the fraudulent electors. The text messages reveal that Roman disagreed with Chesebro on the changes, which were intended to limit their legal liability, and when the attorney offered to help out with the draft, Roman simply wrote: \"fuck these guys.\"\n\nChesebro pleaded guilty to his role in the scheme in a different case in Georgia earlier this year. He is also believed to be one of the unidentified co-conspirators mentioned by special counsel Jack Smith in his federal election interference indictment of Donald Trump last year.\n\nRoman still faces charges in Georgia and is a defendant in an Arizona fake elector case that also involves Chesebro.

Five days after the election, he emailed Troupis, a retired judge who was leading the Trump campaign's legal efforts in Wisconsin, to muse about the possibility of throwing out Joe Biden's win in Wisconsin and appointing a Trump slate of electors. The two developed the scheme over the next few months. Chesebro would later work with Roman to coordinate the efforts across states and to get the slates of fake electors to Washington.\n\nChesebro pleaded guilty to conspiracy to filing false documents for his role in the scheme in a separate case in Georgia earlier this year.

James Troupis, a former judge and Trump campaign attorney, was also charged in connection with the fake electors scheme.\n\nChesebro, Roman and Troupis are all charged with felony forgery, according to court records. They are charged for their role in getting a slate of pro-Trump electors to sign paperwork attesting, falsely, that Trump had won Wisconsin in the 2020 election. Similar slates of fake electors for Trump were organized in several states and charges have been brought in Arizona, Michigan, Nevada and Georgia.\n\nWisconsin Attorney General Josh Kaul, a Democrat who brought the case, did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\nThe fake electors scheme is a major component of the charges that special counsel Jack Smith has brought against Trump in federal court in Washington, D.C. That case, assigned to U.S. District Judge Tanya Chutkan, is currently on hold while the Supreme Court decides on Trump's claim of absolute immunity from prosecution. The trial is unlikely to go forward before Election Day.\n\nChesebro and Troupis previously settled a lawsuit related to the fake electors in Wisconsin that resulted in the release of more than 1,000 pages of emails and text messages, though neither man admitted any liability or culpability. The released documents revealed more information about the scheme in Wisconsin, and 10 of the fake electors in the Badger State admitted as part of litigation in December that President Joe Biden won the state in 2020.", "source": {"uri": "nbcnews.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "NBC News"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trump_fake_electors_plot", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Trump fake electors plot"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2020_United_States_presidential_election", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "2020 United States presidential election"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump_2016_presidential_campaign", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump 2016 presidential campaign"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lawyer", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Lawyer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wisconsin", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Wisconsin"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Wisconsin"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_House_Select_Committee_on_the_January_6_Attack", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States House Select Committee on the January 6 Attack"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plea_bargain", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Plea bargain"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Election_Day_(United_States)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Election Day (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philadelphia", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Philadelphia"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Philadelphia"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Georgia_(U.S._state)", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Georgia (U.S. state)"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Georgia (U.S. state)"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Washington,_D.C.", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Washington, D.C."}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Washington, D.C."}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Josh_Kaul", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Josh Kaul"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Attorney_General", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United States Attorney General"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Felony", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Felony"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_district_court", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United States district court"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Democratic Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arizona", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Arizona"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Arizona"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nevada", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Nevada"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Nevada"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michigan", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Michigan"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Michigan"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jack_Smith_(lawyer)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Jack Smith (lawyer)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special_counsel", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Special counsel"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tanya_S._Chutkan", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Tanya S.

Pennsylvania fake electors avoided charges by adding qualifying language to their forms that stated that suggested that they were only electors if the state's election results were overturned.\n\nThere were seven swing states in the 2020 election, and five of them have filed criminal charges as participants in Trump's plot.\n\nIt is impossible to know if these criminal charges will influence voters in those states. However, the national media tends to overlook the significance of these cases as they view presidential elections from a national perspective instead of what they really are: a series of 50 individual state elections.\n\nTrump tried to cheat the voters in these states in 2020, and he is already planning on trying to do so again in 2024. The state-level cases only make it more difficult for Trump to shake the convicted felon label.\n\nThe bad news keeps coming for Trump as his alleged crimes of 2020 will not go away in states that will be critical to the 2024 outcome.\n\nA Special Message From PoliticusUSA\n\nIf you are in a position to donate purely to help us keep the doors open on PoliticusUSA during what is a critical

The attorney general in New Mexico said the state's laws prevent criminal prosecution there, and Pennsylvania's top prosecutor at the time made similar remarks.\n\nChesebro and Roman were previously indicted alongside Trump in Georgia over similar alleged conduct.\n\nChesebro has since pleaded guilty and agreed to cooperate, while Roman maintains his innocence. He first revealed the accusations of misconduct against Fulton County District Attorney Fani Willis's (D) over her romance with a top prosecutor on the case. Roman also faces charges in Arizona.\n\nChesebro reportedly sat for interviews in Arizona and Nevada, where charges were eventually filed against several Republicans, including top Trump allies.\n\nIn Wisconsin, none of the 10 individuals who signed the Electoral College documents have been charged, though they have faced civil litigation.\n\nThough Tuesday marks the first criminal charges against Chesebro and Troupis in Wisconsin, they faced a civil lawsuit brought by Democrats there in 2022, which was settled in March. As part of the agreement, they turned over more than 1,400 documents and agreed never to participate in similar efforts, though the agreement did not include any admission of wrongdoing or liability.\n\nThe Hill requested comment from Wisconsin Attorney General Josh Kaul's (D) office.\n\n\"Good,\" Wisconsin Gov.

(AP) -- Wisconsin Attorney General Josh Kaul filed felony forgery charges against two attorneys and an aide who helped submit paperwork falsely saying that former President Donald Trump had won the battleground state in 2020.\n\nThe charges were filed against Trump attorneys Kenneth Chesebro and Jim Troupis and former Trump aide Mike Roman who allegedly delivered Wisconsin's fake elector paperwork to a Pennsylvania congressman's staffer in order to get them to Vice President Mike Pence on Jan. 6, 2021.\n\nAll three are due in Dane County Circuit Court on Sept. 19, according to court records.\n\nKaul, a Democrat, has faced pressure to bring action against the 10 fake electors, who have yet to be charged with any criminal wrongdoing. He has previously suggested that he was relying on federal investigators while also not ruling out a state probe.\n\nPeople are also reading...

The winner of the popular vote in each state determines which party's electors are sent to the Electoral College, which meets in December after the election to certify the outcome.\n\nThe fake elector efforts are central to an August federal indictment filed against Trump alleging he tried to overturn results of the 2020 election. Federal prosecutors, investigating his conduct related to the Jan. 6, 2021, U.S. Capitol riot, have also said the scheme originated in Wisconsin. Trump also faces charges in Georgia and has denied wrongdoing.\n\nMichigan and Nevada have also criminally charged fake electors.\n\nThe Wisconsin electors, Chesebro and Troup all settled a civil lawsuit that was brought against them last year.\n\nDocuments released as part of those settlements showed that the strategy in Wisconsin replicated moves in six other swing states.\n\nTrump lost Wisconsin to Biden, a Democrat, by fewer than 21,000 votes. Trump carried Wisconsin by a similar margin in 2016.\n\nWisconsin is one of a handful of swing states again this year.\n\nGovernment and outside investigationshave uniformly found there was no evidence of widespread voter fraud that could have swung the 2020 election. But Trump has continued to spread falsehoods about the election, particularly in Wisconsin.\n\nCopyright 2024 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.

For Troupis, it's the first time facing criminal charges connected to the alleged scheme. All three face the same single count of forgery, which stems from their role soliciting and delivering false sets of elector certificates to Congress in December 2020.\n\nThe criminal charges from Wisconsin Attorney General Josh Kaul, a Democrat, had not yet been officially announced on Tuesday morning, but the charging papers were publicly available on a court docket for Dane County, where the state capital, Madison, is located.\n\nWisconsin is the fifth state to level charges against participants in the elector scheme, but it has special significance because the scheme was largely hatched there. Chesebro was deputized by Troupis to craft an elector strategy in November 2020 focused primarily on Wisconsin. But as Trump grew increasingly desperate to stave off his defeat in the 2020 election, Troupis promoted Chesebro's efforts to the national campaign, which quickly opted to export it to other states as part of a national strategy.\n\nEventually, Chesebro became the point-man for Trump and his allies to coordinate the slates of false electors in seven states. Would-be pro-Trump electors have been charged in Arizona, Georgia, Michigan and Nevada.\n\nSpecial counsel Jack Smith also labeled Chesebro an unindicted co-conspirator in Trump's criminal case in Washington, D.C., citing him as the source of Trump's increasingly fringe legal and political strategy.\n\nChesebro pleaded guilty to a single charge in Georgia and received a nominal sentence. He cooperated with investigators in Arizona and was labeled an unindicted co-conspirator there. He has also been the subject of civil lawsuits in Michigan and Wisconsin that have shed light on his extraordinary efforts on Trump's behalf.", "source": {"uri": "yahoo.com", "dataType": "news",

The three are set to make their initial appearances in Dane County Circuit Court on Sept. 19, court records show. Violators face up to six years in prison and a fine of up to $10,000.\n\nChesebro, an attorney, wrote a six-page memo in December 2020 that laid out a plan for organizing Trump's supporters to serve as fake electors after that year's presidential election in crucial swing states where he lost. The plot entailed those so-called alternate electors meeting on Dec. 14, 2020, when legitimate members of the Electoral College would meet to certify the results of their states' elections. The fake electors would also sign false certifications claiming Trump won. As part of the scheme, then-Vice President Mike Pence would count their state electoral votes as cast for Trump, even though President Biden had won their states, during a joint session of Congress on Jan. 6, 2021.\n\nThe alleged efforts to overturn the results of the 2020 election to keep Trump in office have led to indictments in several battleground states, including Arizona, Michigan, Nevada and Georgia. Trump is facing 10 charges in an election-related case brought by prosecutors in Fulton County, Georgia, as well as federal charges in Washington, D.C., stemming from the alleged efforts to subvert the transfer of presidential power. He has pleaded not guilty to all counts.\n\nCheseboro, too, was charged in the sprawling racketeering case in Georgia. He pleaded guilty in October to one count of conspiracy to commit filing false documents. Prosecutors said he devised the strategy to appoint alternate electors in several states, which was part of the broader plot to overturn the results of the 2020 election.\n\nRoman, a longtime GOP operative, served as director of Election Day operations for Trump's 2020 campaign and was also charged in Fulton County. He faces seven counts there related to the fake elector scheme and has pleaded not guilty. Roman also was indicted in Arizona on charges stemming from the alleged attempt to keep Trump in office for a second term.\n\nTroupis briefly served as a circuit court judge in Wisconsin and represented Trump in the state during the last presidential election.\n\nAttorneys for the three men could not immediately be reached for comment.\n\nIn response to reports of the charges, Wisconsin Gov.

Chesebro, a former attorney for Trump's 2020 election campaign, is considered one of the masterminds behind the fake elector scheme to undermine the Electoral College by submitting alternative, pro-Trump slates of electors. In October, Chesebro accepted a plea deal after being charged for his participation in a similar scheme -- alongside Trump and more than a dozen of his allies -- in Georgia.\n\nRoman, a former aide to Trump, is also a co-defendant in the Georgia case. Troupis, a former Wisconsin judge and adviser to the 2020 Trump campaign, is being charged for the first time for his participation in the scheme despite his alleged role in distributing the plan to multiple states.\n\nWisconsin's Democratic Governor Tony Evers issued a one-word response to news of the indictments: \"Good.\"\n\nThrough the indictment, the Badger State becomes the fifth swing state to level charges against individuals involved in the fake elector scheme. The other states include Georgia, Michigan, Nevada, and Arizona.\n\nIn April, Arizona Attorney General Kristin Mayes (D) charged 18 individuals -- including Trump allies and advisers Rudy Giuliani, Mark Meadows, and John Eastman -- with participating in a scheme to meddle with the state's 2020 election results. \"Defendants deceived the citizens of Arizona by falsely claiming that those votes were contingent only on a legal challenge that would change the outcome of the election,\" the indictment said. \"In reality, Defendants intended that their false votes for Trump-Pence would encourage Pence to reject the Biden-Harris votes on January 6, 2021, regardless of the outcome of the legal challenge.\"", "source": {"uri": "rollingstone.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Rolling Stone"},

(1), knowing it to have been thus falsely made or altered.\"\n\nThe cross-referenced statute -- referred to as \"sub. (1)\" -- makes it a crime for anyone who \"with intent to defraud falsely makes or alters a writing or object of any of the following kinds so that it purports to have been made by another, or at another time, or with different provisions, or by authority of one who did not give such authority.\"\n\nThe crime carries a maximum sentence of six years in state prison.\n\nWisconsin Attorney General Josh Kaul said he will hold a press conference at noon on Tuesday \"to announce legal action in unappointed electors conspiracy,\" according to WISN reporter Matt Smith.\n\nUnder the auspices of the fake electors scheme, several dozen Republican Party officials and laypeople across the country worked to have several swing states' Electoral College votes swapped over to Donald Trump -- despite the 45th president losing the vote in each of those states to Joe Biden. In each case, false declarations were signed by would-be \"alternate\" electors. Corresponding lawsuits were filed that aimed to then have those putative Trump electors.\n\nIn each state, the parallel litigation failed, as did the entire scheme -- but in Wisconsin, the legal efforts, at least, came close to success.\n\nAs Law&Crime previously reported, Troupis was the lead attorney in a lawsuit that made its way to the Wisconsin Supreme Court -- and very nearly prevailed. In that case, the high court rejected Trump's effort to disqualify ballots in two, and only two, diverse counties -- Milwaukee and Dane -- where the majority of the Badger State's Black residents live. That rejection, however, was only carried by a 4-3 vote.\n\nWisconsin Supreme Court Justice Jill Karofsky had the following admonition for Trump's lawyer during oral arguments in December 2020: \"This lawsuit, Mr. Troupis, smacks of racism.\"\n\nA lawsuit filed by Wisconsin voters and Democrats in 2022 against Chesebro and Troupis was settled in December 2023 -- with each man averring they will never again engage in the same or similar activity, but otherwise not admitting any fault, wrongdoing, or liability.\n\nIn March, 1,400 pages worth of texts and emails between Chesebro and Troupis were released from the settled lawsuit. The documents reveal efforts to keep the fake electors scheme secret and to create a \"cloud of confusion\" as election overthrow efforts ramped up.\n\nMore Law&Crime coverage: Trump campaign PAC paid legal fees to law firm representing co-defendant and 'coup memo' author in RICO case\n\nChesebro authored some so-called \"coup memos\" that offered legal opinions on how Trump's team could overturn the results of the 2020 presidential election in a \"constitutionally defensible manner.\"\n\nCharged by Fulton County District Attorney Fani Willis over his role, Chesebro pleaded guilty to one count of conspiracy to commit filing false documents, a felony, on Oct. 20, 2023. Prosecutors recommended five years probation, community service, and the payment of restitution.\n\nBefore his plea deal, the pro-Trump attorney faced time behind bars as he was charged with one count of Georgia's homegrown RICO act, one count of conspiracy to commit impersonating a public officer, two counts of conspiracy to commit forgery in the first degree, two counts of conspiracy to commit false statements and writing, and one count of conspiracy to commit filing false documents.\n\nMore Law&Crime coverage: Pro-Trump lawyer who already pleaded guilty to election felony in Georgia 'needs' to travel to other states, 'meet with counsel' as fake elector probes ramp up\n\nRoman is also charged in the Georgia case -- where he is currently part of a group of defendants attempting to have the district attorney's office disqualified before the state's court of appeal.

An initial appearance has been scheduled for Sept. 19. All three face one felony count punishable by up to six years in prison and fines of up to $10,000.\n\nDemocratic Gov. Tony Evers issued a one-word statement to the news of the charges.\n\n\"Good,\" Evers said Tuesday.\n\nOn Dec. 14, 2020, a slate of 10 Republican electors gathered at the state Capitol to sign documents declaring Trump the winner. On the same day, Democratic electors cast the state's actual Electoral College votes for Joe Biden, who defeated Trump in the battleground state by almost 21,000 votes.\n\nState Republicans have said the meeting took place on the advice of attorneys and was based on precedent -- specifically, when Hawaii electors from both parties convened in public during a genuine dispute over the 1960 presidential election in that state.\n\n4 in 10 Wisconsin county clerks will be running their first presidential election this year\n\nFormer state GOP chair Andrew Hitt has previously said the Wisconsin electors were \"tricked and misled into participating in what became the alternate elector scheme and would have never taken any actions had we known that there were ulterior reasons beyond preserving an ongoing legal strategy.\"\n\nThe meeting of Republican electors occurred after a Nov. 18, 2020, memo from Chesebro detailing the plan to Troupis. On the same day, Trump's campaign requested recounts in Wisconsin's Dane and Milwaukee counties.\n\nDocuments have underscored efforts by those in Trump's inner circle to circumvent the Electoral College process in several states, including Wisconsin, after the 2020 election, despite recounts and court decisions affirming Biden's victory.\n\nName of Dane County judge overseeing Act 10 lawsuit appears on Scott Walker recall petition\n\nThose who signed the false documents in Wisconsin falsely asserting Trump won are: Hitt; Robert Spindell, a Republican member of the Wisconsin Elections Commission; 8th Congressional District GOP chair Kelly Ruh; former 1st Congressional District GOP vice chair Carol Brunner; former Dane County Republican Party chair Scott Grabins; 3rd Congressional District GOP chair Bill Feehan; second vice chair of the state GOP Kathy Kiernan; former 6th Congressional District GOP chair Darryl Carlson; former 7th Congressional District GOP vice chair Pam Travis; and Mary Buestrin, former member of the Republican National Committee.\n\nFacing a civil lawsuit over the effort, the 10 Republicans in December retracted the document, acknowledged Joe Biden won the election and admitted their actions furthered a scheme to illegally overturn the election under a legal settlement announced Wednesday.\n\nAs part of the settlement in the civil case with the liberal law firm Law Forward, the 10 Republicans agreed to never serve as presidential electors in any presidential election involving Trump, who is seeking the party's nomination next year. They have also agreed to cooperate with any ongoing or future U.S. Department of Justice investigations related to the 2020 presidential election.\n\nThis story will be updated.\n\nLove 1 Funny 0 Wow

The woman was forced to carry the fetus to term. The fetus died, and the woman had to have a hysterectomy. Sotomayor asked whether that would be covered under Idaho's law.\n\n\"I'm kind of shocked, actually,\" Barrett said. \"Because I thought your own expert had said below that these kinds of cases were covered, and you're now saying they're not?\"\n\nAfter Turner tried to explain, Barrett interrupted him.\n\n\"You're hedging,\" she said. \"I mean, Justice Sotomayor is asking you would this be covered or not?

They've been claiming that Idaho's laws don't prevent doctors from providing care meant to preserve a patient's health.\n\nBut we've been hearing horror stories of women having to carry nonviable fetuses, or continue pregnancy even if it means long-term health effects and eliminating the ability to become pregnant ever again.\n\nAs the Idaho Statesman's Nicole Blanchard reported Monday, St. Luke's hospital has transported six patients out of state this year for pregnancy complications, and the Idaho Capital Sun reported they were airlifted out of state. Some Idaho doctors are advising pregnant patients to carry insurance for air ambulance transports, which can cost tens of thousands of dollars.\n\nThink about that.

That includes treatment to prevent serious damage to bodily functions.\n\nIf the court decides the law does not provide that protection, then hospitals and doctors in Idaho have said they will have to continue transferring patients out of state for that treatment. Since January, when the court decided to take the case and struck down an injunction that provided protection under EMTALA, transfers out of state for pregnancy complications that may require termination increased from one in 2023 to six over the course of four months.\n\nThe court's liberal wing -- Justices Sonia Sotomayor, Elena Kagan and Ketanji Brown Jackson -- questioned Idaho Deputy Attorney General Josh Turner about what EMTALA explicitly says about stabilizing treatment and whether abortion procedures fall into that definition when complications occur before a fetus can survive outside of the womb.\n\nTurner argued that Idaho's law should supersede federal law in the case of abortion procedures, even if it goes against commonly accepted medical care standards.\n\nSotomayor rejected that argument.\n\n\"There is no state licensing law that would permit the state to say, 'Don't treat diabetics with insulin. Treat them only with pills,'\" Sotomayor said. \"Federal law would say you can't do that.\"\n\nShe said federal law requires treatment of a person who is at risk of serious medical complications without that treatment, but Idaho's law does not provide that much leeway.\n\n\"Idaho law says the doctor has to determine not that there's really a serious medical condition, but that the person will die. That's a huge difference, counsel,\" she said.\n\nIdaho's abortion ban went into effect in August 2022, a few months after the U.S. Supreme Court issued its Dobbs v. Jackson Women's Health Organization decision that overturned Roe v. Wade, ending federal protection for abortion access and allowing states to regulate it instead. Providers who are prosecuted for performing an abortion are subject to two to five years in prison plus the loss of their medical license, and they are also subject to civil enforcement laws by any family members related to the person who had the abortion.\n\nDoctors are subject to prosecutorial discretion in Idaho, deputy AG says\n\nThe justices repeatedly asked Turner to identify situations where a doctor might provide an abortion as part of stabilizing care and it would not be allowed under Idaho law. He continued to point to the state's exception to save a patient's life and referred to a doctor's \"good faith medical judgment\" being enough to avoid prosecution.\n\nThe government listed nine emergency medical conditions where termination of the pregnancy may be the recommended treatment to stabilize a patient's condition, including when the water breaks before a fetus is viable or when a patient experiences uncontrolled high blood pressure or bleeding. Idaho doctors identified one recent \"traumatic\" case when a patient had to wait until advanced infection set in before the doctor felt secure enough to end the pregnancy. Others are sending patients out of state as soon as termination might be needed to avoid having to wait until they meet qualifications under Idaho's exception to prevent death.\n\nJustice Amy Coney Barrett, considered one of the court's more conservative members, said Turner was hedging in his answers and asked what happens if another doctor or prosecutor reaches a contrary conclusion about what the appropriate medical treatment should have been.\n\n\"That, your honor, is the nature of prosecutorial discretion,\" Turner said.\n\nBarrett also asked if Idaho had released any legal guidance about its abortion laws, the way a federal health agency might issue guidance. Turner said the \"guiding star\" is the Idaho Supreme Court's opinion from August 2022 interpreting the abortion statute, where it said the law does not require imminence of death or medical certainty for a physician to intervene. The Idaho court also said another doctor's opinion would only be considered if they accused the doctor who performed the abortion of acting in bad faith.\n\nU.S. Solicitor General Elizabeth Prelogar said for those reasons, women in Idaho are not getting the treatment they need, often in already-tragic situations where a wanted pregnancy is lost because of complications.\n\n\"They are getting airlifted to Salt Lake City and to neighboring states where there are health exceptions in their laws,\" she said. \"The doctors can't provide the care until they can conclude that a prosecutor looking over their shoulder won't second guess that maybe it wasn't really necessary to prevent death.\"\n\nConservatives ask about conscience objections, expansion of 'emergency' definition\n\nThe more conservative justices offered mixed questions to Prelogar, who argued on behalf of the government. Justice Neil Gorsuch posed questions related to the federal Supremacy Clause about when federal law can override state law in the context of medicine, while Barrett asked whether conscience exceptions exist for doctors who don't feel comfortable terminating a pregnancy even in emergency situations. Or if a hospital did not want to provide the procedure, such as a Catholic hospital, would be exempt under EMTALA for conscience reasons. One of Idaho's largest hospital systems, Saint Alphonsus, is a Catholic hospital.\n\nPrelogar confirmed that yes, individual doctors and entire medical entities qualify for those conscience objections and are therefore not required to perform an abortion under EMTALA. But at a hospital that did not have a blanket objection, they would take individual objections into consideration for appropriate staffing so that there is always someone available to provide that care if necessary.\n\n\"If the question is, could you force an individual doctor to step in over a conscience objection, the answer is no, and I want to be really clear about that,\" Prelogar said.\n\nJustice Sam Alito also asked Prelogar if EMTALA could be understood to apply to other emergency situations such as a mental health emergency, if someone was expressing suicidal thoughts and wanted to end their pregnancy to resolve those thoughts. Idaho's legal representation, conservative religious law firm Alliance Defending Freedom, argued in its brief to the court that a ruling in favor of EMTALA protection would allow such situations to occur. Prelogar said no, the proper treatment would be to administer medications to alleviate the suicidal thoughts.\n\n\"There can be grave mental health emergencies, but EMTALA could never require pregnancy termination as the stabilizing care ... because that wouldn't do anything to address the underlying brain chemistry issue that's causing the mental health emergency in the first place,\" Prelogar said. \"If she happens to be pregnant, it would be incredibly unethical to terminate her pregnancy. She might not be in a position to give any informed consent.\"\n\nDemonstrators, legislators from Idaho comment on court case\n\nHundreds of abortion rights advocates, medical professionals and two Idaho legislators gathered outside the U.S. Supreme Court building in Washington, D.C., on Wednesday morning before the arguments advocating for the court to uphold EMTALA as a guiding principle regardless of state abortion laws. On the anti-abortion rights side, Idaho-based crisis pregnancy center Stanton Healthcare argued the case was about forcing states with abortion bans to perform them. Danielle Versluys, the organization's chief operating officer, said women with complications should deliver a baby naturally, regardless of the circumstances.\n\n\"The outcome is the same -- a dead baby -- but the difference is one is natural, and the other is not,\" she said. \"And one allows the woman the natural process to give birth and to grieve, and the other one is unnatural.\"\n\nRep. Ilana Rubel, a Democrat and the legislature's minority leader, told States Newsroom the case is a waste of state taxpayer dollars.\n\n\"It is, frankly, stunning that leaders in our state think that this is something they want so badly they were willing to take it to the Supreme Court to deprive women of appropriate care in medical emergencies,\" Rubel said. And with the Idaho Legislature adjourned for the year, she added, \"If the Supreme Court does not give us EMTALA back, there will be no lifeline for women at least until 2025.\"", "source": {"uri": "truthdig.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Truthdig: Expert Reporting, Current News, Provocative Columnists"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emergency_Medical_Treatment_and_Active_Labor_Act", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Emergency Medical Treatment and Active Labor Act"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sonia_Sotomayor", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Sonia Sotomayor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supreme_Court_of_the_United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Supreme Court of the United States"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Law_of_the_United_States", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Law of the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pregnancy", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Pregnancy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abortion", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Abortion"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Idaho", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Idaho"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Idaho"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dobbs_v._Jackson_Women's_Health_Organization", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Dobbs v.

United States on Thursday. The case focuses on Idaho's abortion ban, which says that anyone who performs an abortion is subject to criminal penalties. There is an exception for abortions when it is necessary to protect the life of a pregnant woman, but the Biden administration sued, arguing that federal law requires hospitals to provide appropriate emergency room care, which could include abortions.\n\nDuring Idaho's rebuttal, attorney Joshua Turner told Justice Sonia Sotomayor that those decisions would be \"very case-by-case\" when asked if a patient who was at risk of losing her reproductive organs would be enough to trigger the hospital's duty to perform an abortion. His comments prompted Barrett to interject.\n\n\"I'm kind of shocked actually because I thought your own expert had said below that these kinds of cases were covered but you're now saying they're not?\" the conservative justice asked Turner.\n\nWhen Turner tried to say that's not what he was saying, Barrett countered, \"Well, you're hedging.\"\n\n\"I mean, Justice Sotomayor is asking you, would this be covered or not, and it was my understanding that the legislature's witnesses said that these would be covered,\" Barrett told him.\n\nIn response, Turner said, \"Yeah, and those doctors said if they were exercising their medical judgment, they could in good faith determine that life-saving care was necessary. And that's my point -- \" before Barrett interrupted again to ask, \"But some doctor's couldn't.\"\n\nAsked by Barrett if doctors who did come to the conclusion that an abortion was necessary could be prosecuted under Idaho law, Turner replied, \"That, your honor, is the nature of prosecutorial discretion.\"\n\nBarrett emerged as one of two key votes deciding the case on Thursday. Barrett and Chief Justice John Roberts both posed tough questions to Turner and General Solicitor Elizabeth Prelogar, while their conservative colleagues showed sympathy for Idaho and suggested that they saw the case as federal overreach into what should be state power.\n\nBecause the court has a 6-3 conservative majority, the Biden administration needs at least two conservative justices to join the court's three liberals and side with the federal government. Sotomayor, as well as Justices Elena Kagan and Ketanji Brown Jackson, were in agreement with Prelogar's arguments that doctors and women in Idaho were \"facing an impossible position\" because of the state's abortion ban.\n\nThe Idaho law was enacted in 2020 but could only go into effect if the Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade, which it did in a bombshell decision in 2022. Moyle v. United States is one of several abortion clashes that have gone before the High Court since the fall of Roe.\n\nLast month, the Supreme Court heard a Texas case that challenges the Food and Drug Administration's approval of mifepristone, a pill used in more than 60 percent of U.S. abortions. Some of the most notable questioning came from conservative Justice Neil Gorsuch, who questioned why nationwide relief would be needed and, at one point, defended the concerns of one of his liberal colleagues.\n\nAbortion has emerged as a key 2024 campaign issue. Earlier this month, Arizona's state Supreme Court upheld a near-total abortion ban -- a development that earned a rebuke from some of the nation's most conservative figures. President Joe Biden has blamed presumptive Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump for the new restrictions taking place across the country, while Trump has moved closer to the middle on the issue.\n\nA day before the Arizona decision came down, Trump had said in a video shared on his social media accounts, \"My view is now that we have abortion where everyone wanted it from a legal standpoint, the states will determine by vote or legislation, or perhaps both. And whatever they decide must be the law of the land. In this case, the law of the state.\"\n\n\"I am strongly in favor of exceptions for rape, incest, and life of the mother. You must follow your heart on this issue,\" the former president said. \"But remember, you must also win elections to restore our culture and in fact, to save our country, which is currently and very sadly, a nation in decline.", "source": {"uri": "newsweek.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Newsweek"}, "authors": [{"uri": "katherine_fung@newsweek.com", "name": "Katherine Fung", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sonia_Sotomayor", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Sonia Sotomayor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supreme_Court_of_the_United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Supreme Court of the United States"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conservatism", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Conservatism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lawyer", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Lawyer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abortion", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Abortion"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Idaho", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Idaho"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Idaho"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Presidency_of_Joe_Biden", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Presidency of Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oral_argument", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Oral argument"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amy_Coney_Barrett", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Amy Coney Barrett"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abortion_law", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Abortion law"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Law_of_the_United_States", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Law of the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elizabeth_Prelogar", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Elizabeth Prelogar"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liberalism", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Liberalism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Roberts", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "John Roberts"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_government_of_the_United_States", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Federal government of the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dobbs_v._Jackson_Women's_Health_Organization", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Dobbs v.

(Photo by Sofia Resnick | States Newsroom)\n\nU.S. Supreme Court justices spent two hours Wednesday debating whether a federal law about emergency treatment encompasses abortion care even in states with strict abortion bans, with no clear indication of how they may ultimately rule.\n\nA decision could come as soon as the end of June to decide whether Idaho's near-total abortion ban means doctors who might need to terminate a pregnancy during a health emergency would be protected from prosecution under the Emergency Medical Treatment and Labor Act, or EMTALA, a federal law that requires hospitals to treat patients who come to an emergency room regardless of their ability to pay.\n\nIf the court decides it does not provide that protection, then hospitals and doctors in Idaho have said they will have to continue transferring patients out of state for that treatment. Since January, when the court decided to take the case and struck down an injunction that provided protection under EMTALA, the number of transfers out of state for pregnancy complications that may require termination has increased from one in 2023 to six over the course of four months.\n\nThe arguments began with aggressive questioning of Idaho Deputy Attorney General Josh Turner by the court's more liberal justices, Justices Sonia Sotomayor, Elena Kagan and Ketanji Brown Jackson. Their questions revolved around what EMTALA, which was signed into law in 1986 by President Ronald Reagan, explicitly says about stabilizing treatment and whether abortion procedures fall into that definition when complications occur before a fetus can survive outside of the womb, even with medical intervention.\n\nTurner argued that Idaho's law should supersede federal law in the case of abortion procedures because if a treatment isn't available based on a state law, then it is in conflict with EMTALA and the federal law doesn't apply, even if it goes against commonly accepted medical care standards.\n\nSotomayor rejected that argument.\n\n\"There is no state licensing law that would permit the state to say, 'Don't treat diabetics with insulin. Treat them only with pills,'\" Sotomayor said. \"Federal law would say you can't do that.\"\n\nShe said federal law requires treatment of a person who is at risk of serious medical complications without that treatment, but Idaho's law does not provide that much leeway.\n\n\"Idaho law says the doctor has to determine not that there's really a serious medical condition, but that the person will die. That's a huge difference, counsel,\" she said.\n\nIdaho's abortion ban went into effect in August 2022, a few months after the U.S. Supreme Court issued its Dobbs vs. Jackson Women's Health Organization decision that overturned Roe vs. Wade, ending federal protection for abortion access and allowing states to regulate it instead. Providers who are prosecuted for performing an abortion are subject to two to five years in prison plus the loss of their medical license, and they are also subject to civil enforcement laws by any family members related to the person who had the abortion.\n\nConservatives ask about conscience objections, expansion of 'emergency' definition\n\nThe more conservative justices offered mixed questions to U.S. Solicitor General Elizabeth Prelogar, who argued on behalf of the government. Justice Neil Gorsuch posed questions related to the federal Supremacy Clause about when federal law can override state law in the context of medicine, while Justice Amy Coney Barrett asked about whether conscience exceptions exist for doctors who don't feel comfortable terminating a pregnancy even in emergency situations. Or if a hospital in general did not want to provide the procedure, such as a Catholic hospital, would be exempt under EMTALA for conscience reasons. One of Idaho's largest hospital systems, Saint Alphonsus, is a Catholic hospital.\n\nPrelogar confirmed that yes, individual doctors and entire medical entities qualify for those conscience objections and are therefore not required to perform an abortion under EMTALA. But at a hospital that did not have a blanket objection, they would take individual objections into consideration for appropriate staffing so that there is always someone available to provide that care if necessary.\n\n\"If the question is, could you force an individual doctor to step in over a conscience objection, the answer is no, and I want to be really clear about that,\" Prelogar said.\n\nJustice Sam Alito also asked Prelogar if EMTALA could be understood to apply to other emergency situations such as a mental health emergency, if someone was expressing suicidal thoughts and wanted to end their pregnancy to resolve those thoughts. Idaho's legal representation, conservative religious law firm Alliance Defending Freedom, argued in its brief to the court that a ruling in favor of EMTALA protection would allow such situations to occur. Prelogar said no, the proper treatment would be to administer medications to alleviate the suicidal thoughts.\n\n\"There can be grave mental health emergencies, but EMTALA could never require pregnancy termination as the stabilizing care ... because that wouldn't do anything to address the underlying brain chemistry issue that's causing the mental health emergency in the first place,\" Prelogar said. \"If she happens to be pregnant, it would be incredibly unethical to terminate her pregnancy. She might not be in a position to give any informed consent.\"\n\nThe court is expected to rule in the case by the close of its current term, which typically occurs toward the end of June.\n\nThe post Supreme Court justices appear split over whether to protect abortion care during emergencies appeared first on Daily Montanan.\n\nMore from this section\n\nDark Matter and Total Expert partner to boost lender revenue through best-in-class mortgage automation and customer engagement A fire near Red Lodge destroyed a home and started a wildland fire Tuesday Celebrating Earth Day With a Venice Beach Cleanup and a Call for Greater Environmental Responsibility", "source": {"uri": "kulr8.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "KULR-8 Local News"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emergency_Medical_Treatment_and_Active_Labor_Act", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Emergency Medical Treatment and Active Labor Act"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_law", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Federal law"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sonia_Sotomayor", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Sonia Sotomayor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supreme_Court_of_the_United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Supreme Court of the United States"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pregnancy", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Pregnancy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abortion", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Abortion"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Idaho", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Idaho"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Idaho"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turner_Broadcasting_System", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Turner Broadcasting System"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/States_Newsroom", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "States Newsroom"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oral_argument", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Oral argument"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Deputy_Attorney_General", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States Deputy Attorney General"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elena_Kagan", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Elena Kagan"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Injunction", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Injunction"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emergency_department", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Emergency department"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abortion_law", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Abortion law"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Labor_Party", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Australian Labor Party"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liberalism", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Liberalism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conservatism_in_the_United_States", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Conservatism in the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diabetes", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Diabetes"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ketanji_Brown_Jackson", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Ketanji Brown Jackson"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abortion_in_the_United_States", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Abortion in the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roe_v._Wade", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Roe v.

No consensus seemed to emerge among the conservative justices, who expressed concerns including what protections federal law extends to \"unborn children\" and whether Congress had clearly spelled out that EMTALA can mandate abortion in certain emergency cases.\n\nConservative Justice Brett Kavanaugh asked U.S. Solicitor General Elizabeth Prelogar, representing the administration, to respond to Idaho's argument that EMTALA was meant to prevent emergency rooms from so-called patient dumping - turning away uninsured patients - instead of addressing \"abortion or other specific kinds of care.\"\n\nPrelogar said Congress used EMTALA to set a \"baseline national standard of care\" to ensure urgent conditions are addressed.\n\n\"Idaho cannot criminalize the essential care that EMTALA requires,\" Prelogar added.\n\nThe case has led the Supreme Court to revisit the fraught legal landscape it created with its June 2022 decision overturning the 1973 Roe v. Wade ruling that had legalized abortion nationwide.\n\nIdaho is one of seven states to put in place in the past two years a near-total abortion ban with no exception to protect the health of pregnant patients, Prelogar said.\n\nIdaho's so-called abortion \"trigger\" law, adopted in 2020, automatically took effect upon Roe's reversal. The state law bans nearly all abortions unless needed to prevent a mother's death, threatening doctors who violate it with two to five years in prison and loss of their medical license.\n\nAt the same time, EMTALA requires hospitals that receive funding under the federal Medicare program to \"stabilize\" patients with emergency medical conditions. Hospitals that violate EMTALA can face lawsuits by injured patients, civil fines and potentially the loss of Medicare funding.\n\nThe liberal justices pressed Joshua Turner, the lawyer for Idaho, to explain why the state permits emergency abortions to prevent the woman's death but not to protect her health.\n\nTerminating a pregnancy may be needed to address numerous conditions in the woman that could lead to seizures, stroke, organ damage or the loss of her uterus, according to medical experts.\n\n\"Within rare cases, there's a significant number where the woman ... her life is not in peril but she's going to lose her reproductive organs, she's going to lose the ability to have children in the future, unless an abortion takes place,\" liberal Justice Elena Kagan said.\n\nIn such cases, Kagan added, \"Idaho says, 'Sorry no abortion here,' and the result is that these patients are now helicoptered out of state.\"\n\nTurner called these \"difficult\" situations that raise \"tough medical questions that implicate deeply theological and moral questions.\"\n\nFollowing Roe's demise, the Biden administration issued federal guidance stating that EMTALA takes precedence over state abortion bans when the two conflict.\n\nThe Supreme Court in January let Idaho enforce its law while also agreeing to decide its legality.\n\nAt issue in the case is whether Idaho's ban must yield to EMTALA when a doctor determines that the necessary \"stabilizing care\" is an abortion that would not meet Idaho's narrow exception for preventing the mother's death.\n\nThe liberal justices posed sharp questions to Turner over his contention that EMTALA can only require emergency care that a state chooses to make available.\n\nLiberal Justice Sonia Sotomayor told Turner his argument put \"preemption on its head,\" referring to the general principle that federal law trumps contradictory state laws.\n\nPrelogar pushed back against Idaho's claim that doctors could comply with both the state and federal requirements, arguing that \"the situation on the ground in Idaho is showing the devastating consequences\" due to the \"gap\" between the two laws.\n\n\"One hospital system in Idaho says that right now it's having to transfer pregnant women in medical crisis out of the state about once every other week,\" Prelogar said. \"That's untenable and EMTALA does not countenance it.\"\n\n'ANTITHETICAL TO THAT DUTY'\n\nThe conservative justices voiced concerns concerning the Biden administration's legal challenge, though it was not clear which legal theory might garner a majority in the eventual ruling.\n\nConservative Justice Samuel Alito told Prelogar that EMTALA also requires stabilizing care to be given to a woman's \"unborn child.\"\n\n\"Performing an abortion is antithetical to that duty,\" Alito added.\n\nPrelogar said that provision of EMTALA did not displace the woman herself \"as an individual with an emergency medical condition\" when her health is in danger. Prelogar added that in many pregnancy emergencies there is no way to stabilize the unborn child because, before viability, \"it's inevitable that the pregnancy is going to be lost. But Idaho would deny women treatment in that circumstance even though it's senseless.\"\n\nQuestioned by conservative Chief Justice John Roberts, Prelogar said the administration's stance would not require religiously affiliated hospitals with emergency rooms to perform abortions, nor would it require individual doctors who oppose to abortion to perform the procedure.\n\n\"Our position is that EMTALA does not override either set of conscience protections,\" Prelogar said.\n\nBoise-based U.S. District Judge B. Lynn Winmill in 2022 blocked enforcement of Idaho's law in cases of abortions needed to avoid putting the woman's health in \"serious jeopardy\" or risking \"serious impairment to bodily functions.\"\n\n(Reporting by John Kruzel and Andrew Chung; Editing by Will Dunham)", "source": {"uri": "medscape.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Medscape"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emergency_Medical_Treatment_and_Active_Labor_Act", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Emergency Medical Treatment and Active Labor Act"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_law", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Federal law"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supreme_Court_of_the_United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Supreme Court of the United States"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abortion", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Abortion"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Idaho", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Idaho"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Idaho"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Turner", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "John Turner"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roe_v._Wade", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Roe v.

It imposes criminal penalties and suspensions of medical licenses on doctors who perform abortions unless the mother's life is in danger.\n\nThe state law had been put on hold by a district court judge after the federal government sued the state, but when the Supreme Court decided to take the case in January, it allowed the law to take effect while litigation continued.\n\nIn oral arguments that took two hours, Idaho Solicitor General Joshua Turner told the justices that the federal government doesn't get to decide when abortions are required standard of care in hospital emergency rooms.\n\nHe also stressed that states must be allowed to regulate how they provide health care -- including abortion -- in the same way that they license medical personnel and require hospitals to comply with state laws.\n\nGabriella McIntyre, legal counsel at the Alliance Defending Freedom, representing Idaho, said the case is an attempt by the Biden administration to impose \"a national mandate on abortion.\"\n\nU.S. Solicitor General Elizabeth Prelogar, representing the federal government, said the state's abortion ban has major consequences for pregnant women and emergency room doctors.\n\n\"Today, doctors in Idaho and the women in Idaho are in an impossible position,\" she said. \"If a woman comes to an emergency room facing a grave threat to her health, but she isn't yet facing death, doctors either have to delay treatment and allow her condition to materially deteriorate or they're airlifting her out of the state so she can get the emergency care that she needs.\"\n\nJustices Elena Kagan, Sonia Sotomayor, and Ketanji Brown Jackson asked Turner several questions about Idaho's interpretation of the federal law. Kagan asked what if a pregnant woman came to the emergency room with a serious health condition that would not lead to her death but could cause loss of organs or fertility if an abortion was not performed.\n\nIn response, Turner said: \"Yes, Idaho law does say that abortions in that case aren't allowed.\"\n\nJustice Samuel Alito mentioned that the federal law includes several mentions of the phrase \"unborn child.\"\n\n\"Doesn't that tell us something?\" he asked. He said it likely meant that \"the hospital must try to eliminate any immediate threat to the child\" and that \"performing an abortion is antithetical to that duty.\"\n\nThe U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops filed a friend of the court brief siding with Idaho and was joined by Catholic Health Care Leadership Alliance, Christ Medicus Foundation, National Catholic Bioethics Center, the Catholic Bar Association, and the Catholic Medical Association.\n\nThey urged the justices to reject \"efforts to fabricate a federal abortion mandate that will override state law and, in so doing, violate the rights of religious health care providers who desire to treat and protect the lives and health of both the mother and her unborn baby in compliance with the text and purpose of EMTALA.\"\n\nThey also said that by using the federal law to require individuals and entities to provide abortions, the Biden administration \"has exceeded its statutory authority and acted contrary to the express will of Congress under federal law,\" noting that \"Congress has expressly prohibited the federal government from requiring health care entities to perform abortions.\"\n\nNational Right to Life similarly filed a friend of the court brief siding with the Idaho law and arguing that the federal government's \"attempt to force hospital emergency rooms to perform abortions under the Emergency Medical Treatment and Active Labor Act is contrary to that federal law which was only meant to protect emergency room patients from being dumped and does not mandate that the hospital provide medical care that is contrary to state law.\"", "source": {"uri": "thetablet.org", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Tablet"}, "authors": [{"uri": "carol_zimmermann@thetablet.org", "name": "Carol Zimmermann", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_law", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Federal law"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emergency_department", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Emergency department"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supreme_Court_of_the_United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Supreme Court of the United States"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_government_of_the_United_States", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Federal government of the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abortion", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Abortion"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Idaho", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Idaho"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Idaho"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oral_argument", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Oral argument"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solicitor_General_of_the_United_States", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Solicitor General of the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dobbs_v._Jackson_Women's_Health_Organization", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Dobbs v.

Until it is them who are endangered will we find the rules (which they are) will change. Sad . . .\n\nThe U.S. Supreme Court heard oral arguments this morning in the federal government's suit against Idaho's \"Defense of Life Act,\" which bans abortion in almost all circumstances and claims to preempt the federal Emergency Medical Treatment and Active Labor Act. EMTALA, passed in 1986 and signed into law by President Ronald Reagan, requires every hospital accepting Medicare or Medicaid funds (which is virtually every hospital in the U.S.) provide emergency medical treatment to anyone who faces immediate risk of death or severe bodily harm.\n\nThe stakes in this case are huge and go well beyond the abortion issue. Should the conservative majority on the high court rule in Idaho's favor, virtually every federal law regulating the environment, working conditions or consumer product safety could be called into question. Indeed, any law that sets national standards will face legal challenge by states that pass laws (usually on behalf of corporations) that have lower standards or none at all.\n\nI listened in to the live audio feed. I was shocked by medically erroneous statements made by the Idaho solicitor general Joshua Turner in defending his state's law, which does include an exception for preserving the life (but not the health) of a pregnant woman.\n\nJustice Sonia Sotomayor asked whether the state's ban would prevent abortion even if the woman faced losing an organ or might never be able to have children should her current, nonviable pregnancy continue. \"I don't know of a condition that leads to a loss of organ but not death,\" Turner said. \"Idaho law does say that abortions in that case aren't allowed.\"\n\nDuring her oral arguments, U.S. solicitor general Elizabeth Prelogar countered that a pregnant woman with a medical crisis -- due a burst amniotic sac, uterine rupture or severe preeclampsia, for instance -- can be at very high risk of death with no hope of fetal viability. Because there is \"no other way to stabilize and prevent her from deteriorating, EMTALA's plain text requires an abortion under those circumstances,\" she argued.\n\n\"Idaho makes this a crime leading to years in prison.\"\n\nTurner repeatedly argued that states, not the federal government, have the right to regulate the practice of medicine. This implies that state legislatures are better positioned than individual doctors, professional societies or other clinical practice guideline-writing organizations, which set the parameters for physician practice now, to establish when a particular medical situation threatens the life or health of the pregnant woman. He said . . .\n\n\"Best clinical evidence or a national norm is very fraught. Standards may change from day to day.\"\n\nThe Idaho solicitor general also claimed, falsely, that \"Catholic hospitals will now have to perform abortions.\" Prelogar stated definitively that both hospitals and individual doctors have the right to assert conscience objections to providing abortions.\n\n\"EMTALA does not override either conscience objections,\" she said. \"As best practice, hospitals ask doctors to make those objections known in advance\" so they can staff with non-objecting physicians. Catholic hospitals have an obligation to have an alternative immediately at hand should a pregnant woman require an abortion to save her life.\n\nAmy Coney Barrett, the anti-abortion justice appointed by Donald Trump to replace Ruth Bader Ginsburg, drew the obvious conclusion from the state's argument. What if some doctor determined that an abortion was necessary to save the life of the mother at an Idaho hospital, but a county prosecutor made a different determination and charged the attending physician with murder, she asked.\n\n\"That will be left to prosecutorial discretion,\" Turner said.\n\nThere you have it in a nutshell: If the high court rules in Idaho's favor, state legislatures and county prosecutors will have free rein to control the practice of medicine in the U.S.", "source": {"uri": "angrybearblog.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "AngryBear Econ"}, "authors": [{"uri":

The law went into effect in 2022 when the Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade.\n\nThe law stipulates that anyone who performs an abortion outside of the limited exceptions is subject to criminal penalties, including up to five years in prison. Health care professionals could also lose their professional licenses.\n\nCommenting on the law on Wednesday, James wrote on X, formerly Twitter: \"This isn't complicated. No one should be denied medical treatment during a life-threatening emergency.\"\n\nIdaho's law bans nearly all abortions unless they are required to prevent a mother's death.\n\nPresident Joe Biden's administration sued Idaho in 2022, arguing that its near-total ban could violate a 1986 federal law, the Emergency Medical Treatment and Labor Act (EMTALA), which requires hospitals receiving funding under the Medicare program to \"stabilize\" patients with emergency medical conditions. The Biden administration believes this should include abortion in certain contexts.\n\nThis week, the Supreme Court is hearing an appeal by Idaho officials to a lower court's ruling that found the EMTALA supersedes the state's ban when the two conflict in rare circumstances. Hospitals that violate EMTALA can face lawsuits, fines and the loss of Medicare funding.\n\nOn Wednesday, liberal justices asked Joshua Turner, the lawyer representing Idaho, to explain why the state permits emergency abortions to prevent a woman's death, but not to protect her health. Abortions can be required to address a number of health conditions in pregnant women, including strokes, organ damage or the loss of the uterus, according to medical experts.\n\nLiberal Justice Elena Kagan said on Wednesday: \"Within rare cases, there's a significant number where the woman...her life is not in peril, but she's going to lose her reproductive organs, she's going to lose the ability to have children in the future, unless an abortion takes place.\"\n\nShe added: \"If the woman is going to lose her reproductive organs, that's enough to trigger this duty on the part of the hospital to stabilize the patient.\"\n\nTurner said that these situations were \"difficult\" and raised \"tough medical questions that implicate deeply theological and moral questions.\"\n\nMeanwhile, conservative justices voiced concerns regarding the Biden administration's legal challenge. Justice Samuel Alito told Elizabeth Prelogar, the US Solicitor General representing the administration, that EMTALA also requires care to stabilize a woman's unborn child. \"Performing an abortion is antithetical to that duty,\" he said.\n\nIn response to the case, former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton said on X: \"The MAGA Supreme Court majority appears ready to rule that the right to 'life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness' doesn't extend to women with pregnancy complications or who otherwise need abortions.\n\n\"This is horrifying, and it is because of Donald Trump.\"\n\nNewsweek reached out to Donald Trump's press team and the Supreme Court for comment outside of normal working hours.\n\nElizabeth Warren, the Democratic senator from Massachusetts, said: \"Imagine having a serious pregnancy complication and being denied the abortion care your doctors tell you is needed to protect your health.\n\n\"An extremist Supreme Court stacked with Trump-appointed justices could make that tragedy a reality for Americans across the country.\"\n\nAlexis McGill Johnson, the president and CEO of Planned Parenthood, wrote: \"The state of Idaho is literally arguing for the right to deny patients emergency abortion care, even if it means it could stabilize their lives or even if it means that they could die.\n\n\"So let me say that again, the Supreme Court will soon decide if our opponents really have the right to let us die because they disagree with abortion care.\"\n\nIt is not clear yet how the court will rule. However, because the court has a 6-3 conservative majority, the Biden administration requires at least two conservative justices to join the three liberals and side with the federal government.", "source": {"uri": "newsweek.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Newsweek"}, "authors": [{"uri": "matthew_robinson@newsweek.com", "name": "Matthew Robinson", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emergency_Medical_Treatment_and_Active_Labor_Act", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Emergency Medical Treatment and Active Labor Act"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Letitia_James", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Letitia James"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supreme_Court_of_the_United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Supreme Court of the United States"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abortion", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Abortion"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Idaho", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Idaho"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Idaho"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medicare_(United_States)", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Medicare (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dobbs_v._Jackson_Women's_Health_Organization", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Dobbs v.

The Idaho statute criminalizes performing or attempting to perform an abortion unless not doing so would result in the mother's death. The Biden administration argues that the Emergency Medical Treatment & Labor Act (EMTALA) preempts the Idaho law. The case is an appeal from a Ninth Circuit decision that halted Idaho's ban.\n\nAttorney Joshua Turner argued on behalf of the petitioners. Turner asserted that states are responsible for licensing doctors and setting the scope of their professional practice and that the Biden administration misreads EMTALA. Justices Elena Kagan and Ketanji Brown Jackson wrestled with Turner on the scope of EMTALA and what it tells hospitals to do.\n\nJustice Sonia Sotomayor pressed Turner on what the Idaho law tells doctors to do in an emergency. Sotomayor also compared the Idaho law with real-life scenarios, including a situation in Florida where a woman was denied medical care when she was experiencing pregnancy complications because the doctors could not conclude that she would die from the complication. The next day, the woman experienced bleeding, and doctors treated her because she could have died from the bleeding. Justice Amy Coney Barrett also asked how the Idaho law would impact a woman in this scenario.\n\nSolicitor General Elizabeth Prelogar argued on behalf of the US. Prelogar asserted that Idaho cannot criminalize the medical care that EMTALA requires. Justice Samuel Alito asked Prelogar how EMTALA's standard of care impacts women at different stages of their pregnancy differently. Additionally, Alito had Prelogar define several terms with EMTALA to better understand the standard it sets for hospitals treating patients in emergency scenarios, including \"serious jeopardy.\" Justice Neil Gorsuch questioned Prelogar on the scope of Congress's spending power and if this limits EMTALA's ability to regulate hospitals. Lastly, Chief Justice John Roberts asked Prelogar if EMTALA requires religiously affiliated hospitals to perform abortions, to which Prelogar responded, \"No.\"\n\nEMTALA sets conditions for hospitals to receive Medicare funds and mandates that hospitals have to \"stabilize\" patients with emergency conditions in hospitals.\n\nIn response to the arguments, the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists stated:\n\nThe Emergency Medical Treatment and Labor Act (EMTALA) plays a critical role in ensuring that patients across the country have access to emergency medical care and lifesaving interventions. For pregnant people, abortion may be the lifesaving intervention needed. It is therefore essential that abortion care be covered by the federal protections afforded by EMTALA. We urge the Supreme Court to preserve EMTALA's protections for emergency abortion care even in states where abortion is otherwise banned or restricted.\n\nAbortion continues to be a divisive issue in the US since the 2022 US Supreme Court ruling in Dobbs v. Jackson Women's Health Organization. There, the court ruled that abortion was not a constitutional right but a state-level issue, laying the foundation for states to ban abortion entirely or at specific gestational milestones. Earlier this month, Arizona's Supreme Court found that a 159-year-old law prohibiting abortion is enforceable. After this, the Arizona House of Representatives erupted into chants of \"shame\" after Republican members voted to adjourn instead of discussing a bill that would repeal the state's 1864 abortion ban.", "source": {"uri": "jurist.org", "dataType": "news", "title": "JURIST"}, "authors": [{"uri": "lou_kettering@jurist.org", "name": "Lou Kettering", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emergency_Medical_Treatment_and_Active_Labor_Act", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Emergency Medical Treatment and Active Labor Act"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_preemption", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Federal preemption"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abortion", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Abortion"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Idaho", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Idaho"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Idaho"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Presidency_of_Joe_Biden", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Presidency of Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sonia_Sotomayor", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Sonia Sotomayor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oral_argument", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Oral argument"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ketanji_Brown_Jackson", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Ketanji Brown Jackson"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Samuel_Alito", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Samuel Alito"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elena_Kagan", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Elena Kagan"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Court_of_Appeals_for_the_Ninth_Circuit", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statute", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Statute"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supreme_Court_of_the_United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Supreme Court of the United States"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Law_of_the_United_States", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Law of the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pregnancy", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Pregnancy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elizabeth_Prelogar", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Elizabeth Prelogar"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amy_Coney_Barrett", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Amy Coney Barrett"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solicitor_General_of_the_United_States", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Solicitor General of the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neil_Gorsuch", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Neil Gorsuch"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Florida", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Florida"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Florida"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dobbs_v._Jackson_Women's_Health_Organization", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Dobbs v.

NPR CEO Katherine Maher responds to accusations of bias, Boeing looks for its next CEO, and the Supreme Court's latest abortion case examines how states value women's health. Have a thoughtful Thursday.\n\n- Death's door. The latest abortion case in front of the U.S. Supreme Court debated one of the thorniest questions around abortion bans: how close to death must a person be to qualify for the life-saving exemptions to strict anti-abortion laws?\n\nThe Emergency Medical Treatment and Labor Act (EMTALA) requires that hospitals provide abortions to stabilize a patient when an abortion is the best treatment, even in states that have banned abortion except in cases of possible death.\n\nMoyle v. United States is an Idaho lawsuit that asks the Supreme Court whether states are allowed to circumvent that law and prohibit abortion even if a person can't be stabilized without one. (The state has transferred at least six patients facing medical emergencies out of state to terminate pregnancies.) Idaho is seeking to enforce its abortion ban, while the Biden administration is arguing that the EMTALA preempts the state's law.\n\nThe Supreme Court heard oral arguments yesterday, and so far the justices seem divided on this issue. The court's most conservative wing is expected to side with Idaho, while the liberal justices are likely to side with the Biden administration. Three of the six conservative justices seemed to land in the middle, still searching for legal arguments that would support Idaho's stance.\n\nThe case brings to the fore one of the most difficult, practical realities of abortion bans. Even when state bans, like Idaho's, include exceptions to save the life of the mother, providers can never be certain that conservative lawmakers and courts will agree with their judgment. When does a medical emergency qualify as life-threatening?\n\nJustices Sonia Sotomayor and Elena Kagan pressed Idaho's attorney on instances in which a woman's health, but not necessarily her life, is at risk. Sotomayor raised a few examples, like a woman with pregnancy complications that are not yet life-threatening, but later lead to sepsis, or a person denied an abortion early in their pregnancy whose forced pregnancy leads to a hysterectomy. If a woman risks losing her organs, but not her life, is that enough to qualify for an abortion? (Idaho's answer: no.)\n\nThe highest-profile abortion-related case at the Supreme Court this year has been its consideration of access to the abortion pill mifepristone. That case has brought up questions around science and medicine, roping in Big Pharma, which is concerned about the possibility of courts overruling drug developers. Moyle, meanwhile, centers on whether a state abortion ban violates federal law, but it also touches on an issue we're forced to confront again and again: just how much value to place on women's health.\n\n- House call. In Arizona, meanwhile, the state House voted to repeal its recently-resurrected 160-year-old abortion ban. The issue now heads to the state Senate. Washington Post\n\n- Airing it out. Newly appointed NPR CEO Katherine Maher defended the nonprofit radio network as \"really solid\" in responding to a now-retired editor who criticized NPR for having a liberal bias earlier this month. Other critics have resurfaced some of Maher's old tweets that show a history of progressive views, though Maher claims she has a \"robust belief in the First Amendment\" and sets her own politics aside as leader of NPR. Wall Street Journal\n\n- Holding pattern. Boeing analysts and those close to the aircraft manufacturer say COO Stephanie Pope could either be a top candidate for the airline's soon-to-be-vacant CEO spot or off of the list entirely given her three-decade career at the company. Some interpret her promotion to COO and head of the company's struggling commercial plane business as a vote of confidence in her leadership, while others say she may stay in those positions while Boeing looks for an external candidate. New York Times\n\n- Money for menopause. Midi Health, a startup designed to improve access to insurance-covered virtual menopause and perimenopause care, has raised $100 million in total funding after announcing a $60 million Series B round. Cofounder and CEO Joanna Strober said Midi will use the money to hire more clinicians and work towards a goal of 1 million annual members by 2029. Femtechinsider\n\n- Care gap. Patients aged 65 and older in the U.S., especially women, experienced lower mortality and readmission rates when treated by women doctors instead of men, according to new research from the University of Tokyo. The researchers said the results may be due to male doctors' tendency to downplay female patients' illnesses or female physicians' more comforting and communicative style.

U.S. and Moyle v. U.S. that threaten the lives of pregnant people across the country by jeopardizing access to emergency abortion care.\n\nChristian nationalists continue to ram through their unpopular and dangerous agenda to systematically dismantle access to life-saving abortion care across the country. Prompted by the disastrous decision in Dobbs v. Jackson Women's Health Organization, which overturned Roe v. Wade protections, the Emergency Medical Treatment and Labor Act (EMTALA) now finds itself on the chopping block.\n\nThe issue at hand is whether or not EMTALA, a federal law, preempts Idaho's extreme abortion ban and whether Idaho must allow for emergency abortions to take place in hospitals in situations where pregnant people require immediate stabilizing care when their lives are at risk. To put this into context, since Idaho's ban became law, there are reports of numerous pregnant women being airlifted out of state to receive life-saving emergency abortions because the risk for doctors who provide abortion care to save the life of their patient is huge. If the already tainted Supreme Court sides with anti-abortion extremists and Christian nationalists, the results will be catastrophic across the nation and, let there be no confusion: people will die. Despite forcing the false title of \"pro-life\" down the throats of the public for decades, it's abundantly clear that these people have no issue with pregnant people dying, even in scenarios where the death of the person will result in the death of the fetus too.\n\nEMTALA was passed in 1986 for the purpose of ensuring that patients can receive stabilizing treatment at a hospital in emergency scenarios regardless of ability to pay, citizenship status, etc. This crucial law is the reason that emergency rooms cannot turn individuals away from receiving stabilizing care and has invariably saved thousands upon thousands lives since being enacted. The law has also been upheld as precedent for nearly four decades.\n\nIn Tuesday's oral arguments, Justices Ketanji Brown Jackson, Sonia Sotomayor, and Elena Kagan made forceful arguments in support of EMTALA and poked major holes in the plaintiff's arguments; however, with a 6-3 conservative majority on the Court, the future of EMTALA protections for emergency abortions remains precarious. Ever since the Supreme Court created open season on overturning long-standing precedents, the Christian nationalist right has determined that the iron is hot for striking down all access to abortion and contraception across the country. So far, this insidious calculation has been, unfortunately, correct.\n\nThese attacks on abortion access attempt to enforce Christian nationalist ideals upon an unconsenting nation by taking over institutions, in this case an unelected institution in our Supreme Court, and weaponizing them against marginalized people. Abortion access is popular in the United States and support is growing -- 1 in 8 people now say that protecting abortion access is the most important issue to them in the 2024 election, according to KFF, an independent health policy research and news organization. Prior to Roe v. Wade being overturned, the same poll notes that the majority of individuals who said that abortion was their top issue were anti-abortion. This is a seismic shift in just a couple of years and underscores the importance of the issue of expanding access to abortion across the country in upcoming elections.\n\nThere exists significant daylight between the Supreme Court's values, the values of far right Christian nationalist lawmakers and activists, and the values of the average American. In a democracy, consent of the governed is the most basic requirement for a social contract between the people and their elected representatives. By continuing to impose a fascist agenda aimed at controlling people's bodies and pregnancy outcomes, the Supreme Court risks being permanently viewed as a political body whose sole purpose is to roll back civil rights.\n\nTo protect not only abortion access but the entirety of our fledgling democracy, we must protect our institutions from corruption and extremism and we must stop imposing the narrow views of a small minority of people upon a nation of more than 340 million people.\n\nThe Supreme Court must put their extremist ideals away for a moment and act now to save the lives of pregnant people across the country by preserving EMTALA.", "source": {"uri": "thehumanist.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "TheHumanist.com"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dobbs_v._Jackson_Women's_Health_Organization", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Dobbs v.

Wade nearly two years ago, there has been a steady stream of reporting on the medical emergencies and near-death experiences pregnant patients have endured thanks to state-level abortion bans -- despite a federal law, the Emergency Medical Treatment and Active Labor Act (EMTALA), that guarantees abortion care in the most emergent situations.\n\nOn Wednesday, the Supreme Court heard arguments in Idaho v. United States, a case that could solidify this grim reality in states that ban abortion. And after two hours of debate around the margins of the Constitution's spending clause, the relationship between federal and state power, and whether exceptions to protect patients' life and health have any meaning in practice (spoiler alert: they do not), it seems likely the conservative justices will cement into reality Idaho's post-Dobbs experiment of banning abortion to the point of out-of-state airlift for emergency care.\n\nThe fact that the Court heard arguments at all speaks to how rapidly Roe's overturn has spiraled into eroding more than just bodily autonomy -- it has upended the entire relationship between federal and state power. (At the end of 2023, Rewire News Group's senior reporter Garnet Henderson reported from Idaho on this very phenomenon.) Wednesday's arguments further undermined the preemption doctrine (which establishes that when federal and state law conflict, federal law trumps the state law), as the conservative justices searched for various ways to justify reigning in federal law to accommodate Idaho's near-total abortion ban.\n\nWednesday's highlights all came from the women justices, who were determined to make sure the public understands that this is much more than a debate about federal spending power -- it's a constitutional crisis with patients' lives at the center.\n\nBut the fact that the justices were debating hypotheticals around whether multiple organ failure would justify an abortion shows how deep the constitutional crisis following Roe's overturn really runs. We're in the bad place, and the Supreme Court is poised to make it even worse.\n\nA decision in Idaho v. United States isn't expected until later this summer.

In these types of emergencies, ending the patient's pregnancy can be part of the standard of care. But doctors at the hospital where Seyb works say they have been forced to transfer patients who have these complications out of state to comply with the state's abortion ban.\n\n\"This has become the new normal, which is sad,\" he said.\n\nIdaho bans all abortions, with criminal penalties of up to five years in prison for anyone who performs one or assists. The law includes limited exceptions for rape, incest and to save the life of a mother, but there is no exception to protect her health.\n\nAfter oral arguments Wednesday, the Supreme Court is now considering whether Idaho's abortion ban violates a federal law that requires hospitals to offer emergency care to patients in crisis. Thus far, the justices seem split on that question, with some of the more conservative justices appearing to lean toward the state of Idaho, which has argued that federal law should not supersede its own laws on health care.\n\nSt. Luke's Health System, which includes the hospital where Seyb works, filed an amicus brief in the case, noting that an abortion may be critical to protect a patient from nonfatal harms like loss of organs, permanent disability, severe pain or loss of fertility. It also said the ban forces patients to endure potentially risky out-of-state transfers.\n\nAsked on Wednesday about patients being denied care, Idaho Attorney General Ra\u00fal Labrador, a Republican, said, \"The law in Idaho protects unborn children and protects the life of the mother, and any instance where the life of mother's in jeopardy, [abortion] will be allowed by the state of Idaho.\"\n\nSince Jan. 5, when the Supreme Court lifted an injunction that had shielded doctors providing emergency care, six pregnant patients at St. Luke's have had to be airlifted out of Idaho, according to Dr. Jim Souza, the chief physician executive for St. Luke's. Last year, the system saw only one such transfer, he said.\n\nOut-of-state medical transfers can delay needed care and carry immense financial and emotional costs for pregnant patients, who may wind up far from home during some of the most difficult moments of their lives. The cost of the flights can exceed $10,000, and the transportation may also be considered out-of-network by insurance, increasing the share patients must shoulder themselves.\n\nOne of the most common complications is when a patient's water breaks in the first two trimesters of pregnancy, according to Souza. Last year, the hospital system had 54 such cases, most occurring before fetal viability.\n\nPhysicians for Human Rights, an organization that has advocated for abortion rights, also filed an amicus brief in the Supreme Court case. It cites a March report for which the group interviewed several doctors who practice or practiced in Idaho, along with doctors based in neighboring states who received patients who were transferred.\n\nDr. Sarena Hayer, a physician in Oregon, described receiving a patient from Idaho who was gravely ill when she arrived by air. The patient was 18 weeks pregnant with twins when she suffered a severe pregnancy complication. The patient also had a history of kidney issues and had previously received a transplant.\n\nDoctors at her Idaho hospital determined that one of her fetuses had died and her lab results were troubling. She told her doctors she \"wanted them to do whatever they had to, including termination,\" according to the report. But she was ultimately airlifted to Oregon. The following morning, she lost her other fetus too.\n\nIf the woman had started her care in Oregon, she would have been offered a termination almost immediately, Hayer said.\n\n\"What other medical condition can we think of that would require a patient who's sick to get transported to another state for a legal reason?\" Hayer told NBC News. \"It just really feels unjust.\"\n\n\"In a way, you're torturing the women because you're not providing the definitive care until you can say they're at the brink of death,\" Dr. Michele Heisler, the medical director for Physicians for Human Rights, said in an interview. \"I think that's the stake here.\"\n\nDoctors in Idaho also described situations in which patients with severe pregnancy complications were unable to leave the state to seek treatment.\n\nDr. Michael Schneider, a maternal-fetal medicine specialist in Boise, recalled a patient whose water broke around 20 weeks but declined to be airlifted out of state, in part because she could not leave her family. Expenses were another concern. The woman left the hospital, he said, then returned once she experienced contractions. She went into labor, but her fetus did not survive.\n\nOver his decades in medicine, Schneider has learned that vulnerabilities for pregnant women are acute. On his first night of a residency at a hospital in Memphis, Tennessee, a patient with sepsis died.\n\n\"That's what keeps me up -- that somebody's going to be placed in harm's way, or a transport is going to go bad and there's going to be a significant injury to the mother,\" he said. \"It doesn't get any worse than losing two.\"", "source": {"uri": "nbcnews.com", "dataType": "news", "title":

I'm Taylor Wilson, and today is Thursday, April 25th, 2024. This is The Excerpt.\n\nToday, a look at the Supreme Court argument surrounding Idaho's abortion ban. Plus, Israel appears set to launch a military offensive on Rafah, and how a pig kidney transplant helped bring a grandmother back from the brink of death.\n\n\u2666\n\nThe Supreme Court yesterday heard two different views of the clash between a near-total abortion ban in Idaho and a federal law that the Biden administration says requires hospitals to provide emergency abortions if needed to protect the health of the mother. I spoke with USA Today Supreme Court correspondent Maureen Groppe to learn more. Maureen, thanks for making the time.\n\nSo what exactly is Idaho's abortion ban, and what does it functionally do for residents in that state?\n\nMaureen Groppe:\n\nIdaho's law bans abortion except when necessary to save the life of the mother. Doctors in Idaho say they need to be able to intervene earlier if a woman is not on the brink of death, but she is facing major health risks unless her pregnancy is terminated.\n\nTaylor Wilson:\n\nSo what's that issue then in this Supreme Court case?\n\nMaureen Groppe:\n\nThe court's deciding whether a federal law requires doctors to offer abortions if they're needed to stabilize a woman's health, even if that conflicts with a state's abortion ban, that law is called the Emergency Medical Treatment & Labor Act. It's known by its acronym, EMTALA, and Congress passed that law in 1986 to prevent hospitals from turning patients away if they didn't have health insurance.\n\nTaylor Wilson:\n\nJustices yesterday heard two different views on Idaho's ban here. What did we hear from Idaho's lawyers, and what did the Biden administration argue here?\n\nMaureen Groppe:\n\nIdaho's lawyer said that the Supreme Court, when it overturned Roe v. Wade, left the issue up to states to decide. The Justice Department focused on the harm to women who are caught between the state restrictions and the federal requirements.\n\nTaylor Wilson:\n\nHow have the lower courts, Maureen, ruled on this issue?\n\nMaureen Groppe:\n\nThey've been divided. A district court said Idaho couldn't enforce a part of its law that conflicts with the federal law. A panel of appeals court judges disagreed, but they were overridden by their colleagues. And in Texas, however, a judge said the federal law can't be used in Texas to require abortions in emergency situations. An appeals court panel agreed with that decision.\n\nTaylor Wilson:\n\nThings got tense yesterday. There were protests outside the court. How tense was the scene, and who was involved?\n\nMaureen Groppe:\n\nAbortion's an issue that brings out passion on both sides, and we saw that outside the court, one of the more dramatic scenes was created by abortion rights advocates. They laid down in front of the Supreme Court steps while covered in sheets stained with fake blood. Behind them were mourners in black clothing, and they were holding signs saying that women in states with these strict abortion bans are going to die without the protection of the federal law.\n\nTaylor Wilson:\n\nMaureen, just broadly, what impact could the court's handling of this issue have on abortion outside of Idaho nationally?\n\nMaureen Groppe:\n\nThe Supreme Court's decision will determine if there are some federal limits to strict abortion bans. That will affect how states can write and enforce those bans. If the court says the federal law doesn't apply to abortion restrictions, then states without these bans, they may see more women coming to their hospitals in emergency situations.\n\nTaylor Wilson:\n\nAll right. What's coming up next, Maureen? What can we expect from this issue, and how the court's dealing with it?\n\nMaureen Groppe:\n\nThis was the second-to-last case. The court heard this term, and it's likely to be one of the last cases they'll decide before adjourning for the summer. So we're expected to get their opinion in June.\n\nTaylor Wilson:\n\nAll right, Maureen Groppe covers the Supreme Court for USA Today. Thank you, Maureen.\n\nIsrael appears set to launch a military offensive on Rafah in southern Gaza, where more than 1 million Palestinians have taken shelter. Israel says it's the last remaining bastion of Hamas in the territory. The timing of an attack now awaits approval by Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's war cabinet, according to Israeli and Western media outlets. Some observers believe that President Joe Biden's opposition to an assault has softened. Last month, he warned that an invasion of Rafa would be a mistake. But last week, the White House said the US and Israel have a shared objective to see Hamas defeated in Rafah. Meanwhile, protests continue on college campuses, with many protesters pressing their demands for an end to civilian casualties in Gaza. Columbia University announced yesterday that students had agreed to scale down their encampment. Though out West, police arrested protesters at the University of Southern California, which closed to the public yesterday amid clashes between pro-Palestinian demonstrators and authorities at the school.\n\n\u2666\n\nA grand jury has charged 11 Arizona Republicans and seven former aides to Donald Trump in a scheme to keep Trump in the White House by falsely certifying he won the state in 2020. The charges appear to include Trump's former lawyer, Rudy Giuliani, and former chief of staff, Mark Meadows. The indictment alleges the slate of Republicans, sometimes known as fake electors, engaged in a conspiracy aimed at, quote, \"preventing the lawful transfer of the presidency of the United States, keeping President Donald J. Trump in office against the will of Arizona voters, and depriving Arizona voters of their right to vote and have their votes counted.\" Unquote. The grand jury's decision could bring criminal consequences for an unprecedented plot to subvert the will of Arizona voters, one that has broken faith in elections and fueled election conspiracies that have taken root in GOP politics in the state.\n\n\u2666\n\nAlso in Arizona news, the state's House yesterday narrowly voted to repeal a near total abortion ban dating from 1864. The vote caps three weeks of efforts that have brought national attention to the state. The 32 to 28 vote came after passionate speeches from most Republicans who described abortion in graphic detail and as against Republican values. But their attempts to block the appeal failed when three Republicans joined all 29 Democrats to pass the house bill. Things now move to the state's Senate, which is set to take up the matter next Wednesday if there's agreement to bring it up for a vote. Last week, the Senate started work on Senate Bill 1734, which is identical to the measure the House approved.\n\n\u2666\n\nThe 529 education savings plan is getting a couple of big upgrades as a tool to save and pay for school. Starting this year, Congress is allowing up to $35,000 in leftover savings in the plan to roll over tax-free into Roth individual retirement accounts, eliminating fears, unused money could forever be trapped or incur taxes. The Department of Education has revised the free application for federal student aid, or FAFSA, creating the so-called grandparent loophole that allows grandparents to use a 529 plan to fund a grandchild's education without affecting the student's financial aid eligibility. Previously, withdrawals could have reduced aid eligibility by up to 50% of the amount of the distribution.\n\n\u2666\n\nA grandmother on the brink of death received an experimental surgery earlier this month, getting a new heart valve and a kidney from a gene-edited pig. I spoke with USA Today health reporter Karen Weintraub for more. Hello, Karen.\n\nThanks for hopping on. So, Karen, can you just start by telling us about this New Jersey grandmother and her really debilitating health issues?\n\nKaren Weintraub:\n\nYeah, she was in terrible shape. She'd had a heart attack in 2017 and really was spiraling downward since then. She had diabetes. She had heart bypass surgery. She was on dialysis. So both her heart and her kidneys were giving out simultaneously, and she'd recently broken her foot. So she was just pretty immobilized, and her world was just getting smaller and smaller. She could barely leave bed.\n\nTaylor Wilson:\n\nSo she, now, went through an experimental surgery earlier this month as a last-ditch shot. What was this procedure?\n\nKaren Weintraub:\n\nIt was actually two procedures. So one was, she got a heart pump, an artificial pump, and then she got a pig kidney, and the two have never been used before. In fact, the heart pump has been around for several decades, but usually, needing a kidney transplant means you can't get the heart pump. So she's the first person to get a transplant and a pump together, and actually, has opened the door now for more people to get the pump and a human transplant. She wasn't eligible for either alone, so together she became eligible for both, and she is recovering well at the moment.\n\nTaylor Wilson:\n\nKaren, how do these procedures compare to what you and I talked about previously here on the show with the pig kidney transplant in Massachusetts, where you are?\n\nKaren Weintraub:\n\nSo the previous one was also a pig kidney, but a pig raised in a very different way. So also gene edited, but with a different process. So that pig had 69 gene edits. Genes that were knocked out that were eliminated for the pig, genes that were knocked in that were added. This one only had one gene eliminated, and that was a gene that's involved in immediate organ rejection. If you take a kidney from a pig and put it in a person, it will immediately be rejected, and every other problem that might arise, they're dealing with with medications instead. With the Massachusetts pig, they try to deal with it with gene edits. The difference is, the pig that they used in New York can be bred like a normal pig, raised in a farm, have babies, and be bred in a herd. Whereas the one in Massachusetts is going to have to be cloned. Each one is an exact replica of another, and that's a much more scientifically complicated process, more expensive process.\n\nTaylor Wilson:\n\nKaren, can you help us understand just how difficult it is to get an organ transplant off the waiting list? And how might animal organs offer solutions here going forward?\n\nKaren Weintraub:\n\nSo more than 100,000 Americans are on the transplant list at the moment. Far, far fewer than that get a transplant every year. So people wait years to get a transplant, getting sicker all the time. Many people die while they're waiting. Many more people don't even qualify for the list, like this woman, would not have qualified for the transplant list. So having pig organs, if they do become available in large numbers, could relieve that waiting list and the wait time. Obviously, the longer you wait, the sicker you are. So if you could get an organ transplant when you're healthier, the recovery would be faster and easier also. The other major issue with organ transplants are the immunosuppressive medications that you have to take after that transplant. Even with a human, you have to take these medicines for your body to not reject an organ from somebody else with a pig. It could be a whole other level of medication. They're still working that out.\n\nThis woman, the pig organ that she got, she also received another organ from the pig called the thymus, which is involved with the immune system. The idea there is that she'll need less rejection medication. These medications are wonderful. It keeps you from rejecting the kidney but also tamps down your own immune response, so you're more vulnerable to infections like COVID-19 and other infections, and also can make you more vulnerable to cancer. So the less medication you need to tamp down your immune system, the better you are long-term.\n\nTaylor Wilson:\n\nAll right, fascinating science. Karen Weintraub covers health for USA Today.

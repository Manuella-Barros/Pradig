Cllr Kelly has polled well right across the seven-seat constituency, with first preferences coming from all the polling stations. \u201cI can guarantee I\u2019ll work hard,\u201d Kelly says, looking forward to the official count tomorrow. This is the Glenswilly farmer\u2019s first time on the ballot paper, and he carries a sense of reflection back to the 2019 election when he celebrated the victory of his late brother Manus. One month later after the election, businessman and motorsport legend Manus tragically lost his life during the Donegal International Rally. The Fianna F\u00e1il seat was filled by Manus\u2019 father, Donal, who then stood down to allow his son Donal \u2018Mandy\u2019 to take over. Donal said there is no shying away from the fact that he was co-opted to his seat in Lifford, but the results today show that his toil and dedication haven\u2019t gone unnoticed. \u201cI have earned this seat and I\u2019m delighted to be in this position, roll on the next five years. I look forward to working hard for everyone. I can assure them I will work the best I can to the best of my ability,\u201d he said.", "summary": "<p>It\u2019s a proud day and a deeply emotional day for Donal \u2018Mandy\u2019 Kelly as he looks set to top the&#8230;</p>\n<p>The post <a href=\"https://www.donegaldaily.com/2024/06/08/elections-2024-emotional-donal-mandy-kelly-out-in-front-in-letterkenny/\">Elections 2024: Emotional Donal &#8216;Mandy&#8217; Kelly out in front in Letterkenny</a> appeared first on <a href=\"https://www.donegaldaily.com\">Donegal Daily</a>.</p>", "url": "https://www.donegaldaily.com/2024/06/08/elections-2024-emotional-donal-mandy-kelly-out-in-front-in-letterkenny/", "image": "https://www.donegaldaily.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/IMG_7893.jpg", "video": null, "publish_date": "2024-06-08 13:18:31", "author": "Rachel McLaughlin", "authors": ["Rachel McLaughlin"], "language": "en", "source_country": "ie", "sentiment": 0.114}

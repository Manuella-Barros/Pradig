But destiny had something else in store. While he went outside, he saw a man whom he thought to be a beggar. The child felt empathetic and gave his last dollar bill to the man.\n\nAccording to reports, this man is a millionaire businessman, Matt Busbice. He is a resident of Louisiana, USA. He shared this heartwarming story. Busbice said this incident took place a month ago. One day, the fire alarm went off inside his complex. Everyone came out in whatever condition they were in. He also jumped out of bed and came outside. Later, they came to know it was a mock drill. But he thought to go out and have a cup of coffee.\n\nMatt was wearing mismatched clothes and was looking quite dishevelled. As he was about to enter the coffee shop, he realised that he had not prayed this morning. So. he went to a religious place nearby for prayer, where this unexpected incident took place.\n\nHe further added, that after prayer, when he opened his eyes, he saw a child coming towards him, who gave him one dollar. After this, he asked the child why he gave that money to him. Answering the question, the nine-year-old boy named Kelvin Ellis Jr said, \"Perhaps you are homeless. So this one dollar will be very useful for you. I always wanted to help homeless people. Finally, I got this opportunity. These are the few rupees I have, which I got for getting good grades in school.\"\n\nHearing the reply, Busbice had tears in his eyes. He immediately hugged the child and decided to reward him for his kindness. He gave him a new bike as a token of love.

Later, he called the child's parents to his home and promised to always stay in touch with them and help them. He also said, that whatever the child needs in life, he is ready to give everything.

This is the story of a Louisiana boy who does a simple good deed because he cares.\n\n9-year-old Kelvin Ellis Jr. of Baton Rouge got a dollar for good grades on his report card. He didn't spend that money on something for himself. No soda, no candy or a snack. He decided to give that dollar away.\n\nMatt Busbice was in his condo when he heard the fire alarm go off. He jumped up and ran downstairs. There was no fire. All was ok. But he decided to go next door to a local business to grab a cup of coffee. He was looking a little scruffy because he had jumped up so quickly. When he got to the coffee shop, he realized he had not done his morning prayer. So he stopped outside the business to bow his head and pray.\n\nThat's when 9-year-old Kelvin approached him with a clinched fist. Matt was a bit alarmed at first, but the young boy opened his hand to reveal the dollar. He wanted to give it to him because he though he was homeless. The boy says he always wanted to help a homeless person. Wow. It was the only money this youngster had to his name. But he wanted to give it away.\n\nWell, the \"homeless\" person he was helping turned out to be a millionaire. Matt promptly brought the youngster in the coffee shop to get a snack and a drink. He then arranged for a shopping spree for the child. Kelvin was able to pick out a bike, some clothes and other things he needed. But Kelvin says he didn't expect to get anything back. He says all he wanted to get from giving was joy.\n\nCBS did a report from Baton Rouge on this amazing story and it is so inspiration to see the actual video footage of Kelvin offering his dollar to Matt outside the coffee shop.\n\nMatt says he plans to keep in touch with Kelvin and hopes to spread his message of giving to others as a way to spread joy.", "source": {"uri": "k945.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "K945"}, "authors": [{"uri": "erin_mccarty@k945.com", "name": "Erin McCarty", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kelvin", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Kelvin"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Candy", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Candy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homelessness", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Homelessness"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soft_drink", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Soft drink"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Snack", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Snack"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shreveport,_Louisiana", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Shreveport, Louisiana"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Shreveport, Louisiana"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Louisiana", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Louisiana"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Louisiana"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baton_Rouge,_Louisiana", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Baton Rouge, Louisiana"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Baton Rouge, Louisiana"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coffeehouse", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Coffeehouse"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coffee", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Coffee"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CBS", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "CBS"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Advice", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Advice", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Job-Related", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Job-Related", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://townsquare.media/site/180/files/2024/05/attachment-Kelvin-Ellis-5.jpg?w=1200&q=75&format=natural", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9540833", "eventUri": "eng-9540833", "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Shreveport, Louisiana"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.04313725490196074, "wgt": 156, "relevance": 1}

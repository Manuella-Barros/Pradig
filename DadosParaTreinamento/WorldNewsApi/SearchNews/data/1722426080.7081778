{"id": 243278648, "title": "Colombia dominates Costa Rica 3-0 to reach Copa America quarterfinals", "text": "GLENDALE, Ariz. (AP) \u2014 Davinson S\u00e1nchez and Jhon C\u00f3rdoba scored three minutes apart in the second half, and Colombia advanced to the Copa America quarterfinals with a 3-0 win over Costa Rica on Friday. Colombia controlled possession (62%) for the second straight game and led 1-0 at halftime on Luis D\u00edaz\u2019s penalty kick in the 31st minute. Los Cafeteros kept up the pressure in the second half and wrapped up Group D with a dominating performance in front of 27,386 pro-Colombian fans at State Farm Stadium. Colombia outshot Costa Rica 14-5 and faces Brazil on Tuesday in Santa Clara, California to close out the group stage. Colombia has won 10 straight and is unbeaten in 25 games (20-0-5) since losing at Argentina in a World Cup qualifier in 2022. Costa Rica did not have a shot on goal. \u201cToday was a game we dominated from start to finish,\u201d Colombia coach N\u00e9stor Lorenzo said through an interpreter. Costa Rica had the first big surprise of the tournament, playing nine-time Copa America champion Brazil to a scoreless tie despite being outshot 18-2. Los Ticos found themselves on their heels again against another powerhouse team in the desert \u2014 and it didn\u2019t go quite as well for the youngest roster in the tournament. \u201cThe other team was clearly on another level,\u201d Costa Rica coach Gustavo Alfaro said. Colombia controlled possession (66%) in its opening 2-1 win over Paraguay and dominated the ball early against Costa Rica. D\u00edaz had the first good chance in the fifth minute, just missing the crossbar on a header. James Rodr\u00edguez followed with the first shot on goal in the 20th minute, but Patrick Sequeira sprawled out for a diving save. D\u00edaz scored on the penalty kick after Sequeira took down a charging C\u00f3rdoba at the edge of the penalty box. Los Cafeteros kept up the pressure, just missing another goal when S\u00e1nchez couldn\u2019t get a head on D\u00edaz\u2019s bouncing cross. Colombia had 71% possession in the first half and kept control in the second. S\u00e1nchez made it 2-0 with a header off a corner kick in the 59th minute. C\u00f3rdoba scored when he slipped behind Costa Rica\u2019s defense and beat Sequeira from a tough angle. \u201cWe\u2019re a good team, but we also have good character,\u201d Lorenzo said. \u201cIt\u2019s no miracle. They\u2019re good players,\u201d Lorenzo said after the game, in Spanish. \u201cThe quality of the players is what makes the difference. On the field they pressure, they stick to the game plan.\u201d ___ AP Copa America coverage: https://apnews.com/hub/copa-america", "summary": "<a href=\"https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiXGh0dHBzOi8vYXBuZXdzLmNvbS9hcnRpY2xlL2NvcGEtYW1lcmljYS1jb2xvbWJpYS1jb3N0YS1yaWNhLTJmNTY5NmRkNmU1ZDRjZTY5ZWVlODdkY2M3ZDNiYzgw0gEA?oc=5\" target=\"_blank\">Colombia dominates Costa Rica 3-0 to reach Copa America quarterfinals</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;<font color=\"#6f6f6f\">The Associated Press</font>", "url": "https://apnews.com/article/copa-america-colombia-costa-rica-2f5696dd6e5d4ce69eee87dcc7d3bc80", "image": "https://dims.apnews.com/dims4/default/72abd4f/2147483647/strip/true/crop/6151x3460+0+321/resize/1440x810!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fassets.apnews.com%2F59%2Fd4%2F54ef367ba7f215c5e61da8785829%2F208258dd8abf4f488916e3640783f02f", "video": null, "publish_date": "2024-06-29 03:11:29", "author": "John Marshall", "authors": ["John Marshall"], "language": "en", "source_country": "us", "sentiment": 0.086}

Chairperson Dovile Connor first learned about the available funds during the Steering Group meeting for the Parent Council chairs and decided to take up the opportunity. Created by the Scottish Government and managed by Third Sector Interfaces across Scotland, the Communities Mental Health and Wellbeing Fund aims to develop a culture of mental wellbeing and prevention within local communities. Gargieston Parent Council had to meet specific conditions to be considered, for instance, the project must be aimed at over 16-year-olds and must provide an initiative that benefits and improves mental health and wellbeing in the community. Dovile said: \"We have consulted with the members of our Parent Council at Gargieston Primary School and settled on the idea to bid for the first aid courses. \"We established that due to the increased cost of living, these courses became inaccessible for many families who had to prioritise their expenses. \"Thus this project alleviates the financial burden and provides increased and more widespread access to life saving skills and in many cases supports the transition into the workforce. \"And this in a way further boosts participants\u2019 mental wellbeing by providing a sense of accomplishment, building confidence and fostering a promising future outlook through employability prospects and community connections where acquired skills can make a positive impact in emergency situations.\" The first session took place on Thursday, May 4 where the Primo Performance Coaching team taught the practical skills of emergency first aid. On the day, all participants passed their assessment and were awarded with first aid certificates that are accredited by workplaces in the UK. Dovile said: \"We had our first session at the beginning of May and it was very successful - the feedback we received was very positive and participants appreciated the opportunity. We appreciate the funding that we have received from the CVO and would like to thank for this opportunity we can provide our community with.\" The next session is planned for Wednesday, June 5 and Thursday, June 6, with further two sessions scheduled in October and November. In June, both sessions must be attended as it's a 6-hour course split in two days from 9.30am to 12.30pm. Kevin Watson, who facilitates the courses, added: \u201cPeople should expect to be taught the practical skills of emergency first aid. \"Primo Performance Coaching pride themselves on the volume of hands-on experience learners get so that in an emergency they have the practical skills to save a life.\u201d Courses will be held in the parent room at Gargieston Primary School, Dundonald Road Kilmarnock. Groups are limited to 12 participants. For anyone interested in learning the practical skills of emergency first aid, sign up here.

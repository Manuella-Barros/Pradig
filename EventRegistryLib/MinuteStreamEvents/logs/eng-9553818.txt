Jeff Fortenberry", "body": "Federal prosecutors have charged former Rep. Jeff Fortenberry in Washington for allegedly lying to investigators in connection with a campaign finance probe of a foreign billionaire's political contributions.\n\nFortenberry (R-Neb.) was convicted of the same charges by a jury in Los Angeles in 2022, but the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals reversed the conviction, determining that the case should have been brought in either the then-lawmaker's Nebraska district or in Washington. It was unclear until Thursday whether prosecutors would seek to reissue the charges.\n\nFortenberry resigned from Congress following his conviction and was sentenced to probation and community service.\n\nThe former representative was convicted after a seven-day trial on charges that he lied to the FBI and concealed evidence as they pursued questions about whether Nigerian billionaire Gilbert Chagoury had made illicit contributions to U.S. candidates, including Fortenberry, by masking them through \"straw donors.\" Prosecutors said some of that cash was delivered by donors who attended a 2016 Fortenberry fundraiser in Los Angeles, which is why prosecutors brought the charges there. Foreign nationals are prohibited by federal law from contributing to candidates for federal office.\n\nChagoury admitted making the improper donations in 2019 and paid a $1.8 million fine. The host of Fortenberry's fundraiser also cooperated with the FBI, which later probed whether Fortenberry was aware of the illegal contributions. Though the fundraiser host told Fortenberry in 2018 about the illegal contributions from Chagoury, Fortenberry never took steps to disclose the issue to the Federal Elections Commission, prosecutors say. Instead, they say he misled the FBI about what he had learned and denied receiving any donations from a foreign source.\n\nFortenberry defended against the charges by arguing that he fully cooperated with government investigators and was charged for forgetting the details of a year-old conversation when he told the FBI he wasn't aware of the foreign contributions. He has also complained about the FBI's tactics, including what he described as a \"ruse\" undertaken by one investigator to convince him to speak with agents.\n\nChad Kolton, a Fortenberry spokesperson, said the forthcoming charges are a reflection of an \"overzealous\" Justice Department that seems \"intent on dragging Jeff Fortenberry around the country to face one trial after another until it can secure a conviction that actually holds up.\"\n\n\"Federal prosecutors should have better things to do than force a distinguished former public servant to incur massive additional legal costs despite already having resigned his office and performed his sentence from a conviction that was ultimately overturned,\" Kolton said.\n\nFortenberry was first elected in 2004 and represented a district in eastern Nebraska until his 2022 conviction.", "source": {"uri": "yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jeff_Fortenberry", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Jeff Fortenberry"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Washington,_D.C.", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Washington, D.C."}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Washington, D.C."}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Billionaire", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Billionaire"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Bureau_of_Investigation", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Federal Bureau of Investigation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los_Angeles", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Court_of_Appeals_for_the_Ninth_Circuit", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Community_service", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Community service"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Campaign_finance", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Campaign finance"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Probation", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Probation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Congress", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States Congress"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gilbert_Chagoury", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Gilbert Chagoury"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foreign_national", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Foreign national"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Law_of_the_United_States", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Law of the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nebraska", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Nebraska"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Nebraska"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nigeria", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Nigeria"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Nigeria"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Election_Commission", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Federal Election Commission"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Civil_service", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Civil service"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Department_of_Justice", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "United States Department of Justice"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Crime_and_Justice", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Crime and Justice", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Theft", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Theft", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Unsolved", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Unsolved", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Research", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Research", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 79}], "image": "https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/sHji17Vcdc6GI2GpH9qoCw--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyMDA7aD04MDA7Y2Y9d2VicA--/https://media.zenfs.com/en/politico_453/94e3e8b3611d33ce567740d661054dbe", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9553818", "eventUri": "eng-9553818", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.207843137254902, "wgt": 247, "relevance": 1}

The Nebraska Republican's indictment on Wednesday, May 8, 2024, revives a case that was derailed by [...]\n\nWASHINGTON (AP) -- Former Rep. Jeff Fortenberry has been charged with lying to federal authorities about a foreign billionaire's illegal $30,000 contribution to his campaign, reviving a case that was derailed by an appellate court.\n\nA federal jury convicted the Nebraska Republican in 2022, but the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals reversed Fortenberry's conviction last year, ruling that the case should not have been tried in Los Angeles.\n\nA grand jury in the nation's capital indicted Fortenberry on Wednesday on two counts: falsifying and concealing material facts and making false statements.\n\nChad Kolton, a spokesman for Fortenberry, said the case should not have been brought in the first place and should not be pursued again after the 9th Circuit ruled in his favor.\n\n\"This case has defined overzealous prosecution from the earliest days of the investigation, and retrying it in D.C. just highlights the prosecutors' vindictive obsession with destroying a good man's life,\" Kolton said in a statement.\n\nAfter his conviction, Fortenberry announced his resignation from the office that he had held since 2005. He had been under pressure from congressional leaders and Nebraska's Republican governor.\n\nThe case stems an FBI investigation of illegal campaign contributions made by Gilbert Chagoury, a Nigerian billionaire who lived in Paris at the time. Chagoury made the $30,000 contribution to Fortenberry through middlemen at a 2016 fundraiser in Los Angeles, his indictment says.\n\nChagoury later agreed to pay a $1.8 million fine. Foreign nationals are prohibited from directly contributing money to candidates for federal offices in the United States.\n\nFortenberry was charged after denying to the FBI that he was aware he had received illicit funds from Chagoury. A person who cooperated with the FBI investigation repeatedly told Fortenberry about the illegal contributions, his indictment says.\n\nThe 9th Circuit ruled that Fortenberry was improperly tried in Los Angeles because he was charged in connection with statements that he made to federal agents at his home in Lincoln, Nebraska, and at his lawyer's office in Washington.\n\nFortenberry's trial was the first for a sitting member of Congress since Rep. Jim Traficant, D-Ohio, who was convicted of bribery and other felony charges in 2002.", "source": {"uri": "tribtown.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Tribune"}, "authors": [{"uri":

Jeff Fortenberry reindicted by federal grand jury", "body": "Former Rep. Jeff Fortenberry (R-Neb.) was charged for allegedly lying to the FBI about an illegal campaign contribution, months after an appeals court wiped out his previous conviction.\n\nA federal grand jury in Washington, D.C., indicted Fortenberry Wednesday on two counts in connection with statements he gave during interviews about a foreign billionaire's illegal $30,200 donation to his 2016 congressional campaign.\n\nA jury in Los Angeles previously convicted him in 2022 following a federal investigation, but a federal appeals court overturned the case in late 2023, ruling Fortenberry was not tried in the proper venue.\n\nChad Kolton, a spokesman for Fortenberry, argued the case should not have been tried again after the 9th Circuit Court of Appeals \"ruled so decisively\" to reverse the conviction.\n\n\"This case has defined overzealous prosecution from the earliest days of the investigation and retrying it in D.C. just highlights the prosecutors' vindictive obsession with destroying a good man's life,\" Kolton wrote in a statement shared with The Hill.\n\n\"Federal prosecutors should have better things to do than force a distinguished former public servant to incur massive additional legal costs despite already having resigned his office and performed his sentence from a conviction that was ultimately overturned,\" he added.\n\nFollowing the 2022 conviction, Fortenberry resigned from his seat and was sentenced to two years of probation, a $25,000 fine and 320 hours of community service.\n\nThe charges center around the statements Fortenberry gave to authorities as they investigated the $30,200 donation to the former congressman's campaign at a 2016 fundraising event in California from Gilbert Chagoury, a Nigerian businessperson.\n\nFederal election law prohibits foreign nationals from making contributions in support of any candidate for a federal elected office in the U.S.\n\nWhen speaking with the FBI in his Nebraska home and his lawyer's office in D.C., Fortenberry claimed he was unaware of any illegal contributions to his campaign, according to the indictment.\n\nCourt filings, however, show the bureau listened into an earlier phone call in which a cooperating witness informed Fortenberry that the Nigerian businessman was the likely source of the $30,200 donation.\n\nFortenberry now faces two counts -- falsifying and concealing material facts and making false statements, per the indictment.\n\nThe Hill has reached out to the Justice Department for comment.", "source": {"uri": "thehill.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Hill"},

Jeff Fortenberry reindicted, this time in DC", "body": "WASHINGTON -- A Washington grand jury has indicted former Rep. Jeff Fortenberry, R-Neb., on charges he made false statements during a campaign finance probe, months after a federal appeals court threw out his 2022 conviction on similar charges in California.\n\nThe indictment, released Thursday by the U.S. Attorney's Office for the District of Columbia, accuses Fortenberry of making false statements to investigators during a July 2019 interview in the District of Columbia and during a March 2019 interview at his residence in Lincoln, Neb.\n\nBoth interviews were connected to an investigation into illegal political campaign contributions from a foreign national to Fortenberry's campaign and the campaigns of other federal candidates, with the probe seeking to find out whether any politicians were aware they received illegal contributions, the indictment states.\n\nProsecutors originally brought the case in California, where the investigators were based. Fortenberry, who resigned from Congress shortly after his conviction, was sentenced to two years of probation.\n\nBut the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 9th Circuit in December ruled that federal prosecutors brought criminal charges in the wrong location and could retry Fortenberry \"if at all, in a proper venue.\"\n\nIn the Washington indictment, Fortenberry now faces one count of scheming to falsify and conceal material facts and one count of making false statements.\n\nOfficials had been investigating contributions from Gilbert Chagoury, a Nigerian-born billionaire of Lebanese descent, according to the document.\n\nDuring the interview in Washington, Fortenberry falsely stated that he had not been informed -- during a 2018 phone call -- that a consultant for Chagoury had given another person $30,000 in cash to help fund a 2016 fundraiser, the indictment states.\n\nFortenberry, also \"falsely stated that he was not aware of any illicit contribution made during the 2016 Fundraiser,\" the indictment states.\n\nChad Kolton, a spokesperson for Fortenberry, slammed the filing of charges in Washington, saying the case has defined \"overzealous prosecution from the earliest days of the investigation.\"\n\n\"Federal prosecutors should have better things to do than force a distinguished former public servant to incur massive additional legal costs despite already having resigned his office and performed his sentence from a conviction that was ultimately overturned,\" Kolton said.\n\nThe Justice Department, he said, \"seems intent on dragging Jeff Fortenberry around the country to face one trial after another until it can secure a conviction that actually holds up.\"\n\nIn the 9th Circuit ruling, the court said the Constitution requires that a criminal defendant be tried in the location where the criminal conduct occurred.\n\n\"Fortenberry's trial took place in a state where no charged crime was committed, and before a jury drawn from the vicinage of the federal agencies that investigated the defendant,\" the ruling said. \"The Constitution does not permit this.\"", "source": {"uri": "arcamax.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "ArcaMax"},

Jeff Fortenberry reindicted, this time in DC - Roll Call", "body": "An appeals court threw out his California conviction but said charges could be retried elsewhere\n\nA Washington grand jury has indicted former Rep. Jeff Fortenberry, R-Neb., on charges he made false statements during a campaign finance probe, months after a federal appeals court threw out his 2022 conviction on similar charges in California.\n\nThe indictment, released Thursday by the U.S. Attorney's Office for the District of Columbia, accuses Fortenberry of making false statements to investigators during a July 2019 interview in the District of Columbia and during a March 2019 interview at his residence in Lincoln, Neb.\n\nBoth interviews were connected to an investigation into illegal political campaign contributions from a foreign national to Fortenberry's campaign and the campaigns of other federal candidates, with the probe seeking to find out whether any politicians were aware they received illegal contributions, the indictment states.\n\nProsecutors originally brought the case in California, where the investigators were based. Fortenberry, who resigned from Congress shortly after his conviction, was sentenced to two years of probation.\n\nBut the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 9th Circuit in December ruled that federal prosecutors brought criminal charges in the wrong location and could retry Fortenberry \"if at all, in a proper venue.\"\n\nIn the Washington indictment, Fortenberry now faces one count of scheming to falsify and conceal material facts and one count of making false statements.\n\nOfficials had been investigating contributions from Gilbert Chagoury, a Nigerian-born billionaire of Lebanese descent, according to the document.\n\nDuring the interview in Washington, Fortenberry falsely stated that he had not been informed -- during a 2018 phone call -- that a consultant for Chagoury had given another person $30,000 in cash to help fund a 2016 fundraiser, the indictment states.\n\nFortenberry, also \"falsely stated that he was not aware of any illicit contribution made during the 2016 Fundraiser,\" the indictment states.\n\nChad Kolton, a spokesperson for Fortenberry, slammed the filing of charges in Washington, saying the case has defined \"overzealous prosecution from the earliest days of the investigation.\"\n\n\"Federal prosecutors should have better things to do than force a distinguished former public servant to incur massive additional legal costs despite already having resigned his office and performed his sentence from a conviction that was ultimately overturned,\" Kolton said.\n\nThe Justice Department, he said, \"seems intent on dragging Jeff Fortenberry around the country to face one trial after another until it can secure a conviction that actually holds up.\"\n\nIn the 9th Circuit ruling, the court said the Constitution requires that a criminal defendant be tried in the location where the criminal conduct occurred.\n\n\"Fortenberry's trial took place in a state where no charged crime was committed, and before a jury drawn from the vicinage of the federal agencies that investigated the defendant,\" the ruling said. \"The Constitution does not permit this.\"", "source": {"uri": "rollcall.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Roll Call"},

But the FBI says he lied in interviews about the money.\n\nFortenberry resigned from the House of Representatives a week after his conviction and he was sentenced to probation, community service and a $25,000 fine.\n\nBut the sentence and convictions later were canceled out on appeal.\n\nIn a Dec. 26 decision, a Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals panel said Fortenberry should have been tried in Nebraska or Washington -- where the statements had been made -- not in California where the fundraiser took place.\n\nThe mandate was issued on March 19, just four days before the five-year statute of limitations ran out to bring charges against him in Nebraska over the statements he made at his home March 23, 2019.\n\nBut officials still had until July 18 to try him for the statements he made in D.C.\n\nKolton called it a disgraceful misuse of prosecutorial power, and an egregious waste of resources, saying the DOJ seems intent on dragging Fortenberry \"around the country to face one trial after another until it can secure a conviction that actually holds up.\"\n\n\"This case never should have been brought in the first place, and it shouldn't have been pursued again after the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals ruled so decisively in Fortenberry's favor,\" he said.\n\nComplete Coverage: U.S. Rep.

Jeff Fortenberry has been charged with lying to federal authorities about a foreign billionaire's illegal $30,000 contribution to his campaign, reviving a case that was derailed by an appellate court.\n\nA federal jury convicted the Nebraska Republican in 2022, but the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals reversed Fortenberry's conviction last year, ruling that the case should not have been tried in Los Angeles.\n\nA grand jury in the nation's capital indicted Fortenberry on Wednesday on two counts: falsifying and concealing material facts and making false statements.\n\nChad Kolton, a spokesman for Fortenberry, said the case should not have been brought in the first place and should not be pursued again after the 9th Circuit ruled in his favor.\n\nPeople are also reading...

He had been under pressure from congressional leaders and Nebraska's Republican governor.\n\nThe case stems an FBI investigation of illegal campaign contributions made by Gilbert Chagoury, a Nigerian billionaire who lived in Paris at the time. Chagoury made the $30,000 contribution to Fortenberry through middlemen at a 2016 fundraiser in Los Angeles, his indictment says.\n\nChagoury later agreed to pay a $1.8 million fine. Foreign nationals are prohibited from directly contributing money to candidates for federal offices in the United States.\n\nFortenberry was charged after denying to the FBI that he was aware he had received illicit funds from Chagoury. A person who cooperated with the FBI investigation repeatedly told Fortenberry about the illegal contributions, his indictment says.\n\nThe 9th Circuit ruled that Fortenberry was improperly tried in Los Angeles because he was charged in connection with statements that he made to federal agents at his home in Lincoln, Nebraska, and at his lawyer's office in Washington.\n\nFortenberry's trial was the first for a sitting member of Congress since Rep. Jim Traficant, D-Ohio, who was convicted of bribery and other felony charges in 2002.\n\nCopyright 2024 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.

The federal judge sentenced him to probation. Fortenberry resigned his seat in the U.S. House of Representatives. But in December 2023, the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals reversed the conviction saying Fortenberry should have been tried where the alleged crimes occurred -- in Washington, D.C., or in Nebraska -- not in Los Angeles, where the fundraiser was held.\n\nThe new indictment has been filed in the District of Columbia.\n\n\"The Biden/Garland Justice Department seems intent on dragging Jeff Fortenberry around the country to face one trial after another until it can secure a conviction that actually holds up. This case never should have been brought in the first place, and it shouldn't have been pursued again after the 9th Circuit Court of Appeals ruled so decisively in Fortenberry's favor.\n\nThis case has defined overzealous prosecution from the earliest days of the investigation, and retrying it in D.C. just highlights the prosecutors' vindictive obsession with destroying a good man's life. Federal prosecutors should have better things to do than force a distinguished former public servant to incur massive additional legal costs despite already having resigned his office and performed his sentence from a conviction that was ultimately overturned.\n\nThe man the Biden Justice Department is about to spend massive amounts of time and money prosecuting for a second time was described by the District Court judge in his previous trial as 'by all accounts...a man of exceptional character. And when I say 'by all accounts,' I don't mean simply based upon one-sided submissions on the part of the defense. I mean by all accounts, including the evidence that was presented by the Government at trial.' This is a disgraceful misuse of prosecutorial power, and an egregious waste of resources at the time when the Justice Department is letting actual crime run rampant.\n\nThis case is the ultimate proof that federal prosecutors under the Biden DOJ are out of control, and that they are being allowed to weaponize the government's vast prosecutorial power for their own personal and political reasons without proper oversight from the Attorney General.\"\n\nFortenberry was convicted on charges he lied to federal authorities about an illegal $30,000 contribution to his campaign from a foreign billionaire at a 2016 Los Angeles fundraiser. It was the first trial of a sitting congressman since Ohio Rep. Jim Traficant was convicted of bribery and other felony charges in 2002.\n\nA federal jury in Los Angeles found the nine-term Republican guilty of concealing information and two counts of making false statements to authorities. Fortenberry was charged after denying to the FBI that he was aware he had received illicit funds from Gilbert Chagoury, a Nigerian billionaire of Lebanese descent.\n\nThe ruling from the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit stated that because Fortenberry made the false statements during interviews with federal agents at his home in Lincoln, Neb., and in his lawyer's office in Washington, the trial venue was improper. The appellate court only ruled on the venue.\n\n--\n\nThis is a developing story.

But in December 2023, a Ninth Circuit panel tossed the conviction, citing venue issues.\n\nAfter the unanimous decision, a prosecution spokesman said the ruling did not preclude a retrial. On Thursday morning, federal prosecutors refiled the charges in Washington D.C.\n\nFortenberry, 63, who resigned from the U.S. House following his overturned conviction, stands accused of falsifying and concealing material facts and making false statements in connection to what prosecutors describe as illegal $30,000 donation by Gilbert Chagoury, the billionaire.\n\nThe false statements were made in interviews with federal investigators at the Congressman's home in Lincoln, Nebraska, and at his office in Washington, prosecutors claim in the indictment.\n\n\"The Biden/Garland Justice Department seems intent on dragging Jeff Fortenberry around the country to face one trial after another until it can secure a conviction that actually holds up. This case never should have been brought in the first place, and it shouldn't have been pursued again after the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals ruled so decisively in Fortenberry's favor,\" Fortenberry spokesperson Chad Kolton said in a statement.\n\n\"This is a disgraceful misuse of prosecutorial power, and an egregious waste of resources at the time when the Justice Department is letting actual crime run rampant.\"\n\nFortenberry, a Louisiana native, represented Nebraska's 1st Congressional District from 2005 through March 2022, when he resigned from the House following his conviction.\n\nHe had come to know Chagoury through their mutual involvement with In Defense of Christians, a nonprofit that lobbies Congress on behalf of Christian groups and other religious minorities in the Middle East that face persecution.\n\nAlthough prosecutors say the illegal campaign contribution occurred at a 2016 fundraiser in Los Angeles, where Fortenberry was first tried, the charges only pertain to statements Fortenberry made some three years later after the organizer of the fundraiser started cooperating with the FBI investigation into Chagoury. Investigators suspected the billionaire, who has a house in Beverly Hills, was secretly injecting foreign money into U.S. election campaigns.\n\nFortenberry's attorneys argued there was no evidence that in the 2018 phone call the congressman received on his cellphone, he heard or understood what the fundraiser told him. They have also said Fortenberry was entrapped by the prosecution regarding his recollection of a 10-minute phone call a year later.\n\nThe jury found Fortenberry guilty of concealing a $30,000 illegal contribution from Chagoury and lying to the FBI when they questioned him about donation. The judge sentenced him to two years probation, finding his crimes to be \"out of character\" for the longtime politician and requiring of prison.\n\nChagoury paid $1.8 million in 2021 as part of a deferred prosecution agreement with the Justice Department over $180,000 in illegal contributions he made to four different campaigns.", "source": {"uri": "courthousenews.com", "dataType": "news",

Jeff Fortenberry has been charged with lying to federal authorities about a foreign billionaire's illegal $30,000 contribution to his campaign, reviving a case that was derailed by an appellate court.\n\nA federal jury convicted the Nebraska Republican in 2022, but the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals reversed Fortenberry's conviction last year, ruling that the case should not have been tried in Los Angeles.\n\nA grand jury in the nation's capital indicted Fortenberry on Wednesday on two counts: falsifying and concealing material facts and making false statements.\n\nChad Kolton, a spokesman for Fortenberry, said the case should not have been brought in the first place and should not be pursued again after the 9th Circuit ruled in his favor.\n\nPeople are also reading...

He had been under pressure from congressional leaders and Nebraska's Republican governor.\n\nThe case stems an FBI investigation of illegal campaign contributions made by Gilbert Chagoury, a Nigerian billionaire who lived in Paris at the time. Chagoury made the $30,000 contribution to Fortenberry through middlemen at a 2016 fundraiser in Los Angeles, his indictment says.\n\nChagoury later agreed to pay a $1.8 million fine. Foreign nationals are prohibited from directly contributing money to candidates for federal offices in the United States.\n\nFortenberry was charged after denying to the FBI that he was aware he had received illicit funds from Chagoury. A person who cooperated with the FBI investigation repeatedly told Fortenberry about the illegal contributions, his indictment says.\n\nThe 9th Circuit ruled that Fortenberry was improperly tried in Los Angeles because he was charged in connection with statements that he made to federal agents at his home in Lincoln, Nebraska, and at his lawyer's office in Washington.\n\nFortenberry's trial was the first for a sitting member of Congress since Rep. Jim Traficant, D-Ohio, who was convicted of bribery and other felony charges in 2002.\n\nCopyright 2024 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.

In fact, federal prosecutors in recent months have brought charges against two other lawmakers, both Democrats: Representative Henry Cuellar of Texas and Senator Robert Menendez of New Jersey.\n\n\"This case has defined overzealous prosecution from the earliest days of the investigation, and retrying it in D.C. just highlights the prosecutors' vindictive obsession with destroying a good man's life,\" Mr. Kolton said.\n\nAt issue are donations Mr. Fortenberry received from Gilbert Chagoury, a Lebanese-Nigerian billionaire, who later admitted to his part in a scheme to make illegal campaign donations to candidates for president and Congress. Foreign citizens are not allowed to make political donations to an American candidate.\n\nIn January 2016, Mr. Chagoury contributed $30,000 to Mr. Fortenberry's re-election campaign, routing the money through other people. The host of the fund-raiser, who is not named in the indictment, started to cooperate with the F.B.I. in September of that year.\n\nIn June 2018, the fund-raiser host spoke with Mr. Fortenberry over the phone and told him the 2016 donation was from Mr. Chagoury. According to the indictment, Mr. Fortenberry did not take steps to amend his campaign finance report or return the donation. He did, however, ask about the possibility of hosting another campaign event.\n\nFederal investigators first interviewed Mr. Fortenberry in 2019. The Justice Department charged him with lying to federal agents in October 2021.\n\nFacing political pressure, Mr. Fortenberry, who was first elected to Congress in 2004, resigned in March 2022 a few days after his conviction. He was sentenced to two years of probation, and was told to pay $25,000 and perform 320 hours of community service.", "source": {"uri": "nytimes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The New York Times"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jeff_Fortenberry", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Jeff Fortenberry"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indictment", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Indictment"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republican_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Republican Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_House_of_Representatives", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "United States House of Representatives"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grand_jury", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Grand jury"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Campaign_finance", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Campaign finance"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Bureau_of_Investigation", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Federal Bureau of Investigation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nebraska", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Nebraska"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Nebraska"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Washington,_D.C.", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Washington, D.C."}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Washington, D.C."}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chad_Kolton", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Chad Kolton"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gilbert_Chagoury", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Gilbert Chagoury"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bob_Menendez", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Bob Menendez"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Henry_Cuellar", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Henry Cuellar"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Department_of_Justice", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United States Department of Justice"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Senate", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United States Senate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Democratic Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Jersey", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "New Jersey"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "New Jersey"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Texas", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Texas"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Texas"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barack_Obama_2012_presidential_campaign", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Barack Obama 2012 presidential campaign"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Probation", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Probation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Congress", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "United States Congress"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/End-of-Life", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/End-of-Life", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Crime_and_Justice", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Crime and Justice", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Murder", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Murder", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Research", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Research", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 94}], "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/05/09/multimedia/09dc-fortenberry-bgqf/09dc-fortenberry-bgqf-videoSixteenByNineJumbo1600.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9553818", "eventUri": "eng-9553818", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "date": "2016-01-", "textStart": 1555, "textEnd": 1567}, {"amb": false, "date": "2018-06-", "textStart": 1818, "textEnd": 1827}], "sentiment": -0.3490196078431372, "wgt": 201, "relevance": 1}

But the FBI says he lied in interviews about the money.\n\nFortenberry resigned from the House of Representatives a week after his conviction and he was sentenced to probation, community service and a $25,000 fine.\n\nBut the sentence and convictions later were canceled out on appeal.\n\nIn a Dec. 26 decision, a Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals panel said Fortenberry should have been tried in Nebraska or Washington -- where the statements had been made -- not in California where the fundraiser took place.\n\nThe mandate was issued on March 19, just four days before the five-year statute of limitations ran out to bring charges against him in Nebraska over the statements he made at his home March 23, 2019.\n\nBut officials still had until July 18 to try him for the statements he made in D.C.\n\nKolton called it a disgraceful misuse of prosecutorial power, and an egregious waste of resources, saying the DOJ seems intent on dragging Fortenberry \"around the country to face one trial after another until it can secure a conviction that actually holds up.\"\n\n\"This case never should have been brought in the first place, and it shouldn't have been pursued again after the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals ruled so decisively in Fortenberry's favor,\" he said.\n\nReach the writer at 402-473-7237 or lpilger@journalstar.com.\n\nOn Twitter @LJSpilger\n\n0 Comments Love 0 Funny 0

But a federal appeals court reversed the conviction last year.\n\nNow, Mr Fortenberry, a Republican, is facing the same charges.\n\nFederal prosecutors charged Mr Fortenberry in papers filed Thursday with falsifying and concealing facts and making false statements in the US District Court for the District of Columbia. They are connected with the same alleged incident as the earlier indictment.\n\nIn the first indictment, Mr Fortenberry faced three federal felonies of lying to the FBI about an allegedly illegal $30,000 contribution to his 2016 re-election campaign from a Nigerian businessman.\n\nThe former Nebraska lawmaker was accused of lying to FBI agents during two interviews about his knowledge of the contributions. He was convicted of the charges by a jury in Los Angeles, and sentenced to two years probation and a $25,000 fine.\n\nBut one interview occurred in his Nebraska home and the other was in a lawyer's office in Washington, D.C. An appeals court reversed the conviction last year, finding that Mr Fortenberry was tried in the wrong state.\n\nAccording to the court's opinion, the trial should have been held in Nebraska or Washington, D.C. - where he allegedly made the false statements - and not in California.\n\nHe resigned from his House seat after the conviction amid threats of possible expulsion.\n\nAt the time, federal investigators had been conducting a criminal investigation into illegal political contributions to Mr Fortenberry's 2016 re-election campaign, as well as other federal candidates' campaigns, according to the indictment. Investigators questioned lawmakers as to whether they were aware of the illegal contributions.\n\nThe Norwegian businessman arranged for $30,000 to be contributed through other individuals to Mr Fortenberry's campaign.\n\nMr Fortenberry later learned of the illegal contribution, but allegedly did not file an amended Federal Election Commission report regarding the donation, according to the indictment.\n\nIt says he told federal investigators on two separate occasions that he was not aware of the illegal contribution and that every campaign contribution was publicly disclosed. He also reported that he was unaware of any contributions made by foreign nationals, saying he would be \"horrified\" if he learned of an illegal contribution, according to the indictment.\n\nThe indictment filed on Thursday alleges Mr Fortenberry knowingly falsified and concealed the illegal contribution from a foreign national.", "source": {"uri": "ca.news.yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jeff_Fortenberry", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Jeff Fortenberry"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Making_false_statements", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Making false statements"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indictment", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Indictment"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nebraska", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Nebraska"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Nebraska"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Bureau_of_Investigation", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Federal Bureau of Investigation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump_2020_presidential_campaign", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump 2020 presidential campaign"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_District_Court_for_the_District_of_Columbia", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States District Court for the District of Columbia"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_courts_of_appeals", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States courts of appeals"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republican_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Republican Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Washington,_D.C.", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Washington, D.C."}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Washington, D.C."}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Probation", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Probation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Felony", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Felony"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los_Angeles", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/California", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "California"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "California"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Election_Commission", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Federal Election Commission"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Crime_and_Justice", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Crime and Justice", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Murder", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Murder", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Unsolved", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Unsolved", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Research", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Research", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 78}], "image": "https://media.zenfs.com/en/bbc_us_articles_995/a7a1c6081823db8468fbbf9096880fbf", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9553818", "eventUri": "eng-9553818", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.3647058823529412, "wgt": 198, "relevance": 1}

Fortenberry indicted in DC for lying to FBI agents", "body": "Former Nebraska Rep. Fortenberry's convictions reversed by federal appeals court\n\nFormer Nebraska Congressman Jeff Fortenberry has been indicted in the District of Columbia for allegedly lying to FBI agents there who were investigating foreign campaign contributions.\n\nHis spokesman, Chad Kolton, on Thursday called it proof that federal prosecutors under President Biden's Department of Justice are out of control and being allowed to \"weaponize the government's vast prosecutorial power for their own personal and political reasons.\"\n\n\"This case has defined overzealous prosecution from the earliest days of the investigation, and retrying it in D.C. just highlights the prosecutors' vindictive obsession with destroying a good man's life,\" Kolton said. \"Federal prosecutors should have better things to do than force a distinguished former public servant to incur massive additional legal costs despite already having resigned his office and performed his sentence from a conviction that was ultimately overturned.\"\n\nPeople are also reading...

But the FBI says he lied in interviews about the money.\n\nFortenberry resigned from the House of Representatives a week after his conviction and he was sentenced to probation, community service and a $25,000 fine.\n\nBut the sentence and convictions later were canceled out on appeal.\n\nIn a Dec. 26 decision, a Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals panel said Fortenberry should have been tried in Nebraska or Washington -- where the statements had been made -- not in California where the fundraiser took place.\n\nThe mandate was issued on March 19, just four days before the five-year statute of limitations ran out to bring charges against him in Nebraska over the statements he made at his home March 23, 2019.\n\nBut officials still had until July 18 to try him for the statements he made in D.C.\n\nKolton called it a disgraceful misuse of prosecutorial power, and an egregious waste of resources, saying the DOJ seems intent on dragging Fortenberry \"around the country to face one trial after another until it can secure a conviction that actually holds up.\"\n\n\"This case never should have been brought in the first place, and it shouldn't have been pursued again after the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals ruled so decisively in Fortenberry's favor,\" he said.\n\nComplete Coverage: U.S. Rep.

{"id": 225068038, "title": "France's Macron Urges a Green Light for Ukraine to Strike Targets Inside Russia with Western Weapons", "text": "Western countries should let Ukraine strike military bases inside Russia with the sophisticated long-range weapons they are providing to Kyiv, French President Emmanuel Macron said, pressuring his allies in the most recent sign of a potentially significant policy shift that could help change the complexion of the war. The question of whether to allow Ukraine to hit targets on Russian soil with Western-supplied weaponry has been a delicate issue since the Kremlin\u2019s full-scale invasion of its neighbor in February 2022. Western leaders have mostly shrunk from taking the step because it runs the risk of provoking Russian President Vladimir Putin, who has repeatedly warned that the West's direct involvement could put the world on a path to nuclear conflict. But the war has been going Russia\u2019s way recently as the Kremlin\u2019s forces have exploited Ukrainian shortages in troops and ammunition after a lengthy delay in U.S. military aid and Western Europe\u2019s inadequate military production slowed crucial deliveries to the battlefield. Russian missiles and bombs have smashed into Ukrainian military positions and civilian areas, including the power grid. Kyiv is facing its hardest test of the war, and untying its hands on long-range weapons could spur a fightback and upset the Kremlin. Macron said France's position is that \u201cwe think we must allow (Ukraine) to neutralize the (Russian) military sites from which the missiles are fired.\" \u201cIf we tell (the Ukrainians) you do not have the right to reach the point from which the missiles are fired, we are in fact telling them that we are delivering weapons to you but you cannot defend yourself,\u201d Macron said late Tuesday on an official visit to Germany. His remarks came a day after NATO Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg urged the alliance\u2019s members to lift some of the restrictions on Ukraine\u2019s use of Western weapons. \u201cThe right to self-defense includes hitting legitimate targets outside Ukraine,\u201d Stoltenberg said at a NATO meeting in Sofia, Bulgaria on Monday. Already, at the start of May, Moscow interpreted as a threat U.K. Foreign Secretary David Cameron\u2019s comment that Ukraine could use British long-range weapons, such as the Storm Shadow cruise missile, to hit back at Russia. That, and Macron\u2019s comments that he doesn\u2019t exclude sending troops to Ukraine, prompted Russia to announce it would hold drills involving tactical nuclear weapons. Russia also warned London that its decision could bring retaliatory strikes on British military facilities and equipment on Ukrainian soil or elsewhere. The leaders are choosing their words carefully. Macron underlined that only Russian bases used to launch missiles against Ukraine should be regarded as legitimate targets \u2014 not other Russian bases or civilian infrastructure. German Chancellor Olaf Scholz, speaking alongside Macron, was as usual more guarded and noncommittal, noting that under international law Ukraine \u201cis allowed to defend itself.\u201d Scholz has insisted on avoiding steps that could end up drawing NATO into a battlefield confrontation with Russia. Other Western leaders have expressed similar fears of a creeping, high-stakes escalation. His concerns are shared in Washington. The U.S. has over the past two years gradually ceded to Ukrainian requests for support, sending tanks and long-range missile systems that it initially hesitated to provide, but with a caveat on aiming at Russian soil. \u201cThere\u2019s no change to our policy at this point,\u201d U.S. National Security Council spokesman John Kirby said Tuesday. \u201cWe don\u2019t encourage or enable the use of U.S.-supplied weapons to strike inside Russia.\u201d Western leaders are keen to put pressure on Putin, whose forces have recently been pushing hard against Ukrainian defenses in eastern and northeastern Ukraine. This week has brought a cascade of new European aid, with Belgium and Spain each pledging around 1 billion euros ($1.1 billion) in new military support to Ukraine. Sweden announced Wednesday it will donate a aid worth 13 billion kronor ($1.23 billion) \u2014 the largest package Sweden has so far donated. It will include air defense systems, artillery ammunition and armored vehicles.", "summary": "The question of whether to allow Ukraine to hit targets on Russian soil with Western-supplied weaponry has been a delicate issue since the Kremlin\u2019s full-scale invasion of its neighbor in February 2022.", "url": "https://www.military.com/daily-news/2024/05/29/frances-macron-urges-green-light-ukraine-strike-targets-inside-russia-western-weapons.html", "image": "https://images03.military.com/sites/default/files/styles/full/public/2024-05/ApNewsroom_Russia_Ukraine_War_27679.jpg", "video": null, "publish_date": "2024-05-29 13:44:19", "author": "Associated Press", "authors": ["Associated Press"], "language": "en", "source_country": "us", "sentiment": -0.077}

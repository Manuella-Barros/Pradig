{"id": 223780142, "title": "9 favorite cookie recipes from the L.A. Times", "text": "I didn\u2019t consider myself a cookie person until recently. Maybe a childhood experience is to blame. It\u2019s an American platitude that everyone loves their mom\u2019s chocolate chip cookies best. I do not like my mom\u2019s chocolate chip cookies. (Sorry, Mom!) As a kid I preferred dunking Chips Ahoy! into milk, until I outgrew them (but I do still have a soft spot for Oreos). I was thrilled when my grandmother in Tokyo occasionally sent tins of individually wrapped cigar cookies from a Japanese brand called Yoku Moku. But really, I always wanted a fudgy brownie or slice of layer cake over a cookie. Mom made delicious, spectacular birthday cakes and even cream puffs from scratch. But for some reason she always experimented with cutting out at least half of the sugar in any chocolate chip cookie recipe, which rendered them thick and cakey. I begged her to just follow the instructions on the bag of chocolate chips, but she refused. I excavated the chocolate chips from the cookies and discarded the rest. Then I found cookie nirvana decades later when I tried a florentine from legendary baker and dessert maker Alice Medrich: It was ultra thin and super crisp, nutty and extra buttery. There\u2019s a recipe for her ginger florentines and many more versions of the lacy Italian cookie in her cookbook \u201cChewy Gooey Crispy Crunchy Melt-in-Your-Mouth Cookies.\u201d It changed my perspective on what a cookie could be. I was reminded of that when we recently published a guide to 24 of the best cookies in Los Angeles. Among them are a brown-butter riff on the Hong Kong-style almond cookie, an airy-textured spelt thumbprint cookie with farmers market jam in the middle, and a brownie-like cookie injected with condensed milk and drizzled with caramel.

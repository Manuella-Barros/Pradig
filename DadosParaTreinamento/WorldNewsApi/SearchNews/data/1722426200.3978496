All local authorities are understood to have budgeted to receive a share of the money this year, but the Scottish Government will only release it if they agree not to cut teacher numbers. This would leave some councils in huge difficultly, particularly Glasgow, which would have to reverse plans to axe 172 teaching posts this year or be left with a \u00a316.5m hole in its budget. Education Secretary Jenny Gilruth said only last week she was \u201cvery clear that no local authority is going to receive that funding unless they agree\u201d to maintain teacher numbers. The issue was considered at a meeting of council umbrella body Cosla on Friday. After the talks, a Cosla spokesperson said: \u201cCouncils rightly have high ambitions for all learners in Scotland, demonstrated through the stretch aims set to drive progress in raising attainment and closing the poverty related attainment gap. \u201cWe recognise the vital role of teachers in improving outcome for children and young people but progress cannot be made by focusing on teachers alone. Investment is required in wider support that may well sit outside the classroom and indeed the school. \u201cIt is for this reason that councils cannot sign a grant offer letter that restricts the use of funding in this way, and does not enable a holistic focus on improving outcomes.\" It is understood that rather than agree the terms, or reject them, Cosla voted to seek a compromise. TES Scotland reported earlier this week that papers for the meeting said councils \u201cmay have to offer concessions\u201d, such as \u201cto freeze learning hours at current levels\u201d. Schools currently must be open for 190 days a year, but the number of learning hours is not legally prescribed, and some councils, most recently Falkirk, have proposed cuts to help balance the books. However, it was also reported that the papers said: \u201cThere are also concerns that we are now at a stage where there is not sufficient time to consider new approaches, with the school census taking place in September.\u201d Ms Gilruth told The Scotsman last month: \u201cI've been really clear in my time as education secretary about the need to protect this funding for teacher numbers.\u201d", "summary": "<p>Cosla meeting considered response to Scottish Government demands on Friday</p>", "url": "https://www.scotsman.com/education/councils-seek-compromise-with-snp-ministers-over-ps1455m-teacher-fund-4684290", "image": "https://www.scotsman.com/jpim-static/2024/06/21/12/31/onecms_4c39bcd4-c56c-4484-a7c7-c399764b9f0b.jpg?width=1200&enable=upscale", "video": null, "publish_date": "2024-06-29 04:18:24", "author": "Calum Ross", "authors": ["Calum Ross"], "language": "en", "catgory": "politics", "source_country": "gb", "sentiment": -0.226}

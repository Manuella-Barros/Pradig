The men, who were all Latino, included his nephew, brother-in-law and friends he had known for years. They were all on break, some inside their cars and others in construction vehicles, when the bridge fell.\n\nCervantes Suarez, who spoke exclusively to NBC News for the first time since the bridge collapse, said he saw his family members and friends disappear into the river one by one, knowing he was next. His nephew, Carlos Daniel Hern\u00e1ndez, whom he considered a son, was the first to fall.\n\nIn what he thought were his final moments, he turned to God.\n\n\"I thanked God for family he gave me. I asked him to take care of my wife and kids. And I asked for forgiveness for everything I've done,\" Cervantes Suarez said in Spanish, his voice breaking.\n\nCervantes Suarez, the only person to survive the fall into the water, was in his truck when the bridge went down.\n\nAfter his truck slammed into the river, Cervantes Suarez said the water \"came up to my neck\" and he was unable to open the doors to escape.\n\nHe manually rolled down the vehicle's window to exit, swallowing water as his truck became completely inundated and sank.\n\n\"That's when I realized what happened. I looked at the bridge and it was no longer there,\" Cervantes Suarez said.\n\nHe had seen his companions as they fell \"and how the water covered them,\" he said.\n\n\"I started to call out to each one of them by name,\" he said.\n\nCervantes Suarez, who cannot swim, managed to climb onto a piece of floating concrete from the wreckage, where he waited until he was rescued. He was taken to a hospital with a chest wound and released the same day. Another surviving worker rescued at the scene was in good condition and refused treatment.\n\nCervantes Suarez still has physical pain in his chest and his left knee and foot. The emotional toll is something that will stay with him for the rest of his life.\n\n\"I relive it all the time, the minutes before the fall and when I'm falling,\" he said.\n\nHe is haunted by the fact that he told his nephew to go to his car and rest.\n\n\"If I had told him to come with me, maybe it would have been different. Maybe he would be here with us,\" he said.\n\nCervantes Suarez is in therapy and \"it has helped me, but sometimes I regress back to the first day,\" he said.\n\nHe said justice to him would be for all of those responsible to \"pay for the damage they have done. Because I know that money is not going to buy a hug from a father or a son.\"\n\nHe said he sees the children of his brother-in-law, Alejandro Hern\u00e1ndez Fuentes, \"and I see how much they miss their dad.\" He sees how much his sister-in-law misses her husband.\n\nCervantes Suarez said the Dali cargo ship \"destroyed six families.\"\n\nThe National Transportation Safety Board determined in a preliminary report released in May that the 947-foot-long Singapore-flagged cargo ship was transiting out of Baltimore Harbor when it lost power and propulsion before striking the Francis Scott Key Bridge.\n\nThe FBI has also been investigating the events that led up to the crash and whether the cargo ship crew knew the vessel had potential mechanical problems that would have made it unsafe to transit in the harbor.\n\nCervantes Suarez and the families of multiple workers killed in the bridge collapse are looking to take legal action against the companies involved with the cargo ship.\n\n\"Everybody that was involved with this boat is responsible for destroying these eight families' lives,\" said L. Chris Stewart, an attorney who represents Cervantes Suarez and the families of some of the workers who died. \"The boat was not seaworthy.\"\n\n\"It's an American tragedy,\" he said.\n\n\"This will never go away and he still has a family to take care of and now a bunch of other people from other families that he has to take care of as well,\" said Justin Miller, an attorney who also represents Cervantes Suarez and other families.\n\nIn the days following the bridge collapse, the ship's Singapore-based owner and manager petitioned a Maryland court to limit their monetary liability for the collapse to $43.67 million.\n\nThe city of Baltimore said in a legal filing in late April against the cargo ship's owner, Grace Ocean Private Ltd., and operator, Synergy Marine Pte Ltd., that \"negligence caused them to destroy the Key Bridge, and singlehandedly shut down the Port of Baltimore, a source of jobs, municipal revenue, and no small amount of pride for the City of Baltimore and its residents.\"\n\n\"None of this should have happened. Reporting has indicated that, even before leaving port, alarms showing an inconsistent power supply on the Dali had sounded. The Dali left port anyway, despite its clearly unseaworthy condition,\" the city said in the filing.\n\nIn response to the ship owner and operator's claim for limited liability, the city said the incident was \"caused by the unseaworthiness of the Dali and the negligence of the vessel's crew and shoreside management\" and that therefore, the requests for a limitation of liability should be denied.\n\nCervantes Suarez said he hopes people remember those who died.\n\n\"I knew all of them, they were families. They were good people, good workers and had good values,\" he said.\n\nCervantes Suarez said he does not know why he survived the bridge collapse.", "source": {"uri": "nbcchicago.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "NBC Chicago"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cargo_ship", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Cargo ship"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miguel_de_Cervantes", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Miguel de Cervantes"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bridge", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Bridge"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/God", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "God"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Race_and_ethnicity_in_the_United_States_census", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Race and ethnicity in the United States census"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Javier_Hern\u00e1ndez", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Javier Hern\u00e1ndez"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Key_Bridge_(Washington,_D.C.)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Key Bridge (Washington, D.C.)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patapsco_River", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Patapsco River"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heavy_equipment", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Heavy equipment"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBC_News", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "NBC News"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ton", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Ton"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spanish_language", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Spanish language"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Port_of_Baltimore", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Port of Baltimore"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_National_(Abu_Dhabi)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "The National (Abu Dhabi)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Concrete", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Concrete"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dali_City", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Dali City"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Dali City"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "China"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chris_Stewart_(politician)", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Chris Stewart (politician)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Negligence", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Negligence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tragedy", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Tragedy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manager_(baseball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Manager (baseball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Port", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Port"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lawyer", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Lawyer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Bureau_of_Investigation", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Federal Bureau of Investigation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maryland", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Maryland"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Maryland"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baltimore", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Baltimore"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Baltimore"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Science/Technology/Structural_Engineering", "label": "dmoz/Science/Technology/Structural Engineering", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Card_Games/Trick_Capturing", "label": "dmoz/Games/Card Games/Trick Capturing", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Roads_and_Highways/Bridges_and_Tunnels", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Roads and Highways/Bridges and Tunnels", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 62}], "image": "https://media.nbcchicago.com/2024/07/240710-baltimore-bridge-collapse-survivor-Julio-Cervantes-Suarez-se-1234p-a2f30d.jpg?quality=85&strip=all&resize=1200%2C675", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9722803", "eventUri": "eng-9722803", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "date": "-03-26", "textStart": 429, "textEnd": 437}], "sentiment": 0.1372549019607843, "wgt": 239, "relevance": 1}

The men, who were all Latino, included his nephew, brother-in-law and friends he had known for years. They were all on break, some inside their cars and others in construction vehicles, when the bridge fell.\n\nCervantes Suarez, who spoke exclusively to NBC News for the first time since the bridge collapse, said he saw his family members and friends disappear into the river one by one, knowing he was next. His nephew, Carlos Daniel Hern\u00e1ndez, whom he considered a son, was the first to fall.\n\nIn what he thought were his final moments, he turned to God.\n\n\"I thanked God for family he gave me.

He was part of a roadwork crew filling potholes on the bridge when a massive cargo ship lost power and crashed into one of its supporting columns on March 26.\n\nSix people died in the collapse, including Cervantes Suarez's nephew and brother-in-law. An inspector working alongside the crew was able to run to safety and declined medical treatment.\n\nCervantes Suarez, 37, who hadn't previously spoken publicly about his experience, said the men were sitting in their construction vehicles during a break when the bridge suddenly started crumbling beneath them. A last-minute mayday call from the ship's pilot had allowed nearby police officers to stop traffic to the bridge just moments earlier, but they didn't have enough time to alert the construction workers.\n\nFaced with almost certain death, Cervantes Suarez said he thanked God for his family.\n\nMiraculously, he was able to manually roll down the window of his rapidly sinking truck and climb out into the frigid water.\n\n\"That's when I realized what happened,\" he told NBC News in Spanish. \"I looked at the bridge, and it was no longer there.\"\n\nHe said he called out to his companions by name, but no one answered him. Unable to swim, he clung to a piece of floating concrete until he was rescued by first responders. He was hospitalized for treatment of a chest wound.\n\nCervantes Suarez said he's haunted by the fall and grieving an unimaginable loss.\n\nAll the victims were Latino immigrants who moved to the U.S. for work opportunities.\n\nIn the immediate aftermath of the collapse, Baltimore County's close-knit Latino community constructed an elaborate memorial where loved ones gathered often while salvage divers continued searching the wreckage for human remains. It took six weeks before all the bodies were recovered.\n\n\"They were good people, good workers and had good values,\" Cervantes Suarez said.\n\nA National Transportation Safety Board investigation found that the wayward cargo ship Dali experienced power outages before starting its voyage from Baltimore to Sri Lanka, but the exact causes of the electrical issues have yet to be determined. The FBI is also conducting a criminal investigation into the circumstances leading up to the disaster.\n\nThe ship's owner and manager, both Singapore-based companies, filed a court petition soon after the collapse seeking to limit their legal liability. The City of Baltimore, among other entities, have challenged that claim and accused the companies of negligence. Lawyers representing victims of the collapse and their families, including Cervantes Suarez, have also pledged to hold the companies accountable.\n\nA federal court in Maryland will ultimately decide who's responsible and how much they owe in what could become one of the most expensive maritime disasters in history.\n\nOfficials have pledged to rebuild the bridge, which could cost at least $1.7 billion and take several years.\n\nDuring a Senate committee hearing Wednesday morning, Maryland senators reiterated calls for Congress to approve a spending measure that would allow the federal government to cover 100% of the rebuild effort.\n\nThe sections of the bridge that remain standing will be demolished in the coming months to make way for the new structure, local media reported earlier this week.", "source": {"uri": "mynorthwest.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "My Northwest"}, "authors": [{"uri": "associated_press@mynorthwest.com", "name": "Associated Press", "type":

In his interview with NBC, Cervantes said that he considered Hern\u00e1ndez as a son.\n\n\"If I had told him to come with me, maybe it would have been different. Maybe he would be here with us,\" he said to NBC. \"I relive it all the time, the minutes before the fall and when I'm falling.\"\n\nCervantes told NBC that he has spent time with Fuentes' children in the wake of the collapse.\n\n\"I see how much they miss their dad,\" Cervantes said.\n\nIn April, attorney L. Chris Stewart of Atlanta-based Stewart Miller Simmons Trial Attorneys said Cervantes escaped after rolling down his work truck's manual window. Cervantes, who can't swim, clung to debris until he was rescued, Stewart said at a news conference. Cervantes was treated for a chest injury and released but still suffers pain in his chest and left leg, he told NBC.\n\nStewart also said in April that the workers were sitting in their vehicles during a break when the bridge collapsed and had \"zero warning\" of the Dali's approach.\n\nStewart and attorney Justin Miller, who also is Cervantes and the families of Fuentes and Jos\u00e9 Mynor L\u00f3pez, did not return phone calls seeking comment Wednesday afternoon.\n\nCervantes was the only worker to fall into the water that night and survive. A Maryland state inspector was on a different part of the bridge, and escaped the collapse on foot. He also has not spoken to the news media.\n\nAll six of the workers who perished were Latino: Dorlian Ronial Castillo Cabrera and L\u00f3pez of Guatemala; Miguel Luna of El Salvador; Maynor Suazo Sandoval of Honduras.\n\nCervantes is from Mexico, as are his lost family members.\n\nIt took nearly a month-and-a-half for the bodies of all six of the workers to be recovered from the Patapsco River. Some of the families held memorial services locally, and repatriated their loved one's body back to their home country in Latin America.

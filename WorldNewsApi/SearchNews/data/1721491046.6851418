A spokesperson for Kimmel echoed this view. The video is the most recent in a series of clips taken at public events, some of them edited, that are being used to suggest Biden is mentally and physically unfit for office. Here\u2019s a closer look at the facts. CLAIM: Biden froze onstage during his fundraiser in Los Angeles on Saturday night and had to be led away by Obama. THE FACTS: Biden paused amid cheers and applause as he exited the stage with his predecessor following an interview moderated by late-night host Kimmel. Former President Donald Trump shared a video on his social media platform Truth Social that showed a grainy version of Biden stopping and looking out into the audience as he departed. \u201cIs this really who you want to be your president?\u201d Trump asked in the post. Separate footage from the event provided to The Associated Press by Biden campaign spokesperson James Singer shows the president waving, pointing, clapping and giving the thumbs-up to the audience alongside Obama while Kimmel waits off to the side. Biden then stands still for about seven seconds looking out at the crowd. He starts moving again when Obama briefly takes his arm and puts his hand on his back as the pair walks offstage. White House spokesperson Andrew Bates described the moment as \u201cthe President taking in an applauding crowd for a few seconds.\u201d Singer attributed the negative characterizations as a distraction tactic from those who \u201care so scared of losing to Joe Biden, they\u2019ll make anything up to distract from the fact that their candidate for president, Donald Trump, has been convicted of 34 felonies, found liable for sexual assault, committed financial fraud, and only cares about himself.\u201d In response to a question at a press briefing on Monday about videos that have been edited to make Biden appear frail or confused, White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre called such footage \u201ccheap fakes video\u201d that are \u201cdone in bad faith.\u201d She added that they demonstrate \u201ceverything that we need to know about how desperate, how desperate Republicans are here.\u201d A source who helped organize, and attended, the fundraiser told the AP that there was nothing noteworthy about this moment and that Obama wanted to be \u201cchummy\u201d by walking offstage with Biden. Lewis Kay, a spokesperson for Kimmel, called the claims spreading online \u201cnonsense.\u201d \u201cAttendees in the front were shouting at him, and President Biden was trying to hear them,\u201d he wrote in an email to the AP. \u201cIt\u2019s as simple as that.\u201d The fundraiser took in a record $30 million-plus, according to Biden\u2019s campaign. George Clooney, Julia Roberts and Barbra Streisand were among those who took the stage at the event. During their interview with Kimmel, Biden and Obama both stressed the need to defeat Trump in a race that\u2019s expected to be exceedingly close. ___ This is part of the AP\u2019s effort to address widely shared false and misleading information that is circulating online.

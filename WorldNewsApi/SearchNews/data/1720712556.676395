Donal Snr first took the Fianna F\u00e1il seat after the tragic passing of Manus Kelly in the Donegal rally five years ago. A year on, Donal Snr stood down, seeing a similar drive in Donal than in Manus. \u201cI was depriving him (Donal) of holding the seat, he is a young man, eager, I know the drive in him,\u201d Donal Snr tells Donegal Daily. \u201cHe worked hard over three and a half years, I was able to start him off on the right foot and he has come on in leaps and bounds.\u201d Donal Snr was his son\u2019s Director of Elections in a mammoth seven week campaign. \u201cWe ran a great campaign, we had great reports at the door, people were eager, he was working hard and they wanted him there,\u201d he said.

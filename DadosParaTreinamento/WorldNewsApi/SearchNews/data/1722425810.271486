{"id": 243219174, "title": "Warriors, Chris Paul push back contract deadline amid trade rumors", "text": "The Warriors have two extra days to figure out what to do with Chris Paul. Golden State and the 39-year-old guard agreed to push back the deadline for when his $30 million salary for next season \u2014 the final year of a four-year, $120 million deal inked with the Suns in August 2021 \u2014 becomes guaranteed from Friday to Sunday, according to multiple reports. The purpose of that change, according to ESPN, revolved around helping find a potential trade partner that fits Paul, though the outlet added that there\u2019s still a possibility the Warriors will waive him to save salary cap space. Warriors general manager Mike Dunleavy Jr. had hinted at the possibility of extending the deadline during a press conference Thursday, though he didn\u2019t consider the team\u2019s decision on Paul \u2014 the guard who spent last season with Golden State after getting traded from the Suns to the Wizards and then the Wizards to the Warriors across four days \u2014 to reflect the \u201cpivot point\u201d of their offseason. \u201cWe still have some time on that, which will take,\u201d Dunleavy told reporters Thursday, \u201cand we\u2019ll come to a conclusion. But in terms of pivot point, no, it doesn\u2019t. We\u2019ll figure it out and go from there, but I don\u2019t think it\u2019s gonna make a huge difference in terms of like how things shake out overall.\u201d In his first year with the Warriors, Paul averaged 9.2 points and 6.8 assists per game, starting the fewest games \u2014 just 18 \u2014 of his career and settling into a complementary role alongside a struggling group that still possessed a star-filled lineup. The Warriors, who finished No. 10 in the Western Conference, were eliminated by the Kings during their opening game of the play-in tournament, and that started an offseason filled with speculation about the futures of Klay Thompson, Andrew Wiggins and Paul. Wiggins, according to The Ringer, will likely be \u201caggressively dangled,\u201d in addition to the reality that Paul could get traded. Those are the decisions that will shape the Warriors\u2019 offseason, and last year, right around this time, they were the final stop for Paul after a whirlwind one-week stretch. He was dealt by the Suns \u2014 where he had played since 2020-21 \u2014 to the Wizards in a three-team trade on June 23, and days later, Washington sent him to the Warriors in the deal that brought Jordan Poole to the Warriors. But depending on what Dunleavy decides by Sunday, it might be a one-season stint in Golden State.", "summary": "The Warriors have two extra days to figure out what to do with Chris Paul.", "url": "https://nypost.com/2024/06/28/sports/warriors-chris-paul-push-back-contract-deadline-amid-trade-rumors/", "image": "https://nypost.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/06/newspress-collage-jnysx370l-1719608495906.jpg?quality=75&strip=all&1719594237&w=1200", "video": null, "publish_date": "2024-06-29 00:22:05", "author": "Andrew Crane", "authors": ["Andrew Crane"], "language": "en", "source_country": "us", "sentiment": -0.299}

There are typically between 40 and 50 guests and 10 staff members at the chalet each night, with most visitors arriving by foot or horse along a steep trail nearly 7 miles (11 kilometers) from Lake McDonald Lodge on the park's main roadway.\n\nA lightning strike ignited a fire in the forest somewhere between the lodge and the chalet.

Early Friday, it was estimated to be about 80 acres. Fires have also been reported in the Apgar Lookout area, the Nyack area and in the Camas drainage.\n\nFire conditions in the park are rated extreme. Fire managers expect the hot and dry conditions to last at least through the weekend.\n\nSperry Chalet guests were told they would either have to hike out via the Gunsight Pass Trail or remain in place while the Sprague Fire was being assessed. People with reservations for Friday night will not be able to access the chalet. The chalet is not in immediate danger, but the main trail accessing it is affected by the fire.\n\nGlacier closed a number of trails, including the Apgar Lookout Trail, Howe Ridge Trail, Camas Trail, Trout Lake Trail, the Sperry Trail from Lake McDonald to Sperry Chalet (including all secondary trails such as the Snyder Trail), John's Lake Trail, and Lincoln Lake Trail.\n\nNo horseback rides will depart from the Lake McDonald Corral Friday.\n\nBackcountry areas in those areas are closed and users are being escorted out. Backcountry campgrounds impacted by the closures include Arrow, Camas, Snyder, Sperry, and Lincoln campgrounds.\n\nOther backcountry areas in the park are open to day use, but no new overnight backcountry permits will be issued Friday as a precaution while the park searches for other new fires potentially started by Thursday's storm.\n\n\"That's the pattern that we've seen following storms,\" Alley said. \"After they pass through, we'll start to spot fires a day or two afterward.\"\n\nMost backcountry areas in the park remain open, including areas in the North Fork that had been closed earlier this week. Initial attack efforts on about eight fires started by a storm earlier this week were successful in either containing or putting out those blazes.\n\nAlley said firefighting resources that had been assigned to the North Fork are being moved to help attack the new fires flaring in the Lake McDonald area.\n\nNone of the fires in the North Fork were allowed to burn for resource benefits due to the dry conditions that can lead to extreme fire behavior and the challenges in finding firefighting resources right now, Alley said.\n\nA Type III incident commander has been assigned to the new fires in Glacier and additional resources are being ordered. The initial attack on the fires is being managed by the park and Flathead National Forest fire management staff.\n\nVisitors should check the park's trail status page for the most current closure information. https://www.nps.gov/glac/planyourvisit/trailstatusreports.htm", "time": "15:12:00"}

Multiple fires have been reported.\n\nFires are suspected or known in the Apgar Lookout area, the Nyack area, Sprague drainage, and Camas drainage.\n\nThe following trails are closed: Apgar Lookout Trail, Howe Ridge Trail, Camas Trail, Trout Lake Trail, the Sperry Trail from Lake McDonald to Sperry Chalet (including all secondary trails such as Synder Trail), John's Lake Trail, and Lincoln Lake Trail.\n\nBackcountry campgrounds in the areas listed above are closed and backcountry users in those areas are being walked out. Those include Arrow, Camas, Snyder, Sperry, and Lincoln Backcountry Campgrounds. Other backcountry areas in the park are still open for day use.\n\nNo new overnight backcountry permits will be issued today to reduce the number of people overnighting in the backcountry while the park assesses the impacts from last night's storm. Sperry Chalet guests will either hike out via the Gunsight Pass Trail, or remain in place while the Sprague fire is being assessed. Guests with reservations for tonight will not be able to access the chalet. Additional updates will be available as the fire is further evaluated. The structures in the Sperry Chalet complex are not immediately threatened, however the main trail accessing the chalet may be impacted by the fire. No horseback rides will depart from the Lake McDonald Corral today.\n\nA Type III incident commander has been assigned and additional resources are being ordered. The initial attack for these fires is being managed with park and Flathead National Forest fire management staff and law enforcement, including air support.\n\nMost areas of the park remain open including all areas of the North Fork (all closures have been lifted from earlier this week), Apgar Village, the Going-to-the-Sun Road, Granite Park Chalet, Two Medicine, St. Mary, and Many Glacier.\n\nFire managers expect hot and dry conditions to persist through the weekend. Additional trail closures are possible as conditions change or new fires are detected. Visitors should check the park's trail status page for the most current closure information.\n\nThe park is currently experiencing a power outage on the west side of the park unrelated to the fires. The outage extends beyond the park boundary. This may impact the park's ability to provide up to the minute fire updates.", "time": "15:45:00"}

That trail ends up on the eastern side of the park, on the other side of the Continental Divide from Lake McDonald Lodge.\n\nFor those who stay, the chalet has running water, a full-service kitchen and 17 private rooms - but it doesn't have electricity and only spotty cellphone coverage.\n\n\"The good news is they got resupplied yesterday,\" Alley said.\n\nShare\n\nSend questions/comments to the editors.\n\nWant the news vital to Maine?

Additional details about the size and scope of the outbreak of fires were limited Friday morning.\n\nThe largest known blaze is the Sprague Fire east of Lake McDonald, which scorched 80 acres overnight.\n\nAs of Friday morning, the following trails were closed in Glacier Park:\n\nApgar Lookout Trail\n\nHowe Ridge Trail\n\nCamas Trail\n\nTrout Lake Trail\n\nThe Sperry Trail from Lake McDonald to Sperry Chalet\n\nThe Synder Trail\n\nJohn's Lake Trail\n\nLincoln Lake Trail\n\nThe Arrow, Camas, Snyder, Sperry, and Lincoln backcountry campgrounds are also closed.\n\nNo new overnight backcountry camping permits will be issued on Friday to reduce the number of people staying in the backcountry while park officials assess the situation.\n\nGuests at the Sperry Chalet are being advised to either hike out via the Gunsight Pass Trail or remain in place until park officials assess the Sprague Fire. The structures in the Sperry Chalet complex are not immediately threatened, according to park officials.\n\nA Type III incident management team has been assigned to the fires in the park and additional firefighting resources are being sent to the area.\n\nThursday night's storm also knocked out power on the west side of Glacier Park. Nearly 5,000 members lost power in the West Glacier and Hungry Horse areas, according to Flathead Electric Cooperative.\n\nThe Gibraltar Ridge Fire, east of Eureka, grew another 200 acres in the last 24 hours. It is now 1,652 acres. Last night's thunderstorm brought high east winds that caused several spot fires to develop on the west of Foothills Road. Fire crews responded to the new starts and worked through the night to suppress the flames. One of the new fires is located just across the Foothills Road and north of the intersection with the Lick Lake Road. These small fires are generally located near the Foothills Road and Lick Lake Road junction.\n\nAs of 6 a.m., no structures had been lost to the fire but several are threatened. These wind-driven spot fires will continue to be a challenge for firefighters throughout the day, according to fire managers.\n\nA public information meeting is scheduled for 6 p.m., Friday evening at the Lincoln County High School gym.\n\nTinderbox conditions are plaguing the region, creating high fire danger.\n\nStrict fire restrictions are in place across Western Montana, prohibiting campfires and internal combustion engines without a spark arrestor in the outdoors. Stage II restrictions mean people are prohibited from using motorized vehicles off road; operating any internal combustion engines during certain hours; having a fire of any kind, smoking or using fireworks.\n\nThis story will be updated when more information becomes available.\n\nComments\n\ncomments", "time": "16:07:00"}

A new start detected near Howe Lake was estimated at about a tenth of an acre.\n\nFire conditions in the park are rated extreme. Fire managers expect the hot and dry conditions to last at least through the weekend. They could be exacerbated by a red flag warning, which has been issued for western Montana Saturday.\n\nGlacier Park officials closed Sperry Chalet when the Sprague Fire appeared to threaten the main trail into the popular tourist attraction.\n\nGuests were told they would either have to hike out via the Gunsight Pass Trail or remain in place while the Sprague Fire was being assessed. People with reservations for Friday night will not be able to access the chalet. The chalet is not in immediate danger.\n\nGlacier also closed a number of trails, including the Apgar Lookout Trail, Howe Ridge Trail, Camas Trail, Trout Lake Trail, the Sperry Trail from Lake McDonald to Sperry Chalet (including all secondary trails such as the Snyder Trail), John's Lake Trail, and Lincoln Lake Trail.\n\nBackcountry areas in those areas are closed and users are being escorted out. Backcountry campgrounds affected by the closures include Arrow, Camas, Snyder, Sperry, and Lincoln campgrounds.\n\nAll of those closures remained in place late Friday afternoon.\n\nOther backcountry areas in the park are open to day use, but no new overnight backcountry permits were issued Friday as a precaution while the park searches for other new fires potentially started by Thursday's storm.\n\nMost backcountry areas in the park remain open, including areas in the North Fork that had been closed earlier this week after initial attack efforts on about eight fires started by a storm earlier this week were successful in either containing or putting out the blazes.\n\nOn Thursday, the National Multi-Agency Coordinating Group made the decision to place the country on its highest level for preparedness.\n\nPreparedness Level 5 means that nearly all firefighting suppression resources and people are committed.\n\nIn an Aug. 16 memo, Secretary of the Interior Ryan Zinke said the decision to move to the highest level of preparedness reflects the complexity of fires facing firefighters.\n\n\"There are currently more than 15,000 interagency firefighting personnel deployed in 10 geographic areas,\" Zinke wrote. \"Based on this level of wildfire activity, and to meet existing challenges, I am asking that all DOI supervisors make all qualified personnel immediately available for assignments.\n\n\"If your employees are red carded and available to assist in any capacity, their first priority should be response to fire incidents.\"\n\nFor those not qualified for assignments, Zinke said those employees should provide backup for those accepting fire assignments.\n\nMontana is currently in the bulls-eye of fire activity in the country.\n\nThere are 12 large fires burning the state. Three Type 1 and six Type 2 teams are assigned to manage many of the nearly 4,000 firefighting personnel working on wildfires in Montana.\n\nThe evacuation warning for the Lolo Peak fire was expanded Friday afternoon to include both the north and south sides of Highway 12 near Lolo between mile post 20 at Bear Creek to Fort Fizzle.\n\nThe expansion was due to the weekend's impending Red Flag warning. This is not an evacuation order, but a warning that evacuations may be needed.\n\nGlacier National Park visitors should check the park's trail status page for the most current closure information: www.nps.gov/glac/planyourvisit/trailstatusreports.htm.", "time": "00:53:00"}

New fires are being assessed on the east side of the park, including a small fire visible from the Going-to-the Sun Road near Siyeh Bend, and on Elk Mountain in the southeast area of the park. Both of these fires are estimated to be less than a tenth of an acre in size, and are in rocky areas with little potential for spread.\n\nA red flag warning has been issued from 2 p.m. Sunday until later in the evening for the Glacier National Park region. Strong winds and possible thunderstorms are predicted. Due to extremely dry conditions, potential for new starts and fire growth is high. Additional fire personnel are staged on both sides of the park to respond to new fires.\n\nThe Apgar Lookout Trail has been reopened, as has the Johns Lake area trails. Closures remain in effect for the Howe Ridge Trail, Camas Trail, Trout Lake Trail, the Sperry Trail from Lake McDonald to Gunsight Pass (including all secondary trails such as the Snyder Lake Trail), and the Lincoln Lake Trail. The Inside North Fork Road is also closed to vehicles from Fish Creek to Logging Lake.\n\nBackcountry campgrounds in the areas listed above are also closed. Other backcountry areas in the park are still open for day use. No new overnight backcountry permits are being issued, in order to reduce the number of people overnighting in the backcountry while the park remains in extreme fire danger. Individuals with current backcountry permits for areas not impacted by fires are not being asked to leave.\n\nSperry Chalet remains closed. The structures in the Sperry Chalet complex are not immediately threatened, however the Sprague fire has necessitated the closure of the main trail that accesses the chalet. As of Aug. 11, no overnight guests remain at Sperry Chalet.\n\nMost areas of the park are open including all areas of the North Fork, Apgar Village, the Going-to-the-Sun Road, Granite Park Chalet, Two Medicine, St. Mary, Many Glacier and Goat Haunt.

backcountry campgrounds closed\n\n-- Gibralter Ridge Fire east of Eureka grows to more than 1,600 acres\n\nUpdated: Aug. 11, 3:20 p.m.\n\nCrews are busy suppressing three wildfires burning on the west side of Glacier National Park following a storm that produced more than 150 lightning strikes late Thursday, prompting trail and backcountry campground closures.\n\nThe largest blaze is the Sprague Fire east of Lake McDonald and south of Mount Brown, which scorched 10 acres overnight. Initial estimates suggested the fire was more than 50 acres, but Glacier National Park spokesperson Lauren Alley said a flight over the park on Friday morning was able to record a more accurate size. Multiple helicopters are attacking the priority blaze and firefighters have been dropped on the incident.\n\nThe Rogers Fire is currently estimated at 2 acres but it is producing sparse amounts of smoke, according to Alley. A new start was also detected near Howe Lake that is estimated at less than one-tenth of an acre.\n\nAs of Friday morning, the following trails were closed in Glacier Park:\n\nApgar Lookout Trail\n\nHowe Ridge Trail\n\nCamas Trail\n\nTrout Lake Trail\n\nThe Sperry Trail from Lake McDonald to Sperry Chalet\n\nMount Brown Trail\n\nThe Snyder Trail\n\nJohn's Lake Trail\n\nLincoln Lake Trail\n\nThe Arrow, Camas, Snyder, Sperry, and Lincoln backcountry campgrounds are also closed.\n\nNo new overnight backcountry camping permits will be issued on Friday to reduce the number of people staying in the backcountry while park officials assess the situation. No horseback rides will depart from the Lake McDonald Corral on Friday.\n\n\"\"\" Click here to view a map of the reported fires\n\nThere were 42 guests at the Sperry Chalet and they were advised to either hike out via the Gunsight Pass Trail or remain in place until park officials assess the Sprague Fire. The structures in the Sperry Chalet complex are not immediately threatened, according to park officials.\n\nThere were 39 guests at the chalet who began hiking out over Gunsight Friday morning, while three stayed with staff, according to a person close to the situation.\n\nPark rangers are also leading out hikers who were staying in backcountry campgrounds near the fires.\n\nA Type III incident management team has been assigned to the fires in the park and additional firefighting resources are being sent to the area.\n\n\"\"\" Glacier Park: What's Open and What's Closed\n\nThursday night's storm also knocked out power on the west side of Glacier Park, but it was restored by late morning Friday. Nearly 5,000 members temporarily lost power in the West Glacier and Hungry Horse areas, according to Flathead Electric Cooperative.\n\nThe Flathead Interagency Dispatch Center received 56 calls to 911 about power line emergencies, many of which caused small fires that crews quickly extinguished, according to the local emergency services agency.\n\nJanette Turk, spokesperson with Flathead National Forest, said aircraft will be scanning the mountains for potential new fires after dozens of lightning strikes overnight.\n\nThe Gibralter Ridge Fire, east of Eureka, grew another 200 acres in the last 24 hours. It is now 1,652 acres. Last night's thunderstorm brought high east winds that caused several spot fires to develop on the west of Foothills Road.\n\nFire crews responded to the new starts and worked through the night to suppress the flames. One of the new fires is located just across the Foothills Road and north of the intersection with the Lick Lake Road. These small fires are generally located near the Foothills Road and Lick Lake Road junction.\n\nAs of 6 a.m., no structures had been lost to the fire but several are threatened. These wind-driven spot fires will continue to be a challenge for firefighters throughout the day, according to fire managers.\n\nA public information meeting is scheduled for 6 p.m., Friday evening at the Lincoln County High School gym.\n\nFirefighters are also battling a fire on the east side of Flathead Lake. The Blue Bay Fire has burned 17 acres in the Mission Mountains about a mile from Montana Highway 35, according to Confederated Salish and Kootenai Tribes fire prevention specialist C.T. Camel. No structures are threatened at this time. A hand crew and air resources, including two CL-215 scooper planes based at Glacier International Airport, were battling the blaze early Friday afternoon.\n\nSmoke is blanketing the region and harming air quality conditions. Air quality in Seeley Lake is considered hazardous, and health officials are encouraging resident to evacuate. Seeley Lake registered air pollution levels Thursday morning 38 times above what the World Health Organization says is safe, the Associated Press reported.\n\nAir Quality Conditions\n\nAs of Aug. 11\n\nSource: Montana Department of Environmental Quality\n\nHazardous\n\nWhen air quality is \"hazardous,\" health officials recommend everyone should avoid any outdoor exertion; people with respiratory or heart disease, the elderly, and children should remain indoors.\n\n-- Seeley Lake (recommended evacuation)\n\nVery Unhealthy\n\nWhen air quality is \"very unhealthy,\" health officials recommend people with respiratory or heart disease, the elderly, and children should avoid any outdoor activity; everyone else should avoid prolonged exertion.\n\n-- Quartz Creek near Superior\n\nUnhealthy\n\nWhen air quality is \"unhealthy,\" health officials recommend people with respiratory or heart disease, the elderly, and children should avoid prolonged exertion; everyone else should limit prolonged exertion.\n\n-- Arlee\n\n-- Lolo\n\n-- Missoula\n\nUnhealthy for Sensitive Groups\n\nWhen air quality is \"unhealthy for sensitive groups,\" health officials recommend people with respiratory or heart disease, the elderly and children should limit prolonged exertion.\n\n-- Libby\n\n-- Thompson Falls\n\nModerate\n\nWhen air quality is \"moderate,\" health officials recommend that unusually sensitive people should consider reducing prolonged or heavy exertion.\n\n-- Clearwater\n\n-- Flathead Valley\n\n-- Butte\n\n-- Dillon\n\n-- Helena\n\n-- Bozeman\n\n-- Great Falls\n\n-- Lewistown\n\nTinderbox conditions are plaguing the region, creating high fire danger.\n\nStrict fire restrictions are in place across Western Montana, prohibiting campfires and internal combustion engines without a spark arrestor in the outdoors. Stage II restrictions mean people are prohibited from using motorized vehicles off road; operating any internal combustion engines during certain hours; having a fire of any kind, smoking or using fireworks.\n\nThis story will be updated when more information becomes available on Aug. 10.

(AP) - A wildfire has cut off the return route for dozens of people staying in a Glacier National Park backcountry chalet, leaving them the choice of remaining until rangers tell them it's safe or hiking out along a longer and more difficult trail, park officials said Friday.\n\nPark rangers also planned to lead out 39 other hikers who were staying in backcountry campsites near fires that broke out after a passing lightning storm on Thursday, Glacier spokeswoman Lauren Alley said.\n\nIt's peak tourist season at the Montana park, and the stone chalet built more than a century ago is a top attraction in one of the busiest parts of Glacier. There are typically between 40 and 50 guests and 10 staff members at the chalet each night, with most visitors arriving by foot or horse along a steep trail nearly 7 miles (11 kilometers) from Lake McDonald Lodge on the park's main roadway.\n\nA lightning strike ignited a fire in the forest somewhere between the lodge and the chalet. Neither structure is threatened, but park officials determined that it was unsafe for those at the chalet to return by the same trail Friday.\n\nThirty-nine of the 42 guests staying at the Sperry Chalet decided to hike out and three stayed behind, said Suzie Menke, the office manager of Belton Chalets Inc., which runs the chalet.\n\n___\n\nXi calls for calm after Trump says US is 'locked and loaded'\n\nSEOUL, South Korea (AP) - Chinese President Xi Jinping made a plea for cool-headedness over escalating tensions between the U.S. and North Korea in a phone conversation with U.S. President Donald Trump on Saturday, urging both sides to avoid words or actions that could worsen the situation.\n\nThe call came after Trump unleashed a slew of fresh threats against North Korea on Friday, declaring the U.S. military \"locked and loaded\" and warning North Korean leader Kim Jong Un that he \"will regret it fast\" if he takes any action against U.S. territories or allies.\n\nTrump has pushed China to pressure North Korea to halt a nuclear weapons program that is nearing the capability of targeting the United States. China is the North's biggest economic partner and source of aid, but says it alone can't compel Pyongyang to end its nuclear and missile programs.\n\nState-run China Central Television quoted Xi as telling Trump the \"relevant parties must maintain restraint and avoid words and deeds that would exacerbate the tension on the Korean Peninsula.\"\n\nBut restraint was not the word of the day on Friday as Trump sent out a cascade of unscripted statements, including what appeared to be another red line - the mere utterance of threats - that would trigger a U.S. attack against North Korea and \"big, big trouble\" for Kim.\n\n___\n\nAnalysis: Trump meets crisis with familiar bluster, risk\n\nBEDMINSTER, N.J. (AP) - A nuclear showdown. The world's most unpredictable foe. A world on edge. What will the new president do?\n\nBe Trump.\n\nFaced with perhaps his gravest international crisis yet, President Donald Trump this week responded precisely as his some of supporters hoped and his critics long feared. The mix of plain-spoken bluster, spontaneity and norm-breaking risk that defined his political rise defined his approach to a round of fresh threats from nuclear North Korea. When Pyongyang punched, Trump counterpunched harder - much as he did on a debate stage flanked by political opponents.\n\nBut this was not a Florida debate stage or a low-stakes celebrity Twitter war of the sort Trump perfected before entering politics. It was a standoff over North Korea's rapidly developing nuclear program, complete with trading threats of war and the safety of millions in the balance. Over the course of the week, Trump unleashed provocative rhetoric and dismissed the careful or precise diplomatic language favored by his predecessors.\n\n\"They should be very nervous,\" Trump said of North Korea. \"Because things will happen to them like they never thought possible, OK?\n\n___\n\nJudge tosses DJ's suit against Taylor Swift in groping trial\n\nDENVER (AP) - A judge on Friday threw out a former radio host's case against Taylor Swift in a trial that delved into their dueling lawsuits over whether he groped her during a backstage meet-and-greet and whether she and her team ruined his career.\n\nU.S. District Judge William Martinez determined that the pop star could not be held liable because David Mueller failed to prove that she personally set out to have him fired after the 2013 photo op in Denver. His identical allegations against Swift's mother and her radio liaison will go to jurors for a verdict.\n\nMueller denies groping Swift and sued the singer, her mother, Andrea Swift, and their radio handler, Frank Bell, seeking up to $3 million as compensation for his ruined career.\n\nThe singer-songwriter said in her countersuit that she wanted a symbolic $1 and the chance to stand up for other women. The jury will still consider her claim.\n\nSwift teared up as the judge read his decision and said there was no evidence of her actions being insincere. Afterward, her team smiled and embraced. Mueller's side didn't speak.\n\n___\n\nTrump spat with Senate leader complicates tough agenda\n\nWASHINGTON (AP) - Donald Trump's attacks on Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell come at the worst possible time, if the president's goal is actually to accomplish the agenda on health care, infrastructure and taxes he's goading his GOP ally to pass.\n\nCongress, now on its August recess, will return to confront a brutal September workload including two absolute must-do items: funding the government to head off a shutdown, and raising the federal borrowing limit to avert a potentially catastrophic first-ever default on U.S. obligations.\n\nBoth will require bipartisan cooperation, something that's been in short supply on Capitol Hill this year. And that's all apart from the legislation Trump wants to see, including a rewrite of the tax code to lower rates, a sweeping infrastructure bill, and renewed efforts to repeal Barack Obama's Affordable Care Act after McConnell tried and failed last month - an outcome Trump called \"a disgrace.\"\n\nSo the president's rhetoric this past week has fueled divisions at a moment when his party should be working together toward shared goals, not tearing each other apart. And his agenda only can pass if McConnell navigates it through the Senate, something the veteran lawmaker may not feel more motivated to do with his president working against him instead of for him.\n\n\"Virtually any substantial goals that the president intends to achieve, whether it's tax reform or more infrastructure, requires the active assistance of the Senate majority leader,\" said Michael Steel, who served as spokesman to John Boehner when the Ohio Republican was House speaker.\n\n___\n\nNorth Korea still mastering how to deliver a nuke to US\n\nWASHINGTON (AP) - No need to duck and cover just yet. While U.S. intelligence officials are pretty sure North Korea can put a nuclear warhead on an intercontinental missile that could reach the United States, experts aren't convinced the bomb could survive the flight to America.\n\nThey cite lingering questions about Kim Jong Un's nuclear know-how. Could North Korea deploy nuclear weapons successfully time after time and hit their intended targets? Would its weapon system break apart from the heat and stress it would sustain as it re-enters the Earth's atmosphere at roughly 10 times faster than a speeding bullet?\n\n\"I don't think North Korea has a good measure of how accurate the missile is at this point,\" said Michael Elleman, an expert with the International Institute for Strategic Studies. \"They don't know if the re-entry technologies will really hold up - whether the bomb will survive the trip.\"\n\nNorth Korea has short-range missiles that can hit its neighbors. It has tested an intermediate one that could strike Guam, a U.S. territory, as well as a longer-range missile that could reach Hawaii and perhaps the West Coast of the United States. The intermediate and long-range missiles are still being developed and it's still questionable if they can reliably strike targets.\n\nKim must do more tests to master what is known as \"re-entry\" in missile parlance, experts believe. The process involves shielding a nuclear warhead from the high temperatures and force it faces when it re-enters the Earth's atmosphere at about 15,500 mph (7 kilometers a second).\n\n___\n\nSon of Sam killer says he 'surrendered to dark forces'\n\nNEW YORK (AP) - The \"Son of Sam\" killer who terrorized New York 40 years ago says he thought he was doing something \"to appease the devil.\"\n\nDavid Berkowitz told CBS News in an interview broadcast Friday (http://cbsn.ws/2vjE4Fa ) that he \"surrendered to those very dark forces\" when he killed six people and wounded seven.\n\nThursday was the 40th anniversary of Berkowitz's Aug. 10, 1977 arrest.\n\nCBS' Maurice Dubois interviewed Berkowitz at the prison where he is serving a life sentence.\n\nThe 64-year-old Berkowitz is now a born-again Christian.\n\n___\n\nMedia: World's oldest man, a Holocaust survivor, dies at 113\n\nJERUSALEM (AP) - Israeli media are reporting that the world's oldest man, who lived through both world wars and survived the Holocaust, has died a month short of his 114th birthday.\n\nYnet on Saturday quoted Israel Kristal's daughter as saying her father died Friday. Shula Kupershtuch says: \"He always saw only light and good in everything.\"\n\nGuinness World Records awarded Kristal a certificate as the world's oldest man last year.\n\nKristal was born in Poland. During World War II he was sent to Auschwitz and other Nazi concentration camps. His first wife and two children were killed in the Holocaust.\n\nKristal survived the war - the only survivor of his large Jewish family.\n\n___\n\nFather: Woman killed by officer was 'ripped from our arms'\n\nMINNEAPOLIS (AP) - The father and the fiance of an Australian woman shot to death by a Minneapolis police officer responding to her 911 call grieved at a public memorial service Friday night, the same time the family had planned to be on a plane to her wedding.\n\nJustine Damond's father, John Ruszczyk, choked back tears as he vowed to find justice for his 40-year-old daughter, whom he described as being \"ripped from our arms.\"\n\n\"We should be walking down the street smiling and laughing,\" he said of his first visit to Minneapolis. \"But now every step on the foot path is very painful. I feel crushed by sorrow.\"\n\nHundreds of people, many wearing heart-shaped stickers, attended the memorial service. An Australian flag was displayed prominently on the stage next to Damond's picture.\n\nHer fiance, Don Damond, said it \"felt like a privilege to love Justine.\" They were getting married next week in Hawaii, and he pointed out the painful irony that the service - held at a lakefront stage near her home in southwest Minneapolis - coincided with the family's original travel plans.\n\n___\n\nQatar crisis redraws red lines and frays age-old Gulf ties\n\nDUBAI, United Arab Emirates (AP) - It's early morning at a fishing port in Dubai. A group of mostly retired fishermen are playing cards, eating dates and drinking coffee at the port's majlis, a traditional meeting space.\n\nHere, the Emirati fisherman say they aren't too worried about the political fallout with Qatar that's gripped the region since early June, when Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, Bahrain and Egypt cut ties with the small Gulf state, accusing it of supporting extremists.\n\n\"When it comes to politics, it's not our business,\" Thani Obeid said. \"If everyone walks around saying their opinion there will be chaos.\"\n\nObeid, 65, and Salem Jomaa, 70, say they have faith in the \"wisdom\" of the region's rulers because \"we are one family.\"\n\n\"The Gulf is one home. From Saudi Arabia to Ras al-Khaimah (in the UAE) to Oman. We are all brothers, cousins, friends,\" Jomaa said. \"We are all Muslims.\"", "time": "10:10:00"}

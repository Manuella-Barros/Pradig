If Modi wins, he'll be only the second Indian leader to retain power for a third term after Jawaharlal Nehru, the country's first prime minister.\n\nThe seventh round of voting in 57 constituencies across seven states and one union territory will complete polling for all 543 seats in the powerful lower house of parliament. Nearly 970 million voters -- more than 10 percent of the world's population -- were eligible to elect a new parliament for five years. More than 8,300 candidates ran for the office.\n\nMost polls show Modi and his Bharatiya Janata Party leading over the broad opposition alliance that's challenging them, led by the Congress party. The votes will be counted Tuesday, with results expected by the end of the day.\n\nModi's campaign, vying for a third-straight term, began on a platform of economic progress. He promised to uplift the poor and turn India into a developed nation by 2047. But it has turned increasingly shrill in recent weeks as he escalated polarizing rhetoric in back-to-back incendiary speeches that targeted the country's Muslim minority, who make up 14 percent of India's 1.4 billion people.\n\nOn Thursday, after finishing his election campaign, Modi went to meditate at a memorial site honoring a famous Hindu saint who is believed to have attained enlightenment there.\n\nWhen the election kicked off in April, Modi and his BJP were widely expected to clinch another term.\n\nSince first coming to power in 2014, Modi has enjoyed immense popularity. His supporters see him as a self-made, strong leader who has improved India's standing in the world, and credit his pro-business policies with making the economy the world's fifth-largest.\n\nAt the same time, his rule has seen brazen attacks and hate speech against minorities, particularly Muslims. India's democracy, his critics say, is faltering and Modi has increasingly blurred the line between religion and state.\n\nBut as the campaign ground on, his party has faced stiff resistance from the opposition alliance and its main face, Rahul Gandhi of the Congress party. They have attacked Modi over his Hindu nationalist politics and are hoping to benefit from growing economic discontent.\n\nPre-poll surveys showed that voters were increasingly worried about unemployment, the rise in food prices and an overall sentiment that only a small portion of Indians have benefitted despite brisk economic growth under Modi, making the contest appear closer than initially anticipated.\n\nIn this election, Modi's BJP -- which controls much of India's Hindi-speaking northern and central parts -- sought to expand their influence by making inroads into the country's eastern and southern states, where regional parties hold greater sway.\n\nThe BJP also banked on consolidating votes among the Hindu majority, who make up 80 percent of the population, after Modi opened a long-demanded Hindu temple on the site of a razed mosque in January. Many saw it as the unofficial start of his campaign, but analysts said the excitement over the temple may not be enough to yield votes.\n\nInstead, Modi ramped up anti-Muslim rhetoric after voter turnout dipped slightly below 2019 figures in the first few rounds of the 2024 polls.\n\nThis was seen as a tactic to energize his core Hindu voter base. But analysts say it also reflected the lack of any big-ticket national issue to help Modi propel his BJP to electoral victory, as he has done previously.\n\nIn 2014, Modi's status as a political outsider cracking down on deep-rooted corruption won over voters disillusioned with decades of dynastic politics. And in 2019, he swept the polls on a wave of nationalism after his government launched airstrikes into rival Pakistan in response to a suicide bombing in Kashmir that killed 40 Indian soldiers.\n\nBut things are different this time, analysts say, giving Modi's political challengers a potential boost.\n\n\"The opposition somehow managed to derail his plan by setting the narrative to local issues, like unemployment and the economy.

Now all that's left is to wait for the results, which are expected to be announced Tuesday.\n\nThe election is considered one of the most consequential in India's history. If Modi wins, he'll be only the second Indian leader to retain power for a third term after Jawaharlal Nehru, the country's first prime minister.\n\nMost poll surveys show Modi and his Bharatiya Janata Party leading over the broad opposition alliance that's challenging them, led by the Congress party. The votes will be counted Tuesday, with results expected by the end of the day.\n\nModi's campaign began on a platform of economic progress, with vows to uplift the poor and turn India into a developed nation by 2047. But it turned increasingly shrill in recent weeks as Modi escalated polarizing rhetoric in incendiary speeches that targeted the country's Muslim minority, who make up 14 percent of India's 1.4 billion people.\n\nAfter campaigning ended on Thursday, Modi went to a memorial site honoring a famous Hindu saint to meditate on national television. The opposition Congress party called it a political stunt and said it violated election rules as the campaigning period has ended.\n\nWhen the election kicked off in April, Modi and his BJP were widely expected to clinch another term.\n\nSince coming to power in 2014, Modi has enjoyed immense popularity. His supporters see him as a self-made, strong leader who has improved India's standing in the world, and credit his pro-business policies with making the economy the world's fifth-largest.\n\nAt the same time, his rule has seen brazen attacks and hate speech against minorities, particularly Muslims. India's democracy, his critics say, is faltering and Modi has increasingly blurred the line between religion and state.\n\nBut as the campaign ground on, his party faced stiff resistance from the opposition alliance and its main face, Rahul Gandhi of the Congress party. They have attacked Modi over his Hindu nationalist politics and are hoping to benefit from growing economic discontent.\n\nPre-poll surveys showed that voters were increasingly worried about unemployment, the rise in food prices and an overall sentiment that only a small portion of Indians have benefitted despite brisk economic growth under Modi, making the contest appear closer than initially anticipated.\n\nThe seventh round of polls covered 57 constituencies across seven states and one union territory, completing a national election to fill all 543 seats in the powerful lower house of parliament. Nearly 970 million voters -- more than 10 percent of the world's population. More than 8,300 candidates ran for five-year terms in parliament.\n\nIn Kolkata, the capital of West Bengal, voters lined up outside polling stations early Saturday morning to avoid the scorching heat, with temperatures expected to reach 34 degrees Celsius (93.2 Fahrenheit). Modi was challenged there by the state's chief minister, Mamata Banerjee, who heads the regional Trinamool Congress party.\n\n\"There is a crunch for jobs now in the present market. I will vote for the government that can uplift jobs. And I hope those who cannot get jobs, they will get jobs,\" said Ankit Samaddar.\n\nIn this election, Modi's BJP -- which controls much of India's Hindi-speaking northern and central parts -- sought to expand their influence by making inroads into the country's eastern and southern states, where regional parties hold greater sway.\n\nThe BJP also banked on consolidating votes among the Hindu majority, who make up 80 percent of the population, after Modi opened a long-demanded Hindu temple on the site of a razed mosque in January. Many saw it as the unofficial start of his campaign, but analysts said the excitement over the temple may not be enough to yield votes.\n\nModi ramped up anti-Muslim rhetoric after voter turnout dipped slightly below 2019 figures in the first few rounds of the 2024 polls, in a move seen as a bid to energize his core Hindu voter base. But analysts say it also reflected the absence of a single big-ticket campaign issue, which Modi has relied on to power previous campaigns.\n\nIn 2014, Modi's status as a political outsider with plans to crack down on deep-rooted corruption won over voters disillusioned with decades of dynastic politics. And in 2019, he swept the polls on a wave of nationalism after his government launched airstrikes into rival Pakistan in response to a suicide bombing in Kashmir that killed 40 Indian soldiers.\n\nBut things are different this time, analysts say, giving Modi's political challengers a potential opportunity.\n\n\"The opposition somehow managed to derail his plan by setting the narrative to local issues, like unemployment and the economy.

His supporters see him as a self-made, strong leader who has improved India's standing in the world, and credit his pro-business policies with making the economy the world's fifth-largest.\n\nAt the same time, his rule has seen brazen attacks and hate speech against minorities, particularly Muslims. India's democracy, his critics say, is faltering and Modi has increasingly blurred the line between religion and state.\n\nBut as the campaign ground on, his party faced stiff resistance from the opposition alliance and its main face, Rahul Gandhi of the Congress party. They have attacked Modi over his Hindu nationalist politics and are hoping to benefit from growing economic discontent.\n\nPre-poll surveys showed that voters were increasingly worried about unemployment, the rise in food prices and an overall sentiment that only a small portion of Indians have benefitted despite brisk economic growth under Modi, making the contest appear closer than initially anticipated.\n\nThe seventh round of polls covered 57 constituencies across seven states and one union territory, completing a national election to fill all 543 seats in the powerful lower house of parliament. Nearly 970 million voters -- more than 10 percent of the world's population -- were eligible to elect a new parliament for five years. More than 8,300 candidates ran for the office.\n\nIn Kolkata, the capital of West Bengal, voters lined up outside polling stations early Saturday morning to avoid the scorching heat, with temperatures expected to reach 34 degrees Celsius (93.2 Fahrenheit). Modi was challenged there by the state's chief minister, Mamata Banerjee, who heads the regional Trinamool Congress party.\n\n\"There is a crunch for jobs now in the present market. I will vote for the government that can uplift jobs. And I hope those who cannot get jobs, they will get jobs,\" said Ankit Samaddar.\n\nIn this election, Modi's BJP -- which controls much of India's Hindi-speaking northern and central parts -- sought to expand their influence by making inroads into the country's eastern and southern states, where regional parties hold greater sway.\n\nThe BJP also banked on consolidating votes among the Hindu majority, who make up 80 percent of the population, after Modi opened a long-demanded Hindu temple on the site of a razed mosque in January. Many saw it as the unofficial start of his campaign, but analysts said the excitement over the temple may not be enough to yield votes.\n\nModi ramped up anti-Muslim rhetoric after voter turnout dipped slightly below 2019 figures in the first few rounds of the 2024 polls, in a move seen as a bid to energize his core Hindu voter base. But analysts say it also reflected the absence of a single big-ticket campaign issue, which Modi has relied on to power previous campaigns.\n\nIn 2014, Modi's status as a political outsider with plans to crack down on deep-rooted corruption won over voters disillusioned with decades of dynastic politics. And in 2019, he swept the polls on a wave of nationalism after his government launched airstrikes into rival Pakistan in response to a suicide bombing in Kashmir that killed 40 Indian soldiers.\n\nBut things are different this time, analysts say, giving Modi's political challengers a potential opportunity.\n\n\"The opposition somehow managed to derail his plan by setting the narrative to local issues, like unemployment and the economy.

Now all that's left is to wait for the results, which are expected to be announced Tuesday.\n\nThe election is considered one of the most consequential in India's history. If Modi wins, he'll be only the second Indian leader to retain power for a third term after Jawaharlal Nehru, the country's first prime minister.\n\nMost poll surveys show Modi and his Bharatiya Janata Party leading over the broad opposition alliance that's challenging them, led by the Congress party. The votes will be counted Tuesday, with results expected by the end of the day.\n\nModi's campaign began on a platform of economic progress, with vows to uplift the poor and turn India into a developed nation by 2047. But it turned increasingly shrill in recent weeks as Modi escalated polarizing rhetoric in incendiary speeches that targeted the country's Muslim minority, who make up 14% of India's 1.4 billion people.\n\nAfter campaigning ended on Thursday, Modi went to a memorial site honoring a famous Hindu saint to meditate on national television. The opposition Congress party called it a political stunt and said it violated election rules as the campaigning period has ended.\n\nWhen the election kicked off in April, Modi and his BJP were widely expected to clinch another term.\n\nSince coming to power in 2014, Modi has enjoyed immense popularity. His supporters see him as a self-made, strong leader who has improved India's standing in the world, and credit his pro-business policies with making the economy the world's fifth-largest.\n\nAt the same time, his rule has seen brazen attacks and hate speech against minorities, particularly Muslims. India's democracy, his critics say, is faltering and Modi has increasingly blurred the line between religion and state.\n\nBut as the campaign ground on, his party faced stiff resistance from the opposition alliance and its main face, Rahul Gandhi of the Congress party. They have attacked Modi over his Hindu nationalist politics and are hoping to benefit from growing economic discontent.\n\nPre-poll surveys showed that voters were increasingly worried about unemployment, the rise in food prices and an overall sentiment that only a small portion of Indians have benefitted despite brisk economic growth under Modi, making the contest appear closer than initially anticipated.\n\nThe seventh round of polls covered 57 constituencies across seven states and one union territory, completing a national election to fill all 543 seats in the powerful lower house of parliament. Nearly 970 million voters -- more than 10% of the world's population. More than 8,300 candidates ran for five-year terms in parliament.\n\nIn Kolkata, the capital of West Bengal, voters lined up outside polling stations early Saturday morning to avoid the scorching heat, with temperatures expected to reach 34 degrees Celsius (93.2 Fahrenheit). Modi was challenged there by the state's chief minister, Mamata Banerjee, who heads the regional Trinamool Congress party.\n\n\"There is a crunch for jobs now in the present market. I will vote for the government that can uplift jobs. And I hope those who cannot get jobs, they will get jobs,\" said Ankit Samaddar.\n\nIn this election, Modi's BJP -- which controls much of India's Hindi-speaking northern and central parts -- sought to expand their influence by making inroads into the country's eastern and southern states, where regional parties hold greater sway.\n\nThe BJP also banked on consolidating votes among the Hindu majority, who make up 80% of the population, after Modi opened a long-demanded Hindu temple on the site of a razed mosque in January. Many saw it as the unofficial start of his campaign, but analysts said the excitement over the temple may not be enough to yield votes.\n\nModi ramped up anti-Muslim rhetoric after voter turnout dipped slightly below 2019 figures in the first few rounds of the 2024 polls, in a move seen as a bid to energize his core Hindu voter base. But analysts say it also reflected the absence of a single big-ticket campaign issue, which Modi has relied on to power previous campaigns.\n\nIn 2014, Modi's status as a political outsider with plans to crack down on deep-rooted corruption won over voters disillusioned with decades of dynastic politics. And in 2019, he swept the polls on a wave of nationalism after his government launched airstrikes into rival Pakistan in response to a suicide bombing in Kashmir that killed 40 Indian soldiers.\n\nBut things are different this time, analysts say, giving Modi's political challengers a potential opportunity.\n\n\"The opposition somehow managed to derail his plan by setting the narrative to local issues, like unemployment and the economy. This election, people are voting keeping various issues in mind,\" said Rasheed Kidwai, a political analyst.\n\nAssociated Press video journalist Shonal Ganguly contributed from Kolkata, India.",

The election is considered one of the most consequential in India's history. If Modi wins, he'll be only the second Indian leader to retain power for a third term after Jawaharlal Nehru, the country's first prime minister. The seventh round of polls covered 57 constituencies across seven states and one union territory. It completed a national election to fill all 543 seats in the powerful lower house of parliament. Nearly 970 million voters - more than 10% of the world's population - were eligible to elect a new parliament for five years. More than 8,300 candidates ran for the office. Most poll surveys show Modi and his Bharatiya Janata Party leading over the broad opposition alliance that's challenging them, led by the Congress party. The votes will be counted Tuesday, with results expected by the end of the day. Modi's campaign, vying for a third-straight term, began on a platform of economic progress. He has promised to uplift the poor and turn India into a developed nation by 2047. But the campaign has turned increasingly shrill in recent weeks as he escalated polarizing rhetoric in back-to-back incendiary speeches that targeted the country's Muslim minority, who make up 14% of India's 1.4 billion people. After campaigning ended on Thursday, Modi went to a memorial site honoring a famous Hindu saint to meditate on national television. The opposition Congress party called it a political stunt and said it violates election rules as the campaigning period has ended. When the election kicked off in April, Modi and his BJP were widely expected to clinch another term. Since first coming to power in 2014, Modi has enjoyed immense popularity. His supporters see him as a self-made, strong leader who has improved India's standing in the world, and credit his pro-business policies with making the economy the world's fifth-largest. At the same time, his rule has seen brazen attacks and hate speech against minorities, particularly Muslims. India's democracy, his critics say, is faltering and Modi has increasingly blurred the line between religion and state. But as the campaign ground on, his party has faced stiff resistance from the opposition alliance and its main face, Rahul Gandhi of the Congress party. They have attacked Modi over his Hindu nationalist politics and are hoping to benefit from growing economic discontent. Pre-poll surveys showed that voters were increasingly worried about unemployment, the rise in food prices and an overall sentiment that only a small portion of Indians have benefitted despite brisk economic growth under Modi, making the contest appear closer than initially anticipated. In Kolkata, the capital of West Bengal, voters lined up outside polling stations early Saturday morning to avoid the scorching heat, with temperatures expected to reach 34 degrees Celsius (93.2 Fahrenheit). Modi is challenged there by the state's chief minister, Mamata Banerjee, who heads the regional Trinamool Congress party. \"There is a crunch for jobs now in the present market. I will vote for the government that can uplift jobs. And I hope those who cannot get jobs, they will get jobs,\" said Ankit Samaddar. In this election, Modi's BJP - which controls much of India's Hindi-speaking northern and central parts - sought to expand their influence by making inroads into the country's eastern and southern states, where regional parties hold greater sway. The BJP also banked on consolidating votes among the Hindu majority, who make up 80% of the population, after Modi opened a long-demanded Hindu temple on the site of a razed mosque in January. Many saw it as the unofficial start of his campaign, but analysts said the excitement over the temple may not be enough to yield votes. Instead, Modi ramped up anti-Muslim rhetoric after voter turnout dipped slightly below 2019 figures in the first few rounds of the 2024 polls. This was seen as a tactic to energize his core Hindu voter base. But analysts say it also reflected the lack of any big-ticket national issue to help Modi propel his BJP to electoral victory, as he has done previously. In 2014, Modi's status as a political outsider cracking down on deep-rooted corruption won over voters disillusioned with decades of dynastic politics. And in 2019, he swept the polls on a wave of nationalism after his government launched airstrikes into rival Pakistan in response to a suicide bombing in Kashmir that killed 40 Indian soldiers. But things are different this time, analysts say, giving Modi's political challengers a potential boost. \"The opposition somehow managed to derail his plan by setting the narrative to local issues, like unemployment and the economy. This election, people are voting keeping various issues in mind,\"\u009d said Rasheed Kidwai, a political analyst. ___ Associated Press video journalist Shonal Ganguly contributed from Kolkata,

More than 8,300 candidates ran for five-year terms in parliament.\n\nIn Kolkata, the capital of West Bengal, voters lined up outside polling stations early on Saturday morning to avoid the scorching heat, with temperatures expected to reach 34C. Mr Modi was challenged there by the state's chief minister, Mamata Banerjee, who heads the regional Trinamool Congress party.\n\nIn this election, Mr Modi's BJP - which controls much of India's Hindi-speaking northern and central parts - sought to expand their influence by making inroads into the country's eastern and southern states, where regional parties hold greater sway.\n\nThe BJP also banked on consolidating votes among the Hindu majority, who make up 80% of the population, after Mr Modi opened a long-demanded Hindu temple on the site of a razed mosque in January. Many saw it as the unofficial start of his campaign, but analysts said the excitement over the temple may not be enough to yield votes.\n\nMr Modi ramped up anti-Muslim rhetoric after voter turnout dipped slightly below 2019 figures in the first few rounds of the 2024 polls, in a move seen as a bid to energise his core Hindu voter base. But analysts say it also reflected the absence of a single big-ticket campaign issue, which Mr Modi has relied on to power previous campaigns.\n\nIn 2014, Mr Modi's status as a political outsider with plans to crack down on deep-rooted corruption won over voters disillusioned with decades of dynastic politics. And in 2019, he swept the polls after his government launched air strikes into rival Pakistan in response to a suicide bombing in Kashmir that killed 40 Indian soldiers.\n\nBut things are different this time, analysts say, giving Mr Modi's political challengers a potential opportunity.\n\n\"The opposition somehow managed to derail his plan by setting the narrative to local issues, like unemployment and the economy.

If Modi wins, he\u00b4ll be only the second Indian leader to retain power for a third term after Jawaharlal Nehru, the country\u00b4s first prime minister.\n\nThe seventh round of voting in 57 constituencies across seven states and one union territory will complete polling for all 543 seats in the powerful lower house of parliament. Nearly 970 million voters - more than 10% of the world\u00b4s population - were eligible to elect a new parliament for five years.

The votes will be counted Tuesday, with results expected by the end of the day.\n\nModi\u00b4s campaign, vying for a third-straight term, began on a platform of economic progress. He promised to uplift the poor and turn India into a developed nation by 2047. But it has turned increasingly shrill in recent weeks as he escalated polarizing rhetoric in back-to-back incendiary speeches that targeted the country\u00b4s Muslim minority, who make up 14% of India\u00b4s 1.4 billion people.\n\nOn Thursday, after finishing his election campaign, Modi went to meditate at a memorial site honoring a famous Hindu saint who is believed to have attained enlightenment there.\n\nVoters wait to cast their votes at a polling station during the last round of a six week-long national election near Dharamshala, India, Saturday, June 1, 2024.

(AP Photo/Ashwini Bhatia)\n\nWhen the election kicked off in April, Modi and his BJP were widely expected to clinch another term.\n\nSince first coming to power in 2014, Modi has enjoyed immense popularity. His supporters see him as a self-made, strong leader who has improved India\u00b4s standing in the world, and credit his pro-business policies with making the economy the world\u00b4s fifth-largest.\n\nAt the same time, his rule has seen brazen attacks and hate speech against minorities, particularly Muslims. India\u00b4s democracy, his critics say, is faltering and Modi has increasingly blurred the line between religion and state.\n\nBut as the campaign ground on, his party has faced stiff resistance from the opposition alliance and its main face, Rahul Gandhi of the Congress party. They have attacked Modi over his Hindu nationalist politics and are hoping to benefit from growing economic discontent.\n\nPre-poll surveys showed that voters were increasingly worried about unemployment, the rise in food prices and an overall sentiment that only a small portion of Indians have benefitted despite brisk economic growth under Modi, making the contest appear closer than initially anticipated.\n\nIn this election, Modi\u00b4s BJP - which controls much of India\u00b4s Hindi-speaking northern and central parts - sought to expand their influence by making inroads into the country\u00b4s eastern and southern states, where regional parties hold greater sway.\n\nThe BJP also banked on consolidating votes among the Hindu majority, who make up 80% of the population, after Modi opened a long-demanded Hindu temple on the site of a razed mosque in January. Many saw it as the unofficial start of his campaign, but analysts said the excitement over the temple may not be enough to yield votes.\n\nInstead, Modi ramped up anti-Muslim rhetoric after voter turnout dipped slightly below 2019 figures in the first few rounds of the 2024 polls.\n\nThis was seen as a tactic to energize his core Hindu voter base. But analysts say it also reflected the lack of any big-ticket national issue to help Modi propel his BJP to electoral victory, as he has done previously.\n\nIn 2014, Modi\u00b4s status as a political outsider cracking down on deep-rooted corruption won over voters disillusioned with decades of dynastic politics. And in 2019, he swept the polls on a wave of nationalism after his government launched airstrikes into rival Pakistan in response to a suicide bombing in Kashmir that killed 40 Indian soldiers.\n\nBut things are different this time, analysts say, giving Modi\u00b4s political challengers a potential boost.\n\n\"The opposition somehow managed to derail his plan by setting the narrative to local issues, like unemployment and the economy. This election, people are voting keeping various issues in mind,\" said Rasheed Kidwai, a political analyst.\n\nPolling officials check and seal an electronic voting machine before they allow voters to cast their votes at a polling station during the last round of a six week-long national election near Dharamshala, India, Saturday, June 1, 2024.

The chief election commissioner Rajiv Kumar said officials had learned a valuable lesson. \"We should have completed the election at least one month before,\" he said. \"We shouldn't have let it continue into so much heat.\"\n\nOn Tuesday, BJP workers outside the party's office in New Delhi performed a Hindu ritual shortly after the counting began. Meanwhile, supporters at the Congress party headquarters appeared upbeat and chanted slogans praising Gandhi, the party's campaign face.\n\nIn his 10 years in power, Modi has transformed India's political landscape. His popularity has outstripped that of his party's, and has turned a parliamentary election into one that increasingly resembles a presidential-style campaign. The result is that the BJP relies more and more on Modi's enduring brand to stay in power, with local politicians receding into the background even in state elections.\n\n\"Modi was not just the prime campaigner, but the sole campaigner of this election,\" said Yamini Aiyar, a public policy scholar.\n\nHis supporters see him as a self-made, strong leader who has improved India's standing in the world, and credit his pro-business policies with making the economy the world's fifth-largest.\n\nBut a decade of his leadership has also left the country deeply divided. Modi's critics and opponents say his Hindu-first politics have bred intolerance, hate speech and brazen attacks against the country's minorities, especially Muslims, who comprise 14% of the population.\n\nRead more'Ugly speech' but not a surprise: Modi accused of anti-Muslim rhetoric on campaign trail\n\nIndia's economy, one of the fastest-growing, has become more unequal under Modi. While stock markets reach record-highs and millionaires multiply, youth unemployment has soared, with only a small portion of Indians benefitting from the economic boom.\n\nThe country's democracy, Modi's critics say, is faltering under his government, which has increasingly wielded strong-arm tactics to subdue political opponents, squeeze independent media and quash dissent. The government has rejected such accusations and say democracy is flourishing.\n\nAs polls opened in mid-April, a confident BJP initially focused its campaign on \"Modi's guarantees,\" highlighting the economic and welfare achievements that his party says have reduced poverty. With him at the helm, \"India will become a developed nation by 2047,\" Modi repeated in rally after rally.\n\nBut the campaign turned increasingly shrill, as Modi ramped up polarising rhetoric that targeted the Muslim minority, a tactic seen to energise his core Hindu majority voters.\n\nHis opposition, the INDIA alliance led by the Congress party, has attacked Modi over his Hindu nationalist politics. It hopes to benefit from the simmering economic discontent, and its campaign has rallied around issues of joblessness, inflation and inequality.\n\nBut the broad alliance of over a dozen political parties has been beset by ideological differences and defections, raising questions over their effectiveness. Meanwhile, the alliance has also claimed they've been unfairly targeted, pointing to a spree of raids, arrests and corruption investigations against their leaders by federal agencies they say are politically motivated. The government has denied this.\n\nAnother victory would cement Modi as one of the country's most popular and important leaders. It would follow a thumping win in 2019, when the BJP won 303 out of 543 parliamentary seats.", "source": {"uri": "france24.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "France 24"}, "authors": [], "concepts":

India was counting more than 640 million votes cast over the past six weeks in the world's largest democratic exercise, which was widely expected to give Prime Minister Narendra Modi a third five-year term when the final result is declared later Tuesday.\n\nNEW DELHI (AP) -- Prime Minister Narendra Modi's coalition led in a majority of seats Tuesday in India's general election, according to early figures, but faced a stronger challenge from the opposition than expected after it pushed back against the leader's mixed economic record and polarizing politics.\n\nThe counting of more than 640 million votes cast over six weeks in the world's largest democratic exercise was set to take all day. Modi was still widely expected to be elected to a third five-year term -- even as the race tightened and the early count showed his Hindu nationalist party might not secure a majority on its own.\n\nIf Modi wins, it would cement the 73-year-old as one of the country's most popular and important leaders. It would only be the second time an Indian leader has retained power for a third term after Jawaharlal Nehru, the country's first prime minister.\n\nIn his 10 years in power, Modi has transformed India's political landscape, bringing Hindu nationalism, once a fringe ideology in India, into the mainstream while leaving the country deeply divided.\n\nHis supporters see him as a self-made, strong leader who has improved India's standing in the world. His critics and opponents say his Hindu-first politics have bred intolerance and while the economy, the world's fifth-largest and one of the fastest-growing, has become more unequal.\n\nSome seven hours into counting, early leads reported by India's Election Commission showed Modi's Bharatiya Janata Party was ahead in 236 constituencies and had won two, including one uncontested, of 543 parliamentary seats. The main opposition Congress party led in 99 constituencies.\n\nA total of 272 seats are needed for a majority. In 2019, the BJP won 303 seats.\n\nModi's party is part of the National Democratic Alliance, whose parties led in 287 constituencies, according to the early count, including the two won by BJP. The Congress party is part of the INDIA alliance, which led in 230 constituencies.\n\nThe Election Commission does not release data on the percentage of votes tallied, and early figures were expected to change.\n\nThe \"Congress party and other opposition parties have showed tremendous resilience. To have a stronger opposition augers very well for India's democracy that has taken a hit during Modi's 10-year rule,\" said political analyst Rasheed Kidwai.\n\nExit polling from the weekend had projected the NDA to win more than 350 seats. Indian markets, which had hit an all-time high on Monday, were down sharply in midday trading Tuesday, with benchmark stock indices -- the NIFTY 50 and the BSE Sensex -- both down by more than 7%.\n\nExtreme heat struck India as voters went to the polls, with temperatures higher than 45 degrees Celsius (113 Fahrenheit) in some parts of the country. Temperatures were somewhat lower on Tuesday for the counting, but election officials and political parties still took precautions, hauling in large quantities of water and installing outdoor air coolers for people waiting for results outside the buildings where votes were being tallied and party headquarters.\n\nBJP workers outside the party's office in New Delhi performed a Hindu ritual shortly after the counting began. Meanwhile, supporters at the Congress party headquarters appeared upbeat and chanted slogans praising Gandhi, the party's campaign face.\n\nOver 10 years in power, Modi's popularity has outstripped that of his party's, and has turned a parliamentary election into one that increasingly resembles a presidential-style campaign.

All that remains is to wait for the results, which should be announced on Tuesday.\n\nThis election is considered one of the most important in Indian history. If Modi wins, he will be only the second Indian leader to retain power for a third term after Jawaharlal Nehru, the country's first prime minister.\n\nMost polls show Modi and his Bharatiya Janata Party leading the broad opposition alliance challenging them, led by the Congress party. Votes will be counted on Tuesday, with results expected by the end of the day.\n\nModis' campaign began on the basis of an agenda of economic progress, with a vow to uplift the poor and make India a countrydeveloped country by 2047. But this has become increasingly acute in recent weeks as Modiincreased polarizing rhetoricin inflammatory speeches targeting the country's Muslim minority, which makes up 14% of India's 1.4 billion people.\n\nAfter the campaign ended Thursday, Modi visited a memorial site honoring a famous Hindu saint to meditate on national television. The opposition Congress party called it a political stunt and said it had violated election rules even though the campaign period was over.\n\nWhen elections began in April, Modi and his BJP were widely expected to win another term.\n\nSince coming to power in 2014, Modi has enjoyed immense popularity. His supporters see him as a strong, self-made leader who improved India's standing in the world and credit his business-friendly policies with making the economy the world's fifth-largest.\n\nAt the same time, his reign was marked by brazen attacks and hate speech against minorities, particularly Muslims.Indian democracysay his detractors, is faltering and Modi has increasinglyblurred the line between religion and state.\n\nBut as the campaign progressed, his party faced stiff resistance from the opposition alliance and its main face, Rahul Gandhi of the Congress party. They attacked Modi because of his Hindu nationalist policies and hope to benefit fromgrowing economic discontent.\n\nPre-poll surveys showed voters were increasingly worried about unemployment, rising food prices and a general feeling that only a small portion of Indians have benefited despite strong economic growth under Modi, which which makes the vote tighter than initially expected.\n\nThe seventh round of voting covered 57 constituencies across seven states and one Union Territory, capping a nationwide election to fill the 543 seats in the powerful lower house of Parliament. Nearly 970 million voters, or more than 10% of the world population. More than 8,300 candidates ran for a five-year term in Parliament.\n\nIn Calcutta, the capital of West Bengal, voters queued outside polling stations early Saturday morning to avoidthe scorching heat, with temperatures expected to reach 93.2 degrees Fahrenheit. Modi was challenged there by state Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee, who leads the regional Trinamool Congress party.\n\nThere is currently a shortage of jobs in the current market. I will vote for the government that can create jobs. And I hope those who cannot find a job will find it, said Ankit Samaddar.\n\nIn this election, Modis BJP, which controls much of India's northern and central Hindi-speaking regions. sought to extend their influencemaking inroads into the eastern and southern states of the country, where regional parties have greater influence.\n\nThe BJP is also banking on the consolidation of votes within the Hindu majority, which represents 80% of the population, afterModi opened a much-demanded Hindu templeon the site of a mosque razed in January. Many saw it as the unofficial start of his campaign, but analysts say the enthusiasm generated by the temple may not be enough to bring in votes.\n\nModi stepped up his anti-Muslim rhetoric after turnout fell slightly below 2019 figures in the first rounds of 2024 voting, in a move seen as an attempt to energize his Hindu voting base. But analysts say it also reflects the absence of a single major campaign issue, which Modi has relied on to fuel previous campaigns.\n\nIn 2014, Modi's status as a political outsider, with plans to crack down on deep-rooted corruption, won over voters disillusioned by decades of dynastic politics. And in 2019, heswept the polls on a wave of nationalismafter his government launched airstrikes on rival Pakistan in response to a suicide attack in Kashmir that killed 40 Indian soldiers.\n\nBut things are different this time, analysts say, giving a potential opportunity to Modis' political challengers.\n\nThe opposition somehow managed to derail his plan by focusing the discourse on local issues, like unemployment and the economy. In this election, people are voting keeping various issues in mind, said Rasheed Kidwai, a political analyst.", "source": {"uri": "exbulletin.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "ExBulletin"},

India began counting more than 640 million votes Tuesday in the world's largest democratic exercise, which was widely expected to return Prime Minister Narendra Modi to a third term after a decade in power.\n\nNEW DELHI (AP) -- Early leads reported Tuesday by India's Election Commission show incumbent Prime Minister Narendra Modi's Bharatiya Janata Party comfortably ahead over its closest rival.\n\nThree hours into counting, Modi's Hindu nationalist BJP was ahead in 239 constituencies out of 542 parliamentary seats, and has already won one in an uncontested race.\n\nThe main opposition Congress party was leading in 96 constituencies.\n\nThe Election Commission does not release data on the percentage of votes tallied, but counting is expected to go on through the day. A total of some 642 million votes are being counted in the world's largest democratic exercise.\n\nModi's party is part of the National Democratic Alliance, whose parties were leading in 286 constituencies according to the early count. The Congress party is part of the INDIA alliance, which was leading in 197 constituencies.\n\nA total of 272 seats are needed for a majority in parliament.\n\nTHIS IS A BREAKING NEWS UPDATE. AP's earlier story follows below.\n\nNEW DELHI (AP) -- India was counting more than 640 million votes cast over the past six weeks in the world's largest democratic exercise, which was widely expected to give Prime Minister Narendra Modi a third five-year term when the final result is declared later Tuesday.\n\nIf the 73-year-old Modi wins, it would only be the second time an Indian leader has retained power for a third term after Jawaharlal Nehru, the country's first prime minister.\n\nExit polls on Saturday by major television channels projected a comfortable win for Modi's Hindu nationalist Bharatiya Janata Party and its allies over a broad opposition alliance led by the Congress party and its main campaign leader, Rahul Gandhi. Indian media have had a mixed record in predicting past election results.\n\nSome 642 million people voted in the election, with an average 66% turnout across the seven phases, according to official data.\n\nThe tallying of votes at counting centers in each of the 543 constituencies where polls were held could stretch into the evening before a final result is declared by the Election Commission of India. But leads will start to emerge earlier, which will give an idea of where the results may be headed.\n\nExtreme heat struck India as voters went to the polls, with temperatures higher than 45 degrees Celsius (113 Fahrenheit) in some parts of the country. The chief election commissioner Rajiv Kumar said officials had learned a valuable lesson. \"We should have completed the election at least one month before,\" he said. \"We shouldn't have let it continue into so much heat.\"\n\nFeatured Local Savings\n\nOn Tuesday, BJP workers outside the party's office in New Delhi performed a Hindu ritual shortly after the counting began. Meanwhile, supporters at the Congress party headquarters appeared upbeat and chanted slogans praising Gandhi, the party's campaign face.\n\nIn his 10 years in power, Modi has transformed India's political landscape. His popularity has outstripped that of his party's, and has turned a parliamentary election into one that increasingly resembles a presidential-style campaign. The result is that the BJP relies more and more on Modi's enduring brand to stay in power, with local politicians receding into the background even in state elections.\n\n\"Modi was not just the prime campaigner, but the sole campaigner of this election,\" said Yamini Aiyar, a public policy scholar.\n\nHis supporters see him as a self-made, strong leader who has improved India's standing in the world, and they credit his pro-business policies with making the economy the world's fifth-largest.\n\nBut a decade of his leadership has also left the country deeply divided. Modi's critics and opponents say his Hindu-first politics have bred intolerance, hate speech and brazen attacks against the country's minorities, especially Muslims, who comprise 14% of the population.\n\nIndia's economy, one of the fastest-growing, has become more unequal under Modi. While stock markets reach record-highs and millionaires multiply, youth unemployment has soared, with only a small portion of Indians benefitting from the economic boom.\n\nModi's critics say democracy is faltering under his government, which has increasingly wielded strong-arm tactics to subdue political opponents, squeeze independent media and quash dissent. The government has rejected such accusations and say democracy is flourishing.\n\nAs polls opened in mid-April, a confident BJP initially focused its campaign on \"Modi's guarantees,\" highlighting the economic and welfare achievements that his party says have reduced poverty. With him at the helm, \"India will become a developed nation by 2047,\" Modi repeated in rally after rally.\n\nBut the campaign turned increasingly shrill, as Modi ramped up polarizing rhetoric that targeted the Muslim minority, a tactic seen to energize his core Hindu majority voters.\n\nHis opposition, the INDIA alliance led by the Congress party, has attacked Modi over his Hindu nationalist politics. It hopes to benefit from the simmering economic discontent, and its campaign has rallied around issues of joblessness, inflation and inequality.\n\nBut the broad alliance of over a dozen political parties has been beset by ideological differences and defections, raising questions over their effectiveness. Meanwhile, the alliance has also claimed they've been unfairly targeted, pointing to a spree of raids, arrests and corruption investigations against their leaders by federal agencies they say are politically motivated. The government has denied this.\n\nAnother victory would cement Modi as one of the country's most popular and important leaders. It would follow a thumping win in 2019, when the BJP won 303 out of 543 parliamentary seats.", "source": {"uri": "gazette.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Colorado Springs Gazette"}, "authors":

In 2019, the BJP won 303 seats.\n\nModi's party is part of the National Democratic Alliance, whose parties led in 287 constituencies, according to the early count, including the two won by BJP. The Congress party is part of the INDIA alliance, which led in 230 constituencies.\n\nThe Election Commission does not release data on the percentage of votes tallied, and early figures were expected to change.\n\nThe \"Congress party and other opposition parties have showed tremendous resilience. To have a stronger opposition augers very well for India's democracy that has taken a hit during Modi's 10-year rule,\" said political analyst Rasheed Kidwai.\n\nExit polling from the weekend had projected the NDA to win more than 350 seats. Indian markets, which had hit an all-time high on Monday, closed sharply down Tuesday, with benchmark stock indices -- the NIFTY 50 and the BSE Sensex -- both down by more than 5 per cent.\n\nExtreme heat struck India as voters went to the polls, with temperatures higher than 45 degrees Celsius (113 Fahrenheit) in some parts of the country. Temperatures were somewhat lower on Tuesday for the counting, but election officials and political parties still took precautions, hauling in large quantities of water and installing outdoor air coolers for people waiting for results outside the buildings where votes were being tallied and party headquarters.\n\nBJP workers outside the party's office in New Delhi performed a Hindu ritual shortly after the counting began. Meanwhile, supporters at the Congress party headquarters appeared upbeat and chanted slogans praising Gandhi, the party's campaign face.\n\nA worker carries a banner of Bharatiya Janta party featuring Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi to be put up outside party headquarters in New Delhi, India, Tuesday, June 4, 2024. (AP Photo/Dinesh Joshi)\n\nOver 10 years in power, Modi's popularity has outstripped that of his party's, and has turned a parliamentary election into one that increasingly resembles a presidential-style campaign. The result is that the BJP relies more and more on Modi's enduring brand to stay in power, with local politicians receding into the background even in state elections.\n\n\"Modi was not just the prime campaigner, but the sole campaigner of this election,\" said Yamini Aiyar, a public policy scholar.\n\nThe country's democracy, Modi's critics say, is faltering under his government, which has increasingly wielded strong-arm tactics to subdue political opponents, squeeze independent media and quash dissent. The government has rejected such accusations and say democracy is flourishing.\n\nAnd economic discontent has simmered under Modi. While stock markets reach record-highs and millionaires multiply, youth unemployment has soared, with only a small portion of Indians benefitting from the boom.\n\nAs polls opened in mid-April, a confident BJP initially focused its campaign on \"Modi's guarantees,\" highlighting the economic and welfare achievements that his party says have reduced poverty. With him at the helm, \"India will become a developed nation by 2047,\" Modi repeated in rally after rally.\n\nA roadside fruit juice seller watches the election results on his mobile phone in Kolkata, India, Tuesday, June 4, 2024. (AP Photo/Bikas Das)\n\nBut the campaign turned increasingly shrill, as Modi ramped up polarizing rhetoric that targeted Muslims, who make up 14 per cent of the population, a tactic seen to energize his core Hindu majority voters.\n\nThe opposition INDIA alliance has attacked Modi over his Hindu nationalist politics, and campaigned on issues of joblessness, inflation and inequality.\n\nBut the broad alliance of over a dozen political parties has been beset by ideological differences and defections, raising questions over their effectiveness. Meanwhile, the alliance has also claimed they've been unfairly targeted, pointing to a spree of raids, arrests and corruption investigations against their leaders by federal agencies they say are politically motivated. The government has denied this.\n\n___", "source": {"uri": "ctvnews.ca", "dataType": "news", "title": "CTV News"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

His critics and opponents say his Hindu-first politics have bred intolerance and while the economy, the world's fifth-largest and one of the fastest-growing, has become more unequal.\n\nSome eight hours into counting, early leads reported by India's Election Commission showed Modi's Bharatiya Janata Party was ahead in 231 constituencies and had won 13, including one uncontested, of 543 parliamentary seats.

AP's earlier story follows below.\n\nNEW DELHI (AP) -- India's marathon election enters its final phase on Tuesday with the counting of more than 640 million votes in the world's largest democratic exercise, which was widely expected to return Prime Minister Narendra Modi to a third term after a decade in power.\n\nThe 6-week-long election was seen as a referendum on Modi. If the 73-year-old wins, it will only be the second time an Indian leader has retained power for a third term after Jawaharlal Nehru, the country's first prime minister.\n\nExit polls on Saturday by major television channels projected a comfortable win for Modi's Hindu nationalist Bharatiya Janata Party and its allies over a broad opposition alliance led by the Congress party and its main campaign leader, Rahul Gandhi.\n\nIndian television channels have had a mixed record in the past in predicting election results.\n\nNearly 970 million people, more than 10% of the world's population, were eligible to vote. Turnout averaged 66% across the seven phases, according to official data.\n\nThe tallying of votes at counting centers in each of the 543 constituencies where polls were held could stretch into the evening before a final result is declared by the Election Commission of India.\n\nBut leads will emerge earlier and indicate where the results may be headed.\n\nIn his 10 years in power, Modi has transformed India's political landscape. His popularity has outstripped that of his party's, and has turned a parliamentary election into one that increasingly resembles a presidential-style campaign. The result is that the BJP relies more and more on Modi's enduring brand to stay in power, with local politicians receding into the background even in state elections.\n\n\"Modi was not just the prime campaigner, but the sole campaigner of this election,\" said Yamini Aiyar, a public policy scholar.\n\nHis supporters see him as a self-made, strong leader who has improved India's standing in the world, and credit his pro-business policies with making the economy the world's fifth-largest.\n\nBut a decade of his leadership has also left the country deeply divided. Modi's critics and opponents say his Hindu-first politics have bred intolerance, hate speech and brazen attacks against the country's minorities, especially Muslims, who comprise 14% of the population.\n\nIndia's economy, one of the fastest-growing, has become more unequal under Modi. While stock markets reach record-highs and millionaires multiply, youth unemployment has soared, with only a small portion of Indians benefitting from the economic boom.\n\nThe country's democracy, Modi's critics say, is faltering under his government, which has increasingly wielded strong-arm tactics to subdue political opponents, squeeze independent media and quash dissent. The government has rejected such accusations and say democracy is flourishing.\n\nAs polls opened in mid-April, a confident BJP initially focused its campaign on \"Modi's guarantees,\" highlighting the economic and welfare achievements that his party says have reduced poverty. With him at the helm, \"India will become a developed nation by 2047,\" Modi repeated in rally after rally.\n\nBut the campaign turned increasingly shrill, as Modi ramped up polarizing rhetoric that targeted the Muslim minority, a tactic seen to energize his core Hindu majority voters.\n\nHis opposition, the INDIA alliance led by the Congress party, has attacked Modi over his Hindu nationalist politics. It hopes to benefit from the simmering economic discontent, and its campaign has rallied around issues of joblessness, inflation and inequality.\n\nBut the broad alliance of over a dozen political parties has been beset by ideological differences and defections, raising questions over their effectiveness. Meanwhile, the alliance has also claimed they've been unfairly targeted, pointing to a spree of raids, arrests and corruption investigations against their leaders by federal agencies they say are politically motivated. The government has denied this.\n\nAnother victory would cement Modi as one of the country's most popular and important leaders. It would follow a thumping win in 2019, when the BJP won 303 out of 543 parliamentary seats.\n\nKrutika Pathi And Sheikh Saaliq, The Associated Press", "source": {"uri": "orilliamatters.com",

A total of some 642 million votes are being counted in the world's largest democratic exercise.\n\nModi's party is part of the National Democratic Alliance, whose parties were leading in 286 constituencies according to the early count. The Congress party is part of the INDIA alliance, which was leading in 197 constituencies.\n\nA total of 272 seats are needed for a majority in parliament.\n\nTHIS IS A BREAKING NEWS UPDATE. AP's earlier story follows below.\n\nNEW DELHI (AP) -- India was counting more than 640 million votes cast over the past six weeks in the world's largest democratic exercise, which was widely expected to give Prime Minister Narendra Modi a third five-year term when the final result is declared later Tuesday.\n\nIf the 73-year-old Modi wins, it would only be the second time an Indian leader has retained power for a third term after Jawaharlal Nehru, the country's first prime minister.\n\nExit polls on Saturday by major television channels projected a comfortable win for Modi's Hindu nationalist Bharatiya Janata Party and its allies over a broad opposition alliance led by the Congress party and its main campaign leader, Rahul Gandhi. Indian media have had a mixed record in predicting past election results.\n\nSome 642 million people voted in the election, with an average 66% turnout across the seven phases, according to official data.\n\nThe tallying of votes at counting centers in each of the 543 constituencies where polls were held could stretch into the evening before a final result is declared by the Election Commission of India. But leads will start to emerge earlier, which will give an idea of where the results may be headed.\n\nExtreme heat struck India as voters went to the polls, with temperatures higher than 45 degrees Celsius (113 Fahrenheit) in some parts of the country. The chief election commissioner Rajiv Kumar said officials had learned a valuable lesson. \"We should have completed the election at least one month before,\" he said. \"We shouldn't have let it continue into so much heat.\"\n\nOn Tuesday, BJP workers outside the party's office in New Delhi performed a Hindu ritual shortly after the counting began. Meanwhile, supporters at the Congress party headquarters appeared upbeat and chanted slogans praising Gandhi, the party's campaign face.\n\nIn his 10 years in power, Modi has transformed India's political landscape. His popularity has outstripped that of his party's, and has turned a parliamentary election into one that increasingly resembles a presidential-style campaign. The result is that the BJP relies more and more on Modi's enduring brand to stay in power, with local politicians receding into the background even in state elections.\n\n\"Modi was not just the prime campaigner, but the sole campaigner of this election,\" said Yamini Aiyar, a public policy scholar.\n\nHis supporters see him as a self-made, strong leader who has improved India's standing in the world, and they credit his pro-business policies with making the economy the world's fifth-largest.\n\nBut a decade of his leadership has also left the country deeply divided. Modi's critics and opponents say his Hindu-first politics have bred intolerance, hate speech and brazen attacks against the country's minorities, especially Muslims, who comprise 14% of the population.\n\nIndia's economy, one of the fastest-growing, has become more unequal under Modi. While stock markets reach record-highs and millionaires multiply, youth unemployment has soared, with only a small portion of Indians benefitting from the economic boom.\n\nModi's critics say democracy is faltering under his government, which has increasingly wielded strong-arm tactics to subdue political opponents, squeeze independent media and quash dissent. The government has rejected such accusations and say democracy is flourishing.\n\nAs polls opened in mid-April, a confident BJP initially focused its campaign on \"Modi's guarantees,\" highlighting the economic and welfare achievements that his party says have reduced poverty. With him at the helm, \"India will become a developed nation by 2047,\" Modi repeated in rally after rally.\n\nBut the campaign turned increasingly shrill, as Modi ramped up polarizing rhetoric that targeted the Muslim minority, a tactic seen to energize his core Hindu majority voters.\n\nHis opposition, the INDIA alliance led by the Congress party, has attacked Modi over his Hindu nationalist politics. It hopes to benefit from the simmering economic discontent, and its campaign has rallied around issues of joblessness, inflation and inequality.\n\nBut the broad alliance of over a dozen political parties has been beset by ideological differences and defections, raising questions over their effectiveness. Meanwhile, the alliance has also claimed they've been unfairly targeted, pointing to a spree of raids, arrests and corruption investigations against their leaders by federal agencies they say are politically motivated. The government has denied this.\n\nAnother victory would cement Modi as one of the country's most popular and important leaders. It would follow a thumping win in 2019, when the BJP won 303 out of 543 parliamentary seats.", "source": {"uri": "yakimaherald.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yakima Herald-Republic"}, "authors":

India began counting more than 640 million votes Tuesday in the world's largest democratic exercise, which was widely expected to return Prime Minister Narendra Modi to a third term after a decade in power.\n\nNEW DELHI (AP) -- Prime Minister Narendra Modi's Hindu nationalist party showed a comfortable lead Tuesday, according to early figures reported by India's Election Commission, but was facing a stronger challenge from the opposition than had been expected.\n\nThe counting of more than 640 million votes cast over the past six weeks in the world's largest democratic exercise was expected to take all day, with Modi widely expected to be elected to a third five-year term when the final result is declared.\n\nIf the 73-year-old Modi wins, it would only be the second time an Indian leader has retained power for a third term after Jawaharlal Nehru, the country's first prime minister.\n\nSome four hours into the counting, early leads reported by the Election Commission showed Modi's Bharatiya Janata Party comfortably ahead of the main opposition Congress party.\n\nThe preliminary figures showed the BJP ahead in 240 constituencies out of 542 and winning one uncontested race. Congress was leading in 94 constituencies.\n\nModi's National Democratic Alliance group was leading in 287 constituencies, while the opposition INDIA alliance, led by the Congress party and its main campaign leader, Rahul Gandhi was leading in 225.\n\nThe Election Commission does not release data on the percentage of votes tallied, but counting was to go on throughout the day and early figures were expected to change.\n\nExit polling from the weekend had projected the NDA to win more than 350 seats. Indian markets, which had hit an all-time high on Monday, were down sharply in midday trading Tuesday, with benchmark stock indices -- the NIFTY 50 and the BSE Sensex -- both down by more than 7%.\n\nSome 642 million people voted in the election, with an average 66% turnout across the seven phases, according to official data.\n\nExtreme heat struck India as voters went to the polls, with temperatures higher than 45 degrees Celsius (113 Fahrenheit) in some parts of the country. The chief election commissioner Rajiv Kumar said officials had learned a valuable lesson. \"We should have completed the election at least one month before,\" he said. \"We shouldn't have let it continue into so much heat.\"\n\nTemperatures were somewhat lower on Tuesday for the counting, but election officials and political parties still took precautions, hauling in large quantities of water and installing evaporative coolers for people outside the buildings where votes were being tallied and party headquarters.\n\nOn Tuesday, BJP workers outside the party's office in New Delhi performed a Hindu ritual shortly after the counting began. Meanwhile, supporters at the Congress party headquarters appeared upbeat and chanted slogans praising Gandhi, the party's campaign face.\n\nIn his 10 years in power, Modi has transformed India's political landscape. His popularity has outstripped that of his party's, and has turned a parliamentary election into one that increasingly resembles a presidential-style campaign. The result is that the BJP relies more and more on Modi's enduring brand to stay in power, with local politicians receding into the background even in state elections.\n\n\"Modi was not just the prime campaigner, but the sole campaigner of this election,\" said Yamini Aiyar, a public policy scholar.\n\nHis supporters see him as a self-made, strong leader who has improved India's standing in the world, and credit his pro-business policies with making the economy the world's fifth-largest.\n\nBut a decade of his leadership has also left the country deeply divided. Modi's critics and opponents say his Hindu-first politics have bred intolerance, hate speech and brazen attacks against the country's minorities, especially Muslims, who comprise 14% of the population.\n\nIndia's economy, one of the fastest-growing, has become more unequal under Modi. While stock markets reach record-highs and millionaires multiply, youth unemployment has soared, with only a small portion of Indians benefitting from the economic boom.\n\nThe country's democracy, Modi's critics say, is faltering under his government, which has increasingly wielded strong-arm tactics to subdue political opponents, squeeze independent media and quash dissent. The government has rejected such accusations and say democracy is flourishing.\n\nAs polls opened in mid-April, a confident BJP initially focused its campaign on \"Modi's guarantees,\" highlighting the economic and welfare achievements that his party says have reduced poverty. With him at the helm, \"India will become a developed nation by 2047,\" Modi repeated in rally after rally.\n\nBut the campaign turned increasingly shrill, as Modi ramped up polarizing rhetoric that targeted the Muslim minority, a tactic seen to energize his core Hindu majority voters.\n\nHis opposition, the INDIA alliance led by the Congress party, has attacked Modi over his Hindu nationalist politics. It hopes to benefit from the simmering economic discontent, and its campaign has rallied around issues of joblessness, inflation and inequality.\n\nBut the broad alliance of over a dozen political parties has been beset by ideological differences and defections, raising questions over their effectiveness. Meanwhile, the alliance has also claimed they've been unfairly targeted, pointing to a spree of raids, arrests and corruption investigations against their leaders by federal agencies they say are politically motivated. The government has denied this.\n\nAnother victory would cement Modi as one of the country's most popular and important leaders. It would follow a thumping win in 2019, when the BJP won 303 out of 543 parliamentary seats.\n\nAP reporter David Rising contributed to this story.", "source": {"uri": "register-herald.com",

Despite the setback, many of the Hindu nationalist policies he's instituted over the last 10 year remain locked in place.\n\nIn the face of surprising numbers, the opposition claimed they had also won a victory of sorts, with the main opposition Congress party saying the election had been a \"moral and political loss\" for Modi.\n\n\"This is public's victory and a win for democracy,\" Congress party President Mallikarjun Kharge told reporters.\n\nIn his 10 years in power, Modi has transformed India's political landscape, bringing Hindu nationalism, once a fringe ideology in India, into the mainstream while leaving the country deeply divided.\n\nHis supporters see him as a self-made, strong leader who has improved India's standing in the world. His critics and opponents say his Hindu-first politics have bred intolerance and while the economy, the world's fifth-largest and one of the fastest-growing, has become more unequal.\n\nThe counting of more than 640 million votes cast over six weeks was expected to last into the night.\n\nSome 12 hours into counting, partial tallies reported by India's Election Commission showed Modi's BJP was ahead in 114 constituencies and had won 126 of 543 parliamentary seats. The Congress party led in 45 constituencies and had won 54.\n\nA total of 272 seats are needed for a majority. In 2019, the BJP won 303 seats, while they secured 282 in 2014 when Modi first came to power.\n\nThe BJP-led National Democratic Alliance led in 147 constituencies and won 139, according to the partial count. The Congress party is part of the INDIA alliance, which led in 131 constituencies and had won 99.\n\nThe Election Commission does not release data on the percentage of votes tallied.\n\nExit polling from the weekend had projected the NDA to win more than 350 seats. Indian markets, which had hit an all-time high on Monday, closed sharply down Tuesday, with benchmark stock indices -- the NIFTY 50 and the BSE Sensex -- both down by more than 5%.\n\nFor Payal, a resident of the northern city of Lucknow who uses only one name, the election was about the economy and India's vast number of people living in poverty.\n\n\"People are suffering, there are no jobs, people are in such a state that their kids are compelled to make and sell tea on the roadside,\" Payal said. \"This is a big deal for us. If we don't wake up now, when will we?\"\n\nIf Modi wins, it would only be the second time an Indian leader has retained power for a third term after Jawaharlal Nehru, the country's first prime minister.\n\nBut if his BJP is forced to form a coalition, the party would likely \"be heavily dependent on the goodwill of its allies, which makes them critical players who we can expect will extract their pound of flesh, both in terms of policymaking as well as government formation,\" said Milan Vaishnav, director of the South Asia Program at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace.\n\n\"This would be truly, you know, uncharted territory, both for Indians as well as for the prime minister,\" he added.\n\nBefore Modi came to power, India had coalition governments for 30 years. His BJP has always had a majority on its own while still governing in a coalition.\n\nExtreme heat struck India as voters went to the polls. While temperatures were somewhat lower on Tuesday, election officials and political parties still hauled in large quantities of water and installed outdoor air coolers for people waiting for results.\n\nOutside BJP party headquarters in New Delhi, supporters banged drums and bells as the counting was underway. Earlier, party workers performed a Hindu ritual.\n\nMeanwhile, supporters at the Congress party headquarters appeared upbeat and chanted slogans praising Rahul Gandhi, the face of the party's campaign.\n\nSpeaking at the press conference with party president Kharge, Gandhi said he saw the figures as a message from the people.\n\n\"The poorest of this country have defended the constitution of India,\" he said.\n\nOver 10 years in power, Modi's popularity has outstripped that of his party's, and turned a parliamentary election into one that increasingly resembled a presidential-style campaign. The result is that the BJP relies more and more on Modi's enduring brand to stay in power, with local politicians receding into the background even in state elections.\n\n\"Modi was not just the prime campaigner, but the sole campaigner of this election,\" said Yamini Aiyar, a public policy scholar.\n\nThe country's democracy, Modi's critics say, is faltering under his government, which has increasingly wielded strong-arm tactics to subdue political opponents, squeeze independent media and quash dissent. The government has rejected such accusations and say democracy is flourishing.\n\nREAD MORE: What to expect in Indiana's presidential and state primaries\n\nAnd economic discontent has simmered under Modi. While stock markets reach record-highs and millionaires multiply, youth unemployment has soared, with only a small portion of Indians benefitting from the boom.\n\nAs polls opened in mid-April, a confident BJP initially focused its campaign on \"Modi's guarantees,\" highlighting the economic and welfare achievements that his party says have reduced poverty. With him at the helm, \"India will become a developed nation by 2047,\" Modi repeated in rally after rally.\n\nBut the campaign turned increasingly shrill, as Modi ramped up polarizing rhetoric that targeted Muslims, who make up 14% of the population, a tactic seen to energize his core Hindu majority voters.\n\nThe opposition INDIA alliance has attacked Modi over his Hindu nationalist politics, and campaigned on issues of joblessness, inflation and inequality.\n\nBut the broad alliance of over a dozen political parties has been beset by ideological differences and defections, raising questions over their effectiveness. Meanwhile, the alliance has also claimed they've been unfairly targeted, pointing to a spree of raids, arrests and corruption investigations against their leaders by federal agencies they say are politically motivated. The government has denied this.\n\nIn the financial capital of Mumbai, Mangesh Mahadeshwar was one of many surprised by how the election was playing out.\n\n\"Yesterday we thought that the BJP would get more than 400 seats,\" said 52-year-old who was keeping an eye on the results at the restaurant where he works. \"Today it seems like that won't happen - people haven't supported the BJP so much

In 2019, the BJP won 303 seats.\n\nModi's party is part of the National Democratic Alliance, whose parties led in 287 constituencies, according to the early count, including the two won by BJP. The Congress party is part of the INDIA alliance, which led in 230 constituencies.\n\nThe Election Commission does not release data on the percentage of votes tallied, and early figures were expected to change.\n\nThe \"Congress party and other opposition parties have showed tremendous resilience. To have a stronger opposition augers very well for India's democracy that has taken a hit during Modi's 10-year rule,\" said political analyst Rasheed Kidwai.\n\nExit polling from the weekend had projected the NDA to win more than 350 seats. Indian markets, which had hit an all-time high on Monday, were down sharply in midday trading Tuesday, with benchmark stock indices -- the NIFTY 50 and the BSE Sensex -- both down by more than 7%.\n\nExtreme heat struck India as voters went to the polls, with temperatures higher than 45 degrees Celsius (113 Fahrenheit) in some parts of the country. Temperatures were somewhat lower on Tuesday for the counting, but election officials and political parties still took precautions, hauling in large quantities of water and installing outdoor air coolers for people waiting for results outside the buildings where votes were being tallied and party headquarters.\n\nBJP workers outside the party's office in New Delhi performed a Hindu ritual shortly after the counting began. Meanwhile, supporters at the Congress party headquarters appeared upbeat and chanted slogans praising Gandhi, the party's campaign face.\n\nOver 10 years in power, Modi's popularity has outstripped that of his party's, and has turned a parliamentary election into one that increasingly resembles a presidential-style campaign. The result is that the BJP relies more and more on Modi's enduring brand to stay in power, with local politicians receding into the background even in state elections.\n\n\"Modi was not just the prime campaigner, but the sole campaigner of this election,\" said Yamini Aiyar, a public policy scholar.\n\nThe country's democracy, Modi's critics say, is faltering under his government, which has increasingly wielded strong-arm tactics to subdue political opponents, squeeze independent media and quash dissent. The government has rejected such accusations and say democracy is flourishing.\n\nAnd economic discontent has simmered under Modi. While stock markets reach record-highs and millionaires multiply, youth unemployment has soared, with only a small portion of Indians benefitting from the boom.\n\nAs polls opened in mid-April, a confident BJP initially focused its campaign on \"Modi's guarantees,\" highlighting the economic and welfare achievements that his party says have reduced poverty. With him at the helm, \"India will become a developed nation by 2047,\" Modi repeated in rally after rally.\n\nBut the campaign turned increasingly shrill, as Modi ramped up polarizing rhetoric that targeted Muslims, who make up 14% of the population, a tactic seen to energize his core Hindu majority voters.\n\nThe opposition INDIA alliance has attacked Modi over his Hindu nationalist politics, and campaigned on issues of joblessness, inflation and inequality.\n\nBut the broad alliance of over a dozen political parties has been beset by ideological differences and defections, raising questions over their effectiveness. Meanwhile, the alliance has also claimed they've been unfairly targeted, pointing to a spree of raids, arrests and corruption investigations against their leaders by federal agencies they say are politically motivated. The government has denied this.\n\n___\n\nAssociated Press writer David Rising contributed to this story.\n\nKrutika Pathi And Sheikh Saaliq, The Associated Press", "source": {"uri": "ca.finance.yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo!

Despite the setback, many of the Hindu nationalist policies he's instituted over the last 10 year remain locked in place.\n\nIn the face of surprising numbers, both sides claimed they had won some sort of victory.\n\n\"People have placed their faith in the NDA, for a third consecutive time,\" Modi wrote on social media platform X, referring to the National Democratic Alliance that his party heads. \"This is a historical feat in India's history.\"\n\nMeanwhile, the main opposition Congress party said the election had been a \"moral and political loss\" for Modi.\n\n\"This is public's victory and a win for democracy,\" Congress party President Mallikarjun Kharge told reporters.\n\nIn his 10 years in power, Modi has transformed India's political landscape, bringing Hindu nationalism, once a fringe ideology in India, into the mainstream while leaving the country deeply divided.\n\nHis supporters see him as a self-made, strong leader who has improved India's standing in the world. His critics and opponents say his Hindu-first politics have bred intolerance and while the economy, the world's fifth-largest and one of the fastest-growing, has become more unequal.\n\nThe counting of more than 640 million votes cast over six weeks was expected to last into the night.\n\nSome 12 hours into counting, partial tallies reported by India's Election Commission showed Modi's BJP was ahead in 114 constituencies and had won 126 of 543 parliamentary seats. The Congress party led in 45 constituencies and had won 54.\n\nA total of 272 seats are needed for a majority. In 2019, the BJP won 303 seats, while they secured 282 in 2014 when Modi first came to power.\n\nThe BJP-led National Democratic Alliance led in 147 constituencies and won 139, according to the partial count. The Congress party is part of the INDIA alliance, which led in 131 constituencies and had won 99.\n\nThe Election Commission does not release data on the percentage of votes tallied.\n\nExit polling from the weekend had projected the NDA to win more than 350 seats. Indian markets, which had hit an all-time high on Monday, closed sharply down Tuesday, with benchmark stock indices -- the NIFTY 50 and the BSE Sensex -- both down by more than 5%.\n\nFor Payal, a resident of the northern city of Lucknow who uses only one name, the election was about the economy and India's vast number of people living in poverty.\n\n\"People are suffering, there are no jobs, people are in such a state that their kids are compelled to make and sell tea on the roadside,\" Payal said. \"This is a big deal for us. If we don't wake up now, when will we?\"\n\nIf Modi wins, it would only be the second time an Indian leader has retained power for a third term after Jawaharlal Nehru, the country's first prime minister.\n\nBut if his BJP is forced to form a coalition, the party would likely \"be heavily dependent on the goodwill of its allies, which makes them critical players who we can expect will extract their pound of flesh, both in terms of policymaking as well as government formation,\" said Milan Vaishnav, director of the South Asia Program at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace.\n\n\"This would be truly, you know, uncharted territory, both for Indians as well as for the prime minister,\" he added.\n\nBefore Modi came to power, India had coalition governments for 30 years. His BJP has always had a majority on its own while still governing in a coalition.\n\nExtreme heat struck India as voters went to the polls. While temperatures were somewhat lower on Tuesday, election officials and political parties still hauled in large quantities of water and installed outdoor air coolers for people waiting for results.\n\nOutside BJP party headquarters in New Delhi, supporters banged drums and bells as the counting was underway. Earlier, party workers performed a Hindu ritual.\n\nMeanwhile, supporters at the Congress party headquarters appeared upbeat and chanted slogans praising Rahul Gandhi, the face of the party's campaign.\n\nSpeaking at the press conference with party president Kharge, Gandhi said he saw the figures as a message from the people.\n\n\"The poorest of this country have defended the constitution of India,\" he said.\n\nOver 10 years in power, Modi's popularity has outstripped that of his party's, and turned a parliamentary election into one that increasingly resembled a presidential-style campaign. The result is that the BJP relies more and more on Modi's enduring brand to stay in power, with local politicians receding into the background even in state elections.\n\n\"Modi was not just the prime campaigner, but the sole campaigner of this election,\" said Yamini Aiyar, a public policy scholar.\n\nThe country's democracy, Modi's critics say, is faltering under his government, which has increasingly wielded strong-arm tactics to subdue political opponents, squeeze independent media and quash dissent.

The government has denied this.\n\nIn the financial capital of Mumbai, Mangesh Mahadeshwar was one of many surprised by how the election was playing out.\n\n\"Yesterday we thought that the BJP would get more than 400 seats,\" said 52-year-old who was keeping an eye on the results at the restaurant where he works. \"Today it seems like that won't happen - people haven't supported the BJP so much

But it turned increasingly shrill in recent weeks as Mr Modi used polarising rhetoric in speeches that targeted the country's Muslim minority, who make up 14% of India's 1.4 billion people.\n\nAfter campaigning ended on Thursday, Mr Modi went to a memorial site honouring a famous Hindu saint to meditate on national television. The opposition Congress party called it a political stunt and said it violated election rules as the campaigning period has ended.\n\nWhen the election kicked off in April, Mr Modi and his BJP were widely expected to clinch another term.\n\nSince coming to power in 2014, Mr Modi has enjoyed immense popularity. His supporters see him as a self-made, strong leader who has improved India's standing in the world, and credit his pro-business policies with making the economy the world's fifth-largest.\n\nBut as the campaign ground on, his party faced stiff resistance from the opposition alliance and its main face, Rahul Gandhi of the Congress party. They have attacked Mr Modi over his politics and are hoping to benefit from growing economic discontent.\n\nPre-poll surveys showed that voters were increasingly worried about unemployment, the rise in food prices and an overall sentiment that only a small portion of Indians have benefited despite brisk economic growth under Mr Modi, making the contest appear closer than initially anticipated.\n\nThe seventh round of polls covered 57 constituencies across seven states and one union territory, completing a national election to fill all 543 seats in the powerful lower house of parliament.\n\nNearly 970 million voters - more than 10% of the world's population. More than 8,300 candidates ran for five-year terms in parliament.\n\nIn Kolkata, the capital of West Bengal, voters lined up outside polling stations early on Saturday morning to avoid the scorching heat, with temperatures expected to reach 34C. Mr Modi was challenged there by the state's chief minister, Mamata Banerjee, who heads the regional Trinamool Congress party.\n\nIn this election, Mr Modi's BJP - which controls much of India's Hindi-speaking northern and central parts - sought to expand their influence by making inroads into the country's eastern and southern states, where regional parties hold greater sway.\n\nThe BJP also banked on consolidating votes among the Hindu majority, who make up 80% of the population, after Mr Modi opened a long-demanded Hindu temple on the site of a razed mosque in January. Many saw it as the unofficial start of his campaign, but analysts said the excitement over the temple may not be enough to yield votes.\n\nIn 2014, Mr Modi's status as a political outsider with plans to crack down on deep-rooted corruption won over voters disillusioned with decades of dynastic politics. And in 2019, he swept the polls after his government launched air strikes into rival Pakistan in response to a suicide bombing in Kashmir that killed 40 Indian soldiers.\n\nBut things are different this time, analysts say, giving Mr Modi's political challengers a potential opportunity.\n\n\"The opposition somehow managed to derail his plan by setting the narrative to local issues, like unemployment and the economy. This election, people are voting keeping various issues in mind,\" said Rasheed Kidwai, a political analyst.", "source": {"uri": "guernseypress.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Guernsey Press"},

His critics and opponents say his Hindu-first politics have bred intolerance and while the economy, the world's fifth-largest and one of the fastest-growing, has become more unequal.\n\nSome eight hours into counting, early leads reported by India's Election Commission showed Modi's Bharatiya Janata Party was ahead in 231 constituencies and had won 13, including one uncontested, of 543 parliamentary seats. The main opposition Congress party led in 93 constituencies and had won four.\n\nA total of 272 seats are needed for a majority. In 2019, the BJP won 303 seats, while they secured 282 in 2014 when Modi first came to power.\n\nModi's party is part of the National Democratic Alliance, whose members led in 277 constituencies and won 15, according to the early count. The Congress party is part of the INDIA alliance, which led in 220 constituencies and had won five.\n\nThe Election Commission does not release data on the percentage of votes tallied.\n\nExit polling from the weekend had projected the NDA to win more than 350 seats. Indian markets, which had hit an all-time high on Monday, closed sharply down Tuesday, with benchmark stock indices -- the NIFTY 50 and the BSE Sensex -- both down by more than 5%.\n\nIn the financial capital of Mumbai, Mangesh Mahadeshwar was one of many surprised by how the election was playing out.\n\n\"Yesterday we thought that the BJP would get more than 400 seats,\" said 52-year-old who was keeping an eye on the results at the restaurant where he works. \"Today it seems like that won't happen - people haven't supported the BJP so much this time.\"\n\nIf Modi wins, it would only be the second time an Indian leader has retained power for a third term after Jawaharlal Nehru, the country's first prime minister.\n\nBut if his BJP is forced to form a coalition, the party would likely \"be heavily dependent on the goodwill of its allies, which makes them critical players who we can expect will extract their pound of flesh, both in terms of policymaking as well as government formation,\" said Milan Vaishnav, director of the South Asia Program at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace.\n\n\"This would be truly, you know, uncharted territory, both for Indians as well as for the prime minister,\" he added.\n\nSince coming to power in 2014, Modi's BJP has always had a majority on its own, though it has governed in a coalition.\n\nExtreme heat struck India as voters went to the polls, with temperatures higher than 45 degrees Celsius (113 Fahrenheit) in some parts of the country. Temperatures were somewhat lower on Tuesday for the counting, but election officials and political parties still hauled in large quantities of water and installed outdoor air coolers for people waiting for results.\n\nBJP workers outside the party's office in New Delhi performed a Hindu ritual shortly after the counting began. Meanwhile, supporters at the Congress party headquarters appeared upbeat and chanted slogans praising Gandhi, the party's campaign face.\n\nOver 10 years in power, Modi's popularity has outstripped that of his party's, and has turned a parliamentary election into one that increasingly resembles a presidential-style campaign. The result is that the BJP relies more and more on Modi's enduring brand to stay in power, with local politicians receding into the background even in state elections.\n\n\"Modi was not just the prime campaigner, but the sole campaigner of this election,\" said Yamini Aiyar, a public policy scholar.\n\nThe country's democracy, Modi's critics say, is faltering under his government, which has increasingly wielded strong-arm tactics to subdue political opponents, squeeze independent media and quash dissent. The government has rejected such accusations and say democracy is flourishing.\n\nAnd economic discontent has simmered under Modi. While stock markets reach record-highs and millionaires multiply, youth unemployment has soared, with only a small portion of Indians benefitting from the boom.\n\nAs polls opened in mid-April, a confident BJP initially focused its campaign on \"Modi's guarantees,\" highlighting the economic and welfare achievements that his party says have reduced poverty. With him at the helm, \"India will become a developed nation by 2047,\" Modi repeated in rally after rally.\n\nBut the campaign turned increasingly shrill, as Modi ramped up polarizing rhetoric that targeted Muslims, who make up 14% of the population, a tactic seen to energize his core Hindu majority voters.\n\nThe opposition INDIA alliance has attacked Modi over his Hindu nationalist politics, and campaigned on issues of joblessness, inflation and inequality.\n\nBut the broad alliance of over a dozen political parties has been beset by ideological differences and defections, raising questions over their effectiveness. Meanwhile, the alliance has also claimed they've been unfairly targeted, pointing to a spree of raids, arrests and corruption investigations against their leaders by federal agencies they say are politically motivated. The government has denied this.\n\nAssociated Press journalists David Rising in new Delhi and Rafiq Maqbool in Mumbai, India, contributed to this story.", "source": {"uri": "idahostatejournal.com",

If the 73-year-old wins, it will only be the second time an Indian leader has retained power for a third term after Jawaharlal Nehru, the country's first prime minister.\n\nExit polls on Saturday by major television channels projected a comfortable win for Modi's Hindu nationalist Bharatiya Janata Party and its allies over a broad opposition alliance led by the Congress party and its main campaign leader, Rahul Gandhi.\n\nIndian television channels have had a mixed record in the past in predicting election results.\n\nNearly 970 million people, more than 10% of the world's population, were eligible to vote. Turnout was around 66% on average across the seven phases, according to official data.\n\nThe tallying of votes at counting centers in each of the 543 constituencies where polls were held could stretch into the evening before a final result is declared by the Election Commission of India.\n\nBut leads will start to emerge earlier, which will give an idea of where the results may be headed.\n\nIn his 10 years in power, Modi has transformed India's political landscape.

Election officials open an electronic voting machine to count votes at a counting center in New Delhi, India, Tuesday, June 4, 2024. India on Tuesday started counting votes from its staggered, six-week election that was seen as a referendum on Prime Minister Narendra Modi's decade in power and was expected to give him a third term in office.\n\nNEW DELHI (AP) -- India was counting more than 640 million votes cast over the past six weeks in the world's largest democratic exercise, which was widely expected to give Prime Minister Narendra Modi a third five-year term when the final result is declared later Tuesday.\n\nIf the 73-year-old Modi wins, it would only be the second time an Indian leader has retained power for a third term after Jawaharlal Nehru, the country's first prime minister.\n\nSome three hours into the counting, early leads reported by the Election Commission showed Modi's Hindu nationalist Bharatiya Janata Party comfortably ahead of the main opposition Congress party.\n\nThe preliminary figures showed the BJP ahead in 239 constituencies out of 542 and winning one uncontested race. Congress was leading in 96 constituencies.\n\nThe Election Commission does not release data on the percentage of votes tallied, but counting was to go on throughout the day and early figures were expected to change.\n\nExit polls on Saturday by major television channels projected a broad win for Modi's National Democratic Alliance group over an opposition alliance led by the Congress party and its main campaign leader, Rahul Gandhi.\n\nSome 642 million people voted in the election, with an average 66% turnout across the seven phases, according to official data.\n\nExtreme heat struck India as voters went to the polls, with temperatures higher than 45 degrees Celsius (113 Fahrenheit) in some parts of the country. The chief election commissioner Rajiv Kumar said officials had learned a valuable lesson. \"We should have completed the election at least one month before,\" he said. \"We shouldn't have let it continue into so much heat.\"\n\nTemperatures were somewhat lower on Tuesday for the counting, but election officials and political parties still took precautions, hauling in large quantities of water and installing evaporative coolers for people outside the buildings where votes were being tallied and party headquarters.\n\nOn Tuesday, BJP workers outside the party's office in New Delhi performed a Hindu ritual shortly after the counting began. Meanwhile, supporters at the Congress party headquarters appeared upbeat and chanted slogans praising Gandhi, the party's campaign face.\n\nIn his 10 years in power, Modi has transformed India's political landscape. His popularity has outstripped that of his party's, and has turned a parliamentary election into one that increasingly resembles a presidential-style campaign. The result is that the BJP relies more and more on Modi's enduring brand to stay in power, with local politicians receding into the background even in state elections.\n\n\"Modi was not just the prime campaigner, but the sole campaigner of this election,\" said Yamini Aiyar, a public policy scholar.\n\nHis supporters see him as a self-made, strong leader who has improved India's standing in the world, and credit his pro-business policies with making the economy the world's fifth-largest.\n\nBut a decade of his leadership has also left the country deeply divided. Modi's critics and opponents say his Hindu-first politics have bred intolerance, hate speech and brazen attacks against the country's minorities, especially Muslims, who comprise 14% of the population.\n\nIndia's economy, one of the fastest-growing, has become more unequal under Modi. While stock markets reach record-highs and millionaires multiply, youth unemployment has soared, with only a small portion of Indians benefitting from the economic boom.\n\nThe country's democracy, Modi's critics say, is faltering under his government, which has increasingly wielded strong-arm tactics to subdue political opponents, squeeze independent media and quash dissent. The government has rejected such accusations and say democracy is flourishing.\n\nAs polls opened in mid-April, a confident BJP initially focused its campaign on \"Modi's guarantees,\" highlighting the economic and welfare achievements that his party says have reduced poverty. With him at the helm, \"India will become a developed nation by 2047,\" Modi repeated in rally after rally.\n\nBut the campaign turned increasingly shrill, as Modi ramped up polarizing rhetoric that targeted the Muslim minority, a tactic seen to energize his core Hindu majority voters.\n\nHis opposition, the INDIA alliance led by the Congress party, has attacked Modi over his Hindu nationalist politics. It hopes to benefit from the simmering economic discontent, and its campaign has rallied around issues of joblessness, inflation and inequality.\n\nBut the broad alliance of over a dozen political parties has been beset by ideological differences and defections, raising questions over their effectiveness. Meanwhile, the alliance has also claimed they've been unfairly targeted, pointing to a spree of raids, arrests and corruption investigations against their leaders by federal agencies they say are politically motivated. The government has denied this.\n\nAnother victory would cement Modi as one of the country's most popular and important leaders. It would follow a thumping win in 2019, when the BJP won 303 out of 543 parliamentary seats.\n\nAP reporter David Rising contributed to this story.", "source": {"uri": "register-herald.com",

Despite the setback, many of the Hindu nationalist policies he's instituted over the last 10 year remain locked in place.\n\nModi pledged to make good on his election promise to turn India's economy, the world's third biggest, from its current fifth place, and not shirk with pushing forward with his agenda.\n\nHe said he would advance India's defense production, boost jobs for youth, raise exports and help farmers, among other things.\n\n\"This country will see a new chapter of big decisions. This is Modi's guarantee,\" he said, speaking in the third person.\n\nIn the face of surprising numbers, the opposition claimed they had also won a victory of sorts, with the main opposition Congress party saying the election had been a \"moral and political loss\" for Modi.\n\n\"This is public's victory and a win for democracy,\" Congress party President Mallikarjun Kharge told reporters.\n\nIn his 10 years in power, Modi has transformed India's political landscape, bringing Hindu nationalism, once a fringe ideology in India, into the mainstream while leaving the country deeply divided.\n\nHis supporters see him as a self-made, strong leader who has improved India's standing in the world. His critics and opponents say his Hindu-first politics have bred intolerance and while the economy, the world's fifth-largest and one of the fastest-growing, has become more unequal.\n\nThe counting of more than 640 million votes cast over six weeks was expected to last into the night.\n\nSome 12 hours into counting, partial tallies reported by India's Election Commission showed Modi's BJP was ahead in 114 constituencies and had won 126 of 543 parliamentary seats. The Congress party led in 45 constituencies and had won 54.\n\nA total of 272 seats are needed for a majority. In 2019, the BJP won 303 seats, while they secured 282 in 2014 when Modi first came to power.\n\nThe BJP-led National Democratic Alliance led in 147 constituencies and won 139, according to the partial count. The Congress party is part of the INDIA alliance, which led in 131 constituencies and had won 99.\n\nThe Election Commission does not release data on the percentage of votes tallied.\n\nExit polling from the weekend had projected the NDA to win more than 350 seats. Indian markets, which had hit an all-time high on Monday, closed sharply down Tuesday, with benchmark stock indices -- the NIFTY 50 and the BSE Sensex -- both down by more than 5%.\n\nFor Payal, a resident of the northern city of Lucknow who uses only one name, the election was about the economy and India's vast number of people living in poverty.\n\n\"People are suffering, there are no jobs, people are in such a state that their kids are compelled to make and sell tea on the roadside,\" Payal said. \"This is a big deal for us. If we don't wake up now, when will we?\"\n\nIf Modi wins, it would only be the second time an Indian leader has retained power for a third term after Jawaharlal Nehru, the country's first prime minister.\n\nBut if his BJP is forced to form a coalition, the party would likely \"be heavily dependent on the goodwill of its allies, which makes them critical players who we can expect will extract their pound of flesh, both in terms of policymaking as well as government formation,\" said Milan Vaishnav, director of the South Asia Program at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace.\n\n\"This would be truly, you know, uncharted territory, both for Indians as well as for the prime minister,\" he added.\n\nBefore Modi came to power, India had coalition governments for 30 years. His BJP has always had a majority on its own while still governing in a coalition.\n\nExtreme heat struck India as voters went to the polls. While temperatures were somewhat lower on Tuesday, election officials and political parties still hauled in large quantities of water and installed outdoor air coolers for people waiting for results.\n\nOutside BJP party headquarters in New Delhi, supporters banged drums and bells as the counting was underway. Earlier, party workers performed a Hindu ritual.\n\nMeanwhile, supporters at the Congress party headquarters appeared upbeat and chanted slogans praising Rahul Gandhi, the face of the party's campaign.\n\nSpeaking at the press conference with party president Kharge, Gandhi said he saw the figures as a message from the people.\n\n\"The poorest of this country have defended the constitution of India,\" he said.\n\nOver 10 years in power, Modi's popularity has outstripped that of his party's, and turned a parliamentary election into one that increasingly resembled a presidential-style campaign. The result is that the BJP relies more and more on Modi's enduring brand to stay in power, with local politicians receding into the background even in state elections.\n\n\"Modi was not just the prime campaigner, but the sole campaigner of this election,\" said Yamini Aiyar, a public policy scholar.\n\nThe country's democracy, Modi's critics say, is faltering under his government, which has increasingly wielded strong-arm tactics to subdue political opponents, squeeze independent media and quash dissent. The government has rejected such accusations and say democracy is flourishing.\n\nAnd economic discontent has simmered under Modi. While stock markets reach record-highs and millionaires multiply, youth unemployment has soared, with only a small portion of Indians benefitting from the boom.\n\nAs polls opened in mid-April, a confident BJP initially focused its campaign on \"Modi's guarantees,\" highlighting the economic and welfare achievements that his party says have reduced poverty. With him at the helm, \"India will become a developed nation by 2047,\" Modi repeated in rally after rally.\n\nBut the campaign turned increasingly shrill, as Modi ramped up polarizing rhetoric that targeted Muslims, who make up 14% of the population, a tactic seen to energize his core Hindu majority voters.\n\nThe opposition INDIA alliance has attacked Modi over his Hindu nationalist politics, and campaigned on issues of joblessness, inflation and inequality.\n\nBut the broad alliance of over a dozen political parties has been beset by ideological differences and defections, raising questions over their effectiveness. Meanwhile, the alliance has also claimed they've been unfairly targeted, pointing to a spree of raids, arrests and corruption investigations against their leaders by federal agencies they say are politically motivated. The government has denied this.\n\nIn the financial capital of Mumbai, Mangesh Mahadeshwar was one of many surprised by how the election was playing out.\n\n\"Yesterday we thought that the BJP would get more than 400 seats,\" said 52-year-old who was keeping an eye on the results at the restaurant where he works. \"Today it seems like that won't happen - people haven't supported the BJP so much this time.\"", "source": {"uri": "detroitnews.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Detroit News"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Democratic_Alliance",

Congress was leading in 96 constituencies.\n\nThe Election Commission does not release data on the percentage of votes tallied, but counting was to go on throughout the day and early figures were expected to change.\n\nExit polls on Saturday by major television channels projected a broad win for Modi's National Democratic Alliance group over an opposition alliance led by the Congress party and its main campaign leader, Rahul Gandhi.\n\nSome 642 million people voted in the election, with an average 66% turnout across the seven phases, according to official data.\n\nExtreme heat struck India as voters went to the polls, with temperatures higher than 45 degrees Celsius (113 Fahrenheit) in some parts of the country. The chief election commissioner Rajiv Kumar said officials had learned a valuable lesson. \"We should have completed the election at least one month before,\" he said. \"We shouldn't have let it continue into so much heat.\"\n\nTemperatures were somewhat lower on Tuesday for the counting, but election officials and political parties still took precautions, hauling in large quantities of water and installing evaporative coolers for people outside the buildings where votes were being tallied and party headquarters.\n\nOn Tuesday, BJP workers outside the party's office in New Delhi performed a Hindu ritual shortly after the counting began.

His critics and opponents say his Hindu-first politics have bred intolerance and while the economy, the world's fifth-largest and one of the fastest-growing, has become more unequal.\n\nSome 10 hours into counting, partial tallies reported by India's Election Commission showed Modi's Bharatiya Janata Party was ahead in 196 constituencies and had won 45, including one uncontested, of 543 parliamentary seats.

If Modi wins, it would cement the 73-year-old as one of the country's most popular and important leaders. It would only be the second time an Indian leader has retained power for a third term after Jawaharlal Nehru, the country's first prime minister.\n\nWATCH | Great anticipation as India awaits final results in vote:\n\nAfter a historic six-week election, vote counting has begun in India, with many expecting a major win for Narendra Modi, giving him a third consecutive term as the country's prime minister.\n\nNearly 970 million people -- more than 10 per cent of the world's population -- were eligible to vote and turnout averaged 66 per cent, according to official data.\n\nA total of 272 seats are needed for a majority. In 2019, the BJP won 303 seats, up from 282 in 2014 when Modi first came to power.\n\nModi's BJP, part of the National Democratic Alliance (NDA), led in 196 constituencies and had won 45, according to the early count. The Congress, part of the INDIA alliance, led in 83 constituencies and had won 15.\n\nThe election commission does not release data on the percentage of votes tallied, and early figures were expected to change.\n\nThe Congress party and other opposition parties have showed tremendous resilience. To have a stronger opposition augers very well for India's democracy that has taken a hit during Modi's 10-year rule, said political analyst Rasheed Kidwai.\n\nExit polling from the weekend had projected the NDA to win more than 350 seats. Indian markets closed sharply down Tuesday, with benchmark stock indices -- the NIFTY 50 and the BSE Sensex - both down by more than five per cent.\n\nIn his 10 years in power, Modi has transformed India's political landscape, bringing Hindu nationalism, once a fringe ideology in India, into the mainstream while leaving the country deeply divided. His supporters see him as a self-made, strong leader who has improved India's standing in the world. His critics and opponents say his Hindu-first politics have bred intolerance and the economy, the world's fifth-largest and one of the fastest-growing, has become more unequal.\n\nModi's popularity has outstripped that of his party's, and has turned a parliamentary election into one that increasingly resembles a presidential-style campaign. The result is that the BJP relies more and more on Modi's enduring brand to stay in power, with local politicians receding into the background even in state elections.\n\nModi was not just the prime campaigner, but the sole campaigner of this election, said Yamini Aiyar, a public policy scholar.\n\nThe country's democracy, Modi's critics say, is faltering under his government, which has increasingly wielded strong-arm tactics to subdue political opponents, squeeze independent media and quash dissent. The government has rejected such accusations and says democracy is flourishing.\n\nEconomic discontent has simmered under Modi. While stock markets reach record-highs and millionaires multiply, youth unemployment has soared, with only a small portion of Indians benefiting from the boom.\n\nThe campaign turned increasingly shrill, as Modi ramped up polarizing rhetoric that targeted Muslims, who make up 14 per cent of the population, a tactic seen to energize his core Hindu majority voters. The opposition INDIA alliance has attacked Modi over his Hindu nationalist politics, and campaigned on issues of joblessness, inflation and inequality.\n\nExtreme heat struck India as voters went to the polls, with temperatures higher than 45 C in some parts of the country. Temperatures were somewhat lower on Tuesday for the counting, but election officials and political parties still took precautions, hauling in large quantities of water and installing outdoor air coolers for people waiting for results outside the buildings where votes were being tallied and party headquarters.", "source": {"uri": "ici.radio-canada.ca", "dataType": "news", "title": "Radio Canada"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Narendra_Modi", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Narendra Modi"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/India", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "India"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bharatiya_Janata_Party", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Bharatiya Janata Party"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prime_minister", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Prime minister"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democracy", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Democracy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Democratic_Alliance", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "National Democratic Alliance"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jawaharlal_Nehru", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Jawaharlal Nehru"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coalition_government", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Coalition government"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_election", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "General election"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electoral_district", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Electoral district"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Congress", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States Congress"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NIFTY_50", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "NIFTY 50"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hindu_nationalism", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Hindu nationalism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exit_poll", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Exit poll"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_population", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "World population"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BSE_SENSEX", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "BSE SENSEX"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ideology", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Ideology"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Political_science", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Political science"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voter_turnout", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Voter turnout"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hindus", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Hindus"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muslims", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Muslims"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Independent_politician", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Independent politician"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_policy", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Public policy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economic_inequality", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Economic inequality"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unemployment", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Unemployment"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inflation", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Inflation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stock_market", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Stock market"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics", "wgt": 18}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Campaigns_and_Elections", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Campaigns and Elections", "wgt": 27}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Democracy", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Democracy", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Humor", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Humor", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Alternative_Political_Systems", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Alternative Political Systems", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 70}], "image": "https://images.radio-canada.ca/q_auto,w_635/v1/ici-info/16x9/--6548.png", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9616128", "eventUri": "eng-9616128", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.3254901960784313, "wgt": 196, "relevance": 1}

With him at the helm, \"India will become a developed nation by 2047,\" Modi repeated in rally after rally.\n\nBut the campaign turned increasingly shrill, as Modi ramped up polarizing rhetoric that targeted Muslims, who make up 14% of the population, a tactic seen to energize his core Hindu majority voters.\n\nThe opposition INDIA alliance has attacked Modi over his Hindu nationalist politics, and campaigned on issues of joblessness, inflation and inequality.\n\nBut the broad alliance of over a dozen political parties has been beset by ideological differences and defections, raising questions over their effectiveness. Meanwhile, the alliance has also claimed they've been unfairly targeted, pointing to a spree of raids, arrests and corruption investigations against their leaders by federal agencies they say are politically motivated. The government has denied this.\n\nIn the financial capital of Mumbai, Mangesh Mahadeshwar was one of many surprised by how the election was playing out.\n\n\"Yesterday we thought that the BJP would get more than 400 seats,\" said 52-year-old who was keeping an eye on the results at the restaurant where he works. \"Today it seems like that won't happen - people haven't supported the BJP so much

Prime Minister Narendra Modi's Hindu nationalist party showed a comfortable lead Tuesday, according to early figures reported by India's Election Commission, but was facing a stronger challenge from the opposition than had been expected.\n\nNEW DELHI (AP) -- Prime Minister Narendra Modi's coalition led in a majority of seats Tuesday in India's general election, according to partial figures, but faced a stronger challenge from the opposition than expected after it pushed back against the leader's mixed economic record and polarizing politics.\n\nFor the first time since Modi's Bharatiya Janata Party swept to power in 2014, it might not secure a majority on its own, according to the ongoing vote count -- but the prime minister was still expected to be elected to a third five-year term in the world's largest democratic exercise.\n\nIf Modi has to rely on coalition support to govern, it would be a stunning blow for the 73-year-old, who had hoped for a landslide victory. Despite the setback, many of the Hindu nationalist policies he's instituted over the last 10 year remain locked in place.\n\nIn the face of surprising numbers, both sides claimed they had won some sort of victory.\n\n\"People have placed their faith in the NDA, for a third consecutive time,\" Modi wrote on social media platform X, referring to the National Democratic Alliance that his party heads. \"This is a historical feat in India's history.\"\n\nMeanwhile, the main opposition Congress party said the election had been a \"moral and political loss\" for Modi.\n\n\"This is public's victory and a win for democracy,\" Congress party President Mallikarjun Kharge told reporters.\n\nIn his 10 years in power, Modi has transformed India's political landscape, bringing Hindu nationalism, once a fringe ideology in India, into the mainstream while leaving the country deeply divided.\n\nHis supporters see him as a self-made, strong leader who has improved India's standing in the world. His critics and opponents say his Hindu-first politics have bred intolerance and while the economy, the world's fifth-largest and one of the fastest-growing, has become more unequal.\n\nThe counting of more than 640 million votes cast over six weeks was expected to last into the night.\n\nSome 12 hours into counting, partial tallies reported by India's Election Commission showed Modi's BJP was ahead in 114 constituencies and had won 126 of 543 parliamentary seats. The Congress party led in 45 constituencies and had won 54.\n\nA total of 272 seats are needed for a majority. In 2019, the BJP won 303 seats, while they secured 282 in 2014 when Modi first came to power.\n\nThe BJP-led National Democratic Alliance led in 147 constituencies and won 139, according to the partial count. The Congress party is part of the INDIA alliance, which led in 131 constituencies and had won 99.\n\nThe Election Commission does not release data on the percentage of votes tallied.\n\nExit polling from the weekend had projected the NDA to win more than 350 seats. Indian markets, which had hit an all-time high on Monday, closed sharply down Tuesday, with benchmark stock indices -- the NIFTY 50 and the BSE Sensex -- both down by more than 5%.\n\nFor Payal, a resident of the northern city of Lucknow who uses only one name, the election was about the economy and India's vast number of people living in poverty.\n\n\"People are suffering, there are no jobs, people are in such a state that their kids are compelled to make and sell tea on the roadside,\" Payal said. \"This is a big deal for us. If we don't wake up now, when will we?\"\n\nIf Modi wins, it would only be the second time an Indian leader has retained power for a third term after Jawaharlal Nehru, the country's first prime minister.\n\nBut if his BJP is forced to form a coalition, the party would likely \"be heavily dependent on the goodwill of its allies, which makes them critical players who we can expect will extract their pound of flesh, both in terms of policymaking as well as government formation,\" said Milan Vaishnav, director of the South Asia Program at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace.\n\nFeatured Local Savings\n\n\"This would be truly, you know, uncharted territory, both for Indians as well as for the prime minister,\" he added.\n\nBefore Modi came to power, India had coalition governments for 30 years. His BJP has always had a majority on its own while still governing in a coalition.\n\nExtreme heat struck India as voters went to the polls. While temperatures were somewhat lower on Tuesday, election officials and political parties still hauled in large quantities of water and installed outdoor air coolers for people waiting for results.\n\nOutside BJP party headquarters in New Delhi, supporters banged drums and bells as the counting was underway. Earlier, party workers performed a Hindu ritual.\n\nMeanwhile, supporters at the Congress party headquarters appeared upbeat and chanted slogans praising Rahul Gandhi, the face of the party's campaign.\n\nSpeaking at the press conference with party president Kharge, Gandhi said he saw the figures as a message from the people.\n\n\"The poorest of this country have defended the constitution of India,\" he said.\n\nOver 10 years in power, Modi's popularity has outstripped that of his party's, and turned a parliamentary election into one that increasingly resembled a presidential-style campaign. The result is that the BJP relies more and more on Modi's enduring brand to stay in power, with local politicians receding into the background even in state elections.\n\n\"Modi was not just the prime campaigner, but the sole campaigner of this election,\" said Yamini Aiyar, a public policy scholar.\n\nThe country's democracy, Modi's critics say, is faltering under his government, which has increasingly wielded strong-arm tactics to subdue political opponents, squeeze independent media and quash dissent. The government has rejected such accusations and say democracy is flourishing.\n\nAnd economic discontent has simmered under Modi. While stock markets reach record-highs and millionaires multiply, youth unemployment has soared, with only a small portion of Indians benefitting from the boom.\n\nAs polls opened in mid-April, a confident BJP initially focused its campaign on \"Modi's guarantees,\" highlighting the economic and welfare achievements that his party says have reduced poverty. With him at the helm, \"India will become a developed nation by 2047,\" Modi repeated in rally after rally.\n\nBut the campaign turned increasingly shrill, as Modi ramped up polarizing rhetoric that targeted Muslims, who make up 14% of the population, a tactic seen to energize his core Hindu majority voters.\n\nThe opposition INDIA alliance has attacked Modi over his Hindu nationalist politics, and campaigned on issues of joblessness, inflation and inequality.\n\nBut the broad alliance of over a dozen political parties has been beset by ideological differences and defections, raising questions over their effectiveness. Meanwhile, the alliance has also claimed they've been unfairly targeted, pointing to a spree of raids, arrests and corruption investigations against their leaders by federal agencies they say are politically motivated. The government has denied this.\n\nIn the financial capital of Mumbai, Mangesh Mahadeshwar was one of many surprised by how the election was playing out.\n\n\"Yesterday we thought that the BJP would get more than 400 seats,\" said 52-year-old who was keeping an eye on the results at the restaurant where he works. \"Today it seems like that won't happen - people haven't supported the BJP so much this time.\"\n\nAssociated Press journalists David Rising in New Delhi and Rafiq Maqbool in Mumbai, India, contributed to this story.", "source": {"uri": "gazette.com", "dataType": "news", "title":

But also, for the first time since his Hindu nationalist Bharatiya Janata Party swept to power in 2014, it did not secure a majority on its own, meaning he will need the support of other parties in his coalition -- a stunning blow for the 73-year-old, who had hoped for a landslide victory.\n\nThe party may now be \"heavily dependent on the goodwill of its allies, which makes them critical players who we can expect will extract their pound of flesh, both in terms of policymaking as well as government formation,\" said Milan Vaishnav, director of the South Asia Program at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace.\n\nMore than 640 million votes were cast in the marathon election held over a span of six weeks in the world's largest democratic exercise.\n\nIn the face of the surprising drop in the BJP's support, the opposition claimed they had also won a victory of sorts, with the main opposition Congress party saying the election had been a \"moral and political loss\" for Modi.\n\n\"This is public's victory and a win for democracy,\" Congress party President Mallikarjun Kharge told reporters.\n\nDespite the setback, Modi pledged to make good on his election promise to turn India's economy, the world's third biggest, from its current fifth place, and not shirk with pushing forward with his agenda.\n\nHe said he would advance India's defense production, boost jobs for youth, raise exports and help farmers, among other things.\n\n\"This country will see a new chapter of big decisions. This is Modi's guarantee,\" he said, speaking in the third person.\n\nMany of the Hindu nationalist policies he's instituted over the last 10 years will also remain locked in place.\n\nBefore Modi came to power, India had coalition governments for 30 years.\n\nAfter winning a record 303 seats in 2019, the BJP appeared unlikely to win more than 240, far short of the 272 needed to form a majority government on its own, with 224 seats won and the lead in 16 constituencies and counting ongoing.\n\nModi's NDA coalition, meantime, was on track to win a combined 286-seat majority, with 263 seats won and leads in 23 races.\n\nThe opposition INDIA coalition appeared as if it would win 230 seats.\n\nFinal figures were not expected until Wednesday, with counting going late into the night. But congratulations for Modi from leaders of regional countries including neighboring Nepal and Bhutan flowed in, while the White House commended India for its \"vibrant democratic process.\"\n\nIn his 10 years in power, Modi has transformed India's political landscape, bringing Hindu nationalism, once a fringe ideology in India, into the mainstream while leaving the country deeply divided.\n\nHis supporters see him as a self-made, strong leader who has improved India's standing in the world.

If the 73-year-old wins, it will only be the second time an Indian leader has retained power for a third term after Jawaharlal Nehru, the country's first prime minister.\n\nExit polls on Saturday by major television channels projected a comfortable win for Modi's Hindu nationalist Bharatiya Janata Party and its allies over a broad opposition alliance led by the Congress party and its main campaign leader, Rahul Gandhi.\n\nIndian television channels have had a mixed record in the past in predicting election results.\n\nNearly 970 million people, more than 10% of the world's population, were eligible to vote. Turnout was around 66% on average across the seven phases, according to official data.\n\nThe tallying of votes at counting centers in each of the 543 constituencies where polls were held could stretch into the evening before a final result is declared by the Election Commission of India.\n\nBut leads will start to emerge earlier, which will give an idea of where the results may be headed.\n\nIn his 10 years in power, Modi has transformed India's political landscape. His popularity has outstripped that of his party's, and has turned a parliamentary election into one that increasingly resembles a presidential-style campaign. The result is that the BJP relies more and more on Modi's enduring brand to stay in power, with local politicians receding into the background even in state elections.\n\n\"Modi was not just the prime campaigner, but the sole campaigner of this election,\" said Yamini Aiyar, a public policy scholar.\n\nHis supporters see him as a self-made, strong leader who has improved India's standing in the world, and credit his pro-business policies with making the economy the world's fifth-largest.\n\nBut a decade of his leadership has also left the country deeply divided. Modi's critics and opponents say his Hindu-first politics have bred intolerance, hate speech and brazen attacks against the country's minorities, especially Muslims, who comprise 14% of the population.\n\nIndia's economy, one of the fastest-growing, has become more unequal under Modi. While stock markets reach record-highs and millionaires multiply, youth unemployment has soared, with only a small portion of Indians benefitting from the economic boom.\n\nThe country's democracy, Modi's critics say, is faltering under his government, which has increasingly wielded strong-arm tactics to subdue political opponents, squeeze independent media and quash dissent. The government has rejected such accusations and say democracy is flourishing.\n\nAs polls opened in mid-April, a confident BJP initially focused its campaign on \"Modi's guarantees,\" highlighting the economic and welfare achievements that his party says have reduced poverty. With him at the helm, \"India will become a developed nation by 2047,\" Modi repeated in rally after rally.\n\nBut the campaign turned increasingly shrill, as Modi ramped up polarizing rhetoric that targeted the Muslim minority, a tactic seen to energize his core Hindu majority voters.\n\nHis opposition, the INDIA alliance led by the Congress party, has attacked Modi over his Hindu nationalist politics. It hopes to benefit from the simmering economic discontent, and its campaign has rallied around issues of joblessness, inflation and inequality.\n\nBut the broad alliance of over a dozen political parties has been beset by ideological differences and defections, raising questions over their effectiveness. Meanwhile, the alliance has also claimed they've been unfairly targeted, pointing to a spree of raids, arrests and corruption investigations against their leaders by federal agencies they say are politically motivated. The government has denied this.\n\nAnother victory would cement Modi as one of the country's most popular and important leaders.

BJP is part of the National Democratic Alliance, whose parties were leading in 283 constituencies according to an early count. The Congress party is part of the INDIA alliance, which was leading in 232 constituencies.\n\nA total of 272 seats are needed for a majority in parliament.\n\nNearly 970 million people -- more than 10% of the world's population -- were eligible to vote and turnout averaged 66%, according to official data. The tallying at counting centers in 543 constituencies could stretch well into the evening before final results are announced, though substantial leads are likely to emerge earlier.\n\nIndia's vote is the latest in an unusually busy stretch of elections around the world that are challenging the status quo.\n\nIf the 73-year-old Modi wins, it would only be the second time an Indian leader has retained power for a third term after Jawaharlal Nehru, the country's first prime minister.\n\nSome four hours into the counting, early leads reported by the Election Commission showed Modi's Bharatiya Janata Party comfortably ahead of the main opposition Congress party.\n\nThe Election Commission does not release data on the percentage of votes tallied, but counting was to go on throughout the day and early figures were expected to change.\n\nExit polling from the weekend had projected the NDA to win more than 350 seats.

India's marathon election enters its final phase on Tuesday with the counting of more than 640 million votes in the world\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s largest democratic exercise, which was widely expected to return Prime Minister Narendra Modi to a third term after a decade in power. (AP Photo/Rafiq Maqbool)NEW DELHI (AP) - Prime Minister Narendra Modi's Hindu nationalist party showed a comfortable lead Tuesday, according to early figures reported by India's Election Commission, but was facing a stronger challenge from the opposition than had been expected. The counting of more than 640 million votes cast over the past six weeks in the world's largest democratic exercise was expected to take all day, with Modi widely expected to be elected to a third five-year term when the final result is declared. If the 73-year-old Modi wins, it would only be the second time an Indian leader has retained power for a third term after Jawaharlal Nehru, the country's first prime minister. Some four hours into the counting, early leads reported by the Election Commission showed Modi's Bharatiya Janata Party comfortably ahead of the main opposition Congress party. The preliminary figures showed the BJP ahead in 240 constituencies out of 542 and winning one uncontested race. Congress was leading in 94 constituencies. Modi's National Democratic Alliance group was leading in 287 constituencies, while the opposition INDIA alliance, led by the Congress party and its main campaign leader, Rahul Gandhi was leading in 225. The Election Commission does not release data on the percentage of votes tallied, but counting was to go on throughout the day and early figures were expected to change. Exit polling from the weekend had projected the NDA to win more than 350 seats. Indian markets, which had hit an all-time high on Monday, were down sharply in midday trading Tuesday, with benchmark stock indices - the NIFTY 50 and the BSE Sensex - both down by more than 7%. Some 642 million people voted in the election, with an average 66% turnout across the seven phases, according to official data. Extreme heat struck India as voters went to the polls, with temperatures higher than 45 degrees Celsius (113 Fahrenheit) in some parts of the country. The chief election commissioner Rajiv Kumar said officials had learned a valuable lesson. \"We should have completed the election at least one month before,\"\u009d he said. \"We shouldn't have let it continue into so much heat.\"\u009d Temperatures were somewhat lower on Tuesday for the counting, but election officials and political parties still took precautions, hauling in large quantities of water and installing evaporative coolers for people outside the buildings where votes were being tallied and party headquarters. On Tuesday, BJP workers outside the party's office in New Delhi performed a Hindu ritual shortly after the counting began. Meanwhile, supporters at the Congress party headquarters appeared upbeat and chanted slogans praising Gandhi, the party's campaign face. In his 10 years in power, Modi has transformed India's political landscape. His popularity has outstripped that of his party's, and has turned a parliamentary election into one that increasingly resembles a presidential-style campaign. The result is that the BJP relies more and more on Modi's enduring brand to stay in power, with local politicians receding into the background even in state elections. \"Modi was not just the prime campaigner, but the sole campaigner of this election,\"\u009d said Yamini Aiyar, a public policy scholar. His supporters see him as a self-made, strong leader who has improved India's standing in the world, and credit his pro-business policies with making the economy the world's fifth-largest. But a decade of his leadership has also left the country deeply divided. Modi's critics and opponents say his Hindu-first politics have bred intolerance, hate speech and brazen attacks against the country's minorities, especially Muslims, who comprise 14% of the population. India's economy, one of the fastest-growing, has become more unequal under Modi. While stock markets reach record-highs and millionaires multiply, youth unemployment has soared, with only a small portion of Indians benefitting from the economic boom. The country's democracy, Modi's critics say, is faltering under his government, which has increasingly wielded strong-arm tactics to subdue political opponents, squeeze independent media and quash dissent. The government has rejected such accusations and say democracy is flourishing. As polls opened in mid-April, a confident BJP initially focused its campaign on \"Modi's guarantees,\"\u009d highlighting the economic and welfare achievements that his party says have reduced poverty. With him at the helm, \"India will become a developed nation by 2047,\"\u009d Modi repeated in rally after rally. But the campaign turned increasingly shrill, as Modi ramped up polarizing rhetoric that targeted the Muslim minority, a tactic seen to energize his core Hindu majority voters. His opposition, the INDIA alliance led by the Congress party, has attacked Modi over his Hindu nationalist politics. It hopes to benefit from the simmering economic discontent, and its campaign has rallied around issues of joblessness, inflation and inequality. But the broad alliance of over a dozen political parties has been beset by ideological differences and defections, raising questions over their effectiveness. Meanwhile, the alliance has also claimed they've been unfairly targeted, pointing to a spree of raids, arrests and corruption investigations against their leaders by federal agencies they say are politically motivated. The government has denied this. Another victory would cement Modi as one of the country's most popular and important leaders. It would follow a thumping win in 2019, when the BJP won 303 out of 543 parliamentary seats. ___ AP reporter David Rising contributed to this story.", "source": {"uri": "medicinehatnews.com",

The opposition bloc, known as the Indian National Developmental Inclusive Alliance, was on course to win 229 seats, the results showed.\n\nModi told a crowd at his party's headquarters that his National Democratic Alliance will form the government for the third consecutive time, saying Indian voters had \"shown immense faith\" both in his party and the coalition alliance.\n\n\"Today's victory is the victory of the world's largest democracy\" he said.\n\nStill, for the first time since Modi's Bharatiya Janata Party swept to power in 2014, it appeared unlikely it would secure a majority on its own, and the prime minister would instead need the support of the other parties in his coalition for his third five-year term in the world's largest democratic exercise.\n\nThat would be a stunning blow for the 73-year-old, who had hoped for a landslide victory. Despite the setback, many of the Hindu nationalist policies he's instituted over the last 10 year remain locked in place.\n\nIn the face of surprising numbers, the opposition claimed they had also won a victory of sorts, with the main opposition Congress party saying the election had been a \"moral and political loss\" for Modi.\n\n\"This is public's victory and a win for democracy,\" Congress party President Mallikarjun Kharge told reporters.\n\nIn his 10 years in power, Modi has transformed India's political landscape, bringing Hindu nationalism, once a fringe ideology in India, into the mainstream while leaving the country deeply divided.\n\nHis supporters see him as a self-made, strong leader who has improved India's standing in the world. His critics and opponents say his Hindu-first politics have bred intolerance and while the economy, the world's fifth-largest and one of the fastest-growing, has become more unequal.\n\nThe counting of more than 640 million votes cast over six weeks was expected to last into the night.\n\nSome 12 hours into counting, partial tallies reported by India's Election Commission showed Modi's BJP was ahead in 114 constituencies and had won 126 of 543 parliamentary seats. The Congress party led in 45 constituencies and had won 54.\n\nA total of 272 seats are needed for a majority. In 2019, the BJP won 303 seats, while they secured 282 in 2014 when Modi first came to power.\n\nThe BJP-led National Democratic Alliance led in 147 constituencies and won 139, according to the partial count. The Congress party is part of the INDIA alliance, which led in 131 constituencies and had won 99.\n\nThe Election Commission does not release data on the percentage of votes tallied.\n\nExit polling from the weekend had projected the NDA to win more than 350 seats. Indian markets, which had hit an all-time high on Monday, closed sharply down Tuesday, with benchmark stock indices - the NIFTY 50 and the BSE Sensex - both down by more than 5%.\n\nFor Payal, a resident of the northern city of Lucknow who uses only one name, the election was about the economy and India's vast number of people living in poverty.\n\n\"People are suffering, there are no jobs, people are in such a state that their kids are compelled to make and sell tea on the roadside,\" Payal said. \"This is a big deal for us. If we don't wake up now, when will we?\"\n\nIf Modi wins, it would only be the second time an Indian leader has retained power for a third term after Jawaharlal Nehru, the country's first prime minister.\n\nBut if his BJP is forced to form a coalition, the party would likely \"be heavily dependent on the goodwill of its allies, which makes them critical players who we can expect will extract their pound of flesh, both in terms of policymaking as well as government formation,\" said Milan Vaishnav, director of the South Asia Program at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace.\n\n\"This would be truly, you know, uncharted territory, both for Indians as well as for the prime minister,\" he added.\n\nBefore Modi came to power, India had coalition governments for 30 years. His BJP has always had a majority on its own while still governing in a coalition.\n\nExtreme heat struck India as voters went to the polls. While temperatures were somewhat lower on Tuesday, election officials and political parties still hauled in large quantities of water and installed outdoor air coolers for people waiting for results.\n\nOutside BJP party headquarters in New Delhi, supporters banged drums and bells as the counting was underway. Earlier, party workers performed a Hindu ritual.\n\nMeanwhile, supporters at the Congress party headquarters appeared upbeat and chanted slogans praising Rahul Gandhi, the face of the party's campaign.\n\nSpeaking at the press conference with party president Kharge, Gandhi said he saw the figures as a message from the people.\n\n\"The poorest of this country have defended the constitution of India,\" he said.\n\nOver 10 years in power, Modi's popularity has outstripped that of his party's, and turned a parliamentary election into one that increasingly resembled a presidential-style campaign.

get more than 400 seats,\" said 52-year-old who was keeping an eye on the results at the restaurant where he works. \"Today it seems like that won't happen - people haven't supported the BJP so much

(AP Photo/Rafiq Maqbool)NEW DELHI (AP) - Early leads reported Tuesday by India's Election Commission show incumbent Prime Minister Narendra Modi's Bharatiya Janata Party comfortably ahead over its closest rival. Three hours into counting, Modi's Hindu nationalist BJP was ahead in 239 constituencies out of 542 parliamentary seats, and has already won one in an uncontested race. The main opposition Congress party was leading in 96 constituencies. The Election Commission does not release data on the percentage of votes tallied, but counting is expected to go on through the day. A total of some 642 million votes are being counted in the world's largest democratic exercise. Modi's party is part of the National Democratic Alliance, whose parties were leading in 286 constituencies according to the early count. The Congress party is part of the INDIA alliance, which was leading in 197 constituencies. A total of 272 seats are needed for a majority in parliament. THIS IS A BREAKING NEWS UPDATE. AP's earlier story follows below. NEW DELHI (AP) - India was counting more than 640 million votes cast over the past six weeks in the world's largest democratic exercise, which was widely expected to give Prime Minister Narendra Modi a third five-year term when the final result is declared later Tuesday. If the 73-year-old Modi wins, it would only be the second time an Indian leader has retained power for a third term after Jawaharlal Nehru, the country's first prime minister. Exit polls on Saturday by major television channels projected a comfortable win for Modi's Hindu nationalist Bharatiya Janata Party and its allies over a broad opposition alliance led by the Congress party and its main campaign leader, Rahul Gandhi. Indian media have had a mixed record in predicting past election results. Some 642 million people voted in the election, with an average 66% turnout across the seven phases, according to official data. The tallying of votes at counting centers in each of the 543 constituencies where polls were held could stretch into the evening before a final result is declared by the Election Commission of India. But leads will start to emerge earlier, which will give an idea of where the results may be headed. Extreme heat struck India as voters went to the polls, with temperatures higher than 45 degrees Celsius (113 Fahrenheit) in some parts of the country. The chief election commissioner Rajiv Kumar said officials had learned a valuable lesson. \"We should have completed the election at least one month before,\"\u009d he said. \"We shouldn't have let it continue into so much heat.\"\u009d On Tuesday, BJP workers outside the party's office in New Delhi performed a Hindu ritual shortly after the counting began. Meanwhile, supporters at the Congress party headquarters appeared upbeat and chanted slogans praising Gandhi, the party's campaign face. In his 10 years in power, Modi has transformed India's political landscape. His popularity has outstripped that of his party's, and has turned a parliamentary election into one that increasingly resembles a presidential-style campaign. The result is that the BJP relies more and more on Modi's enduring brand to stay in power, with local politicians receding into the background even in state elections. \"Modi was not just the prime campaigner, but the sole campaigner of this election,\"\u009d said Yamini Aiyar, a public policy scholar. His supporters see him as a self-made, strong leader who has improved India's standing in the world, and they credit his pro-business policies with making the economy the world's fifth-largest. But a decade of his leadership has also left the country deeply divided. Modi's critics and opponents say his Hindu-first politics have bred intolerance, hate speech and brazen attacks against the country's minorities, especially Muslims, who comprise 14% of the population. India's economy, one of the fastest-growing, has become more unequal under Modi. While stock markets reach record-highs and millionaires multiply, youth unemployment has soared, with only a small portion of Indians benefitting from the economic boom. Modi's critics say democracy is faltering under his government, which has increasingly wielded strong-arm tactics to subdue political opponents, squeeze independent media and quash dissent. The government has rejected such accusations and say democracy is flourishing. As polls opened in mid-April, a confident BJP initially focused its campaign on \"Modi's guarantees,\"\u009d highlighting the economic and welfare achievements that his party says have reduced poverty. With him at the helm, \"India will become a developed nation by 2047,\"\u009d Modi repeated in rally after rally. But the campaign turned increasingly shrill, as Modi ramped up polarizing rhetoric that targeted the Muslim minority, a tactic seen to energize his core Hindu majority voters. His opposition, the INDIA alliance led by the Congress party, has attacked Modi over his Hindu nationalist politics. It hopes to benefit from the simmering economic discontent, and its campaign has rallied around issues of joblessness, inflation and inequality. But the broad alliance of over a dozen political parties has been beset by ideological differences and defections, raising questions over their effectiveness. Meanwhile, the alliance has also claimed they've been unfairly targeted, pointing to a spree of raids, arrests and corruption investigations against their leaders by federal agencies they say are politically motivated. The government has denied this. Another victory would cement Modi as one of the country's most popular and important leaders. It would follow a thumping win in 2019, when the BJP won 303 out of 543 parliamentary seats.", "source": {"uri": "medicinehatnews.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Medicine Hat News"}, "authors":

Despite the setback, many of the Hindu nationalist policies he's instituted over the last 10 year remain locked in place.\n\nIn the face of surprising numbers, the opposition claimed they had also won a victory of sorts, with the main opposition Congress party saying the election had been a \"moral and political loss\" for Modi.\n\n\"This is public's victory and a win for democracy,\" Congress party President Mallikarjun Kharge told reporters.\n\nIn his 10 years in power, Modi has transformed India's political landscape, bringing Hindu nationalism, once a fringe ideology in India, into the mainstream while leaving the country deeply divided.\n\nHis supporters see him as a self-made, strong leader who has improved India's standing in the world. His critics and opponents say his Hindu-first politics have bred intolerance and while the economy, the world's fifth-largest and one of the fastest-growing, has become more unequal.\n\nThe counting of more than 640 million votes cast over six weeks was expected to last into the night.\n\nSome 12 hours into counting, partial tallies reported by India's Election Commission showed Modi's BJP was ahead in 114 constituencies and had won 126 of 543 parliamentary seats.

In 2019, the BJP won 303 seats, while they secured 282 in 2014 when Modi first came to power.\n\nThe BJP-led National Democratic Alliance led in 147 constituencies and won 139, according to the partial count. The Congress party is part of the INDIA alliance, which led in 131 constituencies and had won 99.\n\nThe Election Commission does not release data on the percentage of votes tallied.\n\nExit polling from the weekend had projected the NDA to win more than 350 seats. Indian markets, which had hit an all-time high on Monday, closed sharply down Tuesday, with benchmark stock indices -- the NIFTY 50 and the BSE Sensex -- both down by more than 5%.\n\nFor Payal, a resident of the northern city of Lucknow who uses only one name, the election was about the economy and India's vast number of people living in poverty.\n\n\"People are suffering, there are no jobs, people are in such a state that their kids are compelled to make and sell tea on the roadside,\" Payal said. \"This is a big deal for us. If we don't wake up now, when will we?\"\n\nIf Modi wins, it would only be the second time an Indian leader has retained power for a third term after Jawaharlal Nehru, the country's first prime minister.\n\nBut if his BJP is forced to form a coalition, the party would likely \"be heavily dependent on the goodwill of its allies, which makes them critical players who we can expect will extract their pound of flesh, both in terms of policymaking as well as government formation,\" said Milan Vaishnav, director of the South Asia Program at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace.\n\nFeatured Local Savings\n\n\"This would be truly, you know, uncharted territory, both for Indians as well as for the prime minister,\" he added.\n\nBefore Modi came to power, India had coalition governments for 30 years. His BJP has always had a majority on its own while still governing in a coalition.\n\nExtreme heat struck India as voters went to the polls. While temperatures were somewhat lower on Tuesday, election officials and political parties still hauled in large quantities of water and installed outdoor air coolers for people waiting for results.\n\nOutside BJP party headquarters in New Delhi, supporters banged drums and bells as the counting was underway. Earlier, party workers performed a Hindu ritual.\n\nMeanwhile, supporters at the Congress party headquarters appeared upbeat and chanted slogans praising Rahul Gandhi, the face of the party's campaign.\n\nSpeaking at the press conference with party president Kharge, Gandhi said he saw the figures as a message from the people.\n\n\"The poorest of this country have defended the constitution of India,\" he said.\n\nOver 10 years in power, Modi's popularity has outstripped that of his party's, and turned a parliamentary election into one that increasingly resembled a presidential-style campaign. The result is that the BJP relies more and more on Modi's enduring brand to stay in power, with local politicians receding into the background even in state elections.\n\n\"Modi was not just the prime campaigner, but the sole campaigner of this election,\" said Yamini Aiyar, a public policy scholar.\n\nThe country's democracy, Modi's critics say, is faltering under his government, which has increasingly wielded strong-arm tactics to subdue political opponents, squeeze independent media and quash dissent. The government has rejected such accusations and say democracy is flourishing.\n\nAnd economic discontent has simmered under Modi. While stock markets reach record-highs and millionaires multiply, youth unemployment has soared, with only a small portion of Indians benefitting from the boom.\n\nAs polls opened in mid-April, a confident BJP initially focused its campaign on \"Modi's guarantees,\" highlighting the economic and welfare achievements that his party says have reduced poverty. With him at the helm, \"India will become a developed nation by 2047,\" Modi repeated in rally after rally.\n\nBut the campaign turned increasingly shrill, as Modi ramped up polarizing rhetoric that targeted Muslims, who make up 14% of the population, a tactic seen to energize his core Hindu majority voters.\n\nThe opposition INDIA alliance has attacked Modi over his Hindu nationalist politics, and campaigned on issues of joblessness, inflation and inequality.\n\nBut the broad alliance of over a dozen political parties has been beset by ideological differences and defections, raising questions over their effectiveness. Meanwhile, the alliance has also claimed they've been unfairly targeted, pointing to a spree of raids, arrests and corruption investigations against their leaders by federal agencies they say are politically motivated. The government has denied this.\n\nIn the financial capital of Mumbai, Mangesh Mahadeshwar was one of many surprised by how the election was playing out.\n\n\"Yesterday we thought that the BJP would get more than 400 seats,\" said 52-year-old who was keeping an eye on the results at the restaurant where he works. \"Today it seems like that won't happen - people haven't supported the BJP so much this time.\"\n\nAssociated Press journalists David Rising in New Delhi and Rafiq Maqbool in Mumbai, India, contributed to this story.", "source": {"uri": "gazette.com", "dataType": "news", "title":

The counting of more than 640 million votes cast over six weeks in the world's largest democratic exercise was set to take all day.

Modi's party is part of the National Democratic Alliance, whose parties led in 287 constituencies, according to the early count, including the two won by BJP. The Congress party is part of the INDIA alliance, which led in 230 constituencies. The Election Commission does not release data on the percentage of votes tallied, and early figures were expected to change. The \"Congress party and other opposition parties have showed tremendous resilience. To have a stronger opposition augers very well for India's democracy that has taken a hit during Modi's 10-year rule,\"\u009d said political analyst Rasheed Kidwai. Exit polling from the weekend had projected the NDA to win more than 350 seats. Indian markets, which had hit an all-time high on Monday, were down sharply in midday trading Tuesday, with benchmark stock indices - the NIFTY 50 and the BSE Sensex - both down by more than 7%. Extreme heat struck India as voters went to the polls, with temperatures higher than 45 degrees Celsius (113 Fahrenheit) in some parts of the country. Temperatures were somewhat lower on Tuesday for the counting, but election officials and political parties still took precautions, hauling in large quantities of water and installing outdoor air coolers for people waiting for results outside the buildings where votes were being tallied and party headquarters. BJP workers outside the party's office in New Delhi performed a Hindu ritual shortly after the counting began. Meanwhile, supporters at the Congress party headquarters appeared upbeat and chanted slogans praising Gandhi, the party's campaign face. Over 10 years in power, Modi's popularity has outstripped that of his party's, and has turned a parliamentary election into one that increasingly resembles a presidential-style campaign. The result is that the BJP relies more and more on Modi's enduring brand to stay in power, with local politicians receding into the background even in state elections. \"Modi was not just the prime campaigner, but the sole campaigner of this election,\"\u009d said Yamini Aiyar, a public policy scholar. The country's democracy, Modi's critics say, is faltering under his government, which has increasingly wielded strong-arm tactics to subdue political opponents, squeeze independent media and quash dissent. The government has rejected such accusations and say democracy is flourishing. And economic discontent has simmered under Modi. While stock markets reach record-highs and millionaires multiply, youth unemployment has soared, with only a small portion of Indians benefitting from the boom. As polls opened in mid-April, a confident BJP initially focused its campaign on \"Modi's guarantees,\"\u009d highlighting the economic and welfare achievements that his party says have reduced poverty. With him at the helm, \"India will become a developed nation by 2047,\"\u009d Modi repeated in rally after rally. But the campaign turned increasingly shrill, as Modi ramped up polarizing rhetoric that targeted Muslims, who make up 14% of the population, a tactic seen to energize his core Hindu majority voters. The opposition INDIA alliance has attacked Modi over his Hindu nationalist politics, and campaigned on issues of joblessness, inflation and inequality. But the broad alliance of over a dozen political parties has been beset by ideological differences and defections, raising questions over their effectiveness. Meanwhile, the alliance has also claimed they've been unfairly targeted, pointing to a spree of raids, arrests and corruption investigations against their leaders by federal agencies they say are politically motivated. The government has denied this. ___ Associated Press writer David Rising contributed to this story.", "source": {"uri": "medicinehatnews.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Medicine Hat News"}, "authors": [{"uri": "canadian_press@medicinehatnews.com", "name": "Canadian Press", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bharatiya_Janata_Party", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Bharatiya Janata Party"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Narendra_Modi", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Narendra Modi"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electoral_district", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Electoral district"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/India", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "India"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hindu_nationalism", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Hindu nationalism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indian_National_Congress", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Indian National Congress"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democracy", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Democracy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Democratic_Alliance", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "National Democratic Alliance"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jawaharlal_Nehru", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Jawaharlal Nehru"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coalition_government", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Coalition government"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_election", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "General election"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ideology", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Ideology"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prime_minister", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Prime minister"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rasheed_Kidwai", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Rasheed Kidwai"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NIFTY_50", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "NIFTY 50"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exit_poll", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Exit poll"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BSE_SENSEX", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "BSE SENSEX"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Political_science", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Political science"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Congress", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United States Congress"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hindus", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Hindus"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muslims", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Muslims"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Independent_politician", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Independent politician"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_policy", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Public policy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Corruption", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Corruption"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mahatma_Gandhi", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Mahatma Gandhi"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Welfare", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Welfare"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economic_inequality", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Economic inequality"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Associated_Press", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Associated Press"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unemployment", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Unemployment"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_government_of_the_United_States", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Federal government of the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inflation", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Inflation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Developed_country", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Developed country"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Delhi", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "New Delhi"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "New Delhi"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 87}], "image": "https://medicinehatnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/medicinehatnewslogo-square.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9616128", "eventUri": "eng-9616128", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1843137254901961, "wgt": 192, "relevance": 1}

Prime Minister Narendra Modi's Hindu nationalist party showed a comfortable lead Tuesday, according to early figures reported by India's Election Commission, but was facing a stronger challenge from the opposition than had been expected.\n\nNEW DELHI (AP) -- Prime Minister Narendra Modi claimed victory for his alliance on Tuesday in India's general election, despite a lackluster performance from his own party as it faced a stronger than expected challenge from the opposition, which pushed back against his mixed economic record and polarizing politics.\n\nModi told a crowd at his party's headquarters that his National Democratic Alliance will form the government for the third consecutive time, saying Indian voters had \"shown immense faith\" both in his party and the coalition alliance.\n\n\"Today's victory is the victory of the world's largest democracy\" he said.\n\nStill, for the first time since Modi's Bharatiya Janata Party swept to power in 2014, it appeared unlikely it would secure a majority on its own, and the prime minister would instead need the support of the other parties in his coalition for his third five-year term in the world's largest democratic exercise.\n\nThat would be a stunning blow for the 73-year-old, who had hoped for a landslide victory. Despite the setback, many of the Hindu nationalist policies he's instituted over the last 10 year remain locked in place.\n\nModi pledged to make good on his election promise to turn India's economy, the world's third biggest, from its current fifth place, and not shirk with pushing forward with his agenda.\n\nHe said he would advance India's defense production, boost jobs for youth, raise exports and help farmers, among other things.\n\n\"This country will see a new chapter of big decisions. This is Modi's guarantee,\" he said, speaking in the third person.\n\nIn the face of surprising numbers, the opposition claimed they had also won a victory of sorts, with the main opposition Congress party saying the election had been a \"moral and political loss\" for Modi.\n\n\"This is public's victory and a win for democracy,\" Congress party President Mallikarjun Kharge told reporters.\n\nIn his 10 years in power, Modi has transformed India's political landscape, bringing Hindu nationalism, once a fringe ideology in India, into the mainstream while leaving the country deeply divided.\n\nHis supporters see him as a self-made, strong leader who has improved India's standing in the world. His critics and opponents say his Hindu-first politics have bred intolerance and while the economy, the world's fifth-largest and one of the fastest-growing, has become more unequal.\n\nThe counting of more than 640 million votes cast over six weeks was expected to last into the night.\n\nSome 12 hours into counting, partial tallies reported by India's Election Commission showed Modi's BJP was ahead in 114 constituencies and had won 126 of 543 parliamentary seats. The Congress party led in 45 constituencies and had won 54.\n\nA total of 272 seats are needed for a majority. In 2019, the BJP won 303 seats, while they secured 282 in 2014 when Modi first came to power.\n\nThe BJP-led National Democratic Alliance led in 147 constituencies and won 139, according to the partial count. The Congress party is part of the INDIA alliance, which led in 131 constituencies and had won 99.\n\nThe Election Commission does not release data on the percentage of votes tallied.\n\nExit polling from the weekend had projected the NDA to win more than 350 seats. Indian markets, which had hit an all-time high on Monday, closed sharply down Tuesday, with benchmark stock indices -- the NIFTY 50 and the BSE Sensex -- both down by more than 5%.\n\nFor Payal, a resident of the northern city of Lucknow who uses only one name, the election was about the economy and India's vast number of people living in poverty.\n\n\"People are suffering, there are no jobs, people are in such a state that their kids are compelled to make and sell tea on the roadside,\" Payal said. \"This is a big deal for us. If we don't wake up now, when will we?\"\n\nIf Modi wins, it would only be the second time an Indian leader has retained power for a third term after Jawaharlal Nehru, the country's first prime minister.\n\nBut if his BJP is forced to form a coalition, the party would likely \"be heavily dependent on the goodwill of its allies, which makes them critical players who we can expect will extract their pound of flesh, both in terms of policymaking as well as government formation,\" said Milan Vaishnav, director of the South Asia Program at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace.\n\n\"This would be truly, you know, uncharted territory, both for Indians as well as for the prime minister,\" he added.\n\nBefore Modi came to power, India had coalition governments for 30 years. His BJP has always had a majority on its own while still governing in a coalition.\n\nExtreme heat struck India as voters went to the polls. While temperatures were somewhat lower on Tuesday, election officials and political parties still hauled in large quantities of water and installed outdoor air coolers for people waiting for results.\n\nOutside BJP party headquarters in New Delhi, supporters banged drums and bells as the counting was underway. Earlier, party workers performed a Hindu ritual.\n\nMeanwhile, supporters at the Congress party headquarters appeared upbeat and chanted slogans praising Rahul Gandhi, the face of the party's campaign.\n\nSpeaking at the press conference with party president Kharge, Gandhi said he saw the figures as a message from the people.\n\n\"The poorest of this country have defended the constitution of India,\" he said.\n\nOver 10 years in power, Modi's popularity has outstripped that of his party's, and turned a parliamentary election into one that increasingly resembled a presidential-style campaign. The result is that the BJP relies more and more on Modi's enduring brand to stay in power, with local politicians receding into the background even in state elections.\n\n\"Modi was not just the prime campaigner, but the sole campaigner of this election,\" said Yamini Aiyar, a public policy scholar.\n\nThe country's democracy, Modi's critics say, is faltering under his government, which has increasingly wielded strong-arm tactics to subdue political opponents, squeeze independent media and quash dissent. The government has rejected such accusations and say democracy is flourishing.\n\nAnd economic discontent has simmered under Modi. While stock markets reach record-highs and millionaires multiply, youth unemployment has soared, with only a small portion of Indians benefitting from the boom.\n\nAs polls opened in mid-April, a confident BJP initially focused its campaign on \"Modi's guarantees,\" highlighting the economic and welfare achievements that his party says have reduced poverty. With him at the helm, \"India will become a developed nation by 2047,\" Modi repeated in rally after rally.\n\nBut the campaign turned increasingly shrill, as Modi ramped up polarizing rhetoric that targeted Muslims, who make up 14% of the population, a tactic seen to energize his core Hindu majority voters.\n\nThe opposition INDIA alliance has attacked Modi over his Hindu nationalist politics, and campaigned on issues of joblessness, inflation and inequality.\n\nBut the broad alliance of over a dozen political parties has been beset by ideological differences and defections, raising questions over their effectiveness. Meanwhile, the alliance has also claimed they've been unfairly targeted, pointing to a spree of raids, arrests and corruption investigations against their leaders by federal agencies they say are politically motivated. The government has denied this.\n\nIn the financial capital of Mumbai, Mangesh Mahadeshwar was one of many surprised by how the election was playing out.\n\n\"Yesterday we thought that the BJP would get more than 400 seats,\" said 52-year-old who was keeping an eye on the results at the restaurant where he works. \"Today it seems like that won't happen - people haven't supported the BJP so much this time.\"\n\nAssociated Press journalists David Rising in New Delhi and Rafiq Maqbool in Mumbai, India, contributed to this story.", "source": {"uri": "eagletribune.com", "dataType": "news",

If Modi wins, it would cement the 73-year-old as one of the country's most popular and important leaders. It would only be the second time an Indian leader has retained power for a third term after Jawaharlal Nehru, the country's first prime minister.\n\nSome seven hours into counting, early leads reported by India's Election Commission showed Modi's Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) was ahead in 236 constituencies and had won two, including one uncontested, of 543 parliamentary seats.

But also, for the first time since his Hindu nationalist Bharatiya Janata Party swept to power in 2014, it did not secure a majority on its own, meaning he will need the support of other parties in his coalition -- a stunning blow for the 73-year-old, who had hoped for a landslide victory.\n\nThe party may now be \"heavily dependent on the goodwill of its allies, which makes them critical players who we can expect will extract their pound of flesh, both in terms of policymaking as well as government formation,\" said Milan Vaishnav, director of the South Asia Program at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace.\n\nMore than 640 million votes were cast in the marathon election held over a span of six weeks in the world's largest democratic exercise.\n\nIn the face of the surprising drop in the BJP's support, the opposition claimed they had also won a victory of sorts, with the main opposition Congress party saying the election had been a \"moral and political loss\" for Modi.\n\n\"This is public's victory and a win for democracy,\" Congress party President Mallikarjun Kharge told reporters.\n\nDespite the setback, Modi pledged to make good on his election promise to turn India's economy, the world's third biggest, from its current fifth place, and not shirk with pushing forward with his agenda.\n\nHe said he would advance India's defense production, boost jobs for youth, raise exports and help farmers, among other things.\n\n\"This country will see a new chapter of big decisions. This is Modi's guarantee,\" he said, speaking in the third person.\n\nMany of the Hindu nationalist policies he's instituted over the last 10 years will also remain locked in place.\n\nBefore Modi came to power, India had coalition governments for 30 years.\n\nAfter winning a record 303 seats in 2019, the BJP appeared unlikely to win more than 240, far short of the 272 needed to form a majority government on its own, with 224 seats won and the lead in 16 constituencies and counting ongoing.\n\nModi's NDA coalition, meantime, was on track to win a combined 286-seat majority, with 263 seats won and leads in 23 races.\n\nThe opposition INDIA coalition appeared as if it would win 230 seats.\n\nFinal figures were not expected until Wednesday, with counting going late into the night. But congratulations for Modi from leaders of regional countries including neighboring Nepal and Bhutan flowed in, while the White House commended India for its \"vibrant democratic process.\"\n\nIn his 10 years in power, Modi has transformed India's political landscape, bringing Hindu nationalism, once a fringe ideology in India, into the mainstream while leaving the country deeply divided.\n\nHis supporters see him as a self-made, strong leader who has improved India's standing in the world. His critics and opponents say his Hindu-first politics have bred intolerance while the economy, one of the world's fastest-growing, has become more unequal.\n\nFor Payal, a resident of the northern city of Lucknow who uses only one name, the election was about the economy and India's vast number of people living in poverty.\n\n\"People are suffering, there are no jobs, people are in such a state that their kids are compelled to make and sell tea on the roadside,\" Payal said. \"This is a big deal for us. If we don't wake up now, when will we?\"\n\nRahul Gandhi, the main face of the opposition Congress party, said he saw the election numbers as a message from the people.\n\n\"The poorest of this country have defended the constitution of India,\" he told a news conference.\n\nModi's popularity has outstripped that of his party's during his first two terms in office, and he turned the parliamentary election into one that more resembled a presidential-style campaign, with the BJP relying on the leader's brand.\n\n\"Modi was not just the prime campaigner, but the sole campaigner of this election,\" said Yamini Aiyar, a public policy scholar.\n\nUnder Modi's government, critics say India's democracy has come under increasing strain with strong-arm tactics used to subdue political opponents, squeeze independent media and quash dissent. The government has rejected such accusations and says democracy is flourishing.\n\nEconomic discontent has also simmered under Modi. While stock markets have reached record-highs, youth unemployment has soared, with only a small portion of Indians benefitting from the boom.\n\nAs polls opened in mid-April, a confident BJP initially focused its campaign on \"Modi's guarantees,\" highlighting the economic and welfare achievements that his party says have reduced poverty. With Modi at the helm, \"India will become a developed nation by 2047,\" he repeated in rally after rally.\n\nBut the campaign turned increasingly shrill, as Modi ramped up polarizing rhetoric that targeted Muslims, who make up 14% of the population, a tactic seen to energize his core Hindu majority voters.\n\nThe opposition INDIA alliance attacked Modi over his Hindu nationalist politics, and campaigned on issues of joblessness, inflation and inequality.\n\n\"These issues have resonated and made a dent,\" added Aiyar, the public policy scholar.\n\nMilestone Alert!

If Modi wins, he'll be only the second Indian leader to retain power for a third term after Jawaharlal Nehru, the country's first prime minister.\n\nThe seventh round of voting in 57 constituencies across seven states and one union territory will complete polling for all 543 seats in the powerful lower house of parliament. Nearly 970 million voters -- more than 10% of the world's population -- were eligible to elect a new parliament for five years. More than 8,300 candidates ran for the office.\n\nMost polls show Modi and his Bharatiya Janata Party leading over the broad opposition alliance that's challenging them, led by the Congress party. The votes will be counted Tuesday, with results expected by the end of the day.\n\nModi's campaign, vying for a third-straight term, began on a platform of economic progress. He promised to uplift the poor and turn India into a developed nation by 2047. But it has turned increasingly shrill in recent weeks as he escalated polarizing rhetoric in back-to-back incendiary speeches that targeted the country's Muslim minority, who make up 14% of India's 1.4 billion people.\n\nOn Thursday, after finishing his election campaign, Modi went to meditate at a memorial site honoring a famous Hindu saint who is believed to have attained enlightenment there.\n\nWhen the election kicked off in April, Modi and his BJP were widely expected to clinch another term.\n\nSince first coming to power in 2014, Modi has enjoyed immense popularity. His supporters see him as a self-made, strong leader who has improved India's standing in the world, and credit his pro-business policies with making the economy the world's fifth-largest.\n\nAt the same time, his rule has seen brazen attacks and hate speech against minorities, particularly Muslims. India's democracy, his critics say, is faltering and Modi has increasingly blurred the line between religion and state.\n\nBut as the campaign ground on, his party has faced stiff resistance from the opposition alliance and its main face, Rahul Gandhi of the Congress party. They have attacked Modi over his Hindu nationalist politics and are hoping to benefit from growing economic discontent.\n\nPre-poll surveys showed that voters were increasingly worried about unemployment, the rise in food prices and an overall sentiment that only a small portion of Indians have benefitted despite brisk economic growth under Modi, making the contest appear closer than initially anticipated.\n\nIn this election, Modi's BJP -- which controls much of India's Hindi-speaking northern and central parts -- sought to expand their influence by making inroads into the country's eastern and southern states, where regional parties hold greater sway.\n\nThe BJP also banked on consolidating votes among the Hindu majority, who make up 80% of the population, after Modi opened a long-demanded Hindu temple on the site of a razed mosque in January. Many saw it as the unofficial start of his campaign, but analysts said the excitement over the temple may not be enough to yield votes.\n\nInstead, Modi ramped up anti-Muslim rhetoric after voter turnout dipped slightly below 2019 figures in the first few rounds of the 2024 polls.\n\nThis was seen as a tactic to energize his core Hindu voter base. But analysts say it also reflected the lack of any big-ticket national issue to help Modi propel his BJP to electoral victory, as he has done previously.\n\nIn 2014, Modi's status as a political outsider cracking down on deep-rooted corruption won over voters disillusioned with decades of dynastic politics. And in 2019, he swept the polls on a wave of nationalism after his government launched airstrikes into rival Pakistan in response to a suicide bombing in Kashmir that killed 40 Indian soldiers.\n\nBut things are different this time, analysts say, giving Modi's political challengers a potential boost.\n\n\"The opposition somehow managed to derail his plan by setting the narrative to local issues, like unemployment and the economy. This election, people are voting keeping various issues in mind,\" said Rasheed Kidwai, a political analyst.", "source": {"uri": "wboc.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "WBOC TV-16"}, "authors":

Mr Modi is still expected to be elected to a third five-year term, however, in the world's largest democratic exercise.\n\nIf that trend holds, it would be a blow for the 73-year-old leader, who has never been in a position where he has needed to rely on his coalition partners to govern.\n\nThe counting of more than 640 million votes cast over six weeks is set to take all day, and early figures could change.\n\nIn his 10 years in power, Mr Modi has transformed India's political landscape, bringing Hindu nationalism, once a fringe ideology in India, into the mainstream while leaving the country deeply divided.\n\nHis supporters see him as a self-made, strong leader who has improved India's standing in the world. His critics and opponents say his Hindu-first politics have bred intolerance and while the economy, the world's fifth-largest and one of the fastest-growing, has become more unequal.\n\nSome 10 hours into counting, partial tallies reported by India's Election Commission showed Mr Modi's Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) was ahead in 196 constituencies and had won 45, including one uncontested, of 543 parliamentary seats. The main opposition Congress party led in 83 constituencies and had won 15.\n\nA total of 272 seats are needed for a majority. In 2019, the BJP won 303 seats, while they secured 282 in 2014 when Mr Modi first came to power.\n\nMr Modi's party is part of the National Democratic Alliance (NDA), whose members led in 236 constituencies and won 50, according to the partial count. The Congress party is part of the India alliance, which led in 211 constituencies and had won 19.\n\nThe Election Commission does not release data on the percentage of votes tallied, and early figures are expected to change.\n\nExit polling from the weekend had projected the NDA to win more than 350 seats. Indian markets, which had hit an all-time high on Monday, closed sharply down on Tuesday, with benchmark stock indices - the Nifty 50 and the BSE Sensex - both down by more than 5%.\n\nIf Mr Modi wins, it would only be the second time an Indian leader has retained power for a third term after Jawaharlal Nehru, the country's first prime minister.\n\nBut if his BJP is forced to form a coalition, the party would likely \"be heavily dependent on the goodwill of its allies, which makes them critical players who we can expect will extract their pound of flesh, both in terms of policymaking as well as government formation,\" said Milan Vaishnav, director of the South Asia Programme at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace.\n\n\"This would be truly, you know, uncharted territory, both for Indians as well as for the prime minister,\" he added.\n\nBefore Mr Modi came to power, India had coalition governments for 30 years. His BJP has always had a majority on its own while still governing in a coalition.\n\nExtreme heat struck India as voters went to the polls. While temperatures were somewhat lower on Tuesday, election officials and political parties still hauled in large quantities of water and installed outdoor air coolers for people waiting for results.\n\nOutside BJP party headquarters in New Delhi, supporters banged drums and bells as the counting was under way. Earlier, party workers performed a Hindu ritual.\n\nMeanwhile, supporters at the Congress party headquarters appeared upbeat and chanted slogans praising Rahul Gandhi, the face of the party's campaign.\n\nAt a news conference, the Congress party president Mallikarjun Kharge said the alliance's strong showing was a \"win for democracy\" and a \"moral and political loss\" for Mr Modi.\n\nMr Gandhi added that the figures were a message from the people: \"The poorest of this country have defended the constitution of India.\"\n\nOver 10 years in power, Mr Modi's popularity has outstripped that of his party's, and has turned a parliamentary election into one that increasingly resembles a presidential-style campaign. The result is that the BJP relies more and more on Mr Modi's enduring brand to stay in power, with local politicians receding into the background even in state elections.\n\n\"Modi was not just the prime campaigner, but the sole campaigner of this election,\" said Yamini Aiyar, a public policy scholar.\n\nThe country's democracy, Mr Modi's critics say, is faltering under his government, which has increasingly wielded strong-arm tactics to subdue political opponents, squeeze independent media and quash dissent. The government has rejected such accusations and says democracy is flourishing.\n\nAnd economic discontent has simmered under Mr Modi. While stock markets reach record-highs and millionaires multiply, youth unemployment has soared, with only a small portion of Indians benefiting from the boom.\n\nAs polls opened in mid-April, a confident BJP initially focused its campaign on \"Modi's guarantees\", highlighting the economic and welfare achievements that his party says have reduced poverty. With him at the helm, \"India will become a developed nation by 2047,\" Mr Modi repeated in rally after rally.\n\nBut the campaign turned increasingly shrill, as Mr Modi ramped up polarising rhetoric that targeted Muslims, who make up 14% of the population, a tactic seen to energise his core Hindu majority voters.\n\nThe opposition India alliance has attacked Mr Modi over his Hindu nationalist politics, and campaigned on issues of joblessness, inflation and inequality.\n\nBut the broad alliance of over a dozen political parties has been beset by ideological differences and defections, raising questions over their effectiveness. Meanwhile, the alliance has also claimed they have been unfairly targeted, pointing to a spree of raids, arrests and corruption investigations against their leaders by federal agencies they say are politically motivated.

AP's earlier story follows below.\n\nNEW DELHI (AP) -- Prime Minister Narendra Modi's coalition led in a majority of seats Tuesday in India's general election, according to early figures, but faced a stronger challenge from the opposition than expected after it pushed back against the leader's mixed economic record and polarizing politics.\n\nThe counting of more than 640 million votes cast over six weeks in the world's largest democratic exercise was set to take all day.

The main opposition Congress party led in 99 constituencies.\n\nA total of 272 seats are needed for a majority. In 2019, the BJP won 303 seats.\n\nModi's party is part of the National Democratic Alliance, whose parties led in 287 constituencies, according to the early count, including the two won by BJP. The Congress party is part of the INDIA alliance, which led in 230 constituencies.\n\nThe Election Commission does not release data on the percentage of votes tallied, and early figures were expected to change.\n\nThe \"Congress party and other opposition parties have showed tremendous resilience. To have a stronger opposition augers very well for India's democracy that has taken a hit during Modi's 10-year rule,\" said political analyst Rasheed Kidwai.\n\nExit polling from the weekend had projected the NDA to win more than 350 seats. Indian markets, which had hit an all-time high on Monday, were down sharply in midday trading Tuesday, with benchmark stock indices -- the NIFTY 50 and the BSE Sensex -- both down by more than 7%.\n\nExtreme heat struck India as voters went to the polls, with temperatures higher than 45 degrees Celsius (113 Fahrenheit) in some parts of the country.

India's marathon election enters its final phase on Tuesday with the counting of more than 640 million votes in the world\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s largest democratic exercise, which was widely expected to return Prime Minister Narendra Modi to a third term after a decade in power. (AP Photo/Rafiq Maqbool)NEW DELHI (AP) - India on Tuesday began counting more than 640 million votes in the world's largest democratic exercise, which was widely expected to return Prime Minister Narendra Modi to a third term after a decade in power. The 6-week-long election was seen as a referendum on Modi. If the 73-year-old wins, it will only be the second time an Indian leader has retained power for a third term after Jawaharlal Nehru, the country's first prime minister. Exit polls on Saturday by major television channels projected a comfortable win for Modi's Hindu nationalist Bharatiya Janata Party and its allies over a broad opposition alliance led by the Congress party and its main campaign leader, Rahul Gandhi. Indian television channels have had a mixed record in the past in predicting election results. Nearly 970 million people, more than 10% of the world's population, were eligible to vote. Turnout was around 66% on average across the seven phases, according to official data. The tallying of votes at counting centers in each of the 543 constituencies where polls were held could stretch into the evening before a final result is declared by the Election Commission of India. But leads will start to emerge earlier, which will give an idea of where the results may be headed. In his 10 years in power, Modi has transformed India's political landscape. His popularity has outstripped that of his party's, and has turned a parliamentary election into one that increasingly resembles a presidential-style campaign. The result is that the BJP relies more and more on Modi's enduring brand to stay in power, with local politicians receding into the background even in state elections. \"Modi was not just the prime campaigner, but the sole campaigner of this election,\"\u009d said Yamini Aiyar, a public policy scholar. His supporters see him as a self-made, strong leader who has improved India's standing in the world, and credit his pro-business policies with making the economy the world's fifth-largest. But a decade of his leadership has also left the country deeply divided. Modi's critics and opponents say his Hindu-first politics have bred intolerance, hate speech and brazen attacks against the country's minorities, especially Muslims, who comprise 14% of the population. India's economy, one of the fastest-growing, has become more unequal under Modi. While stock markets reach record-highs and millionaires multiply, youth unemployment has soared, with only a small portion of Indians benefitting from the economic boom. The country's democracy, Modi's critics say, is faltering under his government, which has increasingly wielded strong-arm tactics to subdue political opponents, squeeze independent media and quash dissent. The government has rejected such accusations and say democracy is flourishing. As polls opened in mid-April, a confident BJP initially focused its campaign on \"Modi's guarantees,\"\u009d highlighting the economic and welfare achievements that his party says have reduced poverty. With him at the helm, \"India will become a developed nation by 2047,\"\u009d Modi repeated in rally after rally. But the campaign turned increasingly shrill, as Modi ramped up polarizing rhetoric that targeted the Muslim minority, a tactic seen to energize his core Hindu majority voters. His opposition, the INDIA alliance led by the Congress party, has attacked Modi over his Hindu nationalist politics. It hopes to benefit from the simmering economic discontent, and its campaign has rallied around issues of joblessness, inflation and inequality. But the broad alliance of over a dozen political parties has been beset by ideological differences and defections, raising questions over their effectiveness. Meanwhile, the alliance has also claimed they've been unfairly targeted, pointing to a spree of raids, arrests and corruption investigations against their leaders by federal agencies they say are politically motivated. The government has denied this. Another victory would cement Modi as one of the country's most popular and important leaders.

AP's earlier story follows below.\n\nPrime Minister Narendra Modi's coalition led in a majority of seats Tuesday in India's general election, according to partial figures, but faced a stronger challenge from the opposition than expected after it pushed back against the leader's mixed economic record and polarizing politics.\n\nFor the first time since Modi's Bharatiya Janata Party swept to power in 2014, it might not secure a majority on its own, according to the ongoing vote count -- but the prime minister was still expected to be elected to a third five-year term in the world's largest democratic exercise.\n\nIf Modi has to rely on coalition support to govern, it would be a stunning blow for the 73-year-old, who had hoped for a landslide victory. Despite the setback, many of the Hindu nationalist policies he's instituted over the last 10 year remain locked in place.\n\nIn the face of surprising numbers, both sides claimed they had won some sort of victory.\n\n\"People have placed their faith in the NDA, for a third consecutive time,\" Modi wrote on social media platform X, referring to the National Democratic Alliance that his party heads. \"This is a historical feat in India's history.\"\n\nMeanwhile, the main opposition Congress party said the election had been a \"moral and political loss\" for Modi.\n\n\"This is public's victory and a win for democracy,\" Congress party President Mallikarjun Kharge told reporters.\n\nIn his 10 years in power, Modi has transformed India's political landscape, bringing Hindu nationalism, once a fringe ideology in India, into the mainstream while leaving the country deeply divided.\n\nHis supporters see him as a self-made, strong leader who has improved India's standing in the world. His critics and opponents say his Hindu-first politics have bred intolerance and while the economy, the world's fifth-largest and one of the fastest-growing, has become more unequal.\n\nThe counting of more than 640 million votes cast over six weeks was expected to last into the night.\n\nSome 12 hours into counting, partial tallies reported by India's Election Commission showed Modi's BJP was ahead in 114 constituencies and had won 126 of 543 parliamentary seats. The Congress party led in 45 constituencies and had won 54.\n\nA total of 272 seats are needed for a majority. In 2019, the BJP won 303 seats, while they secured 282 in 2014 when Modi first came to power.\n\nThe BJP-led National Democratic Alliance led in 147 constituencies and won 139, according to the partial count. The Congress party is part of the INDIA alliance, which led in 131 constituencies and had won 99.\n\nThe Election Commission does not release data on the percentage of votes tallied.\n\nExit polling from the weekend had projected the NDA to win more than 350 seats. Indian markets, which had hit an all-time high on Monday, closed sharply down Tuesday, with benchmark stock indices -- the NIFTY 50 and the BSE Sensex -- both down by more than 5%.\n\nFor Payal, a resident of the northern city of Lucknow who uses only one name, the election was about the economy and India's vast number of people living in poverty.\n\n\"People are suffering, there are no jobs, people are in such a state that their kids are compelled to make and sell tea on the roadside,\" Payal said. \"This is a big deal for us. If we don't wake up now, when will we?\"\n\nIf Modi wins, it would only be the second time an Indian leader has retained power for a third term after Jawaharlal Nehru, the country's first prime minister.\n\nBut if his BJP is forced to form a coalition, the party would likely \"be heavily dependent on the goodwill of its allies, which makes them critical players who we can expect will extract their pound of flesh, both in terms of policymaking as well as government formation,\" said Milan Vaishnav, director of the South Asia Program at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace.\n\n\"This would be truly, you know, uncharted territory, both for Indians as well as for the prime minister,\" he added.\n\nBefore Modi came to power, India had coalition governments for 30 years. His BJP has always had a majority on its own while still governing in a coalition.\n\nExtreme heat struck India as voters went to the polls. While temperatures were somewhat lower on Tuesday, election officials and political parties still hauled in large quantities of water and installed outdoor air coolers for people waiting for results.\n\nOutside BJP party headquarters in New Delhi, supporters banged drums and bells as the counting was underway. Earlier, party workers performed a Hindu ritual.\n\nMeanwhile, supporters at the Congress party headquarters appeared upbeat and chanted slogans praising Rahul Gandhi, the face of the party's campaign.\n\nSpeaking at the press conference with party president Kharge, Gandhi said he saw the figures as a message from the people.\n\n\"The poorest of this country have defended the constitution of India,\" he said.\n\nOver 10 years in power, Modi's popularity has outstripped that of his party's, and turned a parliamentary election into one that increasingly resembled a presidential-style campaign. The result is that the BJP relies more and more on Modi's enduring brand to stay in power, with local politicians receding into the background even in state elections.\n\n\"Modi was not just the prime campaigner, but the sole campaigner of this election,\" said Yamini Aiyar, a public policy scholar.\n\nThe country's democracy, Modi's critics say, is faltering under his government, which has increasingly wielded strong-arm tactics to subdue political opponents, squeeze independent media and quash dissent. The government has rejected such accusations and say democracy is flourishing.\n\nAnd economic discontent has simmered under Modi. While stock markets reach record-highs and millionaires multiply, youth unemployment has soared, with only a small portion of Indians benefitting from the boom.\n\nAs polls opened in mid-April, a confident BJP initially focused its campaign on \"Modi's guarantees,\" highlighting the economic and welfare achievements that his party says have reduced poverty. With him at the helm, \"India will become a developed nation by 2047,\" Modi repeated in rally after rally.\n\nBut the campaign turned increasingly shrill, as Modi ramped up polarizing rhetoric that targeted Muslims, who make up 14% of the population, a tactic seen to energize his core Hindu majority voters.\n\nThe opposition INDIA alliance has attacked Modi over his Hindu nationalist politics, and campaigned on issues of joblessness, inflation and inequality.\n\nBut the broad alliance of over a dozen political parties has been beset by ideological differences and defections, raising questions over their effectiveness. Meanwhile, the alliance has also claimed they've been unfairly targeted, pointing to a spree of raids, arrests and corruption investigations against their leaders by federal agencies they say are politically motivated. The government has denied this.\n\nIn the financial capital of Mumbai, Mangesh Mahadeshwar was one of many surprised by how the election was playing out.\n\n\"Yesterday we thought that the BJP would

Mr Modi is still widely expected to be elected to a third five-year term - even as the race tightens and the early count showed his party might not secure a majority on its own.\n\nIf Mr Modi wins, it would cement the 73-year-old as one of the country's most popular and important leaders. It would only be the second time an Indian leader has retained power for a third term after Jawaharlal Nehru, the country's first prime minister.\n\nIn his 10 years in power, Mr Modi has transformed India's political landscape, bringing Hindu nationalism, once a fringe ideology in India, into the mainstream while leaving the country deeply divided.\n\nHis supporters see him as a self-made, strong leader who has improved India's standing in the world. His critics and opponents say his Hindu-first politics have bred intolerance and while the economy, the world's fifth-largest and one of the fastest-growing, has become more unequal.\n\nSome seven hours into counting, early leads reported by India's Election Commission showed Mr Modi's Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) was ahead in 236 constituencies and had won two, including one uncontested, of 543 parliamentary seats. The main opposition Congress party led in 99 constituencies.\n\nA total of 272 seats are needed for a majority. In 2019, the BJP won 303 seats.\n\nMr Modi's party is part of the National Democratic Alliance (NDA), whose parties led in 287 constituencies, according to the early count, including the two won by BJP. The Congress party is part of the India alliance, which led in 230 constituencies.\n\nThe Election Commission does not release data on the percentage of votes tallied, and early figures are expected to change.\n\n\"(The) Congress party and other opposition parties have showed tremendous resilience. To have a stronger opposition augers very well for India's democracy that has taken a hit during Modi's 10-year rule,\" said political analyst Rasheed Kidwai.\n\nExit polling from the weekend had projected the NDA to win more than 350 seats. Indian markets, which had hit an all-time high on Monday, closed sharply down on Tuesday, with benchmark stock indices - the Nifty 50 and the BSE Sensex - both down by more than 5%.\n\nExtreme heat struck India as voters went to the polls, with temperatures higher than 45C in some parts of the country. Temperatures were somewhat lower on Tuesday for the counting, but election officials and political parties still took precautions, hauling in large quantities of water and installing outdoor air coolers for people waiting for results outside the buildings where votes were being tallied and party headquarters.\n\nBJP workers outside the party's office in New Delhi performed a Hindu ritual shortly after the counting began. Meanwhile, supporters at the Congress party headquarters appeared upbeat.\n\nOver 10 years in power, Mr Modi's popularity has outstripped that of his party's, and has turned a parliamentary election into one that increasingly resembles a presidential-style campaign. The result is that the BJP relies more and more on Mr Modi's enduring brand to stay in power, with local politicians receding into the background even in state elections.\n\n\"Modi was not just the prime campaigner, but the sole campaigner of this election,\" said Yamini Aiyar, a public policy scholar.\n\nThe country's democracy, Mr Modi's critics say, is faltering under his government, which has increasingly wielded strong-arm tactics to subdue political opponents, squeeze independent media and quash dissent. The government has rejected such accusations and says democracy is flourishing.\n\nAnd economic discontent has simmered under Mr Modi. While stock markets reach record-highs and millionaires multiply, youth unemployment has soared, with only a small portion of Indians benefiting from the boom.\n\nAs polls opened in mid-April, a confident BJP initially focused its campaign on \"Modi's guarantees\", highlighting the economic and welfare achievements that his party says have reduced poverty. With him at the helm, \"India will become a developed nation by 2047,\" Mr Modi repeated in rally after rally.\n\nBut the campaign turned increasingly shrill, as Mr Modi ramped up polarising rhetoric that targeted Muslims, who make up 14% of the population, a tactic seen to energise his core Hindu majority voters.\n\nThe opposition India alliance has attacked Mr Modi over his Hindu nationalist politics, and campaigned on issues of joblessness, inflation and inequality.\n\nBut the broad alliance of over a dozen political parties has been beset by ideological differences and defections, raising questions over their effectiveness. Meanwhile, the alliance has also claimed they have been unfairly targeted, pointing to a spree of raids, arrests and corruption investigations against their leaders by federal agencies they say are politically motivated.

If the 73-year-old wins, it will only be the second time an Indian leader has retained power for a third term after Jawaharlal Nehru, the country's first prime minister.Exit polls on Saturday by major television channels projected a comfortable win for Modi's Hindu nationalist Bharatiya Janata Party and its allies over a broad opposition alliance led by the Congress party and its main campaign leader, Rahul Gandhi.\n\nIndian television channels have had a mixed record in the past in predicting election results. Nearly 970 million people, more than 10% of the world's population, were eligible to vote. Turnout averaged 66% across the seven phases, according to official data. The tallying of votes at counting centers in each of the 543 constituencies where polls were held could stretch into the evening before a final result is declared by the Election Commission of India. But leads will emerge earlier and indicate where the results may be headed.\n\nIn his 10 years in power, Modi has transformed India's political landscape. His popularity has outstripped that of his party's, and has turned a parliamentary election into one that increasingly resembles a presidential-style campaign. The result is that the BJP relies more and more on Modi's enduring brand to stay in power, with local politicians receding into the background even in state elections. \"Modi was not just the prime campaigner, but the sole campaigner of this election,\" said Yamini Aiyar, a public policy scholar. His supporters see him as a self-made, strong leader who has improved India's standing in the world, and credit his pro-business policies with making the economy the world's fifth-largest.\n\nBut a decade of his leadership has also left the country deeply divided. Modi's critics and opponents say his Hindu-first politics have bred intolerance, hate speech and brazen attacks against the country's minorities, especially Muslims, who comprise 14% of the population. India's economy, one of the fastest-growing, has become more unequal under Modi. While stock markets reach record-highs and millionaires multiply, youth unemployment has soared, with only a small portion of Indians benefitting from the economic boom.\n\nThe country's democracy, Modi's critics say, is faltering under his government, which has increasingly wielded strong-arm tactics to subdue political opponents, squeeze independent media and quash dissent. The government has rejected such accusations and say democracy is flourishing. As polls opened in mid-April, a confident BJP initially focused its campaign on \"Modi's guarantees,\" highlighting the economic and welfare achievements that his party says have reduced poverty. With him at the helm, \"India will become a developed nation by 2047,\" Modi repeated in rally after rally. But the campaign turned increasingly shrill, as Modi ramped up polarizing rhetoric that targeted the Muslim minority, a tactic seen to energize his core Hindu majority voters.\n\nHis opposition, the INDIA alliance led by the Congress party, has attacked Modi over his Hindu nationalist politics. It hopes to benefit from the simmering economic discontent, and its campaign has rallied around issues of joblessness, inflation and inequality. But the broad alliance of over a dozen political parties has been beset by ideological differences and defections, raising questions over their effectiveness. Meanwhile, the alliance has also claimed they've been unfairly targeted, pointing to a spree of raids, arrests and corruption investigations against their leaders by federal agencies they say are politically motivated. The government has denied this.\n\nAnother victory would cement Modi as one of the country's most popular and important leaders. It would follow a thumping win in 2019, when the BJP won 303 out of 543 parliamentary seats.\n\nExcept for the headline, this story has not been edited by DNA staff and is published from AP",

AP's earlier story follows below.\n\nPrime Minister Narendra Modi's coalition led in a majority of seats Tuesday in India's general election, according to early figures, but faced a stronger challenge from the opposition than expected after it pushed back against the leader's mixed economic record and polarizing politics.\n\nModi was still widely expected to be elected to a third five-year term in the world's largest democratic exercise -- even as early count showed his Hindu nationalist party might not secure a majority on its own, despite pre-election hopes of a landslide victory.\n\nIf that trend holds, it would be a stunning blow for the 73-year-old leader, who has never been in a position where he has needed to rely on his coalition partners to govern.\n\nThe counting of more than 640 million votes cast over six weeks was set to take all day, and early figures could change.\n\nIn his 10 years in power, Modi has transformed India's political landscape, bringing Hindu nationalism, once a fringe ideology in India, into the mainstream while leaving the country deeply divided.\n\nHis supporters see him as a self-made, strong leader who has improved India's standing in the world. His critics and opponents say his Hindu-first politics have bred intolerance and while the economy, the world's fifth-largest and one of the fastest-growing, has become more unequal.\n\nSome eight hours into counting, early leads reported by India's Election Commission showed Modi's Bharatiya Janata Party was ahead in 231 constituencies and had won 13, including one uncontested, of 543 parliamentary seats. The main opposition Congress party led in 93 constituencies and had won four.\n\nA total of 272 seats are needed for a majority. In 2019, the BJP won 303 seats, while they secured 282 in 2014 when Modi first came to power.\n\nModi's party is part of the National Democratic Alliance, whose members led in 277 constituencies and won 15, according to the early count. The Congress party is part of the INDIA alliance, which led in 220 constituencies and had won five.\n\nThe Election Commission does not release data on the percentage of votes tallied.\n\nExit polling from the weekend had projected the NDA to win more than 350 seats. Indian markets, which had hit an all-time high on Monday, closed sharply down Tuesday, with benchmark stock indices -- the NIFTY 50 and the BSE Sensex -- both down by more than 5%.\n\nIn the financial capital of Mumbai, Mangesh Mahadeshwar was one of many surprised by how the election was playing out.\n\n\"Yesterday we thought that the BJP would get more than 400 seats,\" said 52-year-old who was keeping an eye on the results at the restaurant where he works. \"Today it seems like that won't happen -- people haven't supported the BJP so much this time.\"\n\nA worker carries a banner of Bharatiya Janta party featuring Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi to be put up outside party headquarters in New Delhi, India, Tuesday, June 4, 2024. (AP Photo/Dinesh Joshi)\n\nIf Modi wins, it would only be the second time an Indian leader has retained power for a third term after Jawaharlal Nehru, the country's first prime minister.\n\nBut if his BJP is forced to form a coalition, the party would likely \"be heavily dependent on the goodwill of its allies, which makes them critical players who we can expect will extract their pound of flesh, both in terms of policymaking as well as government formation,\" said Milan Vaishnav, director of the South Asia Program at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace.\n\n\"This would be truly, you know, uncharted territory, both for Indians as well as for the prime minister,\" he added.\n\nBefore Modi came to power, India had coalition governments for 30 years. His BJP has always had a majority on its own while still governing in a coalition.\n\nExtreme heat struck India as voters went to the polls, with temperatures higher than 45 degrees Celsius (113 Fahrenheit) in some parts of the country. Temperatures were somewhat lower on Tuesday for the counting, but election officials and political parties still hauled in large quantities of water and installed outdoor air coolers for people waiting for results.\n\nBJP workers outside the party's office in New Delhi performed a Hindu ritual shortly after the counting began. Meanwhile, supporters at the Congress party headquarters appeared upbeat and chanted slogans praising Rahul Gandhi, the face of the party's campaign.\n\nOver 10 years in power, Modi's popularity has outstripped that of his party's, and turned a parliamentary election into one that increasingly resembled a presidential-style campaign. The result is that the BJP relies more and more on Modi's enduring brand to stay in power, with local politicians receding into the background even in state elections.\n\n\"Modi was not just the prime campaigner, but the sole campaigner of this election,\" said Yamini Aiyar, a public policy scholar.\n\nThe country's democracy, Modi's critics say, is faltering under his government, which has increasingly wielded strong-arm tactics to subdue political opponents, squeeze independent media and quash dissent.

AP's earlier story follows below.\n\nPrime Minister Narendra Modi's coalition led in a majority of seats Tuesday in India's general election, according to partial figures, but faced a stronger challenge from the opposition than expected after it pushed back against the leader's mixed economic record and polarizing politics.\n\nFor the first time since Modi's Bharatiya Janata Party swept to power in 2014, it might not secure a majority on its own, according to the ongoing vote count -- but the prime minister was still expected to be elected to a third five-year term in the world's largest democratic exercise.\n\nIf Modi has to rely on coalition support to govern, it would be a stunning blow for the 73-year-old, who had hoped for a landslide victory. Despite the setback, many of the Hindu nationalist policies he's instituted over the last 10 year remain locked in place.\n\nIn the face of surprising numbers, both sides claimed they had won some sort of victory.\n\n\"People have placed their faith in the NDA, for a third consecutive time,\" Modi wrote on social media platform X, referring to the National Democratic Alliance that his party heads. \"This is a historical feat in India's history.\"\n\nMeanwhile, the main opposition Congress party said the election had been a \"moral and political loss\" for Modi.\n\n\"This is public's victory and a win for democracy,\" Congress party President Mallikarjun Kharge told reporters.\n\nIn his 10 years in power, Modi has transformed India's political landscape, bringing Hindu nationalism, once a fringe ideology in India, into the mainstream while leaving the country deeply divided.\n\nHis supporters see him as a self-made, strong leader who has improved India's standing in the world. His critics and opponents say his Hindu-first politics have bred intolerance and while the economy, the world's fifth-largest and one of the fastest-growing, has become more unequal.\n\nThe counting of more than 640 million votes cast over six weeks was expected to last into the night.\n\nSome 12 hours into counting, partial tallies reported by India's Election Commission showed Modi's BJP was ahead in 114 constituencies and had won 126 of 543 parliamentary seats. The Congress party led in 45 constituencies and had won 54.\n\nA total of 272 seats are needed for a majority. In 2019, the BJP won 303 seats, while they secured 282 in 2014 when Modi first came to power.\n\nThe BJP-led National Democratic Alliance led in 147 constituencies and won 139, according to the partial count. The Congress party is part of the INDIA alliance, which led in 131 constituencies and had won 99.\n\nThe Election Commission does not release data on the percentage of votes tallied.\n\nExit polling from the weekend had projected the NDA to win more than 350 seats. Indian markets, which had hit an all-time high on Monday, closed sharply down Tuesday, with benchmark stock indices -- the NIFTY 50 and the BSE Sensex -- both down by more than 5%.\n\nFor Payal, a resident of the northern city of Lucknow who uses only one name, the election was about the economy and India's vast number of people living in poverty.\n\n\"People are suffering, there are no jobs, people are in such a state that their kids are compelled to make and sell tea on the roadside,\" Payal said. \"This is a big deal for us. If we don't wake up now, when will we?\"\n\nIf Modi wins, it would only be the second time an Indian leader has retained power for a third term after Jawaharlal Nehru, the country's first prime minister.\n\nBut if his BJP is forced to form a coalition, the party would likely \"be heavily dependent on the goodwill of its allies, which makes them critical players who we can expect will extract their pound of flesh, both in terms of policymaking as well as government formation,\" said Milan Vaishnav, director of the South Asia Program at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace.\n\n\"This would be truly, you know, uncharted territory, both for Indians as well as for the prime minister,\" he added.\n\nBefore Modi came to power, India had coalition governments for 30 years. His BJP has always had a majority on its own while still governing in a coalition.\n\nExtreme heat struck India as voters went to the polls. While temperatures were somewhat lower on Tuesday, election officials and political parties still hauled in large quantities of water and installed outdoor air coolers for people waiting for results.\n\nOutside BJP party headquarters in New Delhi, supporters banged drums and bells as the counting was underway. Earlier, party workers performed a Hindu ritual.\n\nMeanwhile, supporters at the Congress party headquarters appeared upbeat and chanted slogans praising Rahul Gandhi, the face of the party's campaign.\n\nSpeaking at the press conference with party president Kharge, Gandhi said he saw the figures as a message from the people.\n\n\"The poorest of this country have defended the constitution of India,\" he said.\n\nOver 10 years in power, Modi's popularity has outstripped that of his party's, and turned a parliamentary election into one that increasingly resembled a presidential-style campaign. The result is that the BJP relies more and more on Modi's enduring brand to stay in power, with local politicians receding into the background even in state elections.\n\n\"Modi was not just the prime campaigner, but the sole campaigner of this election,\" said Yamini Aiyar, a public policy scholar.\n\nThe country's democracy, Modi's critics say, is faltering under his government, which has increasingly wielded strong-arm tactics to subdue political opponents, squeeze independent media and quash dissent. The government has rejected such accusations and say democracy is flourishing.\n\nAnd economic discontent has simmered under Modi.

The government has denied this.\n\nIn the financial capital of Mumbai, Mangesh Mahadeshwar was one of many surprised by how the election was playing out.\n\n\"Yesterday we thought that the BJP would get more than 400 seats,\" said 52-year-old who was keeping an eye on the results at the restaurant where he works. \"Today it seems like that won't happen - people haven't supported the BJP so much

India began counting more than 640 million votes Tuesday in the world's largest democratic exercise, which was widely expected to return Prime Minister Narendra Modi to a third term after a decade in power. (AP Photo/Rajesh Kumar Singh, File)\n\nPrime Minister Narendra Modi's coalition led in a majority of seats Tuesday in India's general election, according to partial figures, but faced a stronger challenge from the opposition than expected after it pushed back against the leader's mixed economic record and polarizing politics.\n\nModi was still widely expected to be elected to a third five-year term in the world's largest democratic exercise -- even as an ongoing count showed his Hindu nationalist party might not secure a majority on its own, despite pre-election hopes of a landslide victory.\n\nIf that trend holds, it would be a stunning blow for the 73-year-old leader, who has never been in a position where he has needed to rely on his coalition partners to govern.\n\nThe counting of more than 640 million votes cast over six weeks was set to take all day, and early figures could change.\n\nIn his 10 years in power, Modi has transformed India's political landscape, bringing Hindu nationalism, once a fringe ideology in India, into the mainstream while leaving the country deeply divided.\n\nHis supporters see him as a self-made, strong leader who has improved India's standing in the world. His critics and opponents say his Hindu-first politics have bred intolerance and while the economy, the world's fifth-largest and one of the fastest-growing, has become more unequal.\n\nSome 10 hours into counting, partial tallies reported by India's Election Commission showed Modi's Bharatiya Janata Party was ahead in 196 constituencies and had won 45, including one uncontested, of 543 parliamentary seats. The main opposition Congress party led in 83 constituencies and had won 15.\n\nA total of 272 seats are needed for a majority. In 2019, the BJP won 303 seats, while they secured 282 in 2014 when Modi first came to power.\n\nModi's party is part of the National Democratic Alliance, whose members led in 236 constituencies and won 50, according to the partial count.

AP's earlier story follows below.\n\nNEW DELHI (AP) -- Prime Minister Narendra Modi's coalition led in a majority of seats Tuesday in India's general election, according to partial figures, but faced a stronger challenge from the opposition than expected after it pushed back against the leader's mixed economic record and polarizing politics.\n\nModi was still widely expected to be elected to a third five-year term in the world's largest democratic exercise -- even as an ongoing count showed his Hindu nationalist party might not secure a majority on its own, despite pre-election hopes of a landslide victory.\n\nIf that trend holds, it would be a stunning blow for the 73-year-old leader, who has never been in a position where he has needed to rely on his coalition partners to govern.\n\nThe counting of more than 640 million votes cast over six weeks was set to take all day, and early figures could change.\n\nIn his 10 years in power, Modi has transformed India's political landscape, bringing Hindu nationalism, once a fringe ideology in India, into the mainstream while leaving the country deeply divided.\n\nHis supporters see him as a self-made, strong leader who has improved India's standing in the world. His critics and opponents say his Hindu-first politics have bred intolerance and while the economy, the world's fifth-largest and one of the fastest-growing, has become more unequal.\n\nSome 10 hours into counting, partial tallies reported by India's Election Commission showed Modi's Bharatiya Janata Party was ahead in 196 constituencies and had won 45, including one uncontested, of 543 parliamentary seats. The main opposition Congress party led in 83 constituencies and had won 15.\n\nA total of 272 seats are needed for a majority. In 2019, the BJP won 303 seats, while they secured 282 in 2014 when Modi first came to power.\n\nModi's party is part of the National Democratic Alliance, whose members led in 236 constituencies and won 50, according to the partial count. The Congress party is part of the INDIA alliance, which led in 211 constituencies and had won 19.\n\nThe Election Commission does not release data on the percentage of votes tallied.\n\nExit polling from the weekend had projected the NDA to win more than 350 seats. Indian markets, which had hit an all-time high on Monday, closed sharply down Tuesday, with benchmark stock indices -- the NIFTY 50 and the BSE Sensex -- both down by more than 5%.\n\nFor Payal, a resident of the northern city of Lucknow who uses only one name, the election was about the economy and India's vast number of people living in poverty.\n\n\"People are suffering, there are no jobs, people are in such a state that their kids are compelled to make and sell tea on the roadside,\" Payal said. \"This is a big deal for us.

During the grueling, multiphase election, candidates crisscrossed the country, poll workers hiked to remote villages, and voters lined up for hours in sweltering heat. The election, whose results are to be announced Tuesday, is considered one of the most consequential in India's history, the AP reports. If Modi wins, he'll be only the second Indian leader to retain power for a third term after Jawaharlal Nehru, the country's first prime minister.\n\nExit polls by major television news channels projected Modi's Hindu nationalist Bharatiya Janata Party and its allies were leading over the broad opposition alliance led by the Congress party. Most exit polls projected BJP and its allies could win more than 350 seats out of 543 -- far ahead of the 272 seats needed to form the next government.

AP's earlier story follows below.\n\nNEW DELHI (AP) -- Prime Minister Narendra Modi's coalition led in a majority of seats Tuesday in India's general election, according to partial figures, but faced a stronger challenge from the opposition than expected after it pushed back against the leader's mixed economic record and polarizing politics.\n\nHis Hindu nationalist party appeared unlikely to secure a majority on its own, according to an ongoing count showed, despite pre-election hopes of a landslide victory -- but Modi was still expected to be elected to a third five-year term in the world's largest democratic exercise.\n\nIf that trend holds, it would be a stunning blow for the 73-year-old leader, who has never been in a position where he has needed to rely on his coalition partners to govern.\n\nThe counting of more than 640 million votes cast over six weeks was set to take all day, and early figures could change.\n\nIn his 10 years in power, Modi has transformed India's political landscape, bringing Hindu nationalism, once a fringe ideology in India, into the mainstream while leaving the country deeply divided.\n\nHis supporters see him as a self-made, strong leader who has improved India's standing in the world. His critics and opponents say his Hindu-first politics have bred intolerance and while the economy, the world's fifth-largest and one of the fastest-growing, has become more unequal.\n\nSome 10 hours into counting, partial tallies reported by India's Election Commission showed Modi's Bharatiya Janata Party was ahead in 196 constituencies and had won 45, including one uncontested, of 543 parliamentary seats. The main opposition Congress party led in 83 constituencies and had won 15.\n\nA total of 272 seats are needed for a majority. In 2019, the BJP won 303 seats, while they secured 282 in 2014 when Modi first came to power.\n\nModi's party is part of the National Democratic Alliance, whose members led in 236 constituencies and won 50, according to the partial count. The Congress party is part of the INDIA alliance, which led in 211 constituencies and had won 19.\n\nThe Election Commission does not release data on the percentage of votes tallied.\n\nExit polling from the weekend had projected the NDA to win more than 350 seats. Indian markets, which had hit an all-time high on Monday, closed sharply down Tuesday, with benchmark stock indices -- the NIFTY 50 and the BSE Sensex -- both down by more than 5%.\n\nFor Payal, a resident of the northern city of Lucknow who uses only one name, the election was about the economy and India's vast number of people living in poverty.\n\n\"People are suffering, there are no jobs, people are in such a state that their kids are compelled to make and sell tea on the roadside,\" Payal said. \"This is a big deal for us. If we don't wake up now, when will we?\"\n\nIf Modi wins, it would only be the second time an Indian leader has retained power for a third term after Jawaharlal Nehru, the country's first prime minister.\n\nBut if his BJP is forced to form a coalition, the party would likely \"be heavily dependent on the goodwill of its allies, which makes them critical players who we can expect will extract their pound of flesh, both in terms of policymaking as well as government formation,\" said Milan Vaishnav, director of the South Asia Program at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace.\n\n\"This would be truly, you know, uncharted territory, both for Indians as well as for the prime minister,\" he added.\n\nBefore Modi came to power, India had coalition governments for 30 years. His BJP has always had a majority on its own while still governing in a coalition.\n\nExtreme heat struck India as voters went to the polls. While temperatures were somewhat lower on Tuesday, election officials and political parties still hauled in large quantities of water and installed outdoor air coolers for people waiting for results.\n\nOutside BJP party headquarters in New Delhi, supporters banged drums and bells as the counting was underway. Earlier, party workers performed a Hindu ritual.\n\nMeanwhile, supporters at the Congress party headquarters appeared upbeat and chanted slogans praising Rahul Gandhi, the face of the party's campaign.\n\nAt a news conference, the Congress party President Mallikarjun Kharge said the alliance's strong showing was a \"win for democracy\" and a \"moral and political loss\" for Modi.\n\nGandhi added that the figures were a message from the people: \"The poorest of this country have defended the constitution of India.\"\n\nOver 10 years in power, Modi's popularity has outstripped that of his party's, and turned a parliamentary election into one that increasingly resembled a presidential-style campaign. The result is that the BJP relies more and more on Modi's enduring brand to stay in power, with local politicians receding into the background even in state elections.\n\n\"Modi was not just the prime campaigner, but the sole campaigner of this election,\" said Yamini Aiyar, a public policy scholar.\n\nThe country's democracy, Modi's critics say, is faltering under his government, which has increasingly wielded strong-arm tactics to subdue political opponents, squeeze independent media and quash dissent. The government has rejected such accusations and say democracy is flourishing.\n\nAnd economic discontent has simmered under Modi. While stock markets reach record-highs and millionaires multiply, youth unemployment has soared, with only a small portion of Indians benefitting from the boom.\n\nAs polls opened in mid-April, a confident BJP initially focused its campaign on \"Modi's guarantees,\" highlighting the economic and welfare achievements that his party says have reduced poverty. With him at the helm, \"India will become a developed nation by 2047,\" Modi repeated in rally after rally.\n\nBut the campaign turned increasingly shrill, as Modi ramped up polarizing rhetoric that targeted Muslims, who make up 14% of the population, a tactic seen to energize his core Hindu majority voters.\n\nThe opposition INDIA alliance has attacked Modi over his Hindu nationalist politics, and campaigned on issues of joblessness, inflation and inequality.\n\nBut the broad alliance of over a dozen political parties has been beset by ideological differences and defections, raising questions over their effectiveness. Meanwhile, the alliance has also claimed they've been unfairly targeted, pointing to a spree of raids, arrests and corruption investigations against their leaders by federal agencies they say are politically motivated. The government has denied this.\n\nIn the financial capital of Mumbai, Mangesh Mahadeshwar was one of many surprised by how the election was playing out.\n\n\"Yesterday we thought that the BJP would get more than 400 seats,\" said 52-year-old who was keeping an eye on the results at the restaurant where he works. \"Today it seems like that won't happen - people haven't supported the BJP so much this time.\"\n\n___\n\nAssociated Press journalists David Rising in New Delhi and Rafiq Maqbool in Mumbai, India, contributed to this story.", "source": {"uri": "hosted.ap.org", "dataType": "news",

He has promised to uplift the poor and turn India into a developed nation by 2047. But the campaign has turned increasingly shrill in recent weeks as he escalated polarizing rhetoric in back-to-back incendiary speeches that targeted the country's Muslim minority, who make up 14% of India's 1.4 billion people.\n\nAfter ending campaigning on Thursday, Modi went to meditate at a memorial site honoring a famous Hindu saint who is believed to have attained enlightenment there.\n\nWhen the election kicked off in April, Modi and his BJP were widely expected to clinch another term.\n\nSince first coming to power in 2014, Modi has enjoyed immense popularity.

Modi is challenged there by the state's chief minister, Mamata Banerjee, who heads the regional Trinamool Congress party.\n\n\"There is a crunch for jobs now in the present market. I will vote for the government that can uplift jobs. And I hope those who cannot get jobs, they will get jobs,\" said Ankit Samaddar.\n\nIn this election, Modi's BJP -- which controls much of India's Hindi-speaking northern and central parts -- sought to expand their influence by making inroads into the country's eastern and southern states, where regional parties hold greater sway.\n\nThe BJP also banked on consolidating votes among the Hindu majority, who make up 80% of the population, after Modi opened a long-demanded Hindu temple on the site of a razed mosque in January. Many saw it as the unofficial start of his campaign, but analysts said the excitement over the temple may not be enough to yield votes.\n\nInstead, Modi ramped up anti-Muslim rhetoric after voter turnout dipped slightly below 2019 figures in the first few rounds of the 2024 polls.\n\nThis was seen as a tactic to energize his core Hindu voter base. But analysts say it also reflected the lack of any big-ticket national issue to help Modi propel his BJP to electoral victory, as he has done previously.\n\nIn 2014, Modi's status as a political outsider cracking down on deep-rooted corruption won over voters disillusioned with decades of dynastic politics. And in 2019, he swept the polls on a wave of nationalism after his government launched airstrikes into rival Pakistan in response to a suicide bombing in Kashmir that killed 40 Indian soldiers.\n\nBut things are different this time, analysts say, giving Modi's political challengers a potential boost.\n\n\"The opposition somehow managed to derail his plan by setting the narrative to local issues, like unemployment and the economy. This election, people are voting keeping various issues in mind,\" said Rasheed Kidwai, a political analyst.\n\n___", "source": {"uri": "bostonglobe.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Boston

With him at the helm, \"India will become a developed nation by 2047,\" Modi repeated in rally after rally.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut the campaign turned increasingly shrill, as Modi ramped up polarizing rhetoric that targeted Muslims, who make up 14% of the population, a tactic seen to energize his core Hindu majority voters.\n\nThe opposition INDIA alliance has attacked Modi over his Hindu nationalist politics, and campaigned on issues of joblessness, inflation and inequality.\n\nBut the broad alliance of over a dozen political parties has been beset by ideological differences and defections, raising questions over their effectiveness. Meanwhile, the alliance has also claimed they've been unfairly targeted, pointing to a spree of raids, arrests and corruption investigations against their leaders by federal agencies they say are politically motivated. The government has denied this.\n\nIn the financial capital of Mumbai, Mangesh Mahadeshwar was one of many surprised by how the election was playing out.\n\n\"Yesterday we thought that the BJP would get more than 400 seats,\" said 52-year-old who was keeping an eye on the results at the restaurant where he works. \"Today it seems like that won't happen - people haven't supported the BJP so much

The NIFTY 50 index futures rose 0.21% in early trade, according to NSE International Exchange data, and was looking at another record high open.\n\nTV exit polls released on Saturday after voting ended projected the BJP-led National Democratic Alliance could win a two-thirds majority in the 543-member lower house of parliament.\n\nSeveral major polls projected the BJP alone could win more than the 303 it won in 2019.\n\nThe projections pushed Indian shares to lifetime highs on Monday while the rupee gained and bond yields dropped.\n\nNearly one billion people were eligible to vote in the seven-phase, seven-week poll which began on April 19 and held in searing summer heat with temperatures touching nearly 50\u00b0 Celsius (122\u00b0 Fahrenheit) in some parts.\n\nMore than 66% of registered voters turned out, just one percentage point lower than the previous election in 2019, squashing pre-poll concerns that voters might shun a contest thought to be a foregone conclusion in Modi's favor.\n\nMr. Modi, 73, who first swept to power in 2014 by promising growth and change, is seeking to be only the second prime minister after India's independence leader Jawaharlal Nehru to win three straight terms.\n\nHe began his campaign by showcasing his record in office including economic growth, welfare policies, national pride, Hindu nationalism and his own personal commitment to fulfilling promises which he called \"Modi's Guarantee.\"\n\nHowever, he changed tack after low voter turnout in the first phase and accused the opposition, especially the Congress party which leads an alliance of two dozen groups, of favoring India's 200 million Muslims -- a shift analysts said made the campaign coarse and divisive.\n\nThey said the pivot may have been aimed at firing up the Hindu nationalist base of Modi's Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) to draw them to vote. Modi defended himself against criticism that he was stoking divisions between Hindus and Muslims to win votes and said that he was only faulting the opposition campaign.\n\nThe opposition INDIA alliance, led by Rahul Gandhi's Congress party, denied it favoured Muslims in the Hindu-majority country and said Modi would destroy the constitution if he returned to power and end affirmative action enjoyed by the so-called backward castes. The BJP rejects this.\n\nThe opposition alliance also promised more welfare measures and handouts, with surveys saying unemployment, inflation and rural distress were the main concerns of voters. --

India was counting more than 640 million votes cast over the past six weeks in the world's largest democratic exercise, which was widely expected to give Prime Minister Narendra Modi a third five-year term when the final result is declared later Tuesday.\n\nNEW DELHI (AP) -- Indian markets closed sharply down Tuesday as early counting showed that Prime Minister Narendra Modi's party faced a tighter than expected race.\n\nIndia's benchmark stock indices, the NIFTY 50 and the BSE Sensex, had hit new highs at the close of day Monday but dropped sharply Tuesday as the early vote figures started to come in.\n\nThey recovered slightly to each close down more than 5%.\n\nThe country's stock markets have boomed under Modi, whose pro-market policies have made him popular among India's corporations and businesspeople. Critics have said India has become more unequal.\n\nEven if Modi's Bharatiya Janata Party does not secure a parliamentary majority on its own, early counts reported by India's Election Commission showed his coalition including smaller parties leading in a majority of seats.\n\nTHIS IS A BREAKING NEWS UPDATE. AP's earlier story follows below.\n\nNEW DELHI (AP) -- Prime Minister Narendra Modi's coalition led in a majority of seats Tuesday in India's general election, according to early figures, but faced a stronger challenge from the opposition than expected after it pushed back against the leader's mixed economic record and polarizing politics.\n\nThe counting of more than 640 million votes cast over six weeks in the world's largest democratic exercise was set to take all day. Modi was still widely expected to be elected to a third five-year term -- even as the race tightened and the early count showed his Hindu nationalist party might not secure a majority on its own.\n\nIf Modi wins, it would cement the 73-year-old as one of the country's most popular and important leaders. It would only be the second time an Indian leader has retained power for a third term after Jawaharlal Nehru, the country's first prime minister.\n\nIn his 10 years in power, Modi has transformed India's political landscape, bringing Hindu nationalism, once a fringe ideology in India, into the mainstream while leaving the country deeply divided.\n\nHis supporters see him as a self-made, strong leader who has improved India's standing in the world. His critics and opponents say his Hindu-first politics have bred intolerance and while the economy, the world's fifth-largest and one of the fastest-growing, has become more unequal.\n\nSome seven hours into counting, early leads reported by India's Election Commission showed Modi's Bharatiya Janata Party was ahead in 236 constituencies and had won two, including one uncontested, of 543 parliamentary seats. The main opposition Congress party led in 99 constituencies.\n\nA total of 272 seats are needed for a majority. In 2019, the BJP won 303 seats.\n\nModi's party is part of the National Democratic Alliance, whose parties led in 287 constituencies, according to the early count, including the two won by BJP. The Congress party is part of the INDIA alliance, which led in 230 constituencies.\n\nThe Election Commission does not release data on the percentage of votes tallied, and early figures were expected to change.\n\nThe \"Congress party and other opposition parties have showed tremendous resilience. To have a stronger opposition augers very well for India's democracy that has taken a hit during Modi's 10-year rule,\" said political analyst Rasheed Kidwai.\n\nExit polling from the weekend had projected the NDA to win more than 350 seats. Indian markets, which had hit an all-time high on Monday, were down sharply in midday trading Tuesday, with benchmark stock indices -- the NIFTY 50 and the BSE Sensex -- both down by more than 7%.\n\nExtreme heat struck India as voters went to the polls, with temperatures higher than 45 degrees Celsius (113 Fahrenheit) in some parts of the country. Temperatures were somewhat lower on Tuesday for the counting, but election officials and political parties still took precautions, hauling in large quantities of water and installing outdoor air coolers for people waiting for results outside the buildings where votes were being tallied and party headquarters.\n\nBJP workers outside the party's office in New Delhi performed a Hindu ritual shortly after the counting began. Meanwhile, supporters at the Congress party headquarters appeared upbeat and chanted slogans praising Gandhi, the party's campaign face.\n\nOver 10 years in power, Modi's popularity has outstripped that of his party's, and has turned a parliamentary election into one that increasingly resembles a presidential-style campaign. The result is that the BJP relies more and more on Modi's enduring brand to stay in power, with local politicians receding into the background even in state elections.\n\n\"Modi was not just the prime campaigner, but the sole campaigner of this election,\" said Yamini Aiyar, a public policy scholar.\n\nThe country's democracy, Modi's critics say, is faltering under his government, which has increasingly wielded strong-arm tactics to subdue political opponents, squeeze independent media and quash dissent. The government has rejected such accusations and say democracy is flourishing.\n\nAnd economic discontent has simmered under Modi. While stock markets reach record-highs and millionaires multiply, youth unemployment has soared, with only a small portion of Indians benefitting from the boom.\n\nAs polls opened in mid-April, a confident BJP initially focused its campaign on \"Modi's guarantees,\" highlighting the economic and welfare achievements that his party says have reduced poverty. With him at the helm, \"India will become a developed nation by 2047,\" Modi repeated in rally after rally.\n\nBut the campaign turned increasingly shrill, as Modi ramped up polarizing rhetoric that targeted Muslims, who make up 14% of the population, a tactic seen to energize his core Hindu majority voters.\n\nThe opposition INDIA alliance has attacked Modi over his Hindu nationalist politics, and campaigned on issues of joblessness, inflation and inequality.\n\nBut the broad alliance of over a dozen political parties has been beset by ideological differences and defections, raising questions over their effectiveness. Meanwhile, the alliance has also claimed they've been unfairly targeted, pointing to a spree of raids, arrests and corruption investigations against their leaders by federal agencies they say are politically motivated. The government has denied this.\n\nAssociated Press writer David Rising contributed to this story.", "source": {"uri": "yakimaherald.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yakima Herald-Republic"},

AP's earlier story follows below.\n\n----\n\nPrime Minister Narendra Modi's coalition led in a majority of seats Tuesday in India's general election, according to partial figures, but faced a stronger challenge from the opposition than expected after it pushed back against the leader's mixed economic record and polarizing politics.\n\nFor the first time since Modi's Bharatiya Janata Party swept to power in 2014, it might not secure a majority on its own, according to the ongoing vote count -- but the prime minister was still expected to be elected to a third five-year term in the world's largest democratic exercise.\n\nIf Modi has to rely on coalition support to govern, it would be a stunning blow for the 73-year-old, who had hoped for a landslide victory. Despite the setback, many of the Hindu nationalist policies he's instituted over the last 10 year remain locked in place.\n\nIn the face of surprising numbers, both sides claimed they had won some sort of victory.\n\n\"People have placed their faith in the NDA, for a third consecutive time,\" Modi wrote on social media platform X, referring to the National Democratic Alliance that his party heads. \"This is a historical feat in India's history.\"\n\nMeanwhile, the main opposition Congress party said the election had been a \"moral and political loss\" for Modi.\n\n\"This is public's victory and a win for democracy,\" Congress party President Mallikarjun Kharge told reporters.\n\nIn his 10 years in power, Modi has transformed India's political landscape, bringing Hindu nationalism, once a fringe ideology in India, into the mainstream while leaving the country deeply divided.\n\nHis supporters see him as a self-made, strong leader who has improved India's standing in the world. His critics and opponents say his Hindu-first politics have bred intolerance and while the economy, the world's fifth-largest and one of the fastest-growing, has become more unequal.\n\nThe counting of more than 640 million votes cast over six weeks was expected to last into the night.\n\nSome 12 hours into counting, partial tallies reported by India's Election Commission showed Modi's BJP was ahead in 114 constituencies and had won 126 of 543 parliamentary seats. The Congress party led in 45 constituencies and had won 54.\n\nA total of 272 seats are needed for a majority. In 2019, the BJP won 303 seats, while they secured 282 in 2014 when Modi first came to power.\n\nThe BJP-led National Democratic Alliance led in 147 constituencies and won 139, according to the partial count. The Congress party is part of the INDIA alliance, which led in 131 constituencies and had won 99.\n\nThe Election Commission does not release data on the percentage of votes tallied.\n\nExit polling from the weekend had projected the NDA to win more than 350 seats. Indian markets, which had hit an all-time high on Monday, closed sharply down Tuesday, with benchmark stock indices -- the NIFTY 50 and the BSE Sensex -- both down by more than 5%.\n\nA worker carries a banner of Bharatiya Janta party featuring Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi to be put up outside party headquarters in New Delhi, India, Tuesday, June 4, 2024. (AP Photo/Dinesh Joshi)\n\nFor Payal, a resident of the northern city of Lucknow who uses only one name, the election was about the economy and India's vast number of people living in poverty.\n\n\"People are suffering, there are no jobs, people are in such a state that their kids are compelled to make and sell tea on the roadside,\" Payal said. \"This is a big deal for us. If we don't wake up now, when will we?\"\n\nIf Modi wins, it would only be the second time an Indian leader has retained power for a third term after Jawaharlal Nehru, the country's first prime minister.\n\nBut if his BJP is forced to form a coalition, the party would likely \"be heavily dependent on the goodwill of its allies, which makes them critical players who we can expect will extract their pound of flesh, both in terms of policymaking as well as government formation,\" said Milan Vaishnav, director of the South Asia Program at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace.\n\n\"This would be truly, you know, uncharted territory, both for Indians as well as for the prime minister,\" he added.\n\nBefore Modi came to power, India had coalition governments for 30 years. His BJP has always had a majority on its own while still governing in a coalition.\n\nExtreme heat struck India as voters went to the polls. While temperatures were somewhat lower on Tuesday, election officials and political parties still hauled in large quantities of water and installed outdoor air coolers for people waiting for results.\n\nOutside BJP party headquarters in New Delhi, supporters banged drums and bells as the counting was underway. Earlier, party workers performed a Hindu ritual.\n\nMeanwhile, supporters at the Congress party headquarters appeared upbeat and chanted slogans praising Rahul Gandhi, the face of the party's campaign.\n\nSpeaking at the press conference with party president Kharge, Gandhi said he saw the figures as a message from the people.\n\n\"The poorest of this country have defended the constitution of India,\" he said.\n\nOver 10 years in power, Modi's popularity has outstripped that of his party's, and turned a parliamentary election into one that increasingly resembled a presidential-style campaign. The result is that the BJP relies more and more on Modi's enduring brand to stay in power, with local politicians receding into the background even in state elections.\n\nA roadside fruit juice seller watches the election results on his mobile phone in Kolkata, India, Tuesday, June 4, 2024. (AP Photo/Bikas Das)\n\n\"Modi was not just the prime campaigner, but the sole campaigner of this election,\" said Yamini Aiyar, a public policy scholar.\n\nThe country's democracy, Modi's critics say, is faltering under his government, which has increasingly wielded strong-arm tactics to subdue political opponents, squeeze independent media and quash dissent. The government has rejected such accusations and say democracy is flourishing.\n\nAnd economic discontent has simmered under Modi. While stock markets reach record-highs and millionaires multiply, youth unemployment has soared, with only a small portion of Indians benefitting from the boom.\n\nAs polls opened in mid-April, a confident BJP initially focused its campaign on \"Modi's guarantees,\" highlighting the economic and welfare achievements that his party says have reduced poverty. With him at the helm, \"India will become a developed nation by 2047,\" Modi repeated in rally after rally.\n\nBut the campaign turned increasingly shrill, as Modi ramped up polarizing rhetoric that targeted Muslims, who make up 14% of the population, a tactic seen to energize his core Hindu majority voters.\n\nThe opposition INDIA alliance has attacked Modi over his Hindu nationalist politics, and campaigned on issues of joblessness, inflation and inequality.\n\nBut the broad alliance of over a dozen political parties has been beset by ideological differences and defections, raising questions over their effectiveness. Meanwhile, the alliance has also claimed they've been unfairly targeted, pointing to a spree of raids, arrests and corruption investigations against their leaders by federal agencies they say are politically motivated. The government has denied this.\n\nIn the financial capital of Mumbai, Mangesh Mahadeshwar was one of many surprised by how the election was playing out.\n\n\"Yesterday we thought that the BJP would get more than 400 seats,\" said 52-year-old who was keeping an eye on the results at the restaurant where he works. \"Today it seems like that won't happen -- people haven't supported the BJP so much this time.", "source": {"uri": "ctvnews.ca", "dataType": "news", "title": "CTV News"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Democratic_Alliance", "type": "wiki",

If the 73-year-old wins, it will only be the second time an Indian leader has retained power for a third term after Jawaharlal Nehru, the country's first prime minister.\n\nExit polls on Saturday by major television channels projected a comfortable win for Modi's Hindu nationalist Bharatiya Janata Party and its allies over a broad opposition alliance led by the Congress party and its main campaign leader, Rahul Gandhi.\n\nIndian television channels have had a mixed record in the past in predicting election results.\n\nNearly 970 million people, more than 10% of the world's population, were eligible to vote. Turnout averaged 66% across the seven phases, according to official data.\n\nThe tallying of votes at counting centers in each of the 543 constituencies where polls were held could stretch into the evening before a final result is declared by the Election Commission of India.\n\nBut leads will emerge earlier and indicate where the results may be headed.\n\nIn his 10 years in power, Modi has transformed India's political landscape.

Modi's critics and opponents say his Hindu-first politics have bred intolerance, hate speech and brazen attacks against the country's minorities, especially Muslims, who comprise 14% of the population.\n\nIndia's economy, one of the fastest-growing, has become more unequal under Modi.

The NIFTY 50 and the S&P BSE Sensex were both down over 2 percent at 0500 GMT.\n\nThe rupee also fell against the dollar and benchmark bond yields were up.\n\nThe markets had soared on Monday after exit polls on 1 June projected Modi and his Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) would register a big victory, with its National Democratic Alliance (NDA) seen getting a two-thirds majority and more.\n\nAt 0430 GMT, TV channels showed the NDA was ahead in nearly 300 of the 543 elective seats in parliament, a simple majority, in early counting. The opposition INDIA alliance led by Rahul Gandhi's Congress party was leading in over 200 seats, higher than expected.\n\nOnly about 10 percent - 15 percent of the total votes had been counted at the time, TV channels said.\n\nBJP alone accounted for nearly 250 of the seats in which the NDA was leading, compared to the 303 it won in 2019. Trends also showed Modi leading first, then trailing and leading again in his seat in the Hindu holy city of Varanasi.\n\nThe first votes counted were postal ballots, which are paper ballots, mostly cast by troops serving outside their home constituencies or officials away from home on election duty.\n\nThis year, postal votes were also offered to voters over 85 years of age and people with disabilities to allow them to vote from home.\n\nCounting is expected to last several hours as the large majority of votes polled in electronic voting machines or EVMs are taken up after the first 30 minutes of counting postal ballots.\n\n\"These are very early trends, we are going to see better results as the day progresses,\" Congress spokesperson Pawan Khera said.\n\nTV exit polls broadcast after voting ended on June 1 projected a big win for Modi, but exit polls have often got election outcomes wrong in India. Nearly one billion people were registered to vote, of which 642 million turned out.\n\nHowever, if Modi's victory is confirmed, his BJP will have triumphed in a vitriolic campaign in which parties accused each other of religious bias and of posing a threat to sections of the population.\n\nInvestors have already cheered the prospects of another Modi term, expecting it to deliver further years of strong economic growth and pro-business reforms, while a possible two-thirds majority in parliament could allow major changes to the constitution, rivals and critics fear.\n\n\"The next government's main task will be to set India on the path of getting rich before it ages,\" the Times of India newspaper said in an editorial on Tuesday, referring to the young, working age population in the world's most populous nation. \"The clock's ticking.\"\n\nNearly one billion people were eligible to vote in the seven-phase, seven-week poll that began on April 19 and held in searing summer heat with temperatures touching nearly 50- Celsius in some parts.\n\nMore than 66 percent of registered voters turned out, just one percentage point lower than the previous election in 2019, squashing pre-poll concerns that voters might shun a contest thought to be a foregone conclusion in Modi's favour.\n\nModi, 73, who first swept to power in 2014 by promising growth and change, was seeking to be only the second prime minister after India's independence leader Jawaharlal Nehru to win three straight terms.\n\nHe began his campaign by showcasing his record in office including economic growth, welfare policies, national pride, Hindu nationalism and his own personal commitment to fulfilling promises which he called \"Modi's Guarantee\".\n\nHowever, he changed tack after low voter turnout in the first phase and accused the opposition, especially the Congress party, which leads an alliance of two dozen groups, of favouring India's 200 million Muslims - a shift analysts said made the campaign coarse and divisive.\n\nThey said the pivot may have been aimed at firing up the Hindu nationalist base of Modi's BJP to draw them to vote. Modi defended himself against criticism that he was stoking divisions between Hindus and Muslims to win votes and said that he was only faulting the opposition campaign.\n\nThe opposition INDIA alliance denied it favoured Muslims in the Hindu-majority country and said Modi would destroy the constitution if he returned to power and end affirmative action enjoyed by the so-called backward castes.

His BJP has always had a majority on its own while still governing in a coalition.\n\nOver 10 years in power, Mr Modi's popularity has outstripped that of his party's, and turned a parliamentary election into one that increasingly resembled a presidential-style campaign.\n\nThe result is that the BJP relies more and more on Mr Modi's enduring brand to stay in power, with local politicians receding into the background even in state elections.\n\nThe country's democracy, his critics say, is faltering under his government, which has increasingly wielded strong-arm tactics to subdue political opponents, squeeze independent media and quash dissent.\n\nThe government has rejected such accusations and say democracy is flourishing.\n\nAnd economic discontent has simmered under Mr Modi. While stock markets reach record-highs and millionaires multiply, youth unemployment has soared, with only a small portion of Indians benefiting from the boom.", "source": {"uri": "expressandstar.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Express & Star"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Democratic_Alliance", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "National Democratic Alliance"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coalition_government", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Coalition government"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bharatiya_Janata_Party", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Bharatiya Janata Party"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Narendra_Modi", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Narendra Modi"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democracy", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Democracy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/India", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "India"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hindu_nationalism", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Hindu nationalism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indian_National_Congress", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Indian National Congress"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electoral_district", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Electoral district"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Landslide_victory", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Landslide victory"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_election", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "General election"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Congress", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States Congress"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mallikarjun_Kharge", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Mallikarjun Kharge"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exit_poll", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Exit poll"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ideology", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Ideology"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Independent_politician", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Independent politician"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carnegie_Endowment_for_International_Peace", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Carnegie Endowment for International Peace"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jawaharlal_Nehru", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Jawaharlal Nehru"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bombay_Stock_Exchange", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Bombay Stock Exchange"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Asia", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "South Asia"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prime_minister", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Prime minister"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unemployment", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Unemployment"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pound_sterling", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Pound sterling"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poverty", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Poverty"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stock_market", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Stock market"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Milan", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Milan"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Milan"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Italy"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lucknow", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Lucknow"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Lucknow"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics", "wgt": 17}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Socialism", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Socialism", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Campaigns_and_Elections", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Campaigns and Elections", "wgt": 16}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Government_Operations", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Government Operations", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Democracy", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Democracy", "wgt": 17}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 65}], "image": "https://www.expressandstar.com/resizer/HXpFAJWf3ZVkj5X7-h6bQjPFz28=/1200x900/cloudfront-us-east-1.images.arcpublishing.com/mna/4PMHAKFBXVAJTBYCXFA7TVZMAY.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9616128", "eventUri": "eng-9616128", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.2392156862745098, "wgt": 178, "relevance": 1}

The NIFTY and the BSE were both down over 2 percent.\n\nThe rupee also fell against the dollar and benchmark bond yields were up.\n\nThe markets had soared on Monday after exit polls on June 1 projected Modi and his Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) would register a big victory, with its National Democratic Alliance (NDA) seen getting a two-thirds majority and more.\n\nEarlier, TV channels showed the NDA was ahead in nearly 300 of the 543 elective seats in parliament, a simple majority, in early counting. The opposition INDIA alliance led by Rahul Gandhi's Congress party was leading in over 200 seats, higher than expected.\n\nOnly about 10 percent-15 percent of the total votes had been counted at the time, TV channels said.\n\nBJP alone accounted for nearly 250 of the seats in which the NDA was leading, compared to the 303 it won in 2019. Trends also showed Modi leading first, then trailing and leading again in his seat in the Hindu holy city of Varanasi.\n\nThe first votes counted were postal ballots, which are paper ballots, mostly cast by troops serving outside their home constituencies or officials away from home on election duty.\n\nThis year, postal votes were also offered to voters over 85 years of age and people with disabilities to allow them to vote from home.\n\nCounting is expected to last several hours as the large majority of votes polled in electronic voting machines or EVMs are taken up after the first 30 minutes of counting postal ballots.\n\n\"These are very early trends, we are going to see better results as the day progresses,\" Congress spokesperson Pawan Khera said.\n\nTV exit polls broadcast after voting ended on June 1 projected a big win for Modi, but exit polls have often got election outcomes wrong in India. Nearly one billion people were registered to vote, of which 642 million turned out.\n\nVitriolic campaign\n\nHowever, if Modi's victory is confirmed, his BJP will have triumphed in a vitriolic campaign in which parties accused each other of religious bias and of posing a threat to sections of the population.\n\nInvestors have already cheered the prospects of another Modi term, expecting it to deliver further years of strong economic growth and pro-business reforms, while a possible two-thirds majority in parliament could allow major changes to the constitution, rivals and critics fear.\n\n\"The next government's main task will be to set India on the path of getting rich before it ages,\" the Times of India newspaper said in an editorial on Tuesday, referring to the young, working age population in the world's most populous nation. \"The clock's ticking.\"\n\nNearly one billion people were eligible to vote in the seven-phase, seven-week poll that began on April 19 and held in searing summer heat with temperatures touching nearly 50\u00b0 Celsius in some parts.\n\nMore than 66 percent of registered voters turned out, just one percentage point lower than the previous election in 2019, squashing pre-poll concerns that voters might shun a contest thought to be a foregone conclusion in Modi's favor.\n\nModi, 73, who first swept to power in 2014 by promising growth and change, is seeking to be only the second prime minister after India's independence leader Jawaharlal Nehru to win three straight terms.\n\nHe began his campaign by showcasing his record in office including economic growth, welfare policies, national pride, Hindu nationalism and his own personal commitment to fulfilling promises which he called \"Modi's Guarantee\".\n\nHowever, he changed tack after low voter turnout in the first phase and accused the opposition, especially the Congress party, which leads an alliance of two dozen groups, of favoring India's 200 million Muslims - a shift analysts said made the campaign coarse and divisive.\n\nThey said the pivot may have been aimed at firing up the Hindu nationalist base of Modi's BJP to draw them to vote. Modi defended himself against criticism that he was stoking divisions between Hindus and Muslims to win votes and said that he was only faulting the opposition campaign.\n\nThe opposition INDIA alliance denied it favored Muslims in the Hindu-majority country and said Modi would destroy the constitution if he returned to power and end affirmative action enjoyed by the so-called backward castes.

The government has rejected such accusations and says democracy is flourishing.\n\nAs polls opened in mid-April, a confident BJP initially focused its campaign on \"Modi's guarantees\", highlighting the economic and welfare achievements his party says have reduced poverty.\n\nHis opposition, the India alliance led by the Congress party, has attacked Mr Modi over his Hindu nationalist politics.\n\nThe alliance hopes to benefit from the simmering economic discontent, and its campaign has rallied around issues of joblessness, inflation, and inequality.\n\nBut the broad alliance of more than a dozen political parties has been beset by ideological differences and defections, raising questions over its effectiveness.\n\nThe alliance has also claimed it has been unfairly targeted, pointing to a spree of raids, arrests and corruption investigations against its leaders by federal agencies it says are politically motivated. The government has denied this.\n\nAnother victory would cement Mr Modi as one of the country's most popular and important leaders. It would follow the BJP's thumping win in 2019, winning 303 out of 543 parliamentary seats. - AP", "source": {"uri": "irishtimes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Irish Times"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hindu_nationalism", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Hindu nationalism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exit_poll", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Exit poll"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bharatiya_Janata_Party", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Bharatiya Janata Party"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Narendra_Modi", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Narendra Modi"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/India", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "India"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democracy", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Democracy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rahul_Gandhi", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Rahul Gandhi"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jawaharlal_Nehru", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Jawaharlal Nehru"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indian_National_Congress", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Indian National Congress"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prime_minister", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Prime minister"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Referendum", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Referendum"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muslims", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Muslims"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Election_Commission_of_India", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Election Commission of India"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economy_of_India", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Economy of India"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hate_speech", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Hate speech"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voter_turnout", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Voter turnout"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unemployment", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Unemployment"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stock_market", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Stock market"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Independent_politician", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Independent politician"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Corruption", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Corruption"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Welfare", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Welfare"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economic_inequality", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Economic inequality"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Associated_Press", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Associated Press"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_government_of_the_United_States", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Federal government of the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inflation", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Inflation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poverty", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Poverty"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Political_party", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Political party"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics", "wgt": 19}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Campaigns_and_Elections", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Campaigns and Elections", "wgt": 23}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Democracy", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Democracy", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Online_Issues_Polls", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Online Issues Polls", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Humor", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Humor", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 99}], "image": "https://www.irishtimes.com/resizer/zlVEBHYDeuXqzS67wy_VJz92XvQ=/1200x630/filters:format(jpg):quality(70)/cloudfront-eu-central-1.images.arcpublishing.com/irishtimes/MGRUV5XV5V6VT5EKKP3GZ6RF5I.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9616128", "eventUri": "eng-9616128", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.2941176470588236, "wgt": 177, "relevance": 1}

Congress was leading in 94 constituencies.\n\nModi's National Democratic Alliance group was leading in 287 constituencies, while the opposition INDIA alliance, led by the Congress party and its main campaign leader, Rahul Gandhi was leading in 225.\n\nThe Election Commission does not release data on the percentage of votes tallied, but counting was to go on throughout the day and early figures were expected to change.\n\nExit polling from the weekend had projected the NDA to win more than 350 seats. Indian markets, which had hit an all-time high on Monday, were down sharply in midday trading Tuesday, with benchmark stock indices -- the NIFTY 50 and the BSE Sensex -- both down by more than 7 percent.\n\nSome 642 million people voted in the election, with an average 66 percent turnout across the seven phases, according to official data.\n\nExtreme heat struck India as voters went to the polls, with temperatures higher than 45 degrees Celsius (113 Fahrenheit) in some parts of the country. The chief election commissioner Rajiv Kumar said officials had learned a valuable lesson. \"We should have completed the election at least one month before,\" he said. \"We shouldn't have let it continue into so much heat.\"\n\nTemperatures were somewhat lower on Tuesday for the counting, but election officials and political parties still took precautions, hauling in large quantities of water and installing evaporative coolers for people outside the buildings where votes were being tallied and party headquarters.\n\nOn Tuesday, BJP workers outside the party's office in New Delhi performed a Hindu ritual shortly after the counting began. Meanwhile, supporters at the Congress party headquarters appeared upbeat and chanted slogans praising Gandhi, the party's campaign face.\n\nIn his 10 years in power, Modi has transformed India's political landscape. His popularity has outstripped that of his party's and has turned a parliamentary election into one that increasingly resembles a presidential-style campaign. The result is that the BJP relies more and more on Modi's enduring brand to stay in power, with local politicians receding into the background even in state elections.\n\n\"Modi was not just the prime campaigner, but the sole campaigner of this election,\" said Yamini Aiyar, a public policy scholar.\n\nHis supporters see him as a self-made, strong leader who has improved India's standing in the world, and credit his pro-business policies with making the economy the world's fifth-largest.\n\nBut a decade of his leadership has also left the country deeply divided. Modi's critics and opponents say his Hindu-first politics have bred intolerance, hate speech and brazen attacks against the country's minorities, especially Muslims, who comprise 14 percent of the population.\n\nIndia's economy, one of the fastest-growing, has become more unequal under Modi. While stock markets reach record highs and millionaires multiply, youth unemployment has soared, with only a small portion of Indians benefitting from the economic boom.\n\nThe country's democracy, Modi's critics say, is faltering under his government, which has increasingly wielded strong-arm tactics to subdue political opponents, squeeze independent media and quash dissent. The government has rejected such accusations and said democracy is flourishing.

He had hoped for a landslide victory.\n\nDespite the setback, many of the Hindu nationalist policies he has instituted over the last 10 years remain locked in place.\n\nIn the face of surprising numbers, the opposition claimed they had also won a victory of sorts, with the main opposition Congress party saying the election had been a \"moral and political loss\" for Modi.\n\nIn his 10 years in power, Mr Modi has transformed India's political landscape, bringing Hindu nationalism, once a fringe ideology in India, into the mainstream while leaving the country deeply divided.\n\nHis supporters see him as a self-made, strong leader who has improved India's standing in the world.\n\nHis critics and opponents say his Hindu-first politics have bred intolerance and the economy, the world's fifth-largest and one of the fastest-growing, has become more unequal.\n\nThe counting of more than 640 million votes cast over six weeks was expected to last into the night.\n\nSome 12 hours into counting, partial tallies reported by India's election commission showed Modi's BJP was ahead in 114 constituencies and had won 126 of 543 parliamentary seats. The Congress party led in 45 constituencies and had won 54.\n\nThe BJP-led National Democratic Alliance led in 147 constituencies and won 139, according to the partial count.

Reuters\n\nIndia's Prime Minister Narendra Modi is expected to win a record-equalling third consecutive term in office as the counting of 642 million votes in the world's largest election began on Tuesday.\n\nTV exit polls broadcast after voting ended on June 1 projected a big win for Modi, but exit polls have often got election outcomes wrong in India.\n\nHowever, if Modi's victory is confirmed, his Hindu nationalists will have triumphed in a vitriolic campaign in which parties accused each other of religious bias and of posing a threat to sections of the population.\n\nInvestors have already cheered the prospects of another Modi term, expecting it to deliver further years of strong economic growth and pro-business reforms, while a possible two-thirds majority in parliament could allow major changes to the constitution, rivals and critics fear.\n\n\"The next government's main task will be to set India on the path of getting rich before it ages,\" the Times of India newspaper said in an editorial on Tuesday, referring to the young, working-age population in the world's most populous nation. \"The clock's ticking.\"\n\nIndia stock futures edged higher and the rupee was steady before the count began at 8:00am (0230 GMT) on Tuesday. The NIFTY 50 index futures rose 0.21% in early trade, according to NSE International Exchange data, and was looking at another record high open.\n\nTV exit polls released on Saturday after voting ended projected the BJP-led National Democratic Alliance could win a two-thirds majority in the 543-member lower house of parliament.\n\nSeveral major polls projected the BJP alone could win more than the 303 it won in 2019.\n\nThe projections pushed Indian shares to lifetime highs on Monday while the rupee gained and bond yields dropped.\n\nNearly one billion people were eligible to vote in the seven-phase, seven-week poll which began on April 19 and held in searing summer heat with temperatures touching nearly 50\u00b0 Celsius (122\u00b0 Fahrenheit) in some parts.\n\nMore than 66% of registered voters turned out, just one percentage point lower than the previous election in 2019, squashing pre-poll concerns that voters might shun a contest thought to be a foregone conclusion in Modi's favour.\n\nModi, 73, who first swept to power in 2014 by promising growth and change, is seeking to be only the second prime minister after India's independence leader Jawaharlal Nehru to win three straight terms.\n\nHe began his campaign by showcasing his record in office including economic growth, welfare policies, national pride, Hindu nationalism and his own personal commitment to fulfilling promises which he called \"Modi's Guarantee\".\n\nHowever, he changed tack after low voter turnout in the first phase and accused the opposition, especially the Congress party which leads an alliance of two dozen groups, of favouring India's 200 million Muslims - a shift analysts said made the campaign coarse and divisive.\n\nThey said the pivot may have been aimed at firing up the Hindu nationalist base of Modi's Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) to draw them to vote. Modi defended himself against criticism that he was stoking divisions between Hindus and Muslims to win votes and said that he was only faulting the opposition campaign.\n\nThe opposition INDIA alliance, led by Rahul Gandhi's Congress party, denied it favoured Muslims in the Hindu-majority country and said Modi would destroy the constitution if he returned to power and end affirmative action enjoyed by the so-called backward castes. The BJP rejects this.\n\nThe opposition alliance also promised more welfare measures and handouts, with surveys saying unemployment, inflation and rural distress were the main concerns of voters.",

This is a historical feat in India's history.\" The NDA is the National Democratic Alliance, which is led by the BJP.\n\nHe assured people \"that we will continue the good work done in the last decade to keep fulfilling the aspirations of people.\" He displayed a victory sign at BJP headquarters Tuesday evening.\n\nHowever, in a massive setback to the Indian leader, who has ruled the country with a decisive mandate over the past decade, the BJP was not likely to secure a clear majority on its own. The party was winning or ahead with about 240 seats - well short of the 272 seats needed for a majority - in votes counted until Tuesday evening. That is significantly lower than the 303 it won in 2019.\n\nAnalysts say the BJP's weaker-than-expected performance showed Modi's charisma has waned. The Indian leader, who critics call polarizing and divisive, ran a presidential-style campaign, with the party depending heavily on him to pull in votes. But he will now have to depend on his allies to form the next government.\n\nPolitical analyst Nilanjan Mukhopadhyay said, \"Modi has never worked with coalition partners in the past and has always been a leader with his own mind. But without a clear majority for his own party, he will have to be a much more subdued prime minister and work with his allies.\"\n\nWhile Modi may not have won the landslide mandate his party expected and exit polls forecast, he will be only the second prime minister in India - after the country's first, Jawaharlal Nehru - to win a third term in office.\n\nModi, who is seen as a strong leader, has built his popularity on a raft of welfare programs and a strident brand of Hindu nationalism in the majority-Hindu country. But analysts say rising unemployment, especially among young people, and high inflation in a country where millions are still poor, cut into his support.\n\n\"I did not see any wave for Modi on the ground,\" said political analyst Neerja Chowdhury. \"Also, the opposition fought well. This time, they did not give up. There was a spiritedness in their campaign.\"\n\nSupporters greet Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi as he arrives at Bharatiya Janata Party headquarters in New Delhi on June 4, 2024.\n\nThe BJP suffered its biggest losses in Uttar Pradesh, a populous, politically crucial state where vote counting showed the party trailing in about half the 80 parliamentary seats. The most significant defeat the party suffered was in Faizabad, a constituency where in January Modi inaugurated a huge temple in honor of Hindu god Rama. Hailed by many Hindus, it was expected to boost Modi's support.\n\nAn opposition alliance of about two dozen parties led by the Congress Party mounted a united challenge to the BJP and got a huge boost. The alliance, which ran on a platform of reducing wealth inequality and upholding democratic institutions, was heading for victory in around 220 seats - nearly double its present tally of 119 in parliament.\n\nThe opposition emphasized joblessness and accused Modi of undermining the secular fabric of the country, targeting his political opponents and being intolerant of dissent.\n\n\"It shows that India has become a much more competitive democracy. It also shows that people reacted against a slide into a kind of authoritarian regime,\" Mukhopadhyay said.\n\nThe results were also good news for the Congress Party, once India's dominant party, which suffered crushing defeats in two previous elections. It is on course to nearly double its numbers to about 100 seats, which analysts say could revive the party.\n\nThe Congress Party called the election a win for democracy and a mandate against Modi.\n\n\"Our fight was not against a political party but a fight to save the constitution,\" party leader Rahul Gandhi said.\n\n\"The country has unanimously and clearly stated that we do not want Narendra Modi and [Minister of Home Affairs] Amit Shah to be involved in running the country,\" Gandhi said.\n\nOther opposition leaders said Modi lost his credibility.\n\nSome positive news for BJP\n\nAlthough the BJP lost ground, there was some good news for the party. It was on course to win in the eastern Odisha state, formerly Orissa, and was also performing well in some southern states. The victories will help the BJP build its credentials as a pan-Indian party - for decades, it drew its maximum support from populous states of the north and west where its Hindu nationalist agenda struck a chord.\n\nOn the streets, reactions were mixed. In the business hub of Gurugram, young people who see Modi as a strong leader who has improved India's economy say they will be happy to see him lead the country for a third term.\n\n\"Since Modi has come, there has been good development in the country. He is supportive of the young generation,\" said Varun Singh, an undergraduate student.\n\nOthers welcomed the election results for a different reason.\n\n\"It is good that we will have a strong opposition because it is good for democracy to have checks and balances,\" said New Delhi resident Purnima Mehta.\n\nIndia's stock markets dropped 5.74% as news that the elections had failed to deliver a clear mandate to the BJP, seen as a business-friendly party that planned to bring in more reforms.\n\nSome 642 million people, making up about 66% of registered voters, cast ballots in the world's biggest election that stretched over six weeks in searing heat.", "source": {"uri": "nigeriasun.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Nigeria Sun"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

He had hoped for a landslide victory.\n\nDespite the setback, many of the Hindu nationalist policies he has instituted over the last 10 years remain locked in place.\n\nIn the face of surprising numbers, the opposition claimed they had also won a victory of sorts, with the main opposition Congress party saying the election had been a \"moral and political loss\" for Modi.\n\n\"This is public's victory and a win for democracy,\" Congress party president Mallikarjun Kharge told reporters.\n\nIn his 10 years in power, Mr Modi has transformed India's political landscape, bringing Hindu nationalism, once a fringe ideology in India, into the mainstream while leaving the country deeply divided.\n\nHis supporters see him as a self-made, strong leader who has improved India's standing in the world.\n\nHis critics and opponents say his Hindu-first politics have bred intolerance and the economy, the world's fifth-largest and one of the fastest-growing, has become more unequal.\n\nThe counting of more than 640 million votes cast over six weeks was expected to last into the night.\n\nSome 12 hours into counting, partial tallies reported by India's election commission showed Modi's BJP was ahead in 114 constituencies and had won 126 of 543 parliamentary seats. The Congress party led in 45 constituencies and had won 54.\n\nA total of 272 seats are needed for a majority. In 2019, the BJP won 303 seats, while they secured 282 in 2014 when Mr Modi first came to power.\n\nThe BJP-led National Democratic Alliance led in 147 constituencies and won 139, according to the partial count. The Congress party is part of the India alliance, which led in 131 constituencies and had won 99.\n\nThe election commission does not release data on the percentage of votes tallied.\n\nExit polling from the weekend had projected the NDA to win more than 350 seats.\n\nIndian markets, which had hit an all-time high on Monday, closed sharply down Tuesday, with benchmark stock indices, the Nifty 50 and the BSE Sensex, both down by more than 5%.\n\nFor Payal, a resident of the northern city of Lucknow who uses only one name, the election was about the economy and India's vast number of people living in poverty.\n\n\"People are suffering, there are no jobs, people are in such a state that their kids are compelled to make and sell tea on the roadside,\" Payal said.\n\n\"This is a big deal for us. If we don't wake up now, when will we?\"\n\nIf Mr Modi wins, it would only be the second time an Indian leader has retained power for a third term, after Jawaharlal Nehru, the country's first prime minister.\n\nBut if his BJP is forced to form a coalition, the party would likely \"be heavily dependent on the goodwill of its allies, which makes them critical players who we can expect will extract their pound of flesh, both in terms of policymaking as well as government formation\", said Milan Vaishnav, director of the South Asia Program,e at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace.\n\n\"This would be truly, you know, uncharted territory, both for Indians as well as for the prime minister,\" he added.\n\nBefore Mr Modi came to power, India had coalition governments for 30 years. His BJP has always had a majority on its own while still governing in a coalition.\n\nOver 10 years in power, Mr Modi's popularity has outstripped that of his party's, and turned a parliamentary election into one that increasingly resembled a presidential-style campaign.\n\nThe result is that the BJP relies more and more on Mr Modi's enduring brand to stay in power, with local politicians receding into the background even in state elections.\n\nThe country's democracy, his critics say, is faltering under his government, which has increasingly wielded strong-arm tactics to subdue political opponents, squeeze independent media and quash dissent.\n\nThe government has rejected such accusations and say democracy is flourishing.\n\nAnd economic discontent has simmered under Mr Modi.

Early trends cause market declines, with significant drops in NIFTY 50 and S&P BSE Sensex. The election, marked by a vitriolic campaign, sees BJP's leading, but results are still unfolding.\n\nIndian Prime Minister Narendra Modi's alliance raced to a majority in early vote counting trends in the general election on Tuesday, but the numbers were well short of the landslide predicted in exit polls, TV channels showed.\n\nThe early see-saw trends unnerved markets with stocks falling steeply. The NIFTY 50 and the S&P BSE Sensex were both down over 2% at 0500 GMT. The rupee also fell against the dollar and benchmark bond yields were up.\n\nThe markets had soared on Monday after exit polls on June 1 projected Modi and his Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) would register a big victory, with its National Democratic Alliance (NDA) seen getting a two-thirds majority and more. At 0430 GMT, TV channels showed the NDA was ahead in nearly 300 of the 543 elective seats in parliament, a simple majority, in early counting. The opposition INDIA alliance led by Rahul Gandhi's Congress party was leading in over 200 seats, higher than expected.\n\nOnly about 10%-15% of the total votes had been counted at the time, TV channels said. BJP alone accounted for nearly 250 of the seats in which the NDA was leading, compared to the 303 it won in 2019. Trends also showed Modi leading first, then trailing and leading again in his seat in the Hindu holy city of Varanasi.\n\nThe first votes counted were postal ballots, which are paper ballots, mostly cast by troops serving outside their home constituencies or officials away from home on election duty. This year, postal votes were also offered to voters over 85 years of age and people with disabilities to allow them to vote from home.\n\nCounting is expected to last several hours as the large majority of votes polled in electronic voting machines or EVMs are taken up after the first 30 minutes of counting postal ballots. \"These are very early trends, we are going to see better results as the day progresses,\" Congress spokesperson Pawan Khera said.\n\nTV exit polls broadcast after voting ended on June 1 projected a big win for Modi, but exit polls have often got election outcomes wrong in India. Nearly one billion people were registered to vote, of which 642 million turned out. VITRIOLIC CAMPAIGN\n\nHowever, if Modi's victory is confirmed, his BJP will have triumphed in a vitriolic campaign in which parties accused each other of religious bias and of posing a threat to sections of the population. Investors have already cheered the prospects of another Modi term, expecting it to deliver further years of strong economic growth and pro-business reforms, while a possible two-thirds majority in parliament could allow major changes to the constitution, rivals and critics fear.\n\n\"The next government's main task will be to set India on the path of getting rich before it ages,\" the Times of India newspaper said in an editorial on Tuesday, referring to the young, working age population in the world's most populous nation. \"The clock's ticking.\" Nearly one billion people were eligible to vote in the seven-phase, seven-week poll that began on April 19 and held in searing summer heat with temperatures touching nearly 50\u00b0 Celsius (122\u00b0 Fahrenheit) in some parts.\n\nMore than 66% of registered voters turned out, just one percentage point lower than the previous election in 2019, squashing pre-poll concerns that voters might shun a contest thought to be a foregone conclusion in Modi's favour. Modi, 73, who first swept to power in 2014 by promising growth and change, is seeking to be only the second prime minister after India's independence leader Jawaharlal Nehru to win three straight terms.\n\nHe began his campaign by showcasing his record in office including economic growth, welfare policies, national pride, Hindu nationalism and his own personal commitment to fulfilling promises which he called \"Modi's Guarantee\". However, he changed tack after low voter turnout in the first phase and accused the opposition, especially the Congress party, which leads an alliance of two dozen groups, of favouring India's 200 million Muslims - a shift analysts said made the campaign coarse and divisive.\n\nThey said the pivot may have been aimed at firing up the Hindu nationalist base of Modi's BJP to draw them to vote. Modi defended himself against criticism that he was stoking divisions between Hindus and Muslims to win votes and said that he was only faulting the opposition campaign. The opposition INDIA alliance denied it favoured Muslims in the Hindu-majority country and said Modi would destroy the constitution if he returned to power and end affirmative action enjoyed by the so-called backward castes. The BJP rejects this.\n\n(This story has not been edited by Devdiscourse staff and is auto-generated from a syndicated feed.)", "source": {"uri": "devdiscourse.com", "dataType": "news", "title":

The participation rate was around 66% on average across the seven phases, according to official data.\n\nThe counting of votes at counting centers in each of the 543 constituencies where voting took place could extend into the evening before the final result is declared by the Election Commission of India.\n\nBut leads will start to emerge sooner, which will give an idea of where the results could go.\n\nExtreme heat hit India as voters went to the polls, with temperatures exceeding 45 degrees Celsius (113 Fahrenheit) in some parts of the country. Chief Election Commissioner Rajiv Kumar said officials had learned a valuable lesson. We should have finished the elections at least a month earlier, he said. We shouldn't have let this continue in this much heat.\n\nOn Tuesday, BJP workers outside the party office in New Delhi performed a Hindu ritual soon after the counting began. Meanwhile, supporters at the Congress party headquarters appeared upbeat and chanted slogans praising Gandhi, the party's campaign face.\n\nIn 10 years in power, Modi has transformed Indian political landscape. His popularity has surpassed that of his party and transformed a parliamentary election into a campaign that increasingly resembles a presidential-style campaign. The result is that the BJP is increasingly relying on Modi's enduring brand to stay in power, with local politicians taking a back seat even in national elections.\n\nModi was not just the main campaigner, but the only candidate in this election, said public policy expert Yamini Aiyar.\n\nHis supporters see him as a strong, self-made leader who improved India's standing in the world and credit his business-friendly policies with making the economy the world's fifth-largest.\n\nBut a decade under his leadership has also left the country deeply divided. Critics and opponents of Modis say his Hindu politics first have spawned intolerance, hate speech and brazen attacks against the country's minorities, particularly Muslims, who make up 14% of the population.\n\nThe Indian economy, one of the most dynamic, has become even more unequal under Modi. As stock markets reach record highs and millionaires multiply, youth unemployment has soared, with only a small part of the Indians benefiting from the economic boom.\n\nModis' critics say the country's democracy is faltering under his government, which has increasingly resorted to heavy-handed tactics to subdue political opponents, stifle independent media and suppress dissent. The government has rejected these accusations and says democracy is flourishing.\n\nAs the elections opened in mid-April, an initially confident BJP focused his campaign on Modis' guarantees, highlighting the economic and social achievements that his party says have reduced poverty. With him at the helm, India will become a developed nation by 2047, Modi has repeated in rally after rally.\n\nBut the campaign became increasingly bitter as Modi stepped up his polarizing rhetoric targeting the government.

He hopes to take advantage of latent economic discontent and his campaign has focused on the issues of unemployment, inflation and inequality.\n\nBut the broad alliance of more than a dozen political parties has been plagued by ideological differences and defections, raising questions about its effectiveness. At the same time, the alliance also claimed to have been unfairly targeted, highlighting a series of raids, arrests and corruption investigations against their leaders by federal agencies that they say are politically motivated.

Initial trends caused market instability, with stock indexes and the rupee falling. Postal ballots accounted for early results, with further counting expected to last hours.\n\nIndian Prime Minister Narendra Modi's alliance raced to a majority in early vote counting trends in the general election on Tuesday, but the numbers were well short of the landslide predicted in exit polls, TV channels showed.\n\nThe early see-saw trends unnerved markets with stocks falling steeply. The NIFTY 50 and the S&P BSE Sensex were both down 2.1% at 0434 GMT. The rupee also fell against the dollar and benchmark bond yields were up.\n\nThe markets had soared on Monday after exit polls on June 1 projected Modi and his Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) would register a big victory, with its National Democratic Alliance (NDA) seen getting a two-thirds majority and more. At 0430 GMT, TV channels showed the NDA was ahead in nearly 300 of the 543 elective seats in parliament, a simple majority, in early counting. The opposition INDIA alliance led by Rahul Gandhi's Congress party was leading in over 200 seats, higher than expected.\n\nOnly about 10%-15% of the total votes had been counted at the time, TV channels said. BJP alone accounted for nearly 250 of the seats in which the NDA was leading, compared to the 303 it won in 2019. Trends also showed Modi leading first, then trailing and leading again in his seat in the Hindu holy city of Varanasi.\n\nThe first votes counted were postal ballots, which are paper ballots, mostly cast by troops serving outside their home constituencies or officials away from home on election duty. This year, postal votes were also offered to voters over 85 years of age and people with disabilities to allow them to vote from home.\n\nCounting is expected to last several hours as the large majority of votes polled in electronic voting machines or EVMs are taken up after the first 30 minutes of counting postal ballots. \"These are very early trends, we are going to see better results as the day progresses,\" Congress spokesperson Pawan Khera said.\n\nTV exit polls broadcast after voting ended on June 1 projected a big win for Modi, but exit polls have often got election outcomes wrong in India. Nearly one billion people were registered to vote, of which 642 million turned out. VITRIOLIC CAMPAIGN\n\nHowever, if Modi's victory is confirmed, his BJP will have triumphed in a vitriolic campaign in which parties accused each other of religious bias and of posing a threat to sections of the population. Investors have already cheered the prospects of another Modi term, expecting it to deliver further years of strong economic growth and pro-business reforms, while a possible two-thirds majority in parliament could allow major changes to the constitution, rivals and critics fear.\n\n\"The next government's main task will be to set India on the path of getting rich before it ages,\" the Times of India newspaper said in an editorial on Tuesday, referring to the young, working age population in the world's most populous nation. \"The clock's ticking.\" The exit polls projected the BJP-led National Democratic Alliance could win a two-thirds majority in the Lok Sabha, the lower house of parliament, which would help it usher in far-reaching amendments in the constitution.\n\nMarkets cheered the projections, since it promised the continuation of the growth-focused economic policies of the ruling alliance. Nearly one billion people were eligible to vote in the seven-phase, seven-week poll that began on April 19 and held in searing summer heat with temperatures touching nearly 50\u00b0 Celsius (122\u00b0 Fahrenheit) in some parts.\n\nMore than 66% of registered voters turned out, just one percentage point lower than the previous election in 2019, squashing pre-poll concerns that voters might shun a contest thought to be a foregone conclusion in Modi's favour. Modi, 73, who first swept to power in 2014 by promising growth and change, is seeking to be only the second prime minister after India's independence leader Jawaharlal Nehru to win three straight terms.\n\nHe began his campaign by showcasing his record in office including economic growth, welfare policies, national pride, Hindu nationalism and his own personal commitment to fulfilling promises which he called \"Modi's Guarantee\". However, he changed tack after low voter turnout in the first phase and accused the opposition, especially the Congress party, which leads an alliance of two dozen groups, of favouring India's 200 million Muslims - a shift analysts said made the campaign coarse and divisive.\n\nThey said the pivot may have been aimed at firing up the Hindu nationalist base of Modi's BJP to draw them to vote. Modi defended himself against criticism that he was stoking divisions between Hindus and Muslims to win votes and said that he was only faulting the opposition campaign. The opposition INDIA alliance denied it favoured Muslims in the Hindu-majority country and said Modi would destroy the constitution if he returned to power and end affirmative action enjoyed by the so-called backward castes. The BJP rejects this.\n\n(This story has not been edited by Devdiscourse staff and is auto-generated from a syndicated feed.)", "source": {"uri": "devdiscourse.com", "dataType": "news", "title":

India's marathon election enters its final phase on Tuesday with the counting of more than 640 million votes in the world\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s largest democratic exercise, which was widely expected to return Prime Minister Narendra Modi to a third term after a decade in power. (AP Photo/Rafiq Maqbool)NEW DELHI (AP) - India's marathon election enters its final phase on Tuesday with the counting of more than 640 million votes in the world's largest democratic exercise, which was widely expected to return Prime Minister Narendra Modi to a third term after a decade in power. The 6-week-long election was seen as a referendum on Modi. If the 73-year-old wins, it will only be the second time an Indian leader has retained power for a third term after Jawaharlal Nehru, the country's first prime minister. Exit polls on Saturday by major television channels projected a comfortable win for Modi's Hindu nationalist Bharatiya Janata Party and its allies over a broad opposition alliance led by the Congress party and its main campaign leader, Rahul Gandhi. Indian television channels have had a mixed record in the past in predicting election results. Nearly 970 million people, more than 10% of the world's population, were eligible to vote. Turnout averaged 66% across the seven phases, according to official data. The tallying of votes at counting centers in each of the 543 constituencies where polls were held could stretch into the evening before a final result is declared by the Election Commission of India. But leads will emerge earlier and indicate where the results may be headed. In his 10 years in power, Modi has transformed India's political landscape. His popularity has outstripped that of his party's, and has turned a parliamentary election into one that increasingly resembles a presidential-style campaign. The result is that the BJP relies more and more on Modi's enduring brand to stay in power, with local politicians receding into the background even in state elections. \"Modi was not just the prime campaigner, but the sole campaigner of this election,\"\u009d said Yamini Aiyar, a public policy scholar. His supporters see him as a self-made, strong leader who has improved India's standing in the world, and credit his pro-business policies with making the economy the world's fifth-largest. But a decade of his leadership has also left the country deeply divided. Modi's critics and opponents say his Hindu-first politics have bred intolerance, hate speech and brazen attacks against the country's minorities, especially Muslims, who comprise 14% of the population. India's economy, one of the fastest-growing, has become more unequal under Modi. While stock markets reach record-highs and millionaires multiply, youth unemployment has soared, with only a small portion of Indians benefitting from the economic boom. The country's democracy, Modi's critics say, is faltering under his government, which has increasingly wielded strong-arm tactics to subdue political opponents, squeeze independent media and quash dissent. The government has rejected such accusations and say democracy is flourishing. As polls opened in mid-April, a confident BJP initially focused its campaign on \"Modi's guarantees,\"\u009d highlighting the economic and welfare achievements that his party says have reduced poverty. With him at the helm, \"India will become a developed nation by 2047,\"\u009d Modi repeated in rally after rally. But the campaign turned increasingly shrill, as Modi ramped up polarizing rhetoric that targeted the Muslim minority, a tactic seen to energize his core Hindu majority voters. His opposition, the INDIA alliance led by the Congress party, has attacked Modi over his Hindu nationalist politics. It hopes to benefit from the simmering economic discontent, and its campaign has rallied around issues of joblessness, inflation and inequality. But the broad alliance of over a dozen political parties has been beset by ideological differences and defections, raising questions over their effectiveness. Meanwhile, the alliance has also claimed they've been unfairly targeted, pointing to a spree of raids, arrests and corruption investigations against their leaders by federal agencies they say are politically motivated.

Modi will need support from other coalition parties for his third five-year term in office. This result is a setback for the 73-year-old, who had hoped for a landslide victory. However, many of the Hindu nationalist policies he implemented over the past decade remain intact.\n\nModi vowed to fulfill his election promises, including advancing India's economy from the world's fifth to the third largest, boosting defense production, creating jobs for youth, raising exports, and supporting farmers. \"This country will see a new chapter of big decisions. This is Modi's guarantee,\" he said.\n\nThe opposition also claimed a sort of victory, with the Congress party calling the election a \"moral and political loss\" for Modi. \"This is the public's victory and a win for democracy,\" said Congress party President Mallikarjun Kharge.\n\nDuring his 10 years in power, Modi has transformed India's political landscape by bringing Hindu nationalism into the mainstream, leaving the country deeply divided. His supporters view him as a strong, self-made leader who has improved India's global standing. Critics argue that his Hindu-first politics have fostered intolerance, and while the economy has grown, it has also become more unequal.\n\nThe counting of over 640 million votes cast over six weeks was expected to continue into the night. After 12 hours of counting, partial tallies from India's Election Commission showed Modi's BJP ahead in 114 constituencies and winning 126 out of 543 parliamentary seats. The Congress party led in 45 constituencies and won 54 seats.\n\nA total of 272 seats are needed for a majority. In 2019, the BJP won 303 seats and 282 in 2014.

Investors are optimistic about sustained economic growth under another Modi term, despite some market nervousness. The opposition has accused the BJP of divisive tactics, while the BJP denies these allegations.\n\nIndian Prime Minister Narendra Modi's Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP)-led alliance raced to a clear majority in the 543-member lower house of parliament in early vote-counting trends on Tuesday, TV channels showed.\n\nThe channels showed the ruling National Democratic Alliance (NDA) was ahead in more than 300 seats, with BJP alone ahead in 255. The opposition INDIA alliance led by Rahul Gandhi's Congress party was ahead in 172 seats, with Congress alone ahead in 71. Based on the early trends, the Republic TV channel called the vote in favour of Modi, the first to do so.\n\nThe first votes counted are postal ballots, which are paper ballots, mostly cast by troops serving outside their home constituencies or officials away from home on election duty. This year, postal votes were also offered to voters over 85 years of age and people with disabilities to allow them to vote from home.\n\nCounting is expected to last several hours as the large majority of votes polled in electronic voting machines or EVMs are taken up after the first 30 minutes of counting postal ballots. \"These are very early trends, we are going to see better results as the day progresses,\" Congress spokesperson Pawan Khera said.\n\nTV exit polls broadcast after voting ended on June 1 projected a big win for Modi, but exit polls have often got election outcomes wrong in India. Nearly one billion people were registered to vote, of which 642 million turned out. However, if Modi's victory is confirmed, his BJP will have triumphed in a vitriolic campaign in which parties accused each other of religious bias and of posing a threat to sections of the population.\n\nInvestors have already cheered the prospects of another Modi term, expecting it to deliver further years of strong economic growth and pro-business reforms, while a possible two-thirds majority in parliament could allow major changes to the constitution, rivals and critics fear. \"The next government's main task will be to set India on the path of getting rich before it ages,\" the Times of India newspaper said in an editorial on Tuesday, referring to the young, working age population in the world's most populous nation. \"The clock's ticking.\"\n\nMARKETS CHEER India stocks fell at the open after Monday's sharp surge as traders said there was some nervousness on the margin of victory.\n\nThe NIFTY 50 was down 2.2% at 0345 GMT and the S&P BSE Sensex was down 1.8%. TV exit polls released on Saturday after voting ended projected the BJP-led National Democratic Alliance could win a two-thirds majority in the 543-member lower house of parliament.\n\nSeveral major polls projected the BJP alone could win more than the 303 it won in 2019. The projections pushed Indian shares to lifetime highs on Monday while the rupee gained and bond yields dropped.\n\nNearly one billion people were eligible to vote in the seven-phase, seven-week poll which began on April 19 and held in searing summer heat with temperatures touching nearly 50\u00b0 Celsius (122\u00b0 Fahrenheit) in some parts. More than 66% of registered voters turned out, just one percentage point lower than the previous election in 2019, squashing pre-poll concerns that voters might shun a contest thought to be a foregone conclusion in Modi's favour.\n\nModi, 73, who first swept to power in 2014 by promising growth and change, is seeking to be only the second prime minister after India's independence leader Jawaharlal Nehru to win three straight terms. He began his campaign by showcasing his record in office including economic growth, welfare policies, national pride, Hindu nationalism and his own personal commitment to fulfilling promises which he called \"Modi's Guarantee\".\n\nHowever, he changed tack after low voter turnout in the first phase and accused the opposition, especially the Congress party which leads an alliance of two dozen groups, of favouring India's 200 million Muslims - a shift analysts said made the campaign coarse and divisive. They said the pivot may have been aimed at firing up the Hindu nationalist base of Modi's Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) to draw them to vote. Modi defended himself against criticism that he was stoking divisions between Hindus and Muslims to win votes and said that he was only faulting the opposition campaign.\n\nThe opposition INDIA alliance, led by Rahul Gandhi's Congress party, denied it favoured Muslims in the Hindu-majority country and said Modi would destroy the constitution if he returned to power and end affirmative action enjoyed by the so-called backward castes. The BJP rejects this.\n\n(This story has not been edited by Devdiscourse staff and is auto-generated from a syndicated feed.)", "source": {"uri": "devdiscourse.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Devdiscourse"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indian_National_Congress", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Indian National Congress"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bharatiya_Janata_Party", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Bharatiya Janata Party"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Narendra_Modi", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Narendra Modi"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exit_poll", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Exit poll"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parliament", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Parliament"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economic_growth", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Economic growth"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/India", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "India"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Democratic_Alliance", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "National Democratic Alliance"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Postal_voting", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Postal voting"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supermajority", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Supermajority"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disability", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Disability"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ballot", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Ballot"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lower_house", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Lower house"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electoral_district", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Electoral district"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republic_TV", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Republic TV"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Times_of_India", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "The Times of India"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rahul_Gandhi", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Rahul Gandhi"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bombay_Stock_Exchange", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Bombay Stock Exchange"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Market_economy", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Market economy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electronic_voting", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Electronic voting"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constitution", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Constitution"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hindus", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Hindus"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muslims", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Muslims"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hindu_nationalism", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Hindu nationalism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Affirmative_action", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Affirmative action"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jawaharlal_Nehru", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Jawaharlal Nehru"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Percentage_point", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Percentage point"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Other_Backward_Class", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Other Backward Class"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Campaigns_and_Elections", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Campaigns and Elections", "wgt": 26}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Activism/Strategies", "label": "dmoz/Society/Activism/Strategies", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Online_Issues_Polls", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Online Issues Polls", "wgt": 16}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Alternative_Political_Systems", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Alternative Political Systems", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 50}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 50}], "image": "https://www.devdiscourse.com/remote.axd?https://devdiscourse.blob.core.windows.net/devnews/03_06_2024_09_51_06_7983832.jpg?width=920&format=jpeg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9616128", "eventUri": "eng-9616128", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-06-01", "textStart": 1608, "textEnd": 1614}, {"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-04-19", "textStart": 3246, "textEnd": 3254}], "sentiment": 0.1764705882352942, "wgt": 170, "relevance": 1}

Since then, he has fused religion with politics in a formula that has attracted wide support from the country's majority Hindu population.\n\nIndia under Modi is a rising global power, but his rule has also been marked by rising unemployment, attacks by Hindu nationalists against minorities, particularly Muslims, and a shrinking space for dissent and free media.\n\nThe final day of voting in the 6-week-long election was Saturday. The vote counting will start Tuesday and will be updated throughout the day. The election results will likely be known the same day.\n\nThe voters are choosing 543 members for the lower house of Parliament for a five-year term.\n\nPeople stand in queues to cast their votes at a polling station during the last round of a six-week-long national election in Varanasi, India, Saturday, June 1, 2024. (AP Photo/Rajesh Kumar Singh)\n\nVotes were cast at more than a million polling stations. Each of the seven voting phases lasted a single day with several constituencies across multiple states voting that day. The staggered polling allowed the government to transport election officials and voting machines and deploy tens of thousands of troops to prevent violence. Candidates crisscrossed the country, poll workers hiked to remote villages, and voters lined up for hours in sweltering heat.\n\nIndia has a first-past-the-post multiparty electoral system in which the candidate who receives the most votes wins. To secure a majority, a party or coalition must breach the mark of 272 seats.\n\nIndia uses electronic voting machines.\n\nModi\u00b4s Bharatiya Janata Party and his main challenger, Rahul Gandhi of the Indian National Congress, represent Parliament\u00b4s two largest factions. Several other important regional parties are part of an opposition bloc.\n\nOpposition parties, which previously were fractured, have united under a front called INDIA, or Indian National Developmental Inclusive Alliance, to deny Modi a a third straight election victory.\n\nThe alliance has fielded a single main candidate in most constituencies. But it has been roiled by ideological differences and personality clashes, and has not yet decided on its candidate for prime minister.\n\nMost exit polls project Modi is set to extend his decade in power with a third consecutive term, especially after he opened a Hindu temple in northern Ayodhya city in January, which fulfilled his party\u00b4s long-held Hindu nationalist pledge. During the polls Modi escalated polarizing rhetoric in incendiary speeches that targeted the country\u00b4s Muslim minority.\n\nAnother victory would cement Modi as one of the country's most popular and important leaders. It would follow a thumping win in 2019, when the BJP clinched an absolute majority by sweeping 303 parliamentary seats. The Congress party managed only 52 seats.\n\nFor decades, India has clung doggedly to its democratic convictions, largely due to free elections, an independent judiciary, a thriving media, strong opposition and peaceful transition of power. Some of these credentials have eroded under Modi\u00b4s 10-year rule, with the polls seen as a test for the country\u00b4s democratic values.\n\nMany watchdogs have now categorized India as a \"hybrid regime\" that is neither a full democracy nor a full autocracy.\n\nThe poll results will also test Modi's limits. Critics accuse him of running on a Hindu-first platform, endangering the country's secular roots.\n\nUnder Modi, the media, once viewed as vibrant and largely independent, have become more pliant and critical voices muzzled.Courts have largely bent to Modi\u00b4s will and given favorable verdicts in crucial cases. Centralization of executive power has strained India\u00b4s federalism. And federal agencies have bogged down top opposition leaders in corruption cases, which they deny.\n\nAnother key issue is India's large economy, which is among the fastest growing in the world. It has helped India emerge as a global power and a counterweight to China. But even as India's growth soars by some measures, the Modi government has struggled to generate enough jobs for young Indians, and instead has relied on welfare programs like free food and housing to woo voters.\n\nA polling official marks the index finger of a voter with indelible ink inside a polling booth during the seventh and final phase of the general elections, in Varanasi , India, Saturday, June 1, 2024.

While exit polls predict a strong win for Modi's party, the campaign saw accusations of religious bias. Investors are optimistic, anticipating continued reforms and economic growth. Modi aims to set India on a prosperous path.\n\nIndia's Prime Minister Narendra Modi is expected to win a record-equalling third consecutive term in office as the counting of 642 million votes in the world's largest election began on Tuesday. TV exit polls broadcast after voting ended on June 1 projected a big win for Modi, but exit polls have often got election outcomes wrong in India.\n\nHowever, if Modi's victory is confirmed, his Hindu nationalists will have triumphed in a vitriolic campaign in which parties accused each other of religious bias and of posing a threat to sections of the population. Investors have already cheered the prospects of another Modi term, expecting it to deliver further years of strong economic growth and pro-business reforms, while a possible two-thirds majority in parliament could allow major changes to the constitution, rivals and critics fear.\n\n\"The next government's main task will be to set India on the path of getting rich before it ages,\" the Times of India newspaper said in an editorial on Tuesday, referring to the young, working age population in the world's most populous nation. \"The clock's ticking.\" India stock futures edged higher and the rupee was steady before the count began at 8:00 a.m. (0230 GMT) on Tuesday. The NIFTY 50 index futures rose 0.21% in early trade, according to NSE International Exchange data, and was looking at another record high open.\n\nTV exit polls released on Saturday after voting ended projected the BJP-led National Democratic Alliance could win a two-thirds majority in the 543-member lower house of parliament. Several major polls projected the BJP alone could win more than the 303 it won in 2019.\n\nThe projections pushed Indian shares to lifetime highs on Monday while the rupee gained and bond yields dropped. Nearly one billion people were eligible to vote in the seven-phase, seven-week poll which began on April 19 and held in searing summer heat with temperatures touching nearly 50\u00b0 Celsius (122\u00b0 Fahrenheit) in some parts.\n\nMore than 66% of registered voters turned out, just one percentage point lower than the previous election in 2019, squashing pre-poll concerns that voters might shun a contest thought to be a foregone conclusion in Modi's favour. Modi, 73, who first swept to power in 2014 by promising growth and change, is seeking to be only the second prime minister after India's independence leader Jawaharlal Nehru to win three straight terms.\n\nHe began his campaign by showcasing his record in office including economic growth, welfare policies, national pride, Hindu nationalism and his own personal commitment to fulfilling promises which he called \"Modi's Guarantee\". However, he changed tack after low voter turnout in the first phase and accused the opposition, especially the Congress party which leads an alliance of two dozen groups, of favouring India's 200 million Muslims - a shift analysts said made the campaign coarse and divisive.\n\nThey said the pivot may have been aimed at firing up the Hindu nationalist base of Modi's Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) to draw them to vote. Modi defended himself against criticism that he was stoking divisions between Hindus and Muslims to win votes and said that he was only faulting the opposition campaign. The opposition INDIA alliance, led by Rahul Gandhi's Congress party, denied it favoured Muslims in the Hindu-majority country and said Modi would destroy the constitution if he returned to power and end affirmative action enjoyed by the so-called backward castes. The BJP rejects this.\n\nThe opposition alliance also promised more welfare measures and handouts, with surveys saying unemployment, inflation and rural distress were the main concerns of voters.\n\n(This story has not been edited by Devdiscourse staff and is auto-generated from a syndicated feed.)", "source": {"uri": "devdiscourse.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Devdiscourse"},

Critics and opponents say his Hindu-first politics have bred intolerance, hate speech and brazen attacks against the country's minorities, especially Muslims, who comprise 14% of the population.\n\nIndia's economy, one of the fastest-growing, has become unequal under Mr Modi. While stock markets reach record highs and millionaires multiply, youth unemployment has soared, with only a small portion of Indians benefitting from the economic boom.\n\nA woman watches an exit poll on television at her home in Mumbai, India (Rajanish Kakade/AP)\n\nMr Modi's critics say the country's democracy is faltering under his government, which has increasingly used strong-arm tactics to subdue political opponents, squeeze independent media, and quash dissent. The government has rejected such accusations and says democracy is flourishing.\n\nAs polls opened in mid-April, a confident BJP initially focused its campaign on \"Modi's guarantees\", highlighting the economic and welfare achievements his party says have reduced poverty.\n\nHis opposition, the India alliance led by the Congress party, has attacked Mr Modi over his Hindu nationalist politics.\n\nThe alliance hopes to benefit from the simmering economic discontent, and its campaign has rallied around issues of joblessness, inflation, and inequality.\n\nBut the broad alliance of more than a dozen political parties has been beset by ideological differences and defections, raising questions over their effectiveness.\n\nThe alliance has also claimed they have been unfairly targeted, pointing to a spree of raids, arrests and corruption investigations against their leaders by federal agencies they say are politically motivated.

The NIFTY 50 and the S&P BSE Sensex were both down over 2% at 0500 GMT.\n\nThe rupee also fell against the dollar and benchmark bond yields were up.\n\nThe markets had soared on Monday after exit polls on June 1 projected Modi and his Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) would register a big victory, with its National Democratic Alliance (NDA) seen getting a two-thirds majority and more.\n\nAt 0430 GMT, TV channels showed the NDA was ahead in nearly 300 of the 543 elective seats in parliament, a simple majority, in early counting. The opposition INDIA alliance led by Rahul Gandhi's Congress party was leading in over 200 seats, higher than expected.\n\nOnly about 10%-15% of the total votes had been counted at the time, TV channels said.\n\nBJP alone accounted for nearly 250 of the seats in which the NDA was leading, compared to the 303 it won in 2019. Trends also showed Modi leading first, then trailing and leading again in his seat in the Hindu holy city of Varanasi.\n\nThe first votes counted were postal ballots, which are paper ballots, mostly cast by troops serving outside their home constituencies or officials away from home on election duty.\n\nThis year, postal votes were also offered to voters over 85 years of age and people with disabilities to allow them to vote from home.\n\nCounting is expected to last several hours as the large majority of votes polled in electronic voting machines or EVMs are taken up after the first 30 minutes of counting postal ballots.\n\n\"These are very early trends, we are going to see better results as the day progresses,\" Congress spokesperson Pawan Khera said.\n\nTV exit polls broadcast after voting ended on June 1 projected a big win for Modi, but exit polls have often got election outcomes wrong in India. Nearly one billion people were registered to vote, of which 642 million turned out.\n\nVITRIOLIC CAMPAIGN\n\nHowever, if Modi's victory is confirmed, his BJP will have triumphed in a vitriolic campaign in which parties accused each other of religious bias and of posing a threat to sections of the population.\n\nInvestors have already cheered the prospects of another Modi term, expecting it to deliver further years of strong economic growth and pro-business reforms, while a possible two-thirds majority in parliament could allow major changes to the constitution, rivals and critics fear.\n\n\"The next government's main task will be to set India on the path of getting rich before it ages,\" the Times of India newspaper said in an editorial on Tuesday, referring to the young, working age population in the world's most populous nation. \"The clock's ticking.\"\n\nNearly one billion people were eligible to vote in the seven-phase, seven-week poll that began on April 19 and held in searing summer heat with temperatures touching nearly 50\u00b0 Celsius (122\u00b0 Fahrenheit) in some parts.\n\nMore than 66% of registered voters turned out, just one percentage point lower than the previous election in 2019, squashing pre-poll concerns that voters might shun a contest thought to be a foregone conclusion in Modi's favour.\n\nModi, 73, who first swept to power in 2014 by promising growth and change, is seeking to be only the second prime minister after India's independence leader Jawaharlal Nehru to win three straight terms.\n\nHe began his campaign by showcasing his record in office including economic growth, welfare policies, national pride, Hindu nationalism and his own personal commitment to fulfilling promises which he called \"Modi's Guarantee\".\n\nHowever, he changed tack after low voter turnout in the first phase and accused the opposition, especially the Congress party, which leads an alliance of two dozen groups, of favouring India's 200 million Muslims - a shift analysts said made the campaign coarse and divisive.\n\nThey said the pivot may have been aimed at firing up the Hindu nationalist base of Modi's BJP to draw them to vote. Modi defended himself against criticism that he was stoking divisions between Hindus and Muslims to win votes and said that he was only faulting the opposition campaign.\n\nThe opposition INDIA alliance denied it favoured Muslims in the Hindu-majority country and said Modi would destroy the constitution if he returned to power and end affirmative action enjoyed by the so-called backward castes. The BJP rejects this.\n\n(Reporting by New Delhi and Mumbai bureaux; Writing by YP Rajesh; Editing by Michael Perry and Raju Gopalakrishnan)\n\nSign Up for Springs AM Update\n\nYour morning rundown of the latest news from Colorado Springs and around the country\n\nSign Up\n\nView all of our newsletters.\n\nSuccess!

Here's what to know", "body": "NEW DELHI (AP) -- The world's largest election could also be one of its most consequential.\n\nIndia has close to 970 million voters among its more than 1.4 billion people, and its general election pits Prime Minister Narendra Modi, an avowed Hindu nationalist, against a broad alliance of opposition parties that are struggling to play catch up.\n\nNow 73, Modi first swept to power in 2014 on promises of economic development, presenting himself as an outsider cracking down on corruption. Since then, he has fused religion with politics in a formula that has attracted wide support from the country's majority Hindu population.\n\nIndia under Modi is a rising global power, but his rule has also been marked by rising unemployment, attacks by Hindu nationalists against minorities, particularly Muslims, and a shrinking space for dissent and free media.\n\nHOW DOES THE ELECTION WORK?\n\nThe final day of voting in the 6-week-long election was Saturday. The vote counting will start Tuesday and will be updated throughout the day. The election results will likely be known the same day.\n\nThe voters are choosing 543 members for the lower house of Parliament for a five-year term.\n\nVotes were cast at more than a million polling stations. Each of the seven voting phases lasted a single day with several constituencies across multiple states voting that day. The staggered polling allowed the government to transport election officials and voting machines and deploy tens of thousands of troops to prevent violence. Candidates crisscrossed the country, poll workers hiked to remote villages, and voters lined up for hours in sweltering heat.\n\nIndia has a first-past-the-post multiparty electoral system in which the candidate who receives the most votes wins. To secure a majority, a party or coalition must breach the mark of 272 seats.\n\nModi's Bharatiya Janata Party and his main challenger, Rahul Gandhi of the Indian National Congress, represent Parliament's two largest factions. Several other important regional parties are part of an opposition bloc.\n\nOpposition parties, which previously were fractured, have united under a front called INDIA, or Indian National Developmental Inclusive Alliance, to deny Modi a a third straight election victory.\n\nThe alliance has fielded a single main candidate in most constituencies. But it has been roiled by ideological differences and personality clashes, and has not yet decided on its candidate for prime minister.\n\nMost exit polls project Modi is set to extend his decade in power with a third consecutive term, especially after he opened a Hindu temple in northern Ayodhya city in January, which fulfilled his party's long-held Hindu nationalist pledge. During the polls Modi escalated polarizing rhetoric in incendiary speeches that targeted the country's Muslim minority.\n\nAnother victory would cement Modi as one of the country's most popular and important leaders. It would follow a thumping win in 2019, when the BJP clinched an absolute majority by sweeping 303 parliamentary seats. The Congress party managed only 52 seats.\n\nWHAT ARE THE BIG ISSUES?\n\nFor decades, India has clung doggedly to its democratic convictions, largely due to free elections, an independent judiciary, a thriving media, strong opposition and peaceful transition of power. Some of these credentials have eroded under Modi's 10-year rule, with the polls seen as a test for the country's democratic values.\n\nMany watchdogs have now categorized India as a \"hybrid regime\" that is neither a full democracy nor a full autocracy.\n\nThe poll results will also test Modi's limits. Critics accuse him of running on a Hindu-first platform, endangering the country's secular roots.\n\nUnder Modi, the media, once viewed as vibrant and largely independent, have become more pliant and critical voices muzzled.Courts have largely bent to Modi's will and given favorable verdicts in crucial cases. Centralization of executive power has strained India's federalism. And federal agencies have bogged down top opposition leaders in corruption cases, which they deny.\n\nAnother key issue is India's large economy, which is among the fastest growing in the world. It has helped India emerge as a global power and a counterweight to China. But even as India's growth soars by some measures, the Modi government has struggled to generate enough jobs for young Indians, and instead has relied on welfare programs like free food and housing to woo voters.", "source": {"uri": "tribtown.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Tribune"}, "authors": [{"uri": "associated_press@tribtown.com", "name": "Associated Press", "type": "author",

The opposition INDIA alliance led by Rahul Gandhi's Congress party was ahead in 172 seats, with Congress alone ahead in 71.\n\nBased on the early trends, the Republic TV channel called the vote in favour of Modi, the first to do so.\n\nThe first votes counted are postal ballots, which are paper ballots, mostly cast by troops serving outside their home constituencies or officials away from home on election duty.\n\nThis year, postal votes were also offered to voters over 85 years of age and people with disabilities to allow them to vote from home.\n\nCounting is expected to last several hours as the large majority of votes polled in electronic voting machines or EVMs are taken up after the first 30 minutes of counting postal ballots.\n\n\"These are very early trends, we are going to see better results as the day progresses,\" Congress spokesperson Pawan Khera said.\n\nTV exit polls broadcast after voting ended on June 1 projected a big win for Modi, but exit polls have often got election outcomes wrong in India. Nearly one billion people were registered to vote, of which 642 million turned out.\n\nHowever, if Modi's victory is confirmed, his BJP will have triumphed in a vitriolic campaign in which parties accused each other of religious bias and of posing a threat to sections of the population.\n\nInvestors have already cheered the prospects of another Modi term, expecting it to deliver further years of strong economic growth and pro-business reforms, while a possible two-thirds majority in parliament could allow major changes to the constitution, rivals and critics fear.\n\n\"The next government's main task will be to set India on the path of getting rich before it ages,\" the Times of India newspaper said in an editorial on Tuesday, referring to the young, working age population in the world's most populous nation. \"The clock's ticking.\"\n\nMARKETS CHEER\n\nIndia stocks fell at the open after Monday's sharp surge as traders said there was some nervousness on the margin of victory.\n\nThe NIFTY 50 was down 2.2% at 0345 GMT and the S&P BSE Sensex was down 1.8%.\n\nTV exit polls released on Saturday after voting ended projected the BJP-led National Democratic Alliance could win a two-thirds majority in the 543-member lower house of parliament.\n\nSeveral major polls projected the BJP alone could win more than the 303 it won in 2019.\n\nThe projections pushed Indian shares to lifetime highs on Monday while the rupee gained and bond yields dropped.\n\nNearly one billion people were eligible to vote in the seven-phase, seven-week poll which began on April 19 and held in searing summer heat with temperatures touching nearly 50\u00b0 Celsius (122\u00b0 Fahrenheit) in some parts.\n\nMore than 66% of registered voters turned out, just one percentage point lower than the previous election in 2019, squashing pre-poll concerns that voters might shun a contest thought to be a foregone conclusion in Modi's favour.\n\nModi, 73, who first swept to power in 2014 by promising growth and change, is seeking to be only the second prime minister after India's independence leader Jawaharlal Nehru to win three straight terms.\n\nHe began his campaign by showcasing his record in office including economic growth, welfare policies, national pride, Hindu nationalism and his own personal commitment to fulfilling promises which he called \"Modi's Guarantee\".\n\nHowever, he changed tack after low voter turnout in the first phase and accused the opposition, especially the Congress party which leads an alliance of two dozen groups, of favouring India's 200 million Muslims - a shift analysts said made the campaign coarse and divisive.\n\nThey said the pivot may have been aimed at firing up the Hindu nationalist base of Modi's Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) to draw them to vote. Modi defended himself against criticism that he was stoking divisions between Hindus and Muslims to win votes and said that he was only faulting the opposition campaign.\n\nThe opposition INDIA alliance, led by Rahul Gandhi's Congress party, denied it favoured Muslims in the Hindu-majority country and said Modi would destroy the constitution if he returned to power and end affirmative action enjoyed by the so-called backward castes. The BJP rejects this.

If the 73-year-old wins, it will only be the second time an Indian leader has retained power for a third term after Jawaharlal Nehru, the country\u00b4s first prime minister.\n\nExit polls on Saturday by major television channels projected a comfortable win for Modi\u00b4s Hindu nationalist Bharatiya Janata Party and its allies over a broad opposition alliance led by the Congress party and its main campaign leader, Rahul Gandhi.\n\nIndian television channels have had a mixed record in the past in predicting election results.\n\nNearly 970 million people, more than 10% of the world\u00b4s population, were eligible to vote. Turnout averaged 66% across the seven phases, according to official data.\n\nThe tallying of votes at counting centers in each of the 543 constituencies where polls were held could stretch into the evening before a final result is declared by the Election Commission of India.\n\nPolice officers stand guard at a vote counting centre ahead of the counting for Indian parliamentary elections in Mumbai, India, Monday, June 3, 2024.

(AP Photo/Rafiq Maqbool)\n\nBut leads will emerge earlier and indicate where the results may be headed.\n\nIn his 10 years in power, Modi has transformed India\u00b4s political landscape. His popularity has outstripped that of his party\u00b4s, and has turned a parliamentary election into one that increasingly resembles a presidential-style campaign. The result is that the BJP relies more and more on Modi\u00b4s enduring brand to stay in power, with local politicians receding into the background even in state elections.\n\n\"Modi was not just the prime campaigner, but the sole campaigner of this election,\" said Yamini Aiyar, a public policy scholar.\n\nHis supporters see him as a self-made, strong leader who has improved India\u00b4s standing in the world, and credit his pro-business policies with making the economy the world\u00b4s fifth-largest.\n\nBut a decade of his leadership has also left the country deeply divided. Modi\u00b4s critics and opponents say his Hindu-first politics have bred intolerance, hate speech and brazen attacks against the country\u00b4s minorities, especially Muslims, who comprise 14% of the population.\n\nIndia\u00b4s economy, one of the fastest-growing, has become more unequal under Modi. While stock markets reach record-highs and millionaires multiply, youth unemployment has soared, with only a small portion of Indians benefitting from the economic boom.\n\nThe country\u00b4s democracy, Modi\u00b4s critics say, is faltering under his government, which has increasingly wielded strong-arm tactics to subdue political opponents, squeeze independent media and quash dissent. The government has rejected such accusations and say democracy is flourishing.\n\nAs polls opened in mid-April, a confident BJP initially focused its campaign on \"Modi\u00b4s guarantees,\" highlighting the economic and welfare achievements that his party says have reduced poverty. With him at the helm, \"India will become a developed nation by 2047,\" Modi repeated in rally after rally.\n\nBut the campaign turned increasingly shrill, as Modi ramped up polarizing rhetoric that targeted the Muslim minority, a tactic seen to energize his core Hindu majority voters.\n\nHis opposition, the INDIA alliance led by the Congress party, has attacked Modi over his Hindu nationalist politics. It hopes to benefit from the simmering economic discontent, and its campaign has rallied around issues of joblessness, inflation and inequality.\n\nBut the broad alliance of over a dozen political parties has been beset by ideological differences and defections, raising questions over their effectiveness. Meanwhile, the alliance has also claimed they\u00b4ve been unfairly targeted, pointing to a spree of raids, arrests and corruption investigations against their leaders by federal agencies they say are politically motivated. The government has denied this.\n\nAnother victory would cement Modi as one of the country\u00b4s most popular and important leaders. It would follow a thumping win in 2019, when the BJP won 303 out of 543 parliamentary seats.\n\nA woman watches an exit poll on television at her home in Mumbai, India, Saturday, June 1, 2024.

He said his National Democratic Alliance will form the government for the third consecutive time.\n\nBJP is part of the National Democratic Alliance, which so far had won 67 seats, 62 of them going to BJP. The Congress party is part of the INDIA alliance, which so far had won 31 seats, 27 of them for Congress.\n\nA total of 272 seats are needed for a majority in the 543-seat Parliament.\n\nNearly 970 million people -- more than 10% of the world's population -- were eligible to vote and turnout averaged 66%, according to official data. The tallying at counting centers in 543 constituencies could stretch well into the evening before final results are announced, though substantial leads are likely to emerge earlier.\n\nIndia's vote is the latest in an unusually busy stretch of elections around the world that are challenging the status quo.\n\n-- Voting ended Saturday in the election that's a referendum on Modi's decade in power.\n\nPrime Minister Narendra Modi says India will will see a \"new chapter of big decisions\" in his third term in office.\n\nAfter claiming victory for his coalition alliance despite a lacklustre performance from his own party, Modi told a crowd at party headquarters he would not shirk from pushing forward with his agenda.\n\nHe said he would advance India's defense production, jobs for youth, raise exports and help farmers, among other things.\n\n\"This country will see a new chapter of big decisions. This is Modi's guarantee,\" he said, speaking in the third person.\n\nPrime Minister Narendra Modi's Hindu nationalist party is facing a major upset in India's most populous state of Uttar Pradesh at the hands of a powerful regional group, Samajwadi Party, or Socialist Group.\n\nThe Samajwadi Party, led my Akhilesh Yadav, already had won 10 seats and was leading in another 28 seats. Its ally, the Congress party, won four seats and was leading in another two.\n\nModi's Bharatiya Janata Party had won 12 seats and was leading in 20 seats. Exit polls had predicted a landslide victory for BJP in all 80 seats.\n\nModi was among the winners in the state from the Varanasi constituency. Rahul Gandhi of the Congress party won in his family bastion of Rae Bareli.\n\nIn January, Modi inaugurated a massive temple for Lord Ram in Varanasi.\n\nRajendra Chaudhry, spokesperson for the Samajwadi Party, said: \"In this election, it seems Lord Ram has deserted the BJP.\"\n\nThe Samajwadi Party was founded in 1992 by Mulayam Singh Yadav, who served as its top elected official for several years. His son, Akhilesh Yadav, took over the party leadership after his death.\n\nPrime Minister Narendra Modi says his coalition is on the path to a third straight term in government after India's marathon election.\n\n\"People have placed their faith in NDA, for a third consecutive time! This is a historical feat in India's history,\" Modi said in a post on X, referring to the National Democratic Alliance headed by his party. He said he will continue to work and fulfil the aspirations of the people.\n\nAs Modi posted his comment, his coalition had won 128 seats and led in 157 races, according to the Election Commission. A total of 272 seats are needed to form a majority government.\n\nIndia's opposition Congress party has called its alliance's strong showing in the polls a \"win for democracy\" and a \"moral and political loss\" for Prime Minister Narendra Modi.\n\nCongress party President Mallikarjun Kharge told a news conference in New Delhi that because no party had a clear majority, the mandate was against Modi.\n\n\"Our fight has not ended yet. We will continue to fight for the country's development, for the constitution, for the benefit of the people,\" Kharge said.\n\nModi's coalition led in a majority of seats Tuesday in India's general election, according to early figures, but faced a stronger challenge from the opposition than expected.\n\nRahul Gandhi, the face of the Congress party's campaign, said the results showed India does not want Modi.\n\n\"People's clear message to PM Modi and Home Minister Amit shah is that we don't want you to run the nation,\" Gandhi said. \"The poorest of this country have defended the constitution of India.\"\n\nPrime Minister Narendra Modi has won a seat in the Hindu holy city of Varanasi, where he ran in 2014 and 2019, India's Election Commission reported.\n\nModi won by more than 152,000 votes and secured 54% of total votes. He ran against the Congress party's Ajai Rai, who got 40%.\n\nVaranasi is located on the banks of the revered Ganges River and is part of Uttar Pradesh state, India's most populous, with around 200 million people.\n\nPrime Minister Narendra Modi's party has lost a seat in the Ayodhya constituency, a deeply symbolic loss after he opened a grand but controversial Hindu temple there in January.\n\nThe Bharatiya Janata Party candidate, Lallu Singh, lost to a rival from the regional Samajwadi Party, Singh's poll agent Kamlesh Srivastava told The Associated Press.\n\nModi and his party had campaigned heavily at the temple dedicated to Lord Ram, built on the historic ruins of a mosque that was destroyed by Hindu mobs in 1992.\n\nExperts said the January opening, where Modi performed rituals inside the temple, marked the unofficial start of his campaign as they hoped it would resonate with his Hindu majority voters. Modi's government had turned it into a national event by organizing live screenings across the country and closing offices for half a day.\n\nThe BJP had held a seat in Ayodhya since 2014.\n\nWhile the vote counting is still continuing, results have been called for 28 parliamentary seats out of 542 so far.\n\nModi's Bharatiya Janata Party has won 19 seats, according to India's Election Commission, while the main opposition Congress party secured four seats. The rest went to different regional parties.\n\nVote tallying is expected to take all day Tuesday, but the count so far shows Modi's party leading in 224 seats with the Congress ahead in 98.\n\nEarly leads by India's election commission projected Modi's ruling Bharatiya Janata Party was leading in 25 of 26 seats in the prime minister's home state of Gujarat. But party leaders said they were not celebrating victory due to a recent blaze at an amusement park in the state that killed 27 people, including children.\n\nA massive fire broke out in May at an amusement park in the state's Rajkot city.\n\n\"We had decided that there will be no celebratory victory or beating of drums. So we are not celebrating,\" said C. R. Patil, a senior leader from Modi's party.\n\nPrime Minister Narendra Modi's ruling Hindu nationalist party appeared to be falling short of a majority in the early vote count Tuesday. If these trends hold, it would be a stunning setback to the populist prime minister who has never relied on coalition partners to govern.\n\nBharatiya Janata Party is still expected to form the new government and return Modi as the prime minister for a rare third consecutive term as his National Democratic Alliance was leading in about 290 seats. A majority requires 272 seats. BJP alone was leading in 242 seats.\n\nStill, that's not the strong finish Modi was aiming for after his party won landslide victories in the 2014 and 2019 elections.\n\nIf BJP doesn't win a majority on its own, it could \"be heavily dependent on the goodwill of its allies, which makes them critical players who we can expect will extract their pound of flesh, both in terms of policymaking as well as government formation,\" said Milan Vaishnav, director of the South Asia Program at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace.\n\n\"This would be truly, you know, uncharted territory, both for Indians as well as for the prime minister,\" Vaishnav said.\n\nSince coming to power in 2014, Modi's BJP has governed in a coalition government but has always had a majority on its own.\n\nAs the early vote count showed Prime Minister Narendra Modi's party facing a tighter than expected race, India's two main benchmark stock indices closed down sharply.\n\nThe NIFTY 50 and the BSE Sensex had hit new highs at the close of day Monday but dropped sharply Tuesday as the early vote figures started to come in.\n\nThey recovered slightly to each close down more than 5%.\n\nThe country's stock markets have boomed under Modi, whose pro-market policies have made him popular among India's corporations and businesspeople.\n\nEven if Modi's Bharatiya Janata Party does not secure a parliamentary majority on its own, early leads reported by India's Election Commission showed his coalition, which includes smaller parties, still could.\n\nA politician from disputed Kashmir who has been in New Delhi's Tihar Jail since 2019 in a terror funding case has won after his rival conceded defeat.\n\nSheikh Abdul Rashid from northern Baramulla constituency won as an independent candidate, beating former chief minister of the region Omar Abdullah.\n\n\"I think it's time to accept the inevitable,\" Abdullah wrote on X. \"I don't believe his victory will hasten his release from prison nor will the people of North Kashmir get the representation they have a right to but the voters have spoken and in a democracy that's all that matters.\"\n\nRashid's campaign was run by his two sons, hoping a win for him would lead to his release from prison. India and Pakistan have fought two wars over Kashmir, which is divided between the neighbors but claimed by both in its entirety. Modi's government revoked Indian-controlled Kashmir's semi-autonomous status during a 2019 security clampdown.\n\nRebel groups in the region have been fighting against Indian rule since 1989. Tens of thousands of people have been killed in the armed uprising and subsequent Indian military crackdown. The rebels want Kashmir to be united under Pakistani rule or become an independent country.\n\nIndia's most populous state is showing surprising early leads for the opposition, despite being previously controlled by Modi's Hindu nationalist party.\n\nEarly tallies reported by the Election Commission showed the opposition Congress party and its ally, the Samajwadi Party, were leading on more than half the seats in the crucial northern Uttar Pradesh state ruled by a Hindu monk who is considered a future prime minister candidate by Modi supporters.\n\nUttar Pradesh sends the most lawmakers of any state -- 80 -- to Parliament. It has long been considered the biggest prize in Indian elections. It's also home to Ayodhya, where a Hindu temple was built on the site of a razed mosque.\n\nThe Samajwadi Party was leading in 35 seats, with Modi's Bharatiya Janata Party ahead in 34 seats. The Congress party was leading in seven seats.\n\nIn the 2019 election, BJP won 62 seats in the state.\n\nIndia's Election Commission says early counting of votes shows incumbent Prime Minister Narendra Modi's Bharatiya Janata Party comfortably ahead, but with a stronger than expected showing by the main opposition.\n\nSome six hours into counting, Modi's Hindu nationalist BJP was ahead in 236 constituencies and had won two -- including one uncontested -- of 543 parliamentary seats.\n\nThe main opposition Congress party was leading in 99 constituencies.\n\nThe Election Commission does not release data on the percentage of votes tallied, but counting is expected to go on through the day. A total of some 642 million votes are being counted in the world's largest democratic exercise.\n\nModi's party is part of the National Democratic Alliance, whose parties were leading in 283 constituencies according to the early count, including the two won by BJP. The Congress party is part of the INDIA alliance, which was leading in 232 constituencies.\n\nA total of 272 seats are needed for a majority in parliament.\n\nIndian markets, which closed at an all-time high Monday, were down sharply in midday trading Tuesday, after early leads showed fewer seats for Modi's governing BJP than had been expected.\n\nModi's party still showed a comfortable lead, according to early figures reported by India's election commission. but was facing a stronger challenge from the opposition than exit polls had projected.\n\nIndia's benchmark stock indices, the NIFTY 50 and the BSE Sensex, were both down by more than 8% before recovering slightly. This followed a dip of more than 3% when markets opened.\n\nThe country's stock markets have boomed under Modi, whose pro-market policies have made him popular among India's corporations and businesspeople.\n\nTemperatures in the Indian capital were down Tuesday from highs in the past week of 45 degrees Celsius (113 degrees Fahrenheit), but election officials and political parties were nonetheless taking precautions as votes were being counted.\n\nWorkers carried cases of water into one air-conditioned counting station in New Delhi early in the morning in preparation, while tents outside for security personnel and others were outfitted with industrial evaporative coolers.\n\nTemperatures in the morning hovered around 37 C (99 F) in New Delhi and were expected to rise to 41 C (106 F) by the end of the day.\n\nAt the headquarters of the opposition Congress party, a tent was set up outside, equipped with evaporative coolers, for waiting media.\n\nIndian women are a key voting bloc with more of them voting in recent elections than ever before. Most poll experts expect women voters to play a decisive role in determining the 2024 election results.\n\nPolitical parties have been wooing them with monthly cash handouts, subsidized cooking gas cylinders and low-interest loans. Many such programs have particularly helped Modi's Bharatiya Janata party widen its support among them, especially in rural areas. The opposition alliance also tried to gain women's votes by unveiling programs that promised financial aid of $1,200 per year to poor women, and promised to reserve 50% of government jobs for women if voted into power.\n\nWomen make up nearly 49% of India's total electorate. Turnout has grown in each recent major election -- of women who were eligible to vote, 53% voted in 2004; 56% in 2009; 65.5% in 2014; and 67% in 2019. Data for 2024 was not yet available but was estimated to resemble 2019's female voter turnout.\n\nThe counting of some 642 million votes cast in India's election is being done at various locations around the country by government employees. Chief election commissioner Rajiv Kumar said they were starting with postal ballots and then move on to combining the votes from India's electronic voting machines.\n\nThe process is expected to be completed by the end of the day Tuesday.\n\nIndia has close to 970 million eligible voters, and votes were cast at more than a million polling stations staggered over the last six weeks.\n\nThat brought the final phase into India's hottest season, with temperatures higher than 45 degrees Celsius (113 Fahrenheit) in some parts of the country, and Kumar said the election officials learned a valuable lesson.\n\n\"We should have completed the election at least one month before,\" he said ahead of the start of the counting. \"We shouldn't have let it continue into so much heat.\"",

Who is he?", "body": "FILE- Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi greets during the unveiling of his Hindu nationalist Bharatiya Janata party's election manifesto in New Delhi, India, April 14, 2024. Popular but polarizing Prime Minister Narendra Modi who has advanced Hindu nationalism in India is returning for a third consecutive term in office after clinching victory in a general election that was seen as a referendum on his decade in power.\n\nNEW DELHI (AP) -- India's Prime Minister Narendra Modi, who claimed victory for his alliance in an election seen as a referendum on his decade in power, is a popular but polarizing leader who has presided over a fast-growing economy while advancing Hindu nationalism.\n\nModi, 73, is only the second Indian prime minister to win a third straight term.\n\nHis Hindu nationalist Bharatiya Janata Party failed to secure a majority on its own -- as it did in 2014 and 2019 -- after facing a stronger than expected challenge from the opposition. But together with other parties in his National Democratic Alliance, his bloc won enough seats for a slim parliamentary majority and to form his third consecutive government, Election Commission data showed Tuesday.\n\nTo supporters, Modi is a larger-than-life figure who has improved India's standing in the world, helped make its economy the world's fifth-largest, and streamlined the country's vast welfare program, which serves around 60% of the population. To some, he may even be more than human.\n\nBut to critics, he's a cult leader who has eroded India's democracy and advanced divisive politics targeting the Muslims who make up 14% of the country's population. They say he has also increasingly wielded strong-arm tactics to subdue political opponents, squeeze independent media and quash dissent.\n\nModi's government has rejected such accusations and says democracy is flourishing.\n\nPolitical analysts say Modi's victory was driven by social welfare programs that provided benefits from food to housing, and the strident Hindu nationalism that has consolidated a majority of Hindu votes for his party. Hindus make up 80% of India's population.\n\nThe economy is growing by 7% and more than 500 million Indians have opened bank accounts during Modi's tenure, but that growth hasn't created enough jobs, and inequality has worsened under his rule, according to some economists.\n\nModi began his election campaign two months ago by promising to turn India into a developed country by 2047 and focused on highlighting his administration's welfare policies and a robust digital infrastructure that have benefited millions of Indians.\n\nBut as the campaign progressed, he increasingly resorted to anti-Muslim rhetoric, calling them \"infiltrators\" and making references to a Hindu nationalist claim that Muslims were overtaking the Hindu population by having more children. Modi also accused the opposition of pandering to the minority community.\n\nConspicous piety has long been a centerpiece of Modi's brand, but he's also begun suggesting that he was chosen by God.\n\nIn a TV interview during the campaign, he said \"When my mother was alive, I used to believe that I was born biologically. After she passed away, upon reflecting on all my experiences, I was convinced that God had sent me.\"\n\nIn January, he delivered on a longstanding Hindu nationalist ambition by leading the opening of a controversial temple on the site of a razed mosque.\n\nAfter campaigning ended last week, Modi went to a Hindu spiritual site for a televised 45-hour meditation retreat. Most Indian TV channels spent hours showing the event.\n\nBorn in 1950 to a lower-caste family in western Gujarat state, as a young boy Modi joined the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh, a paramilitary, right-wing group which has long been accused of stoking hatred against Muslims. RSS is the ideological parent of Modi's BJP.\n\nThe tea seller's son got his first big political break in 2001, becoming chief minister of his home state of Gujarat. A few months in, anti-Muslim riots ripped through the region, killing at least 1,000 people. There were suspicions that Modi quietly supported the riots, but he has denied the allegations.\n\nIn 2005, the U.S. revoked Modi's visa, citing concerns that he did not act to stop the communal violence. An investigation approved by the Indian Supreme Court later absolved Modi, but the stain of the dark moment has lingered.\n\nThirteen years later, Modi led his Hindu nationalist party to a spectacular victory in the 2014 national elections after promising sweeping reforms to jumpstart India's flagging economy.\n\nBut Modi's critics and opponents say his Hindu-first politics have bred intolerance, hate speech and brazen attacks against the country's minorities, especially Muslims.\n\nMonths after securing a second term in 2019, his government revoked the special status of disputed Kashmir, the country's only Muslim-majority state, and split it into two federally governed territories. His government passed a law that grants citizenship to religious minorities from Muslim countries in the region but excludes Muslims.\n\nDecision like these have made Modi hugely popular among his diehard supporters who hail him as the champion of the Hindu majority and see India emerging as a Hindu majoritarian state.\n\nModi has spent his political life capitalizing on religious tensions for political gain, said Christophe Jaffrelot, a political scientist and expert on Modi and the Hindu right. During his time as a state leader, he pioneered a embrace of Hindu nationalism unlike anything seen before in Indian politics.\n\n\"That style has remained. It was invented in Gujarat and today it is a national brand,\" Jaffrelot said.", "source": {"uri": "idahostatejournal.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Idaho State Journal"}, "authors": [{"uri":

Since then, he has fused religion with politics in a formula that has attracted wide support from the country's majority Hindu population.\n\nIndia under Modi is a rising global power, but his rule has also been marked by rising unemployment, attacks by Hindu nationalists against minorities, particularly Muslims, and a shrinking space for dissent and free media.\n\nHOW DOES THE ELECTION WORK?\n\nThe final day of voting in the 6-week-long election was Saturday. The vote counting will start today and will be updated throughout the day. The election results will likely be known the same day.\n\nThe voters are choosing 543 members for the lower house of Parliament for a five-year term.\n\nVotes were cast at more than a million polling stations. Each of the seven voting phases lasted a single day with several constituencies across multiple states voting that day. The staggered polling allowed the government to transport election officials and voting machines and deploy tens of thousands of troops to prevent violence. Candidates crisscrossed the country, poll workers hiked to remote villages, and voters lined up for hours in sweltering heat.\n\nIndia has a first-past-the-post multiparty electoral system in which the candidate who receives the most votes wins. To secure a majority, a party or coalition must breach the mark of 272 seats.\n\nModi's Bharatiya Janata Party and his main challenger, Rahul Gandhi of the Indian National Congress, represent Parliament's two largest factions. Several other important regional parties are part of an opposition bloc.\n\nOpposition parties, which previously were fractured, have united under a front called INDIA, or Indian National Developmental Inclusive Alliance, to deny Modi a a third straight election victory.\n\nThe alliance has fielded a single main candidate in most constituencies. But it has been roiled by ideological differences and personality clashes, and has not yet decided on its candidate for prime minister.\n\nMost exit polls project Modi is set to extend his decade in power with a third consecutive term, especially after he opened a Hindu temple in northern Ayodhya city in January, which fulfilled his party's long-held Hindu nationalist pledge. During the polls Modi escalated polarizing rhetoric in incendiary speeches that targeted the country's Muslim minority.\n\nAnother victory would cement Modi as one of the country's most popular and important leaders. It would follow a thumping win in 2019, when the BJP clinched an absolute majority by sweeping 303 parliamentary seats. The Congress party managed only 52 seats.\n\nWHAT ARE THE BIG ISSUES?\n\nFor decades, India has clung doggedly to its democratic convictions, largely due to free elections, an independent judiciary, a thriving media, strong opposition and peaceful transition of power. Some of these credentials have eroded under Modi's 10-year rule, with the polls seen as a test for the country's democratic values.\n\nMany watchdogs have now categorized India as a \"hybrid regime\" that is neither a full democracy nor a full autocracy.\n\nThe poll results will also test Modi's limits. Critics accuse him of running on a Hindu-first platform, endangering the country's secular roots.\n\nUnder Modi, the media, once viewed as vibrant and largely independent, have become more pliant and critical voices muzzled.Courts have largely bent to Modi's will and given favorable verdicts in crucial cases. Centralization of executive power has strained India's federalism. And federal agencies have bogged down top opposition leaders in corruption cases, which they deny.", "source": {"uri": "macaudailytimes.com.mo", "dataType": "news", "title": "Macau Daily Times"},

However, the numbers fall short of the landslide predicted in exit polls, leading to a sharp market decline. Nearly one billion people were registered to vote, with a substantial turnout of 66%.\n\nIndian Prime Minister Narendra Modi's alliance raced to a majority in early vote counting trends in the general election on Tuesday, but the numbers were well short of the landslide predicted in exit polls, TV channels showed. The early see-saw trends spooked markets with stocks falling steeply. The blue-chip NIFTY 50 was down 4.4% and the S&P BSE Sensex was down 4.2% at 0600 GMT.\n\nThe rupee also fell sharply against the dollar and benchmark bond yields were up. The markets had soared on Monday after exit polls on June 1 projected Modi and his Hindu nationalist Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) would register a big victory, with its National Democratic Alliance (NDA) seen getting a two-thirds majority and more.\n\nAt 0600 GMT, TV channels showed the NDA was ahead in nearly 300 of the 543 elective seats in parliament, where 272 is a simple majority, in early counting. The opposition INDIA alliance led by Rahul Gandhi's centrist Congress party was leading in over 220 seats, higher than expected. TV channels showed BJP accounted for nearly 250 of the seats in which the NDA was leading, short of a majority on its own, compared to the 303 it won in 2019.\n\nA third Modi term with a slim majority for BJP - or having to depend on NDA allies for a majority - could introduce some uncertainty into governance as Modi has ruled with an authoritative hold over the government in the last decade. However, politicians and analysts said it was too early to get a firm idea of the voting trends since a majority of ballots were yet to be counted.\n\n\"It's a fair assessment to say 400 at the moment certainly looks distant,\" BJP spokesperson Nalin Kohli told the India Today TV channel, referring to some projections that gave 400 seats to the NDA. \"But we need to wait...to have a final picture of the seats because the exit polls speak of a massive sweep, (and) the counting trends currently don't seem to match that,\" he said.\n\n\"The BJP-NDA will form the government, that trend is very clear from the start,\" he added. TV exit polls broadcast after voting ended on June 1 projected a big win for Modi, but exit polls have often got election outcomes wrong in India. Nearly one billion people were registered to vote, of which 642 million turned out.\n\nHowever, if Modi's victory is confirmed even by a slim margin, his BJP will have triumphed in a vitriolic campaign in which parties accused each other of religious bias and of posing a threat to sections of the population. SOME PANIC IN MARKETS\n\nInvestors had cheered the prospects of another Modi term, expecting it to deliver further years of strong economic growth and pro-business reforms, while the anticipated two-thirds majority in parliament would allow major changes to the constitution. \"The sharp drop in Nifty is because the results, although (in) early trends, present a picture that is a lot different from what the exit polls had shown,\" said Siddhartha Khemka, head of retail research at Motilal Oswal Financial Services in Mumbai.\n\n\"This is what has led to some panic, some concern. These trends are early trends, to be honest. The market does not want a hung parliament or a coalition government, where you will have a lot of delays in decision making,\" he said. The seven-phase, seven-week poll that began on April 19 was held in searing summer heat with temperatures touching nearly 50\u00b0 Celsius (122\u00b0 Fahrenheit) in some parts.\n\nMore than 66% of registered voters turned out, just one percentage point lower than the previous election in 2019, squashing pre-poll concerns that voters might shun a contest thought to be a foregone conclusion in Modi's favour. Modi, 73, who first swept to power in 2014 by promising growth and change, is seeking to be only the second prime minister after India's independence leader Jawaharlal Nehru to win three straight terms.\n\nHe began his campaign by showcasing his record in office including economic growth, welfare policies, national pride, Hindu nationalism and his own personal commitment to fulfilling promises which he called \"Modi's Guarantee\". However, he changed tack after low voter turnout in the first phase and accused the opposition, especially the Congress party, which leads an alliance of two dozen groups, of favouring India's 200 million Muslims - a shift analysts said made the campaign coarse and divisive.\n\nThey said the pivot may have been aimed at firing up the Hindu nationalist base of Modi's BJP to draw them to vote. Modi defended himself against criticism that he was stoking divisions between Hindus and Muslims to win votes and said that he was only faulting the opposition campaign. The opposition INDIA alliance denied it favoured Muslims in the Hindu-majority country and said Modi would destroy the constitution if he returned to power and end affirmative action enjoyed by the so-called backward castes. The BJP rejects this.\n\n(This story has not been edited by Devdiscourse staff and is auto-generated from a syndicated feed.)", "source": {"uri": "devdiscourse.com", "dataType": "news", "title":

Nonetheless, together with its political allies, known as the national democratic alliance (NDA), its win amounts to about 292 seats, which is enough to form a majority government to rule for the next five years and return Modi to office for a third term.\n\nMeanwhile, the opposition alliance, which goes by the acronym INDIA, far outperformed expectations, collectively winning more than 230 seats. The alliance, formed of more than 20 national and regional opposition parties, had come together for the first time in this election with the aim of defeating Modi.\n\nDespite the tight race, Modi insisted he had been given a mandate to lead again in a victory speech. Addressing voters at the BJP headquarters in Delhi, Modi said he was \"very, very happy today\".\n\n\"I would like to bow down before the people of the country,\" said Modi. \"Today is an emotional moment for me personally as well. This was my first election after I lost my mother.\"\n\n\"The blessings of the people for the third time after 10 years boosts our morale, gives new strength. Our opponents, despite being united, could not even win as many seats as BJP won.\"\n\nBJP officials were insistent it would form the next government and denied any setback, emphasising that their party had won more seats than any other.\n\n\"The NDA will form the government for the third time. Prime minister Modi will be sworn-in for the third time. Congress will sit in opposition for the third time,\" said Jaiveer Shergill, a spokesperson for the BJP. He added that \"introspection\" would be done within the parties about their losses.\n\nThe INDIA coalition proved more resilient and successful than many analysts had expected, despite grappling with state agencies freezing party funds and jailing opposition leaders in the build up to the polls. They were particularly boosted by regional parties who far outperformed the BJP, such as the Samajwadi party in Uttar Pradesh, the Trinamool Congress in West Bengal and Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam party in Tamil Nadu.\n\n\"We have to credit the opposition alliance for being more politically and electorally savvy than it might have been given credit for,\" said Michael Kugelman, director of the Wilson Centre's South Asia Institute.\n\n\"So many had left the opposition for dead and had not expected it to be able to capitalise on a number of BJP vulnerabilities in the last few years, whether that's economic stress or push back against Hindu nationalism. But instead, they've done pretty well.\"\n\nAnalysts said the results would have significant implications for India's political landscape after the polls. Since he was elected a decade ago, Modi and his Hindu nationalist BJP have enjoyed a powerful mandate, while the opposition have been seen as weak and unable to stand up to the might of the party. Modi is seen as a popular strongman prime minister and stands accused of overseeing increased authoritarianism and a crackdown on dissent over his decade in office.\n\nMaya Tudor, associate professor at Oxford University's Blavatnik school of government, said: \"Particularly in the Hindi heartland, which is the BJP's core base, voters have not delivered the expected Modi wave. So relative to expectations, you can read this as a loss for the BJP.\"\n\nThe results were a particular triumph for the country's beleaguered main opposition party and the BJP's main rival, Indian National Congress, which dramatically lost the previous two elections to Modi and was facing questions about its future as a party. This time it appeared the Congress party had more than doubled its seats.\n\nMallikarjun Kharge, president of the Congress party, said that Modi had faced a \"moral and political defeat\" and said the opposition coalition would meet on Wednesday to discuss their next steps. \"We focused our fight on the unemployed, the farmers and the poor of this country. The BJP, meanwhile, spread lies and hatred, running a vicious campaign. People have rejected that,\" said Kharge.\n\nMamata Banerjee, head of the opposition Trinamool Congress party that swept the seats in West Bengal, called on Modi to step down. \"These results have shown that Modi has lost all credibility and he should immediately resign,\" she said.\n\nRelated: 'Modi builds highways but where are our jobs?': rising inequality looms over India's election\n\nThe BJP centred its campaign around the cult of the prime minister, their party manifesto simply titled \"Modi's guarantee'. Many of his speeches initially focused on the BJP's mammoth infrastructure push, generous welfare programmes and elevation of India on the world stage over the past decade, as well as promises to turn the nation into a $10bn economy.\n\nHowever, in what some took as a sign of nervousness in the BJP camp, Modi later turned to more polarising religious rhetoric on the campaign trail, appearing to call Muslims \"infiltrators\" and \"those who have more children\" while in a flurry of interviews he proclaimed to have been chosen by God for the role. The BJP were also accused of harassing and intimidating political opponents to prevent them running and of suppressing Muslim votes.\n\nAnalysts said results indicate that the \"Modi wave\" has been dented by problems such as high unemployment and inflation. In the aftermath of the election, Modi will probably have to grapple with a more powerful and more animated opposition than at any point over the past decade.\n\nThe BJP's ability to continue with its more hardline Hindu nationalist policies could also be impeded as it is forced to rely on its coalition partners, some of which do not have the same Hindu-first agenda, and analysts said Modi could be forced to take a more pragmatic or consensus-based pathway in policy than ever before.\n\nOne of the biggest shocks of the election results was the vast losses faced by the BJP in the Hindi heartland of Uttar Pradesh, the country's most populous and politically important state, which has 80 seats and is seen as a bellwether for the rest of the country. Early counts showed that the INDIA alliance was ahead of the BJP's alliance, with several BJP heavyweights losing their seats, indicating that the party had lost critical support in one of its key bastions.\n\nThe results also threw up other surprise outcomes. In one significant success for the BJP, they managed to win their first seat in Kerala, long seen as a bastion of left-wing politics, which had pushed back hard against Hindu nationalist politics. Meanwhile, in Modi's own constituency of Varanasi, his victory margin shrank from half a million votes to 150,000.", "source": {"uri": "ca.news.yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo"},

If the 73-year-old wins, it will only be the second time an Indian leader has retained power for a third term after Jawaharlal Nehru, the country's first prime minister.\n\n\u00d7\n\nAlready a Subscriber? Sign in You are logged in Switch accounts\n\nExit polls on Saturday by major television channels projected a comfortable win for Modi's Hindu nationalist Bharatiya Janata Party and its allies over a broad opposition alliance led by the Congress party and its main campaign leader, Rahul Gandhi.\n\nARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW ARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW\n\nIndian television channels have had a mixed record in the past in predicting election results.\n\nNearly 970 million people, more than 10% of the world's population, were eligible to vote. Turnout was around 66% on average across the seven phases, according to official data.\n\nThe tallying of votes at counting centers in each of the 543 constituencies where polls were held could stretch into the evening before a final result is declared by the Election Commission of India.\n\nBut leads will start to emerge earlier, which will give an idea of where the results may be headed.\n\nIn his 10 years in power, Modi has transformed India's political landscape. His popularity has outstripped that of his party's, and has turned a parliamentary election into one that increasingly resembles a presidential-style campaign. The result is that the BJP relies more and more on Modi's enduring brand to stay in power, with local politicians receding into the background even in state elections.\n\nARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW ARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW\n\n\"Modi was not just the prime campaigner, but the sole campaigner of this election,\" said Yamini Aiyar, a public policy scholar.\n\nHis supporters see him as a self-made, strong leader who has improved India's standing in the world, and credit his pro-business policies with making the economy the world's fifth-largest.\n\nBut a decade of his leadership has also left the country deeply divided. Modi's critics and opponents say his Hindu-first politics have bred intolerance, hate speech and brazen attacks against the country's minorities, especially Muslims, who comprise 14% of the population.\n\nIndia's economy, one of the fastest-growing, has become more unequal under Modi. While stock markets reach record-highs and millionaires multiply, youth unemployment has soared, with only a small portion of Indians benefitting from the economic boom.\n\nThe country's democracy, Modi's critics say, is faltering under his government, which has increasingly wielded strong-arm tactics to subdue political opponents, squeeze independent media and quash dissent. The government has rejected such accusations and say democracy is flourishing.\n\nARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW ARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW\n\nAs polls opened in mid-April, a confident BJP initially focused its campaign on \"Modi's guarantees,\" highlighting the economic and welfare achievements that his party says have reduced poverty. With him at the helm, \"India will become a developed nation by 2047,\" Modi repeated in rally after rally.\n\nBut the campaign turned increasingly shrill, as Modi ramped up polarizing rhetoric that targeted the Muslim minority, a tactic seen to energize his core Hindu majority voters.\n\nHis opposition, the INDIA alliance led by the Congress party, has attacked Modi over his Hindu nationalist politics. It hopes to benefit from the simmering economic discontent, and its campaign has rallied around issues of joblessness, inflation and inequality.\n\nBut the broad alliance of over a dozen political parties has been beset by ideological differences and defections, raising questions over their effectiveness. Meanwhile, the alliance has also claimed they've been unfairly targeted, pointing to a spree of raids, arrests and corruption investigations against their leaders by federal agencies they say are politically motivated. The government has denied this.\n\nAnother victory would cement Modi as one of the country's most popular and important leaders. It would follow a thumping win in 2019, when the BJP won 303 out of 543 parliamentary seats.\n\nRead more on the India Election at thestar.com", "source": {"uri": "thestar.com", "dataType": "news",

Here's What to Know", "body": "NEW DELHI (AP) -- The world's largest election could also be one of its most consequential.\n\nIndia has close to 970 million voters among its more than 1.4 billion people, and its general election pits Prime Minister Narendra Modi, an avowed Hindu nationalist, against a broad alliance of opposition parties that are struggling to play catch up.\n\nNow 73, Modi first swept to power in 2014 on promises of economic development, presenting himself as an outsider cracking down on corruption. Since then, he has fused religion with politics in a formula that has attracted wide support from the country's majority Hindu population.\n\nIndia under Modi is a rising global power, but his rule has also been marked by rising unemployment, attacks by Hindu nationalists against minorities, particularly Muslims, and a shrinking space for dissent and free media.\n\nHOW DOES THE ELECTION WORK?\n\nThe final day of voting in the 6-week-long election was Saturday. The vote counting will start Tuesday and will be updated throughout the day. The election results will likely be known the same day.\n\nThe voters are choosing 543 members for the lower house of Parliament for a five-year term.\n\nVotes were cast at more than a million polling stations. Each of the seven voting phases lasted a single day with several constituencies across multiple states voting that day. The staggered polling allowed the government to transport election officials and voting machines and deploy tens of thousands of troops to prevent violence. Candidates crisscrossed the country, poll workers hiked to remote villages, and voters lined up for hours in sweltering heat.\n\nIndia has a first-past-the-post multiparty electoral system in which the candidate who receives the most votes wins. To secure a majority, a party or coalition must breach the mark of 272 seats.\n\nModi's Bharatiya Janata Party and his main challenger, Rahul Gandhi of the Indian National Congress, represent Parliament's two largest factions. Several other important regional parties are part of an opposition bloc.\n\nOpposition parties, which previously were fractured, have united under a front called INDIA, or Indian National Developmental Inclusive Alliance, to deny Modi a a third straight election victory.\n\nThe alliance has fielded a single main candidate in most constituencies. But it has been roiled by ideological differences and personality clashes, and has not yet decided on its candidate for prime minister.\n\nMost exit polls project Modi is set to extend his decade in power with a third consecutive term, especially after he opened a Hindu temple in northern Ayodhya city in January, which fulfilled his party's long-held Hindu nationalist pledge. During the polls Modi escalated polarizing rhetoric in incendiary speeches that targeted the country's Muslim minority.\n\nAnother victory would cement Modi as one of the country's most popular and important leaders. It would follow a thumping win in 2019, when the BJP clinched an absolute majority by sweeping 303 parliamentary seats. The Congress party managed only 52 seats.\n\nWHAT ARE THE BIG ISSUES?\n\nFor decades, India has clung doggedly to its democratic convictions, largely due to free elections, an independent judiciary, a thriving media, strong opposition and peaceful transition of power. Some of these credentials have eroded under Modi's 10-year rule, with the polls seen as a test for the country's democratic values.\n\nMany watchdogs have now categorized India as a \"hybrid regime\" that is neither a full democracy nor a full autocracy.\n\nThe poll results will also test Modi's limits. Critics accuse him of running on a Hindu-first platform, endangering the country's secular roots.\n\nUnder Modi, the media, once viewed as vibrant and largely independent, have become more pliant and critical voices muzzled.Courts have largely bent to Modi's will and given favorable verdicts in crucial cases. Centralization of executive power has strained India's federalism. And federal agencies have bogged down top opposition leaders in corruption cases, which they deny.\n\nAnother key issue is India's large economy, which is among the fastest growing in the world. It has helped India emerge as a global power and a counterweight to China. But even as India's growth soars by some measures, the Modi government has struggled to generate enough jobs for young Indians, and instead has relied on welfare programs like free food and housing to woo voters.\n\nCopyright 2024 The Associated Press.

Nearly one billion people were registered to vote, of which 642 million turned out.\n\nHowever, if Modi's victory is confirmed, his BJP will have triumphed in a vitriolic campaign in which parties accused each other of religious bias and of posing a threat to sections of the population.\n\nInvestors have already cheered the prospects of another Modi term, expecting it to deliver further years of strong economic growth and pro-business reforms, while a possible two-thirds majority in parliament could allow major changes to the constitution, rivals and critics fear.\n\n\"The next government's main task will be to set India on the path of getting rich before it ages,\" the Times of India newspaper said in an editorial on Tuesday, referring to the young, working age population in the world's most populous nation. \"The clock's ticking.\"\n\nMARKETS CHEER\n\nIndia stocks fell at the open after Monday's sharp surge as traders said there was some nervousness on the margin of victory.\n\nThe NIFTY 50 was down 2.2% at 0345 GMT and the S&P BSE Sensex was down 1.8%.\n\nTV exit polls released on Saturday after voting ended projected the BJP-led National Democratic Alliance could win a two-thirds majority in the 543-member lower house of parliament.\n\nSeveral major polls projected the BJP alone could win more than the 303 it won in 2019.\n\nThe projections pushed Indian shares to lifetime highs on Monday while the rupee gained and bond yields dropped.\n\nNearly one billion people were eligible to vote in the seven-phase, seven-week poll which began on April 19 and held in searing summer heat with temperatures touching nearly 50\u00b0 Celsius (122\u00b0 Fahrenheit) in some parts.\n\nMore than 66% of registered voters turned out, just one percentage point lower than the previous election in 2019, squashing pre-poll concerns that voters might shun a contest thought to be a foregone conclusion in Modi's favour.\n\nModi, 73, who first swept to power in 2014 by promising growth and change, is seeking to be only the second prime minister after India's independence leader Jawaharlal Nehru to win three straight terms.\n\nHe began his campaign by showcasing his record in office including economic growth, welfare policies, national pride, Hindu nationalism and his own personal commitment to fulfilling promises which he called \"Modi's Guarantee\".\n\nHowever, he changed tack after low voter turnout in the first phase and accused the opposition, especially the Congress party which leads an alliance of two dozen groups, of favouring India's 200 million Muslims - a shift analysts said made the campaign coarse and divisive.\n\nThey said the pivot may have been aimed at firing up the Hindu nationalist base of Modi's Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) to draw them to vote. Modi defended himself against criticism that he was stoking divisions between Hindus and Muslims to win votes and said that he was only faulting the opposition campaign.\n\nThe opposition INDIA alliance, led by Rahul Gandhi's Congress party, denied it favoured Muslims in the Hindu-majority country and said Modi would destroy the constitution if he returned to power and end affirmative action enjoyed by the so-called backward castes. The BJP rejects this.\n\n(Reporting by New Delhi and Mumbai bureaux; Writing by YP Rajesh; Editing by Michael Perry and Raju Gopalakrishnan)\n\nSign Up for Springs AM Update Your morning rundown of the latest news from Colorado Springs and around the country\n\nSign Up View all of our newsletters.

As of 9 p.m. local time, it is leading with 288 seats, according to India's election commission. The INDIA coalition of opposition parties picked up 233 seats, defying exit polls that predicted a much lower tally.\n\nOn Tuesday morning, only a small group of supporters had gathered at BJP headquarters in New Delhi as initial trends showed the alliance would not get a landslide victory. While one loudly sang hymns to a cut-out of Prime Minister Modi in front of TV cameras, the mood was relatively somber.\n\nAt the opposition Congress party office, supporters were cheering and dancing.\n\nIndia's stock market, meanwhile, plunged to a four-year low, Reuters reported, on news that the governing alliance was winning by a narrower margin than expected, which could make it harder to pass its legislation.\n\nWhen the massive seven-phase election started in April, most analysts had predicted a landslide in favor of Modi and his allies.\n\nAt the time, Modi had inaugurated a Hindu temple built atop a mosque razed by Hindu nationalists in Ayodhya; the income tax department frozen Congress party's bank accounts citing unpaid dues; and India's top investigation agencies charged several opposition leaders for corruption or money-laundering charges.\n\nWhile dismissing allegations of Modi's authoritarianism, the BJP focused its campaign on economic growth, welfare programs and India's rise on the world stage. The party has not tamed high inflation and unemployment in its decade in power, but several voters told NPR that Modi rose above his government's failures.\n\nAfter the first round of voting in April, however, the governing party's rhetoric became increasingly polarized on religious lines.\n\nIn his campaign speeches, Modi accused the Congress party of conspiring to steal wealth of the majority Hindus and distribute it among the minority Muslims, whom he called \"intruders\" and \"those with more children.\" After several complaints by the opposition parties, the election commission said it would hold party presidents responsible for transgressions of its star campaigners.\n\nThe opposition INDIA alliance -- a coalition of two dozen parties led by the Congress -- had pitched the election as a fight to save the country's constitution. Despite one key partner defecting before the polls, the Congress and strong regional parties helped the alliance pick up more seats than predicted. A key victory was in the bellwether state of Uttar Pradesh, where the opposition coalition was leading in nearly half the seats it had lost to the BJP in 2019. This included Faizabad, where the controversial Hindu temple is located.\n\nIn a victory speech on Tuesday evening, that started with salutation to a Hindu god, Modi reiterated his intent to make India a developed country over the next two decades. He added that he would work with all state governments, irrespective of the party.\n\nEarlier in the evening, the opposition Congress party said the main opposition had won the seats despite BJP's \"capture\" of state institutions. Its leader Rahul Gandhi then pulled out a copy of the Indian Constitution and said the mandate was the \"first step\" in preventing Modi from attempting to change it.\n\n\"The main message of these elections is, the era of coalition politics is back, that Modi's one-party domination model will not work anymore,\" says professor Ashwini Kumar, a political analyst from Mumbai. \"It also means that the BJP will have to put contentious ideological issues in cold storage, like the uniform civil code or simultaneous elections for state assembly and the Parliament.\"\n\nKapil Komireddi, author of Malevolent Republic: A Short History of the New India, warns that the BJP could \"poach\" elected lawmakers from other parties -- \"an art they have perfected.\"\n\n\"If this happens, the prime minister can be back to commanding a government with a majority in the Parliament,\" he says. \"The difference is, within his own party, everyone knows the magic has waned.\"", "source": {"uri":

Here's what to know", "body": "The world's largest election could also be one of its most consequential.\n\nIndia has close to 970 million voters among its more than 1.4 billion people, and its general election pits Prime Minister Narendra Modi, an avowed Hindu nationalist, against a broad alliance of opposition parties that are struggling to play catch up.\n\nIndia under Modi is a rising global power, but his rule has also been marked by rising unemployment, attacks by Hindu nationalists against minorities, particularly Muslims, and a shrinking space for dissent and free media.\n\nHOW DOES THE ELECTION WORK?\n\nThe final day of voting in the 6-week-long election was Saturday. The vote counting will start Tuesday and will be updated throughout the day. The election results will likely be known the same day.\n\nThe voters are choosing 543 members for the lower house of Parliament for a five-year term.\n\nIndia has a first-past-the-post multiparty electoral system in which the candidate who receives the most votes wins. To secure a majority, a party or coalition must breach the mark of 272 seats.\n\nWHO IS RUNNING?\n\nModi's Bharatiya Janata Party and his main challenger, Rahul Gandhi of the Indian National Congress, represent Parliament's two largest factions. Several other important regional parties are part of an opposition bloc.\n\nOpposition parties, which previously were fractured, have united under a front called INDIA, or Indian National Developmental Inclusive Alliance, to deny Modi a a third straight election victory.\n\nThe alliance has fielded a single main candidate in most constituencies. But it has been roiled by ideological differences and personality clashes, and has not yet decided on its candidate for prime minister.\n\nMost exit polls project Modi is set to extend his decade in power with a third consecutive term, especially after he opened a Hindu temple in northern Ayodhya city in January, which fulfilled his party's long-held Hindu nationalist pledge. During the polls Modi escalated polarizing rhetoric in incendiary speeches that targeted the country's Muslim minority.\n\nAnother victory would cement Modi as one of the country's most popular and important leaders. It would follow a thumping win in 2019, when the BJP clinched an absolute majority by sweeping 303 parliamentary seats. The Congress party managed only 52 seats.\n\nWHAT ARE THE BIG ISSUES?\n\nFor decades, India has clung doggedly to its democratic convictions, largely due to free elections, an independent judiciary, a thriving media, strong opposition and peaceful transition of power. Some of these credentials have eroded under Modi's 10-year rule, with the polls seen as a test for the country's democratic values.\n\nMany watchdogs have now categorized India as a \"hybrid regime\" that is neither a full democracy nor a full autocracy.\n\nThe poll results will also test Modi's limits. Critics accuse him of running on a Hindu-first platform, endangering the country's secular roots.\n\nUnder Modi, the media, once viewed as vibrant and largely independent, have become more pliant and critical voices muzzled.Courts have largely bent to Modi's will and given favorable verdicts in crucial cases. Centralization of executive power has strained India's federalism. And federal agencies have bogged down top opposition leaders in corruption cases, which they deny.\n\nAnother key issue is India's large economy, which is among the fastest growing in the world. It has helped India emerge as a global power and a counterweight to China. But even as India's growth soars by some measures, the Modi government has struggled to generate enough jobs for young Indians, and instead has relied on welfare programs like free food and housing to woo voters.", "source": {"uri": "nation.com.pk", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Nation"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hindu_nationalism", "type": "wiki",

REUTERS/Adnan Abidi\n\nBy YP Rajesh, Sakshi Dayal and Shivangi Acharya\n\nNEW DELHI (Reuters) -Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi's alliance raced to a majority in early vote counting trends in the general election on Tuesday, but the numbers were well short of the landslide predicted in exit polls, TV channels showed.\n\nThe early see-saw trends spooked markets with stocks falling steeply. The blue-chip NIFTY 50 was down 4.4% and the S&P BSE Sensex was down 4.2% at 0600 GMT.\n\nThe rupee also fell sharply against the dollar and benchmark bond yields were up.\n\nThe markets had soared on Monday after exit polls on June 1 projected Modi and his Hindu nationalist Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) would register a big victory, with its National Democratic Alliance (NDA) seen getting a two-thirds majority and more.\n\nAt 0600 GMT, TV channels showed the NDA was ahead in nearly 300 of the 543 elective seats in parliament, where 272 is a simple majority, in early counting. The opposition INDIA alliance led by Rahul Gandhi's centrist Congress party was leading in over 220 seats, higher than expected.\n\nTV channels showed BJP accounted for nearly 250 of the seats in which the NDA was leading, short of a majority on its own, compared to the 303 it won in 2019.\n\nA third Modi term with a slim majority for BJP - or having to depend on NDA allies for a majority - could introduce some uncertainty into governance as Modi has ruled with an authoritative hold over the government in the last decade.\n\nHowever, politicians and analysts said it was too early to get a firm idea of the voting trends since a majority of ballots were yet to be counted.\n\n\"It's a fair assessment to say 400 at the moment certainly looks distant,\" BJP spokesperson Nalin Kohli told the India Today TV channel, referring to some projections that gave 400 seats to the NDA.\n\n\"But we need to wait...to have a final picture of the seats because the exit polls speak of a massive sweep, (and) the counting trends currently don't seem to match that,\" he said.\n\n\"The BJP-NDA will form the government, that trend is very clear from the start,\" he added.\n\nTV exit polls broadcast after voting ended on June 1 projected a big win for Modi, but exit polls have often got election outcomes wrong in India. Nearly one billion people were registered to vote, of which 642 million turned out.\n\nHowever, if Modi's victory is confirmed even by a slim margin, his BJP will have triumphed in a vitriolic campaign in which parties accused each other of religious bias and of posing a threat to sections of the population.\n\nSOME PANIC IN MARKETS\n\nInvestors had cheered the prospects of another Modi term, expecting it to deliver further years of strong economic growth and pro-business reforms, while the anticipated two-thirds majority in parliament would allow major changes to the constitution.\n\n\"The sharp drop in Nifty is because the results, although (in) early trends, present a picture that is a lot different from what the exit polls had shown,\" said Siddhartha Khemka, head of retail research at Motilal Oswal Financial Services in Mumbai.\n\n\"This is what has led to some panic, some concern. These trends are early trends, to be honest. The market does not want a hung parliament or a coalition government, where you will have a lot of delays in decision making,\" he said.\n\nThe seven-phase, seven-week poll that began on April 19 was held in searing summer heat with temperatures touching nearly 50\u00b0 Celsius (122\u00b0 Fahrenheit) in some parts.\n\nMore than 66% of registered voters turned out, just one percentage point lower than the previous election in 2019, squashing pre-poll concerns that voters might shun a contest thought to be a foregone conclusion in Modi's favour.\n\nModi, 73, who first swept to power in 2014 by promising growth and change, is seeking to be only the second prime minister after India's independence leader Jawaharlal Nehru to win three straight terms.\n\nHe began his campaign by showcasing his record in office including economic growth, welfare policies, national pride, Hindu nationalism and his own personal commitment to fulfilling promises which he called \"Modi's Guarantee\".\n\nHowever, he changed tack after low voter turnout in the first phase and accused the opposition, especially the Congress party, which leads an alliance of two dozen groups, of favouring India's 200 million Muslims - a shift analysts said made the campaign coarse and divisive.\n\nThey said the pivot may have been aimed at firing up the Hindu nationalist base of Modi's BJP to draw them to vote. Modi defended himself against criticism that he was stoking divisions between Hindus and Muslims to win votes and said that he was only faulting the opposition campaign.\n\nThe opposition INDIA alliance denied it favoured Muslims in the Hindu-majority country and said Modi would destroy the constitution if he returned to power and end affirmative action enjoyed by the so-called backward castes. The BJP rejects this.\n\n(Reporting by New Delhi and Mumbai bureaux; Writing by YP Rajesh; Editing by Michael Perry and Raju Gopalakrishnan)\n\nSign Up for Springs AM Update Your morning rundown of the latest news from Colorado Springs and around the country\n\nSign Up View all of our newsletters.

Turnout was around 66% on average across the seven phases, according to official data.\n\nThe tallying of votes at counting centers in each of the 543 constituencies where polls were held could stretch into the evening before a final result is declared by the Election Commission of India.\n\nBut leads will start to emerge earlier, which will give an idea of where the results may be headed.\n\nIn his 10 years in power, Modi has transformed India's political landscape. His popularity has outstripped that of his party's, and has turned a parliamentary election into one that increasingly resembles a presidential-style campaign. The result is that the BJP relies more and more on Modi's enduring brand to stay in power, with local politicians receding into the background even in state elections.\n\n\"Modi was not just the prime campaigner, but the sole campaigner of this election,\" said Yamini Aiyar, a public policy scholar.\n\nHis supporters see him as a self-made, strong leader who has improved India's standing in the world, and credit his pro-business policies with making the economy the world's fifth-largest.\n\nBut a decade of his leadership has also left the country deeply divided. Modi's critics and opponents say his Hindu-first politics have bred intolerance, hate speech and brazen attacks against the country's minorities, especially Muslims, who comprise 14% of the population.\n\nIndia's economy, one of the fastest-growing, has become more unequal under Modi. While stock markets reach record-highs and millionaires multiply, youth unemployment has soared, with only a small portion of Indians benefitting from the economic boom.\n\nThe country's democracy, Modi's critics say, is faltering under his government, which has increasingly wielded strong-arm tactics to subdue political opponents, squeeze independent media and quash dissent. The government has rejected such accusations and say democracy is flourishing.\n\nAs polls opened in mid-April, a confident BJP initially focused its campaign on \"Modi's guarantees,\" highlighting the economic and welfare achievements that his party says have reduced poverty. With him at the helm, \"India will become a developed nation by 2047,\" Modi repeated in rally after rally.\n\nBut the campaign turned increasingly shrill, as Modi ramped up polarizing rhetoric that targeted the Muslim minority, a tactic seen to energize his core Hindu majority voters.\n\nHis opposition, the INDIA alliance led by the Congress party, has attacked Modi over his Hindu nationalist politics. It hopes to benefit from the simmering economic discontent, and its campaign has rallied around issues of joblessness, inflation and inequality.\n\nBut the broad alliance of over a dozen political parties has been beset by ideological differences and defections, raising questions over their effectiveness. Meanwhile, the alliance has also claimed they've been unfairly targeted, pointing to a spree of raids, arrests and corruption investigations against their leaders by federal agencies they say are politically motivated. The government has denied this.", "source": {"uri": "bostonglobe.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Boston Globe"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/India", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "India"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bharatiya_Janata_Party", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Bharatiya Janata Party"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hindu_nationalism", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Hindu nationalism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Election_Commission_of_India", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Election Commission of India"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exit_poll", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Exit poll"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rahul_Gandhi", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Rahul Gandhi"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indian_National_Congress", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Indian National Congress"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electoral_district", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Electoral district"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muslims", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Muslims"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economy_of_India", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Economy of India"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Market_economy", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Market economy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_policy", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Public policy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hate_speech", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Hate speech"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democracy", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Democracy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stock_market", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Stock market"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hindus", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Hindus"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Independent_politician", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Independent politician"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Islam_in_India", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Islam in India"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Corruption", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Corruption"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Welfare", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Welfare"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economic_inequality", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Economic inequality"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unemployment", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Unemployment"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_government_of_the_United_States", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Federal government of the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inflation", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Inflation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Developed_country", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Developed country"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poverty", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Poverty"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Political_party", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Political party"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics", "wgt": 21}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Campaigns_and_Elections", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Campaigns and Elections", "wgt": 26}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Government_Operations", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Government Operations", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Democracy", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Democracy", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Humor", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Humor", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 99}], "image": "https://bostonglobe-prod.cdn.arcpublishing.com/resizer/GjmE98FHl1aw_mxq9VakNUAuRjE=/506x0/cloudfront-us-east-1.images.arcpublishing.com/bostonglobe/FQRG636KSRSGFXW43XCEXHAN7E.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9616128", "eventUri": "eng-9616128", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1372549019607843, "wgt": 163, "relevance": 1}

Praggnanandhaa achieved a significant milestone by...\n\nThe Indian democratic nation led by prime minister Narendra Modi, completed the Lok Sabha elections (general elections) voting phases since Tuesday (4) early morning the counting for votes began. The ruling government was expecting to cross 400 seats out of 543; unfortunately, they are falling short of many, not even crossing 300 seats.\n\nThe exit polls as per Indian media houses had predicted a landslide, but the numbers are falling short more than expected.\n\nEarly fluctuations on the see-saw rattled markets as stocks took a steep nosedive. Both the NIFTY 50 and the S&P BSE Sensex plummeted by over 2 per cent by 0500 GMT. The rupee also saw a decline against the dollar, while benchmark bond yields rose.\n\nMarkets had experienced a surge on Monday (3) following exit polls on June 1, projecting a significant victory for Modi and his Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP). The National Democratic Alliance (NDA), of which BJP is a part, was anticipated to secure a two-thirds majority and more.\n\nAt 0430 GMT, television channels indicated that the NDA was leading in nearly 300 of the 543 elective parliamentary seats, achieving a simple majority, based on early counting. The opposition INDIA alliance, led by Rahul Gandhi's Congress party, was ahead in over 200 seats, surpassing expectations.\n\nOnly about 10 percent to 15 percent of the total votes had been counted at that time, as reported by TV channels.\n\nBJP alone was leading in nearly 250 seats within the NDA, compared to the 303 seats it won in 2019. Trends also depicted Modi initially leading, then trailing, and leading again in his constituency of Varanasi, a Hindu holy city.\n\nThe initial votes counted were postal ballots, primarily cast by troops serving outside their home constituencies or officials on election duty away from home. This year, postal votes were also extended to voters over 85 years of age and people with disabilities, enabling them to vote from home.\n\nThe counting process is expected to continue for several hours as the bulk of votes cast through electronic voting machines (EVMs) are tallied after the initial 30 minutes of counting postal ballots.\n\n\"These are very early trends; we anticipate more accurate results as the day progresses,\" stated Congress spokesperson Pawan Khera.\n\nExit polls aired after the conclusion of voting on June 1 projected a significant win for Modi. However, exit polls in India have often failed to predict election outcomes accurately. Out of nearly one billion registered voters, 642 million participated in the election.\n\nIf Modi's victory is confirmed, his BJP will have succeeded in a contentious campaign marked by accusations of religious bias and threats to various population segments.\n\n\"The primary task of the next government will be to propel India towards prosperity before its population ages,\" remarked the Times of India in an editorial on Tuesday, referring to the youthful demographic of the world's most populous nation. \"Time is of the essence.\"\n\nOver one billion people were eligible to vote in the seven-phase, seven-week-long poll that commenced on April 19, amid scorching summer temperatures, reaching nearly 50\u00b0C (122\u00b0F) in some regions.\n\nDespite pre-poll concerns that voters might abstain from what seemed like a predetermined contest in favor of Modi, more than 66 percent of registered voters turned out, just one percentage point lower than the previous 2019 election.\n\nModi, 73, aiming to become only the second prime minister after India's independence leader Jawaharlal Nehru to secure three consecutive terms, began his campaign by highlighting his achievements in office, including economic growth, welfare policies, national pride, Hindu nationalism, and his personal commitment to fulfilling promises, which he termed \"Modi's Guarantee.\"\n\nHowever, he shifted his approach after low voter turnout in the initial phase, accusing the opposition, especially the Congress party, of favoring India's 200 million Muslims.

Who is he?", "body": "by: ASHOK SHARMA, SHEIKH SAALIQ and KRUTIKA PATHI, Associated Press\n\nNEW DELHI (AP) -- India's Prime Minister Narendra Modi, who claimed victory for his alliance in an election seen as a referendum on his decade in power, is a popular but polarizing leader who has presided over a fast-growing economy while advancing Hindu nationalism.\n\nModi, 73, is only the second Indian prime minister to win a third straight term.\n\nHis Hindu nationalist Bharatiya Janata Party failed to secure a majority on its own -- as it did in 2014 and 2019 -- after facing a stronger than expected challenge from the opposition. But together with other parties in his National Democratic Alliance, his bloc won enough seats for a slim parliamentary majority and to form his third consecutive government, Election Commission data showed Tuesday.\n\nTo supporters, Modi is a larger-than-life figure who has improved India's standing in the world, helped make its economy the world's fifth-largest, and streamlined the country's vast welfare program, which serves around 60% of the population. To some, he may even be more than human.\n\nBut to critics, he's a cult leader who has eroded India's democracy and advanced divisive politics targeting the Muslims who make up 14% of the country's population. They say he has also increasingly wielded strong-arm tactics to subdue political opponents, squeeze independent media and quash dissent.\n\nModi's government has rejected such accusations and says democracy is flourishing.\n\nPolitical analysts say Modi's victory was driven by social welfare programs that provided benefits from food to housing, and the strident Hindu nationalism that has consolidated a majority of Hindu votes for his party. Hindus make up 80% of India's population.\n\nThe economy is growing by 7% and more than 500 million Indians have opened bank accounts during Modi's tenure, but that growth hasn't created enough jobs, and inequality has worsened under his rule, according to some economists.\n\nModi began his election campaign two months ago by promising to turn India into a developed country by 2047 and focused on highlighting his administration's welfare policies and a robust digital infrastructure that have benefited millions of Indians.\n\nBut as the campaign progressed, he increasingly resorted to anti-Muslim rhetoric, calling them \"infiltrators\" and making references to a Hindu nationalist claim that Muslims were overtaking the Hindu population by having more children. Modi also accused the opposition of pandering to the minority community.\n\nConspicous piety has long been a centerpiece of Modi's brand, but he's also begun suggesting that he was chosen by God.\n\nIn a TV interview during the campaign, he said \"When my mother was alive, I used to believe that I was born biologically. After she passed away, upon reflecting on all my experiences, I was convinced that God had sent me.\"\n\nIn January, he delivered on a longstanding Hindu nationalist ambition by leading the opening of a controversial temple on the site of a razed mosque.\n\nAfter campaigning ended last week, Modi went to a Hindu spiritual site for a televised 45-hour meditation retreat. Most Indian TV channels spent hours showing the event.\n\nBorn in 1950 to a lower-caste family in western Gujarat state, as a young boy Modi joined the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh, a paramilitary, right-wing group which has long been accused of stoking hatred against Muslims. RSS is the ideological parent of Modi's BJP.\n\nThe tea seller's son got his first big political break in 2001, becoming chief minister of his home state of Gujarat. A few months in, anti-Muslim riots ripped through the region, killing at least 1,000 people. There were suspicions that Modi quietly supported the riots, but he has denied the allegations.\n\nIn 2005, the U.S. revoked Modi's visa, citing concerns that he did not act to stop the communal violence. An investigation approved by the Indian Supreme Court later absolved Modi, but the stain of the dark moment has lingered.\n\nThirteen years later, Modi led his Hindu nationalist party to a spectacular victory in the 2014 national elections after promising sweeping reforms to jumpstart India's flagging economy.\n\nBut Modi's critics and opponents say his Hindu-first politics have bred intolerance, hate speech and brazen attacks against the country's minorities, especially Muslims.\n\nMonths after securing a second term in 2019, his government revoked the special status of disputed Kashmir, the country's only Muslim-majority state, and split it into two federally governed territories. His government passed a law that grants citizenship to religious minorities from Muslim countries in the region but excludes Muslims.\n\nDecision like these have made Modi hugely popular among his diehard supporters who hail him as the champion of the Hindu majority and see India emerging as a Hindu majoritarian state.\n\nModi has spent his political life capitalizing on religious tensions for political gain, said Christophe Jaffrelot, a political scientist and expert on Modi and the Hindu right. During his time as a state leader, he pioneered a embrace of Hindu nationalism unlike anything seen before in Indian politics.\n\n\"That style has remained. It was invented in Gujarat and today it is a national brand,\" Jaffrelot said.", "source": {"uri": "ktalnews.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "KTALnews.com"}, "authors": [{"uri":

But together with other parties in his National Democratic Alliance, his bloc won enough seats for a slim parliamentary majority and to form his third consecutive government, Election Commission data showed Tuesday.\n\nTo supporters, Modi is a larger-than-life figure who has improved India\u00b4s standing in the world, helped make its economy the world\u00b4s fifth-largest, and streamlined the country\u00b4s vast welfare program, which serves around 60% of the population. To some, he may even be more than human.\n\nBut to critics, he\u00b4s a cult leader who has eroded India\u00b4s democracy and advanced divisive politics targeting the Muslims who make up 14% of the country\u00b4s population. They say he has also increasingly wielded strong-arm tactics to subdue political opponents, squeeze independent media and quash dissent.\n\nModi\u00b4s government has rejected such accusations and says democracy is flourishing.\n\nPrime Minister Narendra Modi is garlanded by senior Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) leaders Rajnath Singh, left, party President JP Nadda, right, and Amit Shah, at the party headquarters in New Delhi, India, Tuesday, June 4, 2024. (AP Photo/Manish Swarup)\n\nPolitical analysts say Modi\u00b4s victory was driven by social welfare programs that provided benefits from food to housing, and the strident Hindu nationalism that has consolidated a majority of Hindu votes for his party. Hindus make up 80% of India\u00b4s population.\n\nThe economy is growing by 7% and more than 500 million Indians have opened bank accounts during Modi's tenure, but that growth hasn't created enough jobs, and inequality has worsened under his rule, according to some economists.\n\nModi began his election campaign two months ago by promising to turn India into a developed country by 2047 and focused on highlighting his administration's welfare policies and a robust digital infrastructure that have benefited millions of Indians.\n\nBut as the campaign progressed, he increasingly resorted to anti-Muslim rhetoric, calling them \"infiltrators\" and making references to a Hindu nationalist claim that Muslims were overtaking the Hindu population by having more children. Modi also accused the opposition of pandering to the minority community.\n\nConspicous piety has long been a centerpiece of Modi's brand, but he's also begun suggesting that he was chosen by God.\n\nIn a TV interview during the campaign, he said \"When my mother was alive, I used to believe that I was born biologically. After she passed away, upon reflecting on all my experiences, I was convinced that God had sent me.\"\n\nIn January, he delivered on a longstanding Hindu nationalist ambition by leading the opening of a controversial temple on the site of a razed mosque.\n\nAfter campaigning ended last week, Modi went to a Hindu spiritual site for a televised 45-hour meditation retreat. Most Indian TV channels spent hours showing the event.\n\nBorn in 1950 to a lower-caste family in western Gujarat state, as a young boy Modi joined the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh, a paramilitary, right-wing group which has long been accused of stoking hatred against Muslims. RSS is the ideological parent of Modi's BJP.\n\nThe tea seller's son got his first big political break in 2001, becoming chief minister of his home state of Gujarat. A few months in, anti-Muslim riots ripped through the region, killing at least 1,000 people. There were suspicions that Modi quietly supported the riots, but he has denied the allegations.\n\nIn 2005, the U.S. revoked Modi\u00b4s visa, citing concerns that he did not act to stop the communal violence. An investigation approved by the Indian Supreme Court later absolved Modi, but the stain of the dark moment has lingered.\n\nThirteen years later, Modi led his Hindu nationalist party to a spectacular victory in the 2014 national elections after promising sweeping reforms to jumpstart India\u00b4s flagging economy.\n\nBut Modi's critics and opponents say his Hindu-first politics have bred intolerance, hate speech and brazen attacks against the country\u00b4s minorities, especially Muslims.\n\nMonths after securing a second term in 2019, his government revoked the special status of disputed Kashmir, the country\u00b4s only Muslim-majority state, and split it into two federally governed territories. His government passed a law that grants citizenship to religious minorities from Muslim countries in the region but excludes Muslims.\n\nDecision like these have made Modi hugely popular among his diehard supporters who hail him as the champion of the Hindu majority and see India emerging as a Hindu majoritarian state.\n\nModi has spent his political life capitalizing on religious tensions for political gain, said Christophe Jaffrelot, a political scientist and expert on Modi and the Hindu right. During his time as a state leader, he pioneered a embrace of Hindu nationalism unlike anything seen before in Indian politics.\n\n\"That style has remained. It was invented in Gujarat and today it is a national brand,\" Jaffrelot said.\n\nFILE- Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi during the inauguration of Kashi Vishwanath Dham Corridor, a promenade that connects the sacred Ganges River with the centuries-old temple dedicated to Lord Shiva in Varanasi, India, Monday, Dec. 13, 2021.

Early trends on TV channels showed the opposition INDIA alliance leading in more than 60 seats.\n\nThe first votes counted are postal ballots, which are paper ballots, mostly cast by troops serving outside their home constituencies or officials away from home on election duty. This year, postal votes were also offered to voters over 85 years of age and people with disabilities to allow them to vote from home.\n\nTV exit polls broadcast after voting ended on June 1 projected a big win for Modi, but exit polls have often got election outcomes wrong in India. Nearly one billion people were registered to vote, of which 642 million turned out. However, if Modi's victory is confirmed, his BJP will have triumphed in a vitriolic campaign in which parties accused each other of religious bias and of posing a threat to sections of the population.\n\nInvestors have already cheered the prospects of another Modi term, expecting it to deliver further years of strong economic growth and pro-business reforms, while a possible two-thirds majority in parliament could allow major changes to the constitution, rivals and critics fear. \"The next government's main task will be to set India on the path of getting rich before it ages,\" the Times of India newspaper said in an editorial on Tuesday, referring to the young, working age population in the world's most populous nation. \"The clock's ticking.\"\n\nIndia stock futures edged higher and the rupee was steady before the count began at 8:00 a.m. (0230 GMT) on Tuesday. The NIFTY 50 index futures rose 0.21% in early trade, according to NSE International Exchange data, and was looking at another record high open. TV exit polls released on Saturday after voting ended projected the BJP-led National Democratic Alliance could win a two-thirds majority in the 543-member lower house of parliament.\n\nSeveral major polls projected the BJP alone could win more than the 303 it won in 2019. MARKETS CHEER\n\nThe projections pushed Indian shares to lifetime highs on Monday while the rupee gained and bond yields dropped. Nearly one billion people were eligible to vote in the seven-phase, seven-week poll which began on April 19 and held in searing summer heat with temperatures touching nearly 50\u00b0 Celsius (122\u00b0 Fahrenheit) in some parts.\n\nMore than 66% of registered voters turned out, just one percentage point lower than the previous election in 2019, squashing pre-poll concerns that voters might shun a contest thought to be a foregone conclusion in Modi's favour. Modi, 73, who first swept to power in 2014 by promising growth and change, is seeking to be only the second prime minister after India's independence leader Jawaharlal Nehru to win three straight terms.\n\nHe began his campaign by showcasing his record in office including economic growth, welfare policies, national pride, Hindu nationalism and his own personal commitment to fulfilling promises which he called \"Modi's Guarantee\". However, he changed tack after low voter turnout in the first phase and accused the opposition, especially the Congress party which leads an alliance of two dozen groups, of favouring India's 200 million Muslims - a shift analysts said made the campaign coarse and divisive.\n\nThey said the pivot may have been aimed at firing up the Hindu nationalist base of Modi's Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) to draw them to vote. Modi defended himself against criticism that he was stoking divisions between Hindus and Muslims to win votes and said that he was only faulting the opposition campaign. The opposition INDIA alliance, led by Rahul Gandhi's Congress party, denied it favoured Muslims in the Hindu-majority country and said Modi would destroy the constitution if he returned to power and end affirmative action enjoyed by the so-called backward castes. The BJP rejects this.\n\nThe opposition alliance also promised more welfare measures and handouts, with surveys saying unemployment, inflation and rural distress were the main concerns of voters.\n\n(This story has not been edited by Devdiscourse staff and is auto-generated from a syndicated feed.)", "source": {"uri": "devdiscourse.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Devdiscourse"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exit_poll", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Exit poll"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bharatiya_Janata_Party", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Bharatiya Janata Party"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Narendra_Modi", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Narendra Modi"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parliament", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Parliament"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/India", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "India"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lower_house", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Lower house"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Postal_voting", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Postal voting"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rupee", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Rupee"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supermajority", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Supermajority"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disability", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Disability"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ballot", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Ballot"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electoral_district", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Electoral district"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economic_growth", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Economic growth"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Democratic_Alliance", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "National Democratic Alliance"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Times_of_India", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "The Times of India"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Market_economy", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Market economy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constitution", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Constitution"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hindus", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Hindus"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muslims", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Muslims"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hindu_nationalism", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Hindu nationalism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Affirmative_action", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Affirmative action"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rahul_Gandhi", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Rahul Gandhi"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jawaharlal_Nehru", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Jawaharlal Nehru"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Percentage_point", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Percentage point"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indian_National_Congress", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Indian National Congress"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Other_Backward_Class", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Other Backward Class"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indian_independence_movement", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Indian independence movement"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Welfare", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Welfare"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Campaigns_and_Elections", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Campaigns and Elections", "wgt": 26}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Activism/Strategies", "label": "dmoz/Society/Activism/Strategies", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Online_Issues_Polls", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Online Issues Polls", "wgt": 17}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 62}], "image": "https://www.devdiscourse.com/remote.axd?https://devdiscourse.blob.core.windows.net/devnews/13_04_2023_16_29_52_9798584.jpg?width=920&format=jpeg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9616128", "eventUri": "eng-9616128", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-06-01", "textStart": 683, "textEnd": 689}, {"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-04-19", "textStart": 2379, "textEnd": 2387}], "sentiment": 0.09019607843137245, "wgt": 160, "relevance": 1}

The opposition bloc, known as the Indian National Developmental Inclusive Alliance, was on course to win 229 seats, the results showed.\n\nModi claimed victory for his coalition in a post on X, calling it a \"historical feat.\"\n\n\"I assure the countrymen that to fulfill their aspirations, we will move forward with new energy, new enthusiasm and new resolve,\" Modi said. He was set to address the nation later on Tuesday.\n\nIndia's stocks had their worst day in more than four years, as it became clear the election outcome would be much closer than expected. Markets had hit a record high on Monday after exit polls released over the weekend showed Modi would coast to an easy victory in the marathon, six-week election. Before voting kicked off on April 19, the prime minister had boldly predicted that his alliance would win a whopping 400 seats.\n\n\"This is not an election -- it is a kind of political earthquake,\" said Niranjan Sahoo, senior fellow with the New Delhi-based Observer Research Foundation who has written several books on Indian politics. \"Even if Modi becomes the prime minister, his position will be diminished to a great extent. He will not be the same Modi.\"\n\nIndia Election Results 2024 -- Follow Live Results\n\nModi now needs to secure the support of two key members of his broader National Democratic Alliance who control some 30 seats -- enough to flip the balance of power in parliament. Leaders of those two parties have a history of switching sides, and only joined up with Modi a few months ago, making it unclear whether they will stick with him or back the opposition bloc. A spokesperson of the allies, the Telugu Desam Party in the southern state of Andhra Pradesh, affirmed support for Modi's coalition.\n\nMore than 20 opposition parties, spearheaded by Rahul Gandhi, formed a united front in a bid to stop Modi's once-dominant electoral machine. A mixture of regional and caste-based groups, the alliance focused on appealing to voters who felt left out of India's growth story, which has been marked by growing inequality, pervasive joblessness and rising living costs.\n\nAfter the results became clear, Gandhi said the election showed that voters don't want Modi to run the country. The opposition alliance would meet on Wednesday to discuss next steps, he added.\n\n\"We do not like the way they have run this country for the last 10 years,\" Gandhi told reporters on Tuesday. \"That is a huge message to Mr. Narendra Modi.\"\n\nThe result is a stunning disappointment for the 73-year-old leader, who has been the main face of the BJP's election campaign and built the party primarily around himself. Besides raising questions about Modi's own future as prime minister, a weak coalition government will likely make it difficult for him to push through tough economic reforms or further his Hindu nationalist agenda assuming he returns to power.\n\nThe lackluster performance marks the first major setback at national polls for Modi. He had looked unbeatable heading into the election, backed by one of the world's fastest-growing economies and the fulfillment of key promises appealing to India's Hindu majority, including the building of a temple on the site where a 500-year-old mosque had been torn down.\n\nSigns of trouble for Modi emerged after the first of seven rounds of voting. A dip in turnout triggered a broad get-out-the-vote effort that saw Modi adopt a more strident tone, firing up his Hindu nationalist base with divisive anti-Muslim rhetoric and attacks on the opposition's welfare policies.\n\nModi had appealed to India's 1.4 billion people with a combination of business-friendly policies, welfare measures for the poor and Hindu nationalist policies. He had pledged more of the same in his third term, vowing measures to create jobs while also replacing India's religion-based marriage and inheritance laws with a uniform civil code -- a measure that Muslims, Christians and other minorities oppose because it would prevent them from adhering to some faith-based laws.\n\nThose more contentious proposals may now be off the table. The results also call into question whether Modi would have the political capital to implement contentious changes to land and labor laws, as well as a slew of other reform measures needed to achieve his goal of turning India into a developed nation by mid-century.\n\nEven with a reduced mandate or a change in government, India's growth trajectory should largely remain positive. Business leaders from Elon Musk to Jamie Dimon have hailed India's potential as an alternative to China, with some economists projecting that the nation's $3.5 trillion economy can become the largest contributor to global growth within the next five years.\n\n\"As far as economic policy is concerned, fiscal backsliding I think is a risk,\" said Shumita Sharma Deveshwar, senior director of India Research at Global Data.TS Lombard. \"Apart from that I actually don't see much of a change in terms of reform policies. Even with a strong majority, Modi was unable to implement much of the so-called big bang reforms.\"\n\n--With assistance from Debjit Chakraborty, Akriti Sharma, Shruti Srivastava, Menaka Doshi, Rakesh

The 642 million votes will be counted on Tuesday, with TV exit polls projecting Modi's Bharatiya Janata Party-led alliance could win a two-thirds majority in the lower house of parliament.\n\nIndia's Prime Minister Narendra Modi is expected to win a record-equalling third consecutive term in office on Tuesday when the 642 million votes cast in the world's largest election are counted.\n\nExit polls have projected a big win for Modi and if they are confirmed -- they have often got the outcome wrong in India -- Modi's Hindu nationalists will have triumphed in a vitriolic campaign in which parties accused each other of religious bias and of posing a threat to sections of the population.\n\nInvestors have already cheered the prospects of another Modi term, expecting it to deliver for India further years of strong economic growth and pro-business reforms, while rivals and critics fear a possible two-thirds majority in parliament could allow major changes to the constitution.\n\nNearly 1 billion people were eligible to vote in the seven-phase, seven-week poll which began on April 19 and concluded on June 1, held in searing summer heat with temperatures touching nearly 50 degrees Celsius in some parts.\n\nYet more than 66 per cent of registered voters turned out, just 1 percentage point lower than the previous election in 2019, belying fears that voters might shun a contest thought to be a foregone conclusion in Modi's favour.\n\nModi, 73, who first swept to power in 2014 by promising growth and change, is seeking to be only the second prime minister after India's independence leader Jawaharlal Nehru to win three straight terms.\n\nHe began his campaign by showcasing his record in office including economic growth, welfare policies, national pride, Hindu nationalism and his own personal commitment to fulfilling promises which he called \"Modi's Guarantee\".\n\nHowever, he changed tack after low voter turnout in the first phase and accused the opposition, especially the Congress party which leads an alliance of two dozen groups, of favouring India's 200 million Muslims -- a shift analysts said made the campaign coarse and divisive.\n\nThey said the pivot may have been aimed at firing up the Hindu nationalist base of Modi's Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) to draw them to vote. Modi defended himself against criticism that he is stoking divisions between Hindus and Muslims to win votes and said that he was only faulting the opposition campaign.\n\nThe opposition INDIA alliance, led by Rahul Gandhi's Congress party, denied it favoured Muslims in the Hindu-majority country and said Modi would destroy the constitution if he returned to power and end affirmative action enjoyed by the so-called backward castes. The BJP rejects this.\n\nThe opposition alliance also promised more welfare measures and handouts, with surveys saying unemployment, inflation and rural distress were the main concerns of voters.\n\nTV exit polls released on Saturday after voting ended, projected the BJP-led National Democratic Alliance could win a two-thirds majority in the 543-member lower house of parliament.\n\nSeveral major polls projected the BJP alone could win more than the 303 it won in 2019.\n\nThe projections pushed Indian shares to lifetime highs on Monday while the rupee gained and bond yields dropped, as investors were buoyed by expectations of sustained economic growth.\n\nExit polls, which are conducted by polling agencies, have a patchy record in India, with analysts saying it is a challenge to get them right in the large and diverse country.\n\nOpposition parties dismissed them saying they were unscientific and did not reflect reality.\n\n\"We are very hopeful that our results are completely opposite to what the exit poll is saying,\" former Congress party president and Rahul Gandhi's mother, Sonia, said on Monday.", "source": {"uri": "abc.net.au", "dataType":

Critics and opponents say his Hindu-first politics have bred intolerance, hate speech and brazen attacks against the country's minorities, especially Muslims, who comprise 14% of the population.\n\nIndia's economy, one of the fastest-growing, has become unequal under Mr Modi. While stock markets reach record highs and millionaires multiply, youth unemployment has soared, with only a small portion of Indians benefitting from the economic boom.\n\nMr Modi's critics say the country's democracy is faltering under his government, which has increasingly used strong-arm tactics to subdue political opponents, squeeze independent media, and quash dissent. The government has rejected such accusations and says democracy is flourishing.\n\nAs polls opened in mid-April, a confident BJP initially focused its campaign on \"Modi's guarantees\", highlighting the economic and welfare achievements his party says have reduced poverty.\n\nHis opposition, the India alliance led by the Congress party, has attacked Mr Modi over his Hindu nationalist politics.\n\nThe alliance hopes to benefit from the simmering economic discontent, and its campaign has rallied around issues of joblessness, inflation, and inequality.\n\nBut the broad alliance of more than a dozen political parties has been beset by ideological differences and defections, raising questions over their effectiveness.\n\nThe alliance has also claimed they have been unfairly targeted, pointing to a spree of raids, arrests and corruption investigations against their leaders by federal agencies they say are politically motivated.

This is Modi's guarantee,\" he said, speaking in the third person.\n\nBJP FACING MAJOR UPSET IN UTTAR PRADESH\n\nPrime Minister Narendra Modi's Hindu nationalist party is facing a major upset in India's most populous state of Uttar Pradesh at the hands of a powerful regional group, Samajwadi Party, or Socialist Group.\n\nThe Samajwadi Party, led my Akhilesh Yadav, already had won 10 seats and was leading in another 28 seats. Its ally, the Congress party, won four seats and was leading in another two.\n\nModi's Bharatiya Janata Party had won 12 seats and was leading in 20 seats. Exit polls had predicted a landslide victory for BJP in all 80 seats.\n\nModi was among the winners in the state from the Varanasi constituency. Rahul Gandhi of the Congress party won in his family bastion of Rae Bareli.\n\nIn January, Modi inaugurated a massive temple for Lord Ram in Varanasi.\n\nRajendra Chaudhry, spokesperson for the Samajwadi Party, said: \"In this election, it seems Lord Ram has deserted the BJP.\"\n\nThe Samajwadi Party was founded in 1992 by Mulayam Singh Yadav, who served as its top elected official for several years. His son, Akhilesh Yadav, took over the party leadership after his death.\n\nMODI SAYS HIS COALITION ON THE PATH TO WIN A THIRD TERM\n\nPrime Minister Narendra Modi says his coalition is on the path to a third straight term in government after India's marathon election.\n\n\"People have placed their faith in NDA, for a third consecutive time! This is a historical feat in India's history,\" Modi said in a post on X, referring to the National Democratic Alliance headed by his party. He said he will continue to work and fulfil the aspirations of the people.\n\nAs Modi posted his comment, his coalition had won 128 seats and led in 157 races, according to the Election Commission. A total of 272 seats are needed to form a majority government.\n\nINDIA'S OPPOSITION SAYS STRONG SHOWING 'A WIN FOR DEMOCRACY'\n\nIndia's opposition Congress party has called its alliance's strong showing in the polls a \"win for democracy\" and a \"moral and political loss\" for Prime Minister Narendra Modi.\n\nCongress party President Mallikarjun Kharge told a news conference in New Delhi that because no party had a clear majority, the mandate was against Modi.\n\n\"Our fight has not ended yet. We will continue to fight for the country's development, for the constitution, for the benefit of the people,\" Kharge said.\n\nModi's coalition led in a majority of seats Tuesday in India's general election, according to early figures, but faced a stronger challenge from the opposition than expected.\n\nRahul Gandhi, the face of the Congress party's campaign, said the results showed India does not want Modi.\n\n\"People's clear message to PM Modi and Home Minister Amit shah is that we don't want you to run the nation,\" Gandhi said. \"The poorest of this country have defended the constitution of India.\"\n\nMODI WINS SEAT IN VARANASI\n\nPrime Minister Narendra Modi has won a seat in the Hindu holy city of Varanasi, where he ran in 2014 and 2019, India's Election Commission reported.\n\nModi won by more than 152,000 votes and secured 54% of total votes. He ran against the Congress party's Ajai Rai, who got 40%.\n\nVaranasi is located on the banks of the revered Ganges River and is part of Uttar Pradesh state, India's most populous, with around 200 million people.\n\nBJP LOSES SEAT IN AYODHYA, WHERE MODI OPENED A GRAND TEMPLE IN JANUARY\n\nPrime Minister Narendra Modi's party has lost a seat in the Ayodhya constituency, a deeply symbolic loss after he opened a grand but controversial Hindu temple there in January.\n\nThe Bharatiya Janata Party candidate, Lallu Singh, lost to a rival from the regional Samajwadi Party, Singh's poll agent Kamlesh Srivastava told The Associated Press.\n\nModi and his party had campaigned heavily at the temple dedicated to Lord Ram, built on the historic ruins of a mosque that was destroyed by Hindu mobs in 1992.\n\nExperts said the January opening, where Modi performed rituals inside the temple, marked the unofficial start of his campaign as they hoped it would resonate with his Hindu majority voters. Modi's government had turned it into a national event by organizing live screenings across the country and closing offices for half a day.\n\nThe BJP had held a seat in Ayodhya since 2014.\n\nMODI'S PARTY WINS 19, CONGRESS PARTY 4 SEATS IN CONFIRMED RACES\n\nWhile the vote counting is still continuing, results have been called for 28 parliamentary seats out of 542 so far.\n\nModi's Bharatiya Janata Party has won 19 seats, according to India's Election Commission, while the main opposition Congress party secured four seats. The rest went to different regional parties.\n\nVote tallying is expected to take all day Tuesday, but the count so far shows Modi's party leading in 224 seats with the Congress ahead in 98.\n\nEARLY TALLIES SHOW MODI'S BJP LEADING IN 25 OF 26 SEATS IN HIS HOME STATE\n\nEarly leads by India's election commission projected Modi's ruling Bharatiya Janata Party was leading in 25 of 26 seats in the prime minister's home state of Gujarat. But party leaders said they were not celebrating victory due to a recent blaze at an amusement park in the state that killed 27 people, including children.\n\nA massive fire broke out in May at an amusement park in the state's Rajkot city.\n\n\"We had decided that there will be no celebratory victory or beating of drums. So we are not celebrating,\" said C. R. Patil, a senior leader from Modi's party.\n\nMODI MAY NEED A COALITION TO KEEP HIS JOB\n\nPrime Minister Narendra Modi's ruling Hindu nationalist party appeared to be falling short of a majority in the early vote count Tuesday. If these trends hold, it would be a stunning setback to the populist prime minister who has never relied on coalition partners to govern.\n\nBharatiya Janata Party is still expected to form the new government and return Modi as the prime minister for a rare third consecutive term as his National Democratic Alliance was leading in about 290 seats. A majority requires 272 seats. BJP alone was leading in 242 seats.\n\nStill, that's not the strong finish Modi was aiming for after his party won landslide victories in the 2014 and 2019 elections.\n\nIf BJP doesn't win a majority on its own, it could \"be heavily dependent on the goodwill of its allies, which makes them critical players who we can expect will extract their pound of flesh, both in terms of policymaking as well as government formation,\" said Milan Vaishnav, director of the South Asia Program at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace.\n\n\"This would be truly, you know, uncharted territory, both for Indians as well as for the prime minister,\" Vaishnav said.\n\nSince coming to power in 2014, Modi's BJP has governed in a coalition government but has always had a majority on its own.\n\nINDIA'S MAIN STOCK INDICES CLOSE SHARPLY DOWN AS EARLY VOTE TALLIES SHOW A CLOSER RACE THAN EXPECTED\n\nAs the early vote count showed Prime Minister Narendra Modi's party facing a tighter than expected race, India's two main benchmark stock indices closed down sharply.\n\nThe NIFTY 50 and the BSE Sensex had hit new highs at the close of day Monday but dropped sharply Tuesday as the early vote figures started to come in.\n\nThey recovered slightly to each close down more than 5%.\n\nThe country's stock markets have boomed under Modi, whose pro-market policies have made him popular among India's corporations and businesspeople.\n\nEven if Modi's Bharatiya Janata Party does not secure a parliamentary majority on its own, early leads reported by India's Election Commission showed his coalition, which includes smaller parties, still could.\n\nJAILED POLITICIAN WINS NORTHERN BARAMULLA CONSTITUENCY AFTER OPPONENT CONCEDES\n\nA politician from disputed Kashmir who has been in New Delhi's Tihar Jail since 2019 in a terror funding case has won after his rival conceded defeat.\n\nSheikh Abdul Rashid from northern Baramulla constituency won as an independent candidate, beating former chief minister of the region Omar Abdullah.\n\n\"I think it's time to accept the inevitable,\" Abdullah wrote on X. \"I don't believe his victory will hasten his release from prison nor will the people of North Kashmir get the representation they have a right to but the voters have spoken and in a democracy that's all that matters.\"\n\nRashid's campaign was run by his two sons, hoping a win for him would lead to his release from prison. India and Pakistan have fought two wars over Kashmir, which is divided between the neighbors but claimed by both in its entirety. Modi's government revoked Indian-controlled Kashmir's semi-autonomous status during a 2019 security clampdown.\n\nRebel groups in the region have been fighting against Indian rule since 1989. Tens of thousands of people have been killed in the armed uprising and subsequent Indian military crackdown. The rebels want Kashmir to be united under Pakistani rule or become an independent country.\n\nOPPOSITION SHOWS SURPRISING EARLY LEADS IN UTTAR PRADESH, INDIA'S MOST POPULOUS STATE\n\nIndia's most populous state is showing surprising early leads for the opposition, despite being previously controlled by Modi's Hindu nationalist party.\n\nEarly tallies reported by the Election Commission showed the opposition Congress party and its ally, the Samajwadi Party, were leading on more than half the seats in the crucial northern Uttar Pradesh state ruled by a Hindu monk who is considered a future prime minister candidate by Modi supporters.\n\nUttar Pradesh sends the most lawmakers of any state -- 80 -- to Parliament. It has long been considered the biggest prize in Indian elections. It's also home to Ayodhya, where a Hindu temple was built on the site of a razed mosque.\n\nThe Samajwadi Party was leading in 35 seats, with Modi's Bharatiya Janata Party ahead in 34 seats. The Congress party was leading in seven seats.\n\nIn the 2019 election, BJP won 62 seats in the state.\n\nMODI'S BJP IS AHEAD IN EARLY TALLIES, BUT WITH A STRONGER OPPOSITION SHOWING THAN EXPECTED\n\nIndia's Election Commission says early counting of votes shows incumbent Prime Minister Narendra Modi's Bharatiya Janata Party comfortably ahead, but with a stronger than expected showing by the main opposition.\n\nSome six hours into counting, Modi's Hindu nationalist BJP was ahead in 236 constituencies and had won two -- including one uncontested -- of 543 parliamentary seats.\n\nThe main opposition Congress party was leading in 99 constituencies.\n\nThe Election Commission does not release data on the percentage of votes tallied, but counting is expected to go on through the day. A total of some 642 million votes are being counted in the world's largest democratic exercise.\n\nModi's party is part of the National Democratic Alliance, whose parties were leading in 283 constituencies according to the early count, including the two won by BJP. The Congress party is part of the INDIA alliance, which was leading in 232 constituencies.\n\nA total of 272 seats are needed for a majority in parliament.\n\nINDIAN MARKETS ARE DOWN SHARPLY AS EARLY TALLIES SHOW A STRONGER CHALLENGE FROM THE OPPOSITION THAN EXPECTED\n\nIndian markets, which closed at an all-time high Monday, were down sharply in midday trading Tuesday, after early leads showed fewer seats for Modi's governing BJP than had been expected.\n\nModi's party still showed a comfortable lead, according to early figures reported by India's election commission. but was facing a stronger challenge from the opposition than exit polls had projected.\n\nIndia's benchmark stock indices, the NIFTY 50 and the BSE Sensex, were both down by more than 8% before recovering slightly. This followed a dip of more than 3% when markets opened.\n\nThe country's stock markets have boomed under Modi, whose pro-market policies have made him popular among India's corporations and businesspeople.\n\nWORKERS TAKE HEAT PRECAUTIONS AS VOTES ARE COUNTED IN TEMPERATURES EXPECTED TOO REACH 106F\n\nTemperatures in the Indian capital were down Tuesday from highs in the past week of 45 degrees Celsius (113 degrees Fahrenheit), but election officials and political parties were nonetheless taking precautions as votes were being counted.\n\nWorkers carried cases of water into one air-conditioned counting station in New Delhi early in the morning in preparation, while tents outside for security personnel and others were outfitted with industrial evaporative coolers.\n\nTemperatures in the morning hovered around 37 C (99 F) in New Delhi and were expected to rise to 41 C (106 F) by the end of the day.\n\nAt the headquarters of the opposition Congress party, a tent was set up outside, equipped with evaporative coolers, for waiting media.\n\nWOMEN ARE A KEY VOTING BLOC IN INDIA'S 2024 ELECTION\n\nIndian women are a key voting bloc with more of them voting in recent elections than ever before. Most poll experts expect women voters to play a decisive role in determining the 2024 election results.\n\nPolitical parties have been wooing them with monthly cash handouts, subsidized cooking gas cylinders and low-interest loans. Many such programs have particularly helped Modi's Bharatiya Janata party widen its support among them, especially in rural areas. The opposition alliance also tried to gain women's votes by unveiling programs that promised financial aid of $1,200 per year to poor women, and promised to reserve 50% of government jobs for women if voted into power.\n\nWomen make up nearly 49% of India's total electorate. Turnout has grown in each recent major election -- of women who were eligible to vote, 53% voted in 2004; 56% in 2009; 65.5% in 2014; and 67% in 2019. Data for 2024 was not yet available but was estimated to resemble 2019's female voter turnout.\n\nCOUNTING STARTS WITH POSTAL BALLOTS THEN MOVES TO ELECTRONIC ONES\n\nThe counting of some 642 million votes cast in India's election is being done at various locations around the country by government employees. Chief election commissioner Rajiv Kumar said they were starting with postal ballots and then move on to combining the votes from India's electronic voting machines.\n\nThe process is expected to be completed by the end of the day Tuesday.\n\nIndia has close to 970 million eligible voters, and votes were cast at more than a million polling stations staggered over the last six weeks.\n\nThat brought the final phase into India's hottest season, with temperatures higher than 45 degrees Celsius (113 Fahrenheit) in some parts of the country, and Kumar said the election officials learned a valuable lesson.\n\n\"We should have completed the election at least one month before,\" he said ahead of the start of the counting. \"We shouldn't have let it continue into so much heat.\"\n\nFollow

The election results will likely be known the same day.\n\nVotes were cast at more than a million polling stations. Each of the seven voting phases lasted a single day with several constituencies across multiple states voting that day. The staggered polling allowed the government to transport election officials and voting machines and deploy tens of thousands of troops to prevent violence. Candidates crisscrossed the country, poll workers hiked to remote villages, and voters lined up for hours in sweltering heat.\n\nMillions of Indians waited anxiously as the election authority prepared to count on Tuesday 642 million votes polled in the national election during a grueling six-week period.\n\nSupporters of Prime Minister Narendra Modi' and his Hindu nationalist party were already in a celebratory mood with exit polls predicting a massive win and a third term for Modi as India's prime minister.\n\nMost exit polls project Modi is set to extend his decade in power with a third consecutive term, especially after he opened a Hindu temple in northern Ayodhya city in January, which fulfilled his party's long-held Hindu nationalist pledge.

The BJP was on course to lose almost 70 constituencies, winning just 240 seats, meaning it will have to rely on its alliance partners to achieve the 272 majority. The outcome so far is a distinct departure from the two-thirds majority that many exit polls had predicted at the weekend.\n\nMeanwhile, the opposition alliance, which goes by the acronym INDIA, appeared to far outperform expectations, collectively winning 234 seats, according to the early count. The alliance, formed of more than 20 national and regional opposition parties, had come together for the first time in this election with the aim of defeating Modi, who has been in power since 2014.\n\nThe early results were a particular triumph for the country's main opposition party and the BJP's main rival, Indian National Congress, which had dramatically lost the previous two elections to Modi and was facing questions about its future as a party. However, it appeared the Congress party had doubled its seats in this election.\n\nShould the results remain consistent as counting continues, it could have significant implications for India's political landscape after the polls. Since he was elected a decade ago, Modi and his Hindu nationalist BJP party have enjoyed a powerful majority, while the opposition - particularly the Congress party - have been seen as weak and unable to stand up to the might of the BJP.\n\nRelated: 'Modi builds highways but where are our jobs?': rising inequality looms over India's election\n\nBut the INDIA coalition proved more resilient than many analysts had expected and was boosted by strong performances by regional parties such as the Samajwadi party in Uttar Pradesh, the Trinamool Congress in West Bengal and Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam party in Tamil Nadu.\n\nOne of the biggest shocks of the early results was the apparent losses faced by the BJP in Uttar Pradesh, the country's most populous and politically important state, which has 80 seats and is seen as a bellwether for the rest of the country. Early counts showed that the INDIA alliance was ahead of the BJP's alliance, with parties gaining more than 30 seats.\n\nIn the aftermath of the election, it appears likely that Modi will have to face a more powerful and more animated opposition than at any point over the past decade. The results also indicate that the \"Modi wave\" has been dented by problems such as high unemployment and inflation.\n\nThe BJP is still likely to have an outright majority, meaning it can freely move forward with Modi's flagship Hindu nationalist agenda and economic changes in his third term. However, without the two-thirds parliamentary majority the party had aimed for, it will not be able to amend India's secular constitution, as many had feared.", "source": {"uri": "uk.news.yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo News UK"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Landslide_victory", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Landslide victory"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bharatiya_Janata_Party", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Bharatiya Janata Party"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Narendra_Modi", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Narendra Modi"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indian_National_Congress", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Indian National Congress"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/India", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "India"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elections_in_India", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Elections in India"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Snap_election", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Snap election"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exit_poll", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Exit poll"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supermajority", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Supermajority"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prime_minister", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Prime minister"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Majority_government", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Majority government"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uttar_Pradesh", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Uttar Pradesh"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Uttar Pradesh"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hindu_nationalism", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Hindu nationalism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Samajwadi_Party", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Samajwadi Party"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dravida_Munnetra_Kazhagam", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coalition_government", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Coalition government"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secularism", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Secularism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economic_inequality", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Economic inequality"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constitution", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Constitution"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inflation", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Inflation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tamil_Nadu", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Tamil Nadu"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Tamil Nadu"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/West_Bengal", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "West Bengal"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "West Bengal"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Entertainment/Party_Supplies", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Entertainment/Party Supplies", "wgt": 18}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Parties/Planning", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Parties/Planning", "wgt": 17}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Children/Parties", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Children/Parties", "wgt": 18}, {"uri": "dmoz/Home/Entertaining/Party_Planning", "label": "dmoz/Home/Entertaining/Party Planning", "wgt": 19}, {"uri": "dmoz/Home/Entertaining/Children", "label": "dmoz/Home/Entertaining/Children", "wgt": 17}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 81}], "image": "https://media.zenfs.com/en/theguardian_763/2280d06b1a0b75eb1ed3598d07c0df88", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9616128", "eventUri": "eng-9616128", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.2862745098039217, "wgt": 154, "relevance": 1}

It's a stunning blow to a leader who has dominated Indian politics since he first took power a decade ago.\n\nModi's Bharatiya Janata Party was leading in 240 seats, short of the 272 needed to form a government and well behind the 303 it won in the 2019 election. The opposition bloc, known as the Indian National Developmental Inclusive Alliance, was on course to win 229 seats, the results showed.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIndia's NSE Nifty 50 Index tumbled 5.9%, its worst day in more than four years, as it became clear the election outcome would be much closer than expected. Stocks had hit a record high on Monday after exit polls released over the weekend showed Modi would coast to an easy victory in the marathon, six-week election. Before voting kicked off on April 19, he had boldly predicted that his alliance would win a whopping 400 seats.\n\nAdvertisementBreaking News\n\nGet the latest breaking news from North Texas and beyond.\n\nSIGN UP\n\nOr with:\n\nGoogleFacebook\n\nBy signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy\n\n\"This is not an election - it is a kind of political earthquake,\" said Niranjan Sahoo, senior fellow with the New Delhi-based Observer Research Foundation who has written several books on Indian politics. \"Even if Modi becomes the prime minister, his position will be diminished to a great extent. He will not be the same Modi.\"\n\nModi now needs to secure the support of two key members of his broader National Democratic Alliance who control some 30 seats - enough to flip the balance of power in parliament. Leaders of those two parties have a history of switching sides, and only joined up with Modi a few months ago, making it unclear whether they will stick with him or back the opposition bloc.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMore than 20 opposition parties, spearheaded by Rahul Gandhi, formed a united front in a bid to stop Modi's once-dominant electoral machine. A mixture of regional and caste-based groups, the alliance focused on appealing to voters who felt left out of India's growth story, which has been marked by growing inequality, pervasive joblessness and rising living costs.\n\nAfter the results became clear, Gandhi said the election showed that voters don't want Modi to run the country. The opposition alliance would meet on Wednesday to discuss next steps, he added.\n\n\"We do not like the way they have run this country for the last 10 years,\" Gandhi told reporters on Tuesday. \"That is a huge message to Mr. Narendra Modi.\"\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe result is a disappointment for the 73-year-old leader, who has been the main face of the BJP's election campaign and built the party primarily around himself. Besides raising questions about Modi's own future as prime minister, a weak coalition government will likely make it difficult for him to push through tough economic reforms or further his Hindu nationalist agenda assuming he returns to power.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe lackluster performance marks the first major setback at national polls for Modi. He had looked unbeatable heading into the election, backed by one of the world's fastest-growing economies and the fulfillment of key promises appealing to India's Hindu majority, including the building of a temple on the site where a 500-year-old mosque had been torn down.\n\nSigns of trouble for Modi emerged after the first of seven rounds of voting. A dip in turnout triggered a broad get-out-the-vote effort that saw Modi adopt a more strident tone, firing up his Hindu nationalist base with divisive anti-Muslim rhetoric and attacks on the opposition's welfare policies.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nModi had appealed to India's 1.4 billion people with a combination of business-friendly policies, welfare measures for the poor and Hindu nationalist policies. He had pledged more of the same in his third term, vowing measures to create jobs while also replacing India's religion-based marriage and inheritance laws with a uniform civil code -- a measure that Muslims, Christians and other minorities oppose because it would prevent them from adhering to some faith-based laws.\n\nThose more contentious proposals may now be off the table. The results also call into question whether Modi would have the political capital to implement contentious changes to land and labor laws, as well as a slew of other reform measures needed to achieve his goal of turning India into a developed nation by mid-century.\n\nEven with a reduced mandate or a change in government, India's growth trajectory should largely remain positive. Business leaders from Elon Musk to Jamie Dimon have hailed India's potential as an alternative to China, with some economists projecting that the nation's $3.5 trillion economy can become the largest contributor to global growth within the next five years.\n\n\"As far as economic policy is concerned, fiscal backsliding I think is a risk,\" said Shumita Sharma Deveshwar, senior director of India Research at Global Data.TS Lombard. \"Apart from that I actually don't see much of a change in terms of reform policies. Even with a strong majority, Modi was unable to implement much of the so-called big bang reforms.\"\n\nAdvertisement\n\n- By Swati Gupta and Dan Strumpf for Bloomberg with assistance from Debjit Chakraborty, Akriti Sharma, Shruti Srivastava, Menaka Doshi, Rakesh Sharma and Preeti Soni.\n\nRelated StoriesRead MoreWhat to know as votes are counted in India's electionVotes were cast through Saturday at more than a million polling stations in India.

This election, marked by high voter turnout and a divisive campaign, could bring substantial economic reforms and constitutional changes, despite opposition concerns.\n\nIndia's Prime Minister Narendra Modi is expected to win a record-equalling third consecutive term in office on Tuesday when the 642 million votes cast in the world's largest election are counted. Exit polls have projected a big win for Modi and if they are confirmed - they have often got the outcome wrong in India - Modi's Hindu nationalists will have triumphed in a vitriolic campaign in which parties accused each other of religious bias and of posing a threat to sections of the population.\n\nInvestors have already cheered\n\nthe prospects of another Modi term, expecting it to deliver for India further years of strong economic growth and pro-business reforms, while a possible two-thirds majority in parliament could allow major changes to the constitution, rivals and critics fear. Nearly one billion people were eligible to vote in the seven-phase, seven-week poll which began on April 19 and concluded on June 1, held in searing summer heat with temperatures touching nearly 50\u00b0 Celsius (122\u00b0 Fahrenheit) in some parts.\n\nYet more than 66% of registered voters turned out, just one percentage point lower than the previous election in 2019, belying fears that voters might shun a contest thought to be a foregone conclusion in Modi's favour. Modi, 73, who first swept to power in 2014 by promising growth and change, is seeking to be only the second prime minister after India's independence leader Jawaharlal Nehru to win three straight terms.\n\nHe began his campaign by showcasing his record in office including economic growth, welfare policies, national pride, Hindu nationalism and his own personal commitment to fulfilling promises which he called \"Modi's Guarantee\". However, he changed tack after low voter turnout in the first phase and accused the opposition, especially the Congress party which leads an alliance of two dozen groups, of favouring India's 200 million Muslims - a shift analysts said made the campaign coarse and divisive.\n\nThey said the pivot may have been aimed at firing up the Hindu nationalist base of Modi's Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) to draw them to vote. Modi defended himself against criticism that he is stoking divisions between Hindus and Muslims to win votes and said that he was only faulting the opposition campaign. VERY HOPEFUL, SAYS OPPOSITION\n\nThe opposition INDIA alliance, led by Rahul Gandhi's Congress party, denied it favoured Muslims in the Hindu-majority country and said Modi would destroy the constitution if he returned to power and end affirmative action enjoyed by the so-called backward castes. The BJP rejects this. The opposition alliance also promised more welfare measures and handouts, with surveys saying unemployment, inflation and rural distress were the main concerns of voters.\n\nTV exit polls released on Saturday after voting ended projected the BJP-led National Democratic Alliance could win a two-thirds majority in the 543-member lower house of parliament. Several major polls projected the BJP alone could win more than the 303 it won in 2019.\n\nThe projections pushed Indian shares to lifetime highs on Monday while the rupee gained and bond yields dropped, as investors were buoyed by expectations of sustained economic growth. Exit polls, which are conducted by polling agencies, have a patchy record in India, with analysts saying it is a challenge to get them right in the large and diverse country.\n\nOpposition parties dismissed them saying they were unscientific and did not reflect reality. \"We are very hopeful that our results are completely opposite to what the exit poll is saying,\" former Congress party president and Rahul Gandhi's mother, Sonia, said on Monday.\n\n(This story has not been edited by Devdiscourse staff and is auto-generated from a syndicated feed.)", "source": {"uri":

It's a stunning blow to a leader who has dominated Indian politics since he first took power a decade ago.\n\nModi's Bharatiya Janata Party was leading in 240 seats, short of the 272 needed to form a government and well behind the 303 it won in the 2019 election. The opposition bloc, known as the Indian National Developmental Inclusive Alliance, was on course to win 229 seats, the results showed.\n\nIndia's NSE Nifty 50 Index tumbled 5.9%, its worst day in more than four years, as it became clear the election outcome would be much closer than expected. Stocks had hit a record high on Monday after exit polls released over the weekend showed Modi would coast to an easy victory in the marathon, six-week election. Before voting kicked off on April 19, he had boldly predicted that his alliance would win a whopping 400 seats.\n\n\"This is not an election - it is a kind of political earthquake,\" said Niranjan Sahoo, senior fellow with the New Delhi-based Observer Research Foundation who has written several books on Indian politics. \"Even if Modi becomes the prime minister, his position will be diminished to a great extent. He will not be the same Modi.\"\n\nModi now needs to secure the support of two key members of his broader National Democratic Alliance who control some 30 seats - enough to flip the balance of power in parliament. Leaders of those two parties have a history of switching sides, and only joined up with Modi a few months ago, making it unclear whether they will stick with him or back the opposition bloc.\n\nMore than 20 opposition parties, spearheaded by Rahul Gandhi, formed a united front in a bid to stop Modi's once-dominant electoral machine. A mixture of regional and caste-based groups, the alliance focused on appealing to voters who felt left out of India's growth story, which has been marked by growing inequality, pervasive joblessness and rising living costs.\n\nAfter the results became clear, Gandhi said the election showed that voters don't want Modi to run the country. The opposition alliance would meet on Wednesday to discuss next steps, he added.\n\n\"We do not like the way they have run this country for the last 10 years,\" Gandhi told reporters on Tuesday. \"That is a huge message to Mr. Narendra Modi.\"\n\nThe result is a disappointment for the 73-year-old leader, who has been the main face of the BJP's election campaign and built the party primarily around himself. Besides raising questions about Modi's own future as prime minister, a weak coalition government will likely make it difficult for him to push through tough economic reforms or further his Hindu nationalist agenda assuming he returns to power.\n\nThe lackluster performance marks the first major setback at national polls for Modi. He had looked unbeatable heading into the election, backed by one of the world's fastest-growing economies and the fulfillment of key promises appealing to India's Hindu majority, including the building of a temple on the site where a 500-year-old mosque had been torn down.\n\nSigns of trouble for Modi emerged after the first of seven rounds of voting. A dip in turnout triggered a broad get-out-the-vote effort that saw Modi adopt a more strident tone, firing up his Hindu nationalist base with divisive anti-Muslim rhetoric and attacks on the opposition's welfare policies.\n\nModi had appealed to India's 1.4 billion people with a combination of business-friendly policies, welfare measures for the poor and Hindu nationalist policies. He had pledged more of the same in his third term, vowing measures to create jobs while also replacing India's religion-based marriage and inheritance laws with a uniform civil code - a measure that Muslims, Christians and other minorities oppose because it would prevent them from adhering to some faith-based laws.\n\nThose more contentious proposals may now be off the table. The results also call into question whether Modi would have the political capital to implement contentious changes to land and labor laws, as well as a slew of other reform measures needed to achieve his goal of turning India into a developed nation by mid-century.\n\nEven with a reduced mandate or a change in government, India's growth trajectory should largely remain positive. Business leaders from Elon Musk to Jamie Dimon have hailed India's potential as an alternative to China, with some economists projecting that the nation's $3.5 trillion economy can become the largest contributor to global growth within the next five years.\n\n\"As far as economic policy is concerned, fiscal backsliding I think is a risk,\" said Shumita Sharma Deveshwar, senior director of India Research at Global Data.TS Lombard. \"Apart from that I actually don't see much of a change in terms of reform policies. Even with a strong majority, Modi was unable to implement much of the so-called big bang reforms.\"\n\n-With assistance from Debjit Chakraborty, Akriti Sharma, Shruti Srivastava, Menaka Doshi, Rakesh

The main opposition Congress party was leading in 94 constituencies, around four hours into the count.\n\nThe National Democratic Alliance (NDA) group of parties, led by Modi, was leading in 287 constituencies, while the opposition INDIA alliance, led by the Congress party and its main campaign leader, Rahul Gandhi, was leading in 225.\n\nExit polling from the weekend had projected the NDA to win more than 350 seats.\n\nSome 642 million people voted in the election, with a turnout of around 66% across the seven voting phases, official data showed.\n\nVoting took place over six weeks due to its sheer scale, with different phases of voting taking place across different regions.\n\nAround 15 million polling staff and election monitors, as well as the security services, moved between locations, with voters travelling by whatever means necessary to reach voting centres - whether by car, bus, taxi, motorbike, boat, camel, buffalo or on foot.\n\nExtreme heat struck the country as voters went to the polls, with temperatures soaring above 50.5C in some parts of northern India. At least 10 election workers died because of the scorching heat, officials said.\n\nChief election commissioner Rajiv Kumar said officials had learned a valuable lesson and that the election should have been completed \"at least one month before\".\n\n\"We shouldn't have let it continue into so much heat,\" he said.\n\nWant a quick and expert briefing on the biggest news stories? Listen to our latest podcasts to find out What You Need To Know...\n\nTemperatures were somewhat lower on Tuesday for the counting, but election officials and political parties still took precautions, hauling in large quantities of water and installing coolers for people outside the buildings where votes were being tallied and at party headquarters.\n\nAs counting got underway, BJP workers outside the party's office in New Delhi performed a Hindu ritual. Supporters at the Congress party headquarters also appeared upbeat and chanted slogans praising Gandhi, the party's campaign face.\n\nIf 73-year-old Modi does win, it would only be the second time an Indian leader has retained power for a third term, after Jawaharlal Nehru, who was the country's first prime minister when it declared independence in 1947.\n\nModi has transformed India's political landscape over his decade in power, and his popularity has outstripped that of his party.\n\n\"Modi was not just the prime campaigner, but the sole campaigner of this election,\" Yamini Aiyar, a public policy scholar, said.\n\nBut critics of Modi say that his Hindu-first politics have led to an uptick in intolerance, hate speech and attacks against the country's minorities, especially Muslims.\n\nThe country's finances have also become more divided while Modi has been in power.\n\nStock markets have reached record highs and the country is on track to become the third-largest economy in the world by 2027, but youth unemployment has soared and some say only a small minority of Indians have benefitted from the economic boom.\n\nThe finalised result of the general election

However, in this vast and diverse country, exit polls have not always been reliable.\n\n\"The final figures will depend on whether the BJP can hold on in the populous northern states where the party has had huge successes in the past,\" said analyst Kidwai.\n\nAfter polling stations closed on Saturday, Modi thanked voters and said he was convinced that \"the people of India voted in record numbers\" to re-elect the government.\n\nHis comments came after he completed two days of meditation in the southern tip of India, at a memorial to Hindu philosopher Swami Vivekananda.

It has also raised concerns about democratic backsliding under Modi.\n\nThe Congress Party has been marginalized over the past decade while the BJP has emerged as a formidable political force under Modi. It only holds 52 seats in Parliament.\n\n\"A lot will depend on how the Congress Party and its allies fare in key states like Maharashtra in the west, Bihar in the east and Karnataka in the south,\" according to Kidwai.\n\nThe opposition faces a daunting task. To make significant progress, the BJP would also need to do well in the populous northern states, where the BJP is well established and where its Hindu nationalist agenda resonates most. The BJP, for its part, hopes to extend its influence in certain southern states where it has almost no presence.\n\nThe election campaign has been called one of the most controversial in India. At the rallies, Modi accused the Congress Party of being pro-Muslim and planning to grant Muslims benefits reserved for lower-caste Hindus if elected. Analysts said the polarizing rhetoric was an attempt to shore up support from his Hindu base after the vote. got off to a poor start last month.\n\nIn a letter to Punjab voters on Thursday, former Prime Minister Manmohan Singh accused Modi of indulging in \"the most vicious form of hate speech, purely divisive in nature\" during the campaign and accused him to undermine the dignity of the Prime Minister's office. .\n\nPunjab was among seven states and one federal territory that voted on Saturday.\n\nOnly India's first Prime Minister, Jawaharlal Nehru, won a third consecutive term.

The NIFTY 50 index futures rose 0.21% in early trade, according to NSE International Exchange data, and was looking at another record high open.\n\nTV exit polls released on Saturday after voting ended projected the BJP-led National Democratic Alliance could win a two-thirds majority in the 543-member lower house of parliament.\n\nSeveral major polls projected the BJP alone could win more than the 303 it won in 2019.\n\nThe projections pushed Indian shares to lifetime highs on Monday while the rupee gained and bond yields dropped.\n\nNearly one billion people were eligible to vote in the seven-phase, seven-week poll which began on April 19 and held in searing summer heat with temperatures touching nearly 50\u00b0 Celsius (122\u00b0 Fahrenheit) in some parts.\n\nMore than 66% of registered voters turned out, just one percentage point lower than the previous election in 2019, squashing pre-poll concerns that voters might shun a contest thought to be a foregone conclusion in Modi's favour.\n\nModi, 73, who first swept to power in 2014 by promising growth and change, is seeking to be only the second prime minister after India's independence leader Jawaharlal Nehru to win three straight terms.\n\nHe began his campaign by showcasing his record in office including economic growth, welfare policies, national pride, Hindu nationalism and his own personal commitment to fulfilling promises which he called \"Modi's Guarantee\".\n\nHowever, he changed tack after low voter turnout in the first phase and accused the opposition, especially the Congress party which leads an alliance of two dozen groups, of favouring India's 200 million Muslims - a shift analysts said made the campaign coarse and divisive.\n\nThey said the pivot may have been aimed at firing up the Hindu nationalist base of Modi's Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) to draw them to vote. Modi defended himself against criticism that he was stoking divisions between Hindus and Muslims to win votes and said that he was only faulting the opposition campaign.\n\nThe opposition INDIA alliance, led by Rahul Gandhi's Congress party, denied it favoured Muslims in the Hindu-majority country and said Modi would destroy the constitution if he returned to power and end affirmative action enjoyed by the so-called backward castes. The BJP rejects this.\n\nThe opposition alliance also promised more welfare measures and handouts, with surveys saying unemployment, inflation and rural distress were the main concerns of voters.\n\n(Reporting by YP Rajesh and Tanvi Mehta; Editing by Toby Chopra and Michael Perry)", "source": {"uri": "dailymaverick.co.za", "dataType": "news", "title": "Daily Maverick"}, "authors": [{"uri": "reuters@dailymaverick.co.za", "name": "Reuters", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exit_poll", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Exit poll"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/India", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "India"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parliament", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Parliament"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supermajority", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Supermajority"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hindu_nationalism", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Hindu nationalism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Times_of_India", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "The Times of India"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Market_economy", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Market economy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rupee", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Rupee"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economic_growth", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Economic growth"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Democratic_Alliance", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "National Democratic Alliance"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NIFTY_50", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "NIFTY 50"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Stock_Exchange_of_India", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "National Stock Exchange of India"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Percentage_point", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Percentage point"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bharatiya_Janata_Party", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Bharatiya Janata Party"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lower_house", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Lower house"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constitution", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Constitution"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hindus", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Hindus"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muslims", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Muslims"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Affirmative_action", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Affirmative action"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rahul_Gandhi", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Rahul Gandhi"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jawaharlal_Nehru", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Jawaharlal Nehru"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indian_National_Congress", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Indian National Congress"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Other_Backward_Class", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Other Backward Class"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indian_independence_movement", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Indian independence movement"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Welfare", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Welfare"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prime_minister", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Prime minister"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voter_turnout", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Voter turnout"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Campaigns_and_Elections", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Campaigns and Elections", "wgt": 21}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Activism/Strategies", "label": "dmoz/Society/Activism/Strategies", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Online_Issues_Polls", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Online Issues Polls", "wgt": 17}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 94}], "image": "https://www.dailymaverick.co.za/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/12183527.jpg?w=1280", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9616128", "eventUri": "eng-9616128", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-06-01", "textStart": 46, "textEnd": 52}, {"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-04-19", "textStart": 1663, "textEnd": 1671}], "sentiment": 0.2392156862745098, "wgt": 154, "relevance": 1}

According to Morning Consult, Modi is by far the world's most popular leader, with an approval rating of 74%.\n\nHis Hindu nationalist Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) and allied parties appeared to have secured almost 300 of 543 seats in Parliament, according to early results, giving them a simple majority. But the opposition was doing better than expected in an election that exit polls had suggested Modi's alliance would win by a landslide.\n\nBut critics say Modi has also eroded human rights in India, the world's largest democracy, and stoked religious tensions, particularly against India's Muslim minority, with Modi and other BJP candidates accused of hate speech and other inflammatory rhetoric during the campaign. India is also struggling to provide enough jobs for its 1.4 billion people, despite being the world's fastest-growing major economy.\n\nOutside BJP headquarters in New Delhi on Tuesday, dozens of Modi supporters danced to drums and chanted Hindu nationalist slogans, wearing shirts that read \"I am Modi's family\" and scarves the color of saffron, the BJP's official color which is also associated with Hindu nationalism.\n\nInside, the feeling was less celebratory. Anxious and disappointed party workers and Modi supporters were glued to the TV screens, awaiting the final results as the supermajority they had hoped for appeared increasingly out of reach. Others were angry.\n\n\"Some voters betrayed us. They betrayed Indian tradition,\" said Ram Shankar Maharaj, a Hindu priest who had traveled to New Delhi to watch the results from his home in the northern city of Ayodhya, where Modi in January presided over the opening of a grand Hindu temple on a contested holy site.\n\n\"We should have gotten 500 [seats],\" Maharaj added. \"India will suffer from this. Had they cleared 400, the country would flourish.\"\n\nRegardless of the margin of victory, Modi's ethos of a Hindu-first nation is now deeply entrenched in Indian politics, raising fears among Muslims and other minority groups over how they will fare during five more years of Modi rule.\n\nIn Modi's home seat of Varanasi, which voted Saturday in the last of seven phases of voting, Tasneem Fatma walked out of a polling station wearing a burqa, saying, \"We want a united India, not for Hindu, Muslim, Sikh, Isai.\"\n\nBut Fatma, 20, a business student, was interrupted by an older man who said there was no religious divide. He also dismissed Fatma's concerns about unemployment, saying, \"If you are educated and if you are capable of the job, you can take the job.\"\n\nAs the discussion grew more heated, police officers asked the man to leave before NBC News could ask for his name.\n\nIndia's election is considered the world's largest, with nearly a billion registered voters and polling that spanned over six weeks. But it was not just the sheer size of the election that posed a challenge for officials.\n\nVoting has taken place amid unusually high temperatures that have exceeded 120 degrees in New Delhi, the capital, and experts say that may have depressed turnout. At least 33 people in three states died of suspected heatstroke just on Friday, Reuters reported, including election officials who were on duty.\n\nAlthough Indian summers are generally hot, scientists say heat waves in India and elsewhere in South Asia are becoming hotter, longer and more frequent at least partly as a result of climate change. Neither the BJP nor the opposition has said much about climate change during the campaign.\n\nThe issue foremost in the minds of voters who spoke with NBC News was jobs. It's an especially big worry for those ages 15 to 29, who make up 83% of unemployed people in India, according to a report in March.\n\n\"Why is nobody talking about rising costs or lack of jobs or poor kids dying or trees being cut?\" Fatma asked.\n\nIndia's opposition parties, led by the Indian National Congress, have tried to use such issues to drive voters away from Modi. Aware of the gargantuan effort it would take to defeat him, the fractured opposition formed an alliance that quickly faltered.\n\nOpposition parties have also accused Modi's government of trying to stifle their campaigns by arresting their leaders and freezing their funds, allegations the BJP denies. Arvind Kejriwal, a vocal Modi opponent who is the chief minister of New Delhi, was arrested in March in connection with corruption allegations, and he returned to jail Sunday after he was granted interim bail in order to campaign. He denies the charges.\n\nToday's India is run by \"a very strong, dominant BJP, which in 1984 had only got four seats in Parliament,\" said Yamini Aiyar, former chief executive of the Center for Policy Research, a highly regarded think tank in New Delhi that has been targeted by a Modi government crackdown on civil society.\n\nIn recent years especially, she said, the BJP has become \"creepingly authoritarian.\"\n\n\"Our democracy is at stake,\" Aiyar said.\n\nAccording to Freedom House, a nonprofit pro-democracy organization in Washington, elections in India are generally considered free and fair, but they are being held in an environment in which freedom of expression is shrinking. It cited the arrests and prosecutions of journalists, information manipulation using artificial intelligence and other technologies, and Indian authorities' demands that social media companies remove online content critical of the government, among other issues.\n\nModi's shaky rights record can make things awkward for Washington, which views India as an important counterweight to China. Though India is not a formal U.S. ally, it is an important defense partner and a member of strategic security groupings such as the Quad, which also includes the U.S., Australia and Japan.\n\nModi, who rarely takes live questions from journalists, pushed back against criticism at a joint news conference with President Joe Biden during a state visit to Washington last year.\n\n\"In India's democratic values, there's absolutely no discrimination, neither on basis of caste, creed or age or any kind of geographic location,\" he said.\n\nU.S. authorities also say Indian agents may have been involved in the attempted assassination last year of a Sikh activist living in New York. India denies the allegations, saying such a crime would be \"contrary to government policy.\"\n\nExperts say the U.S. relationship with Modi will continue to strengthen, regardless of who wins the U.S. presidential election in November.\n\n\"China remains the elephant in the room or the presence that is shaping the alignments and realignments across the world,\" Aiyar said.", "source": {"uri":

Credit - Manish Swarup -- AP Photo\n\nPolitical pundits and exit polls were quick to predict that Narendra Modi was poised to clinch a third term as India's prime minister in this year's elections, which began on April 19 and concluded on June 1. The question was: could his party, the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), win enough votes to claim a supermajority?\n\nThe answer became clear as the final results trickled in on Tuesday, June 4. With more than 50% of the votes counted, the BJP and its National Democratic Alliance (which consists of several rightwing, conservative regional parties) have so far won 290 seats in India's 543-seat Lok Sabha, or the lower house of parliament -- falling short of the 400-seat mark the alliance boasted it would win, and effectively losing the single-party majority Modi has enjoyed since first elected in 2014. The ruling party on its own has claimed 238 seats -- also a stark departure from the BJP's thumping victory in 2019 when it won an unprecedented 303 seats.\n\nIn contrast, the opposition INDIA alliance -- which is made up of more than 20 opposition parties including the Indian National Congress -- won 235 seats, performing better than expected. Final results are expected late on Tuesday or early on Wednesday.\n\nUnder India's electoral system, the party or alliance that wins more than 272 seats in the 543-member parliament can form a government. The vote was carried out in seven phases over six weeks and saw over 1 billion Indians heading to the polls -- making it the largest democratic election in the world.\n\n73-year-old Modi, a charismatic yet polarizing leader, will preside over a rare, third consecutive term in office. Only one other Indian Prime Minister, Congress leader Jawaharlal Nehru, who was India's first prime minister, has done so before. Speaking at the BJP's headquarters in Delhi on Tuesday evening, Modi praised India's election process and celebrated the BJP's achievements. \"No government has come back into power for a third time since 1962,\" he said, adding the number of votes for the BJP had doubled in some areas.\n\nBut while Modi will likely be able to move forward with his promised Hindu-nationalist agenda and slate of economic reforms, the BJP's smaller-than-expected majority means that he may face a more powerful opposition than at any point over the past decade -- making implementation difficult unless the BJP negotiates with smaller alliances and opposition leaders.\n\n\"This election is undoubtedly a rebuke for Modi and the BJP,\" says Milan Vaishnav, the Director of the South Asia Program at Carnegie Endowment for International Peace. \"After ten years in power, it was in many ways a referendum on its track record in office and there are clearly many Indians who are feeling restless and uneasy.\"\n\nTo win a landslide victory, the BJP needed to make electoral gains in two crucial areas. It needed to break ground in the southern states, which seemed unlikely given that it has traditionally had less sway among a diverse and more economically developed non-Hindi-speaking electorate. And it needed to grab more votes in strongholds like Uttar Pradesh, India's most populous state, which is seen as a bellwether for how the rest of the country will vote.\n\nThe BJP managed to pull off stunning breakthroughs in the south, winning one seat in the left-leaning state of Kerala, where it has never won before. It retained its stronghold in Karnataka, grabbing 19 seats compared to nine for INDIA. And it tied in Telangana, where the opposition defeated the BJP in state elections held last year, by securing eight seats.\n\nBut surprisingly, the BJP performed unevenly across the Hindi belt and suffered perhaps its biggest loss in Uttar Pradesh, where Modi inaugurated a Hindu temple in the city of Ayodhya just months ago, fulfilling a three-decade-old BJP promise and cementing his Hindu-nationalist legacy. Early tally suggested the BJP alliance won only 35 out of 80 seats -- a stark contrast to the 71 and the 62 seats won during the 2014 and 2019 elections that helped fuel the party's rise to power in Delhi.\n\nThis time, a divisive campaign saw Muslim votes in the state consolidated for the opposition coalition, formed between two major parties, the Samajwadi Party and the Congress. \"The loss in Uttar Pradesh is particularly significant as this state is the cradle of the Hindu nationalist movement,\" says Gilles Vernier, a Senior Fellow at the Centre for Policy Research in Delhi. \"These results shatter the myth of [Modi's] invincibility in national elections, particularly in the Hindi-speaking North.\"\n\nThe BJP swept through its other stronghold states, including Gujarat, Madhya Pradesh, Chhattisgarh, Delhi, Uttarakhand, and Himachal Pradesh. In comparison, the opposition alliance made marginal gains in Bihar and Rajasthan, as well as Haryana and Punjab.\n\n\"What's complex about this election is it appears more like a state-by-state contest with no unifying national narrative,\" says Vaishnav. \"At some point, the popularity of the alternatives and other local factors also become prime factors,\" he continues.\n\nIn this election, Modi campaigned on the slogan of \"Modi's guarantee,\" referring to the more than 300 welfare programs that have delivered benefits to Indian citizens across the country, ranging from cooking gas to free housing. While these benefits were viewed as a key concern for voters, research also found limited hard evidence of \"schemes translating into votes.\"\n\nModi and the BJP also boasted of reducing poverty in the world's fifth-largest economy, with development featuring high on the prime minister's agenda. While India's GDP grew at a rate of 7.8% in the last quarter, widening inequality, the rising cost of living, and record-high unemployment nevertheless remained big concerns for voters, as evident in credible pre-poll surveys.\n\n\"Narendra Modi's government has ignored ground-level discontent about economic distress and jobless growth,\" says Verniers. \"This election might be the moment where economic reality caught up.\"\n\nGoing into his third term, Modi has touted an ambitious economic reform agenda that he hopes will make India the world's third-largest economy by 2047. The BJP's failure to win a majority, however, means that he will now face a challenge in implementing his economic policy unless he forms alliances with smaller parties. The impact was already reverberating in India's stock market early Tuesday when the Nifty 50 index tumbled as much as 8.5% -- the biggest drop in a single day in more than four years -- after surging to a record high on Monday, when exit polls indicated a comfortable Modi win.\n\nModi now faces a more powerful opposition than at any point over the past decade. Throughout the election, the INDIA alliance has accused the government of crippling the opposition by jailing two state leaders and freezing Congress bank accounts.\n\n\"For the first time since he became PM in 2014, Narendra Modi will have to share power effectively with coalition partners,\" says Verniers. \"This is uncharted territory for a leader who has always exercised power alone,\"\n\nBut the results are undoubtedly a personal setback for the prime minister, whose face has been the central promise of the BJP's campaign this election -- featured on billboards, posters, and campaigns across the country -- and who has never had to depend on coalition partners for survival.\n\n\"Only time will tell whether he will learn the art of conciliation and power-sharing, or press down the path of autocratization to compensate for the loss of political ground,\" Vernier adds.\n\n\"This is the most important question India faces at the moment.\"", "source": {"uri":

It's a stunning blow to a leader who has dominated Indian politics since he first took power a decade ago.\n\nModi's Bharatiya Janata Party was leading in 241 seats, short of the 272 needed to form a government and well behind the 303 it won in the 2019 election. The opposition bloc, known as the Indian National Developmental Inclusive Alliance, was on course to win more than 220 seats, the results showed.\n\nModi now needs to secure the support of two key members of his broader National Democratic Alliance who control some 30 seats -- enough to flip the balance of power in parliament. Leaders of those two parties have a history of switching sides, and only joined up with Modi a few months ago, making it unclear whether they will stick with him or back the opposition bloc.\n\nIndia's NSE Nifty 50 Index tumbled 5.9%, its worst day in more than four years, as it became clear the election outcome would be much closer than expected. Stocks had hit a record high on Monday after exit polls released over the weekend showed Modi would coast to an easy victory in the marathon, six-week election. Before voting kicked off on April 19, he had boldly predicted that his alliance would win a whopping 400 seats.\n\n\"This is not an election -- it is a kind of political earthquake,\" said Niranjan Sahoo, senior fellow with the New Delhi-based Observer Research Foundation who has written several books on Indian politics. \"Even if Modi becomes the prime minister, his position will be diminished to a great extent. He will not be the same Modi.\"\n\nThe result is a disappointment for the 73-year-old leader, who has been the main face of the BJP's election campaign and built the party primarily around himself. Besides raising questions about Modi's own future as prime minister, a weak coalition government will likely make it difficult for him to push through tough economic reforms or further his Hindu nationalist agenda assuming he returns to power.\n\nThe lackluster performance marks the first major setback at national polls for Modi. He had looked unbeatable heading into the election, backed by one of the world's fastest-growing economies and the fulfillment of key promises appealing to India's Hindu majority, including the building of a temple on the site where a 500-year-old mosque had been torn down.\n\nYet more than 20 opposition parties, spearheaded by Rahul Gandhi, formed a united front in a bid to stop Modi's once-dominant electoral machine. A mixture of regional and caste-based groups, the alliance focused on appealing to voters who felt left out of India's growth story, which has been marked by growing inequality, pervasive joblessness, rising living costs and growing demand for welfare support.\n\nSigns of trouble for Modi emerged after the first of seven rounds of voting. A dip in turnout triggered a broad get-out-the-vote effort that saw Modi adopt a more strident tone, firing up his Hindu nationalist base with divisive anti-Muslim rhetoric and attacks on the opposition's welfare policies.\n\nModi had appealed to India's 1.4 billion people with a combination of business-friendly policies, welfare measures for the poor and Hindu nationalist policies. He had pledged more of the same in his third term, vowing measures to create jobs while also replacing India's religion-based marriage and inheritance laws with a uniform civil code -- a measure that Muslims, Christians and other minorities oppose because it would prevent them from adhering to some faith-based laws.\n\nThose more contentious proposals may now be off the table. The results also call into question whether Modi would have the political capital to implement contentious changes to land and labor laws, as well as a slew of other reform measures needed to achieve his goal of turning India into a developed nation by mid-century.\n\nEven with a reduced mandate or a change in government, India's growth trajectory should largely remain positive. Business leaders from Elon Musk to Jamie Dimon have hailed India's potential as an alternative to China, with some economists projecting that the nation's $3.5 trillion economy can become the largest contributor to global growth within the next five years.\n\n\"Political stability has been at the very core of both economic growth and investor sentiment over the last decade,\" said Sumeet Abrol, a partner at business consultancy Grant Thornton Bharat. \"The verdict of the world's largest democracy will put decisive leadership to reforms to a test the markets haven't seen in the last decade, leaving investor sentiment exposed to cautiousness and volatility in the near term.\"", "source": {"uri": "dailynews.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Daily News"}, "authors": [], "concepts":

Since then, he has fused religion with politics in a formula that has attracted wide support from the country's majority Hindu population.\n\nBreaking News\n\nGet the latest breaking news from North Texas and beyond.\n\nSIGN UP\n\nOr with:\n\nGoogleFacebook\n\nBy signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy\n\nIndia under Modi is a rising global power, but his rule has also been marked by rising unemployment, attacks by Hindu nationalists against minorities, particularly Muslims, and a shrinking space for dissent and free media.\n\nHow does the election work\n\nThe final day of voting in the six-week-long election was Saturday. The vote counting began Tuesday with updates expected throughout the day. The election results will likely be known the same day.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe voters are choosing 543 members for the lower house of Parliament for a five-year term.\n\nVotes were cast at more than a million polling stations. Each of the seven voting phases lasted a single day with several constituencies across multiple states voting that day. The staggered polling allowed the government to transport election officials and voting machines and deploy tens of thousands of troops to prevent violence. Candidates crisscrossed the country, poll workers hiked to remote villages, and voters lined up for hours in sweltering heat.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIndia has a first-past-the-post multiparty electoral system in which the candidate who receives the most votes wins. To secure a majority, a party or coalition must breach the mark of 272 seats.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIndia uses electronic voting machines.\n\nWho is running?\n\nModi's Bharatiya Janata Party and his main challenger, Rahul Gandhi of the Indian National Congress, represent Parliament's two largest factions. Several other important regional parties are part of an opposition bloc.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOpposition parties, which previously were fractured, have united under a front called INDIA, or Indian National Developmental Inclusive Alliance, to deny Modi a third-straight election victory.\n\nThe alliance has fielded a single main candidate in most constituencies. But it has been roiled by ideological differences and personality clashes, and has not yet decided on its candidate for prime minister.\n\nMost exit polls project Modi is set to extend his decade in power with a third consecutive term, especially after he opened a Hindu temple in northern Ayodhya city in January, which fulfilled his party's long-held Hindu nationalist pledge. During the polls, Modi escalated polarizing rhetoric in incendiary speeches that targeted the country's Muslim minority.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAnother victory would cement Modi as one of the country's most popular and important leaders. It would follow a thumping win in 2019, when the BJP clinched an absolute majority by sweeping 303 parliamentary seats. The Congress party managed only 52 seats.\n\nWhat are the big issues?\n\nFor decades, India has clung doggedly to its democratic convictions, largely due to free elections, an independent judiciary, a thriving media, strong opposition and peaceful transition of power. Some of these credentials have eroded under Modi's 10-year rule, with the polls seen as a test for the country's democratic values.\n\nMany watchdogs have now categorized India as a \"hybrid regime\" that is neither a full democracy nor a full autocracy.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe poll results will also test Modi's limits. Critics accuse him of running on a Hindu-first platform, endangering the country's secular roots.\n\nUnder Modi, the media, once viewed as vibrant and largely independent, have become more pliant and critical voices muzzled. Courts have largely bent to Modi's will and given favorable verdicts in crucial cases. Centralization of executive power has strained India's federalism. And federal agencies have bogged down top opposition leaders in corruption cases, which they deny.\n\nAnother key issue is India's large economy, which is among the fastest growing in the world. It has helped India emerge as a global power and a counterweight to China. But even as India's growth soars by some measures, the Modi government has struggled to generate enough jobs for young Indians, and instead has relied on welfare programs like free food and housing to woo voters.\n\nAdvertisementRelated StoriesView MoreEditorial cartoon: Debate commissionJoe Biden, Donald Trump agree to 2 presidential debatesRobert F.

His critics and opponents say his Hindu-first politics have bred intolerance and while the economy, the world's fifth-largest and one of the fastest-growing, has become more unequal.\n\nSome eight hours into counting, early leads reported by India's Election Commission showed Modi's Bharatiya Janata Party was ahead in 231 constituencies and had won 13, including one uncontested, of 543 parliamentary seats. The main opposition Congress party led in 93 constituencies and had won four.\n\nA total of 272 seats are needed for a majority. In 2019, the BJP won 303 seats, while they secured 282 in 2014 when Modi first came to power.\n\nModi's party is part of the National Democratic Alliance, whose members led in 277 constituencies and won 15, according to the early count. The Congress party is part of the INDIA alliance, which led in 220 constituencies and had won five.\n\nThe Election Commission does not release data on the percentage of votes tallied.\n\nExit polling from the weekend had projected the NDA to win more than 350 seats. Indian markets, which had hit an all-time high on Monday, closed sharply down Tuesday, with benchmark stock indices -- the NIFTY 50 and the BSE Sensex -- both down by more than 5%.\n\nIn the financial capital of Mumbai, Mangesh Mahadeshwar was one of many surprised by how the election was playing out.\n\n\"Yesterday we thought that the BJP would get more than 400 seats,\" said 52-year-old who was keeping an eye on the results at the restaurant where he works. \"Today it seems like that won't happen - people haven't supported the BJP so much this time.\"\n\nIf Modi wins, it would only be the second time an Indian leader has retained power for a third term after Jawaharlal Nehru, the country's first prime minister.\n\nBut if his BJP is forced to form a coalition, the party would likely \"be heavily dependent on the goodwill of its allies, which makes them critical players who we can expect will extract their pound of flesh, both in terms of policymaking as well as government formation,\" said Milan Vaishnav, director of the South Asia Program at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace.\n\n\"This would be truly, you know, uncharted territory, both for Indians as well as for the prime minister,\" he added.\n\nSince coming to power in 2014, Modi's BJP has always had a majority on its own, though it has governed in a coalition.\n\nExtreme heat struck India as voters went to the polls, with temperatures higher than 45 degrees Celsius (113 Fahrenheit) in some parts of the country. Temperatures were somewhat lower on Tuesday for the counting, but election officials and political parties still hauled in large quantities of water and installed outdoor air coolers for people waiting for results.\n\nBJP workers outside the party's office in New Delhi performed a Hindu ritual shortly after the counting began. Meanwhile, supporters at the Congress party headquarters appeared upbeat and chanted slogans praising Gandhi, the party's campaign face.\n\nOver 10 years in power, Modi's popularity has outstripped that of his party's, and has turned a parliamentary election into one that increasingly resembles a presidential-style campaign. The result is that the BJP relies more and more on Modi's enduring brand to stay in power, with local politicians receding into the background even in state elections.\n\n\"Modi was not just the prime campaigner, but the sole campaigner of this election,\" said Yamini Aiyar, a public policy scholar.\n\nThe country's democracy, Modi's critics say, is faltering under his government, which has increasingly wielded strong-arm tactics to subdue political opponents, squeeze independent media and quash dissent. The government has rejected such accusations and say democracy is flourishing.\n\nAnd economic discontent has simmered under Modi. While stock markets reach record-highs and millionaires multiply, youth unemployment has soared, with only a small portion of Indians benefitting from the boom.\n\nAs polls opened in mid-April, a confident BJP initially focused its campaign on \"Modi's guarantees,\" highlighting the economic and welfare achievements that his party says have reduced poverty. With him at the helm, \"India will become a developed nation by 2047,\" Modi repeated in rally after rally.\n\nBut the campaign turned increasingly shrill, as Modi ramped up polarizing rhetoric that targeted Muslims, who make up 14% of the population, a tactic seen to energize his core Hindu majority voters.\n\nThe opposition INDIA alliance has attacked Modi over his Hindu nationalist politics, and campaigned on issues of joblessness, inflation and inequality.\n\nBut the broad alliance of over a dozen political parties has been beset by ideological differences and defections, raising questions over their effectiveness. Meanwhile, the alliance has also claimed they've been unfairly targeted, pointing to a spree of raids, arrests and corruption investigations against their leaders by federal agencies they say are politically motivated. The government has denied this.\n\nAssociated Press journalists David Rising in new Delhi and Rafiq Maqbool in Mumbai, India, contributed to this story.\n\n0 Comments", "source": {"uri":

Modi defended himself against criticism that he is stoking divisions between Hindus and Muslims to win votes and said that he was only faulting the opposition campaign.\n\nVERY HOPEFUL, SAYS OPPOSITION\n\nThe opposition INDIA alliance, led by Rahul Gandhi's Congress party, denied it favoured Muslims in the Hindu-majority country and said Modi would destroy the constitution if he returned to power and end affirmative action enjoyed by the so-called backward castes. The BJP rejects this.\n\nThe opposition alliance also promised more welfare measures and handouts, with surveys saying unemployment, inflation and rural distress were the main concerns of voters.\n\nTV exit polls released on Saturday after voting ended projected the BJP-led National Democratic Alliance could win a two-thirds majority in the 543-member lower house of parliament.\n\nSeveral major polls projected the BJP alone could win more than the 303 it won in 2019.\n\nThe projections pushed Indian shares to lifetime highs on Monday while the rupee gained and bond yields dropped, as investors were buoyed by expectations of sustained economic growth.\n\nExit polls, which are conducted by polling agencies, have a patchy record in India, with analysts saying it is a challenge to get them right in the large and diverse country.\n\nOpposition parties dismissed them saying they were unscientific and did not reflect reality.\n\n\"We are very hopeful that our results are completely opposite to what the exit poll is saying,\" former Congress party president and Rahul Gandhi's mother, Sonia, said on Monday.", "source": {"uri": "yahoo.com", "dataType":

The bigger question in the Indian election was how big his victory would be.\n\nThere were widespread predictions that Modi would win by a landslide, with the prime minister himself setting an ambitious goal of winning 400 of the total 543 seats up for grabs. It hasn't quite turned out that way. Modi's ruling Bharatiya Janata party (BJP) is on course to be the largest party, but is falling well short of the 272 required for an absolute majority. This means the BJP will be reliant on other parties that make up the National Democratic Alliance to form a government. The Congress-led opposition alliance, known as INDIA - which was widely written off during the campaign - has exceeded all expectations and is set to nearly double its parliamentary seats.\n\nIndia's voters, irked perhaps at being taken for granted, have delivered a stinging rebuke to their rulers. Modi has won the election but emerges from the contest with his authority significantly diminished.\n\nIndia's seven-phase election - the biggest in the world - began on 19 April and closed on Saturday. The country's election commission said 642 million people had voted out of an electorate close to a billion. This is proportionately slightly lower than in the elections of 2014 and 2019, which Modi also won.\n\nThere have been upsets aplenty, most significantly in key northern battleground states that the BJP had previously dominated: in Uttar Pradesh, for example, KL Sharma, the Congress candidate, beat Smriti Irani, the BJP's Women's Minister. The BJP also lost the seat in Ayodhya, a hugely symbolic defeat for the party after Modi opened a controversial Hindu temple there in January.\n\nIndia's opposition parties are understandably thrilled. The Congress party president, Mallikarjun Kharge, claimed Modi had suffered a 'moral and political defeat'. The opposition certainly deserves its moment in the sun, but it should be stressed that even though Congress made significant and unexpected gains, it still only came second overall.\n\nEven so, after a shaky start to the campaign and periodic bouts of infighting, the opposition parties pursued a strategy that seems to have hit home with key groups of voters, including farmers and the poor. They had pledged to deliver a long-delayed census revealing the caste balance in the country. Early results indicate that the BJP vote share fell significantly in areas of the county dominated by Dalits, or 'untouchables', who sit at the bottom of India's caste hierarchy.\n\nThe opposition also successfully tapped into voter concerns about unemployment, rising prices and rural poverty. Modi and the BJP, in choosing to pursue a more aggressive and divisive campaign that stoked religious and communal divisions, appear to have alienated voters in parts of the country. Modi's openly-stated ambition to achieve over 400 seats for his ruling alliance may also have backfired, raising fears that he might make significant and controversial changes to India's constitution if granted such a big majority and unchecked power.\n\nIt is important to stress that Modi is still in the driving seat. Returning for a third term, he will match the milestone achievement of Jawarharlal Nehru, India's first prime minister. Nehru went on to rule the country for 16 years - something Modi has made no secret of wishing to emulate.\n\nLike him or not, Modi is without doubt the most consequential Indian leader since Nehru. What is not clear right now is what his failure to win outright means for the country. Will Modi continue to try to mould the country in his Hindu-nationalist image? Will he listen more to the concerns of voters worried about bread and butter issues such as jobs and the cost of living? One thing is clear: the failure to win an outright majority will make it more difficult for the BJP to implement economic policy, leaving it more beholden to its fickle and smaller political allies. This is a recipe for economic uncertainty, a fear reflected in the sharp falls today on India's stock markets.\n\nModi, in his first public comments following the election, tried to put a brave face on the results. He insisted that it was a victory nonetheless, and that the BJP and its allies had secured 'a historical feat in India's history'. He will know better than anyone that this isn't the outcome he expected or wanted. It is uncharted territory for Modi and the Indian people.", "source": {"uri": "spectator.us", "dataType": "news", "title": "Spectator USA"}, "authors": [{"uri": "jawad_iqbal@spectator.us", "name":

Though Modi is claiming victory, his party is seeing major losses in the country's general election. Some are touting his opposition's unexpected leads as a win for democracy.\n\nFor a decade, Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi has held a decisive grip on his country's politics.\n\nBut as election results roll in on Tuesday, it appears Modi's grip may be slipping.\n\nModi, who leads India's Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), is claiming victory for a historic third term as the country's prime minister. But, even though Modi is projected to hold onto his position, his party isn't doing as well as he predicted.\n\nThough India is still counting the votes in its 2024 general election, one unexpected trend is emerging: Modi's party is projected to lose its majority in Parliament. That's a big blow to Modi, whose party was long expected to win a full majority in Parliament.\n\nNow, he'll have to gather enough allies to form a government.\n\nThe BJP's main opposition party, the Indian National Congress, performed better than expected, according to preliminary results.\n\nThe Indian National Congress had set a goal to double its 52 seats in Parliament, and as of Tuesday afternoon, it had a lead in almost 100 seats, The New York Times reported. It was also leading in nearly 230 races, according to the Times.\n\nIn an election that saw record voter turnout -- with 642 million people voting, according to Al Jazeera, in the seven-phase process that began in April and ended on Saturday -- the surprise results indicate that voters' trust in the BJP is waning.\n\nThe BJP's Hindutva ideology promotes Hindu nationalism, which critics have accused of stoking anti-Muslim hate and right-wing extremism.\n\nModi has even accused the Congress party of plotting to redistribute India's wealth to the Muslim minority, BI previously reported. Modi has denied targeting the Muslim minority to win the favor of the Hindu majority, Reuters reported.\n\nThough Modi is still popular across India, some see him as an authoritarian leader, and his opponents called signs of his fading power a victory for democracy on Tuesday.\n\nThe president of the Congress, Mallikarjun Kharge, called the election a \"moral and political loss\" for Modi, adding that, \"This is public's victory and a win for democracy,\" PBS News Hour reported.\n\nRaghuram Rajan, the former Reserve Bank of India Governor, echoed Kharge's sentiment in a post on LinkedIn.\n\n\"The Indian voter has spoken,\" Rajan wrote. \"And what a wise decision! This is a win for Indian democracy and a win for the Indian economy. Regardless of what happens over the next few days, we will have a strong opposition that forces the government to change course.\"\n\nRead the original article on Business Insider", "source": {"uri": "businessinsider.nl", "dataType": "news", "title": "Business Insider Nederland"}, "authors": [{"uri": "grace_eliza_goodwin@businessinsider.nl", "name": "Grace Eliza Goodwin", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Narendra_Modi", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Narendra Modi"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/India", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "India"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_election", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "General election"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parliament_of_the_United_Kingdom", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Parliament of the United Kingdom"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indian_National_Congress", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Indian National Congress"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bharatiya_Janata_Party", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Bharatiya Janata Party"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prime_minister", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Prime minister"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democracy", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Democracy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Islam_in_India", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Islam in India"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Al_Jazeera", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Al Jazeera"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voter_turnout", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Voter turnout"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_New_York_Times", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "The New York Times"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hindus", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Hindus"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hindu_nationalism", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Hindu nationalism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hindutva", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Hindutva"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PBS_NewsHour", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "PBS NewsHour"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mallikarjun_Kharge", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Mallikarjun Kharge"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Raghuram_Rajan", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Raghuram Rajan"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reserve_Bank_of_India", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Reserve Bank of India"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Business_Insider", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Business Insider"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Islamophobia", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Islamophobia"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ideology", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Ideology"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Authoritarianism", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Authoritarianism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Far-right_politics", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Far-right politics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Governor", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Governor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reuters", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Reuters"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Entertainment/Party_Supplies", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Entertainment/Party Supplies", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Campaigns_and_Elections", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Campaigns and Elections", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Children/Parties", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Children/Parties", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Democracy", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Democracy", "wgt": 17}, {"uri": "dmoz/Home/Entertaining/Party_Planning", "label": "dmoz/Home/Entertaining/Party Planning", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 96}], "image": "https://i.insider.com/665f4fc4d0b8e1c832cbdb1c?format=jpeg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9616128", "eventUri": "eng-9616128", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1372549019607843, "wgt": 151, "relevance": 1}

As India uses electronic voting machines, results are expected the same day.\n\nThe elections will test the popularity of 73-year-old Modi whose image of a strong leader and champion of Hindu nationalism has been boosted by a host of welfare measures for tens of millions of poor people during his decade in power.\n\nThe BJP campaign was dominated by the Indian leader, who crisscrossed the country to hold over 200 rallies.\n\nBefore elections got under way, the BJP was expected to cruise to an easy victory. The party had set a target of winning a supermajority by bagging 400 seats.\n\nAccording to exit polls broadcast by several television channels, the party along with its allies could win 350 seats or more, far ahead of the 272 needed for a simple majority. That would hand Modi a rare, third straight term in office.\n\n'It's a litmus test for Mr. Modi. When elections started, it appeared to be a one-horse race. He appeared very invincible, very formidable and raised the bar very high,' according to political analyst Rasheed Kidwai.\n\nMany observers had expected an opposition alliance of over two dozen parties that is challenging Modi of cutting into his party's huge Parliamentary majority but exit polls projected that it would not be able to do so and showed the alliance trailing with around 150 seats. However, in the vast, diverse country, exit polls have not always been reliable.\n\n'The final numbers will depend on whether the BJP can hold ground in populous northern states where the party has secured huge success in the past,' analyst Kidwai said.\n\nA man watching television waits for the release of exit polls published after voting concludes during its seventh and final phase amid India's general election, at an appliance store in Ajmer on June 1, 2024.\n\nAfter polls closed on Saturday, Modi thanked voters and expressed confidence that the 'people of India have voted in record numbers' to reelect the government.\n\nHis comments came after he ended two days of meditation at the southernmost tip of India at a memorial for Hindu philosopher Swami Vivekananda -- images released by his party showed him clad in saffron robes with eyes closed and prayer beads in hand.\n\nThe opposition's hopes of making gains rest on tapping into growing resentment over high unemployment that faces the country's huge youth population and rising prices.\n\nCongress Party leader, Rahul Gandhi, who was the face of the opposition campaign, focused his campaign on the need to create jobs and growing wealth inequality in the country and said the government's policies have favored the rich at the expense of the poor. The party has promised cash transfers to poor women and a guarantee of apprenticeships for college graduates. It has also raised concerns about democratic backsliding under Modi.\n\nThe Congress Party has been marginalized over the last decade amid the BJP's rise into a formidable political force under Modi - it only holds 52 seats in Parliament.\n\n'Much will depend on how the Congress Party and its allies perform in swing states like Maharashtra in the west, Bihar in the east and Karnataka in the south,' according to Kidwai.\n\nThe opposition faces a daunting task. To make significant gains it would also have to fare well in populous northern states, where the BJP is well entrenched and where its Hindu nationalist agenda resonates the most. The BJP, on its part, hopes to expand its influence in some southern states where it has virtually no presence.\n\nThe election campaign has been called one of India's most divisive. At rallies, Modi charged the Congress Party of being pro-Muslim and of planning to hand benefits reserved for lower caste Hindus to Muslims if it is voted into power - analysts said the polarizing rhetoric was a bid to shore up support among his Hindu base after voting got off to a lackluster start last month.\n\nIn a letter on Thursday addressed to voters in Punjab, former Prime Minister Manmohan Singh accused Modi of indulging in the 'most vicious form of hate speeches that are purely divisive in nature' during the campaign and accused him lowering the dignity of the Prime Minister's office.\n\nPunjab was among the seven states and one federal territory that voted on Saturday.\n\nOnly India's first prime minister, Jawaharlal Nehru, secured a third straight term in office. The winning party is expected to form the next government by mid-June before the term of the present Parliament ends.", "source": {"uri": "cambodiantimes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Cambodian

In the Indian parliament, a party or coalition that wins 272 seats can form the government.\n\nThe final votes were cast on Saturday in the seventh phase of the election, which saw people in eight of India's 36 states and territories take their turns at the ballot.\n\nModi had expected a landslide\n\nModi and the BJP had long been projected to win decisively.

However, the new alliance is undermined by differences in ideologies and contested leadership.\n\nModi, a polarizing but popular leader, has spent much of the election blasting the Congress and its promised policies in controversial attacks.

His leadership, marked by high approval ratings and a presidential-style campaign, has seen India rise economically and politically. Modi aims to transform India into a leading global power, counterbalancing China while promoting national interests.\n\nIndian Prime Minister Narendra Modi was set for a historic third term on Tuesday, but with a vastly diminished majority in a rare electoral setback for a leader who has held a tight grip on the nation's politics. Modi's ruling Bharatiya Janata Party lost its own majority in parliament for the first time in a decade and is dependent on its regional allies to get past the half-way mark required to run the world's largest democracy.\n\nFor Modi whose approval ratings have been the highest among world leaders and who ran a presidential-style campaign, such a result is the first sign of the ground shifting. \"For the BJP to drop below the majority mark, this is a personal setback for him,\" said Yogendra Yadav, a psephologist and the founder of a small political group opposed to the BJP.\n\nSince he took power 10 years ago, riding his Hindu nationalist base, Modi has been the ruling alliance's unquestioned leader, with concerns growing about what his opponents see as the country's slide towards authoritarianism. The man who as a boy sold tea in his home state of Gujarat has dominated India's politics so completely in the last decade that few in his party or even the parent ideological group, the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh, dare stand up to him.\n\nIndeed, throughout the campaign in scorching heat, it was Modi with his thinning white hair, a neatly trimmed white beard and immaculate Indian attire who towered over everyone else. His giant cutouts were everywhere, his face on television screens every day as he courted India's 968 million voters with a personal \"Modi guarantee\" to change their lives.\n\n\"My sole issue with Modi today is that he has become larger than the party itself,\" said Surendra Kumar Dwivedi, a former head of the Department of Political Science at Lucknow University \"In a democratic system... a party should always supersede an individual.\" 'LAST 10 YEARS IS ONLY A PREVIEW'\n\nStill, Modi will be only the second leader to win a third term after founding prime minister Jawaharlal Nehru and has promised a transformative next five years. Under him, India has become the world's fastest growing major economy and he has said he wants to make it the world's third largest in three years, behind the United States and China.\n\n\"What we have done in the last 10 years is only a preview, a trailer,\" Modi told a recent rally. \"We have a lot more to do. Modi is taking the country to a different level in the world.\" The BJP has dismissed opposition speculation that Modi, 73, might hang up his boots once he reaches 75, like some other party leaders have done in recent years. Modi has said he wants to lay the groundwork for India to become a fully developed nation by 2047, the 100th year of independence from British colonial rule. \"Modi will now probably enter in what I call the legacy phase of his prime ministership, driving India forward politically, economically, diplomatically and even militarily,\" said Bilveer Singh, deputy head, department of political science, at the National University of Singapore.\n\nThe idea would be to make the country a \"strong regional power that is also a counterbalance to China, but not to serve Western interest as is sometimes alleged, but mainly to promote India's interest, power and place in international politics\". A reduced mandate for Modi's ruling alliance forecloses the possibility of changes to India's secular constitution that opposition groups had warned against. Any such measures require the support of two-thirds of members of parliament. Concerns have grown in recent years that the BJP's Hindu nationalist agenda has polarised the country with Modi himself turning up the rhetoric, accusing the main opposition Congress of appeasing Muslims for votes.\n\nYashwant Deshmukh, founder of CVoter polling agency and a political analyst, said the BJP's top goal of introducing common civil laws to replace Islam's sharia-based customs and other religious codes would have to go on the back burner. \"These will have to be debated,\" he said.\n\n(This story has not been edited by Devdiscourse staff and is auto-generated from a syndicated

It was also a distinct departure from the two-thirds majority that many exit polls had predicted over the weekend.\n\nMeanwhile, the opposition alliance, which goes by the acronym India, appeared to far outperform expectations, collectively winning 234 seats, according to the early count. The alliance, formed of more than 20 national and regional opposition parties, had come together for the first time in this election with the aim of defeating Modi, who has been in power since 2014.\n\nThe early results were a particular triumph for India's main opposition party and the BJP's main rival, Indian National Congress, which had dramatically lost the previous to elections to Modi and were facing questions about its future as a party. However, it appeared the Congress party had doubled its seats in this election.\n\nShould the results remain consistent as counting continues, it could have significant implications for India's political landscape after the polls. Since he was elected a decade ago, Modi and his Hindu nationalist BJP party have enjoyed a powerful majority, while the opposition - particularly the Congress party - have been seen as weak and unable to stand up the might of the BJP.\n\nBut the INDIA coalition proved more resilient than many analysts had expected and was boosted by strong performances by regional parties such as the Samajwadi party in Uttar Pradesh, the Trinamool Congress in West Bengal and Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam party in Tamil Nadu.\n\nOne of the biggest shocks of the early results was the apparent losses faced by the BJP in Uttar Pradesh, India's most populous and politically important state, which has 80 seats and is seen as a bellwether for the rest of the country. Early counts showed that the INDIA alliance was ahead of the BJP's alliance, with parties gaining more than 30 seats.\n\nIn the aftermath of the election, it appears likely that Modi will have to face a more powerful and more animated opposition than at any point over the past decade. The results also indicated that the so-called \"Modi wave\" had been dented by issues such as sky-high unemployment and inflation.\n\nThe BJP will still likely have an outright majority, meaning it can freely move forward with Modi's flagship Hindu nationalist agenda and economic reforms in his third term. However, without the two-thirds parliamentary majority the BJP had aimed for, the party will not be able to amend India's secular constitution, as many had feared.", "source": {"uri": "theguardian.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Guardian"}, "authors": [{"uri": "hannah_ellis_petersen@theguardian.com", "name": "Hannah Ellis-Petersen", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bharatiya_Janata_Party", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Bharatiya Janata Party"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Narendra_Modi", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Narendra Modi"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supermajority", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Supermajority"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/India", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "India"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exit_poll", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Exit poll"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indian_National_Congress", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Indian National Congress"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Landslide_victory", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Landslide victory"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prime_minister", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Prime minister"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Majority_government", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Majority government"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uttar_Pradesh", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Uttar Pradesh"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Uttar Pradesh"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trinamool_Congress", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Trinamool Congress"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hindu_nationalism", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Hindu nationalism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Samajwadi_Party", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Samajwadi Party"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dravida_Munnetra_Kazhagam", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coalition_government", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Coalition government"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secularism", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Secularism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constitution", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Constitution"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inflation", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Inflation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tamil_Nadu", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Tamil Nadu"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Tamil Nadu"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/West_Bengal", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "West Bengal"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "West Bengal"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Entertainment/Party_Supplies", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Entertainment/Party Supplies", "wgt": 19}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Parties/Planning", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Parties/Planning", "wgt": 18}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Children/Parties", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Children/Parties", "wgt": 19}, {"uri": "dmoz/Home/Entertaining/Party_Planning", "label": "dmoz/Home/Entertaining/Party Planning", "wgt": 20}, {"uri": "dmoz/Home/Entertaining/Children", "label": "dmoz/Home/Entertaining/Children", "wgt": 18}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 86}], "image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/668bed7fe3b87d0aed4506ce0d1829b9b7f8c948/0_182_5448_3269/master/5448.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&s=c936eb82b47475184f3ebf7e43c1abac", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9616128", "eventUri": "eng-9616128", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.3019607843137255, "wgt": 149, "relevance": 1}

Having to depend on allies to form the government could introduce some uncertainty into policymaking after a decade in which Modi has ruled with an authoritative hold.\n\nThe Hindu nationalist BJP won a majority on its own when it won power in 2014, ending India's era of unstable coalition governments, and repeated the feat in 2019.\n\nData showed BJP accounting for around 240 of the seats in which the NDA was leading, compared with the 303 it won in 2019.\n\n\"The NDA will form the government for the third time. PM Modi will be sworn in for the third time. Congress will sit in opposition for the third time,\" BJP spokesperson Jaiveer Shergill said earlier, referring to the main opposition Congress party.\n\nThe opposition INDIA alliance led by Rahul Gandhi's centrist Congress party was leading in over 230 seats, higher than expected. Congress alone was leading in nearly 100 seats, almost double the 52 it won in 2019 - a surprise jump that is expected to boost Gandhi's standing.\n\n\"The country has unanimously and clearly stated, we do not want Narendra Modi and Amit Shah to be involved in the running of this country, we do not like the way they have run this country,\" Gandhi told reporters, referring to Modi's powerful number two, Home Minister Shah. \"That is a huge message.\"\n\nGandhi said Congress would hold talks with its allies on Wednesday and decide on the future course of action, when asked if the opposition would try to form a government.\n\nThe seven-phase poll began on Apr 19 and concluded on Jun 1, with more than 640 million votes cast in the world's largest democratic exercise.\n\nThe six-week election was staggering in its size and logistical complexity, with people casting their ballots in megacities New Delhi and Mumbai, as well as in sparsely populated forest areas and in the high-altitude territory of Kashmir.\n\nVoting was also held in searing summer heat with temperatures touching nearly 50 degrees Celsius in some parts.\n\nNearly 970 million people, more than 10 per cent of the world's population, were eligible to vote. Turnout averaged 66 per cent across the seven phases, according to official data.\n\nThis was just one percentage point lower than the previous election in 2019, squashing pre-poll concerns that voters might shun a contest thought to be a foregone conclusion in Modi's favour.\n\nIn his 10 years in power, Modi has transformed India's political landscape.\n\nHis supporters see him as a self-made, strong leader who has improved India's standing in the world, and credit his pro-business policies with making the economy the world's fifth-largest.\n\nBut a decade of his leadership has also left the country deeply divided. Modi's critics and opponents say his Hindu-first politics have bred intolerance, hate speech and brazen attacks against the country's minorities, especially Muslims, who comprise 14 per cent of the population.", "source": {"uri": "channelnewsasia.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "CNA"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Democratic_Alliance", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "National Democratic Alliance"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indian_National_Congress", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Indian National Congress"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bharatiya_Janata_Party", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Bharatiya Janata Party"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Narendra_Modi", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Narendra Modi"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/India", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "India"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Hindu", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "The Hindu"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coalition_government", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Coalition government"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parliament", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Parliament"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mahatma_Gandhi", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Mahatma Gandhi"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nationalism", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Nationalism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_media", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Social media"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mumbai", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Mumbai"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Mumbai"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jaiveer_Shergill", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Jaiveer Shergill"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amit_Shah", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Amit Shah"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rahul_Gandhi", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Rahul Gandhi"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Centrism", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Centrism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minister_of_Home_Affairs_(India)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Minister of Home Affairs (India)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muslims", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Muslims"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Market_economy", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Market economy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Percentage_point", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Percentage point"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hate_speech", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Hate speech"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kashmir", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Kashmir"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democracy", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Democracy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Delhi", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "New Delhi"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "New Delhi"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Campaigns_and_Elections", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Campaigns and Elections", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Activism/Strategies", "label": "dmoz/Society/Activism/Strategies", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Government_Operations", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Government Operations", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 99}], "image": "https://onecms-res.cloudinary.com/image/upload/s--HsUsszBg--/c_crop,h_576,w_1024,x_0,y_42/fl_relative,g_south_east,l_mediacorp:cna:watermark:2023-11:afp_watermark_14112023,w_0.1/f_auto,q_auto/c_fill,g_auto,h_676,w_1200/v1/mediacorp/cna/image/2024/06/04/000_34uz2ah_1.jpg?itok=VgTip7db", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9616128", "eventUri": "eng-9616128", "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-06-04", "textStart": 90, "textEnd": 95}, {"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-04-19", "textStart": 2025, "textEnd": 2031}, {"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-06-01", "textStart": 2049, "textEnd": 2054}], "sentiment": 0.2705882352941176, "wgt": 149, "relevance": 1}

REUTERS/Adnan Abidi\n\nIndian Prime Minister Narendra Modi was set for a historic third term on Tuesday, but with a vastly diminished majority in a rare electoral setback for a leader who has held a tight grip on the nation's politics.\n\nModi's ruling Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) lost its own majority in parliament for the first time in a decade and is dependent on its regional allies to get past the half-way mark required to run the world's largest democracy.\n\nFor Modi whose approval ratings have been the highest among world leaders and who ran a presidential-style campaign, such a result is the first sign of the ground shifting.\n\n\"For the BJP to drop below the majority mark, this is a personal setback for him,\" said Yogendra Yadav, a psephologist and the founder of a small political group opposed to the BJP.\n\nSince he took power 10 years ago, riding his Hindu nationalist base, Modi has been the ruling alliance's unquestioned leader, with concerns growing about what his opponents see as the country's slide towards authoritarianism.\n\nThe man who as a boy sold tea in his home state of Gujarat has dominated India's politics so completely in the last decade that few in his party or even the parent ideological group, the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh, dare stand up to him.\n\nIndeed, throughout the campaign in scorching heat, it was Modi with his thinning white hair, a neatly trimmed white beard and immaculate Indian attire who towered over everyone else.\n\nHis giant cutouts were everywhere, his face on television screens every day as he courted India's 968 million voters with a personal \"Modi guarantee\" to change their lives.\n\n\"My sole issue with Modi today is that he has become larger than the party itself,\" said Surendra Kumar Dwivedi, a former head of the Department of Political Science at Lucknow University \"In a democratic system... a party should always supersede an individual.\"\n\n'LAST 10 YEARS IS ONLY A PREVIEW'\n\nStill, Modi will be only the second leader to win a third term after founding prime minister Jawaharlal Nehru and has promised a transformative next five years.\n\nUnder him, India has become the world's fastest growing major economy and he has said he wants to make it the world's third largest in three years, behind the United States and China.\n\n\"What we have done in the last 10 years is only a preview, a trailer,\" Modi told a recent rally. \"We have a lot more to do. Modi is taking the country to a different level in the world.\"\n\nThe BJP has dismissed opposition speculation that Modi, 73, might hang up his boots once he reaches 75, like some other party leaders have done in recent years. Modi has said he wants to lay the groundwork for India to become a fully developed nation by 2047, the 100th year of independence from British colonial rule.\n\n\"Modi will now probably enter in what I call the legacy phase of his prime ministership, driving India forward politically, economically, diplomatically and even militarily,\" said Bilveer Singh, deputy head, department of political science, at the National University of Singapore.\n\nThe idea would be to make the country a \"strong regional power that is also a counterbalance to China, but not to serve Western interest as is sometimes alleged, but mainly to promote India's interest, power and place in international politics\".\n\nA reduced mandate for Modi's ruling alliance forecloses the possibility of changes to India's secular constitution that opposition groups had warned against. Any such measures require the support of two-thirds of members of parliament.\n\nConcerns have grown in recent years that the BJP's Hindu nationalist agenda has polarised the country with Modi himself turning up the rhetoric, accusing the main opposition Congress of appeasing Muslims for votes.\n\nYashwant Deshmukh, founder of CVoter polling agency and a political analyst, said the BJP's top goal of introducing common civil laws to replace Islam's sharia-based customs and other religious codes would have to go on the back burner.", "source": {"uri": "bdnews24.com", "dataType": "news", "title":

Modi, a popular yet controversial leader who first rose to power in 2014, is poised to secure a third consecutive term as prime minister.\n\nAlthough exit polls had suggested a landslide victory for his party, the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), the results indicate that the BJP will fall short of an overall majority.\n\nTo achieve a majority in the lower house of parliament, 272 seats are required. Currently, the BJP is ahead in only 240 seats as counting progresses.

The counting of 642 million votes, in what is the world's largest election, began early this morning with approximately three-quarters of the votes tallied so far.\n\nIn a statement on X, formerly Twitter, Modi declared victory, saying: \"People have placed their faith in NDA for a third consecutive time! This is a historical feat in India's history.\" He also thanked supporters and campaign staff, noting, \"Words will never do justice to their exceptional efforts.\"\n\nThe BJP and its allies faced a broad opposition alliance led by the Congress party and its main campaign leader, Rahul Gandhi.

Turnout averaged 66% across the seven phases, according to official data.\n\nThe tallying of votes at counting centers in each of the 543 constituencies where polls were held could stretch into the evening before a final result is declared by the Election Commission of India.\n\nBut leads will emerge earlier and indicate where the results may be headed.\n\nIn his 10 years in power, Modi has transformed India's political landscape. His popularity has outstripped that of his party's, and has turned a parliamentary election into one that increasingly resembles a presidential-style campaign. The result is that the BJP relies more and more on Modi's enduring brand to stay in power, with local politicians receding into the background even in state elections.\n\n\"Modi was not just the prime campaigner, but the sole campaigner of this election,\" said Yamini Aiyar, a public policy scholar.\n\nHis supporters see him as a self-made, strong leader who has improved India's standing in the world, and credit his pro-business policies with making the economy the world's fifth-largest.\n\nBut a decade of his leadership has also left the country deeply divided. Modi's critics and opponents say his Hindu-first politics have bred intolerance, hate speech and brazen attacks against the country's minorities, especially Muslims, who comprise 14% of the population.\n\nIndia's economy, one of the fastest-growing, has become more unequal under Modi. While stock markets reach record-highs and millionaires multiply, youth unemployment has soared, with only a small portion of Indians benefitting from the economic boom.\n\nThe country's democracy, Modi's critics say, is faltering under his government, which has increasingly wielded strong-arm tactics to subdue political opponents, squeeze independent media and quash dissent. The government has rejected such accusations and say democracy is flourishing.\n\nAs polls opened in mid-April, a confident BJP initially focused its campaign on \"Modi's guarantees,\" highlighting the economic and welfare achievements that his party says have reduced poverty. With him at the helm, \"India will become a developed nation by 2047,\" Modi repeated in rally after rally.\n\nBut the campaign turned increasingly shrill, as Modi ramped up polarizing rhetoric that targeted the Muslim minority, a tactic seen to energize his core Hindu majority voters.\n\nHis opposition, the INDIA alliance led by the Congress party, has attacked Modi over his Hindu nationalist politics. It hopes to benefit from the simmering economic discontent, and its campaign has rallied around issues of joblessness, inflation and inequality.\n\nBut the broad alliance of over a dozen political parties has been beset by ideological differences and defections, raising questions over their effectiveness. Meanwhile, the alliance has also claimed they've been unfairly targeted, pointing to a spree of raids, arrests and corruption investigations against their leaders by federal agencies they say are politically motivated. The government has denied this.\n\nAnother victory would cement Modi as one of the country's most popular and important leaders. It would follow a thumping win in 2019, when the BJP won 303 out of 543 parliamentary seats.\n\nKrutika Pathi And Sheikh Saaliq, The Associated Press", "source": {"uri": "lethbridgenewsnow.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Lethbridge News Now"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/India", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "India"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Election_Commission_of_India", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Election Commission of India"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_population", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "World population"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bharatiya_Janata_Party", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Bharatiya Janata Party"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electoral_district", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Electoral district"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muslims", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Muslims"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economy_of_India", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Economy of India"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Market_economy", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Market economy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_policy", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Public policy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hate_speech", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Hate speech"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unemployment", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Unemployment"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democracy", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Democracy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stock_market", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Stock market"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hindus", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Hindus"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Independent_politician", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Independent politician"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hindu_nationalism", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Hindu nationalism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Islam_in_India", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Islam in India"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indian_National_Congress", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Indian National Congress"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Corruption", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Corruption"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Welfare", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Welfare"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economic_inequality", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Economic inequality"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Associated_Press", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Associated Press"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rhetoric", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Rhetoric"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_government_of_the_United_States", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Federal government of the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inflation", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Inflation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Developed_country", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Developed country"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poverty", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Poverty"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Political_party", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Political party"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics", "wgt": 20}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Campaigns_and_Elections", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Campaigns and Elections", "wgt": 25}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Government_Operations", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Government Operations", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Democracy", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Democracy", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Humor", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Humor", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 98}], "image": "https://d2ksr9467jthww.cloudfront.net/20240604000648/665e651e023d1607a07a9198jpeg.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9616128", "eventUri": "eng-9616128", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1372549019607843, "wgt": 147, "relevance": 1}

In 2019, Modi's party secured 303 seats alone and the NDA crossed the 350-seat threshold. This year, however, the coalition fell far short of the 400 target it had set for itself.\n\nThe ruling party faced a stronger challenge from the opposition INDIA bloc, which includes dozens of parties, which could together win over 230 seats, as some constituencies have yet to declare a winner. The Indian National Congress party, which leads the bloc, is expecting to win 100 seats, up from the 52 it won in 2019.\n\nAddressing his party workers in Delhi on Tuesday night, Modi declared that the NDA's election win was a \"victory of the people.\" He noted that before him, only the country's first prime minister, Jawaharlal Nehru, had managed to achieve a third term in office, in 1962.\n\nHe also vowed to push forward his development agenda and advance India's defense production, providing jobs for young people, increasing the volume of exports and helping farmers, among other things. \"This country will see a new chapter of big decisions. This is Modi's guarantee,\" he said, repeating the BJP's election tagline.\n\nBoth rival blocs have announced that they will meet on Wednesday, as they will attempt to form the federal government. According to experts, talks are underway between national and regional parties, and there is a chance that the current alliances could change.\n\nMeanwhile, both Modi and his key rival, Rahul Gandhi of the Indian National Congress party, secured comfortable victories in their respective parliamentary constituencies. While Modi retained his seat in Varanasi, an ancient city in Uttar Pradesh state considered holy by the Hindu community, the Gandhi family scion won in Rae Bareli, which was previously represented by his mother Sonia.\n\n\"The result is a victory for democracy\", Indian National Congress President Mallikarjun Kharge said amid the counting at a press conference, noting that the public has not given a \"complete majority\" to any party. Kharge hailed the turn of events as a \"political defeat\" for Modi, who is seeking a third consecutive term.\n\nFormer Congress President Rahul Gandhi, who also addressed the media after securing his seat in parliament, claimed that the country has \"unanimously and clearly stated\" that \"[they] do not want [Narendra Modi] and [Home Minister] Amit Shah to be involved in the running of the country.\"", "source": {"uri": "rt.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "RT"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Narendra_Modi", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Narendra Modi"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/India", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "India"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Democratic_Alliance", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "National Democratic Alliance"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coalition_government", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Coalition government"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indian_National_Congress", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Indian National Congress"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lok_Sabha", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Lok Sabha"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bharatiya_Janata_Party", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Bharatiya Janata Party"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parliament", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Parliament"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lower_house", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Lower house"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ruling_party", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Ruling party"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jawaharlal_Nehru", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Jawaharlal Nehru"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prime_minister", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Prime minister"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Delhi", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Delhi"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Delhi"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hindus", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Hindus"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mallikarjun_Kharge", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Mallikarjun Kharge"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amit_Shah", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Amit Shah"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rahul_Gandhi", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Rahul Gandhi"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minister_of_Home_Affairs_(India)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Minister of Home Affairs (India)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mahatma_Gandhi", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Mahatma Gandhi"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federation", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Federation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democracy", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Democracy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uttar_Pradesh", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Uttar Pradesh"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Uttar Pradesh"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Varanasi", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Varanasi"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Varanasi"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Entertainment/Party_Supplies", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Entertainment/Party Supplies", "wgt": 19}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Parties/Planning", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Parties/Planning", "wgt": 18}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Children/Parties", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Children/Parties", "wgt": 19}, {"uri": "dmoz/Home/Entertaining/Party_Planning", "label": "dmoz/Home/Entertaining/Party Planning", "wgt": 19}, {"uri": "dmoz/Home/Entertaining/Children", "label": "dmoz/Home/Entertaining/Children", "wgt": 18}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 99}], "image": "https://mf.b37mrtl.ru/files/2024.06/article/665f48e785f540487817083f.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9616128", "eventUri": "eng-9616128", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.4352941176470588, "wgt": 147, "relevance": 1}

The BJP loses its parliamentary majority and depends on regional allies. Modi's leadership and agenda face new challenges as concerns of polarization and authoritarianism rise.\n\nIndian Prime Minister Narendra Modi was set for a historic third term on Tuesday, but with a vastly diminished majority in a rare electoral setback for a leader who has held a tight grip on the nation's politics.\n\nModi's ruling Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) lost its own majority in parliament for the first time in a decade and is dependent on its regional allies to get past the half-way mark required to run the world's largest democracy. For Modi whose approval ratings have been the highest among world leaders and who ran a presidential-style campaign, such a result is the first sign of the ground shifting.\n\n\"For the BJP to drop below the majority mark, this is a personal setback for him,\" said Yogendra Yadav, a psephologist and the founder of a small political group opposed to the BJP. Since he took power 10 years ago, riding his Hindu nationalist base, Modi has been the ruling alliance's unquestioned leader, with concerns growing about what his opponents see as the country's slide towards authoritarianism.\n\nThe man who as a boy sold tea in his home state of Gujarat has dominated India's politics so completely in the last decade that few in his party or even the parent ideological group, the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh, dare stand up to him. Indeed, throughout the campaign in scorching heat, it was Modi with his thinning white hair, a neatly trimmed white beard and immaculate Indian attire who towered over everyone else.\n\nHis giant cutouts were everywhere, his face on television screens every day as he courted India's 968 million voters with a personal \"Modi guarantee\" to change their lives. \"My sole issue with Modi today is that he has become larger than the party itself,\" said Surendra Kumar Dwivedi, a former head of the Department of Political Science at Lucknow University \"In a democratic system... a party should always supersede an individual.\"\n\n'LAST 10 YEARS IS ONLY A PREVIEW' Still, Modi will be only the second leader to win a third term after founding prime minister Jawaharlal Nehru and has promised a transformative next five years.\n\nUnder him, India has become the world's fastest growing major economy and he has said he wants to make it the world's third largest in three years, behind the United States and China. \"What we have done in the last 10 years is only a preview, a trailer,\" Modi told a recent rally. \"We have a lot more to do. Modi is taking the country to a different level in the world.\"\n\nThe BJP has dismissed opposition speculation that Modi, 73, might hang up his boots once he reaches 75, like some other party leaders have done in recent years. Modi has said he wants to lay the groundwork for India to become a fully developed nation by 2047, the 100th year of independence from British colonial rule. \"Modi will now probably enter in what I call the legacy phase of his prime ministership, driving India forward politically, economically, diplomatically and even militarily,\" said Bilveer Singh, deputy head, department of political science, at the National University of Singapore.\n\nThe idea would be to make the country a \"strong regional power that is also a counterbalance to China, but not to serve Western interest as is sometimes alleged, but mainly to promote India's interest, power and place in international politics\". A reduced mandate for Modi's ruling alliance forecloses the possibility of changes to India's secular constitution that opposition groups had warned against. Any such measures require the support of two-thirds of members of parliament.\n\nConcerns have grown in recent years that the BJP's Hindu nationalist agenda has polarised the country with Modi himself turning up the rhetoric, accusing the main opposition Congress of appeasing Muslims for votes. Yashwant Deshmukh, founder of CVoter polling agency and a political analyst, said the BJP's top goal of introducing common civil laws to replace Islam's sharia-based customs and other religious codes would have to go on the back burner.\n\n\"These will have to be debated,\" he said.\n\n(This story has not been edited by Devdiscourse staff and is auto-generated from a syndicated feed.)", "source":

As India uses electronic voting machines, results are expected the same day.\n\nThe elections will test the popularity of 73-year-old Modi whose image of a strong leader and champion of Hindu nationalism has been boosted by a host of welfare measures for tens of millions of poor people during his decade in power.\n\nThe BJP campaign was dominated by the Indian leader, who crisscrossed the country to hold over 200 rallies.\n\nBefore elections got under way, the BJP was expected to cruise to an easy victory. The party had set a target of winning a supermajority by bagging 400 seats.\n\nAccording to exit polls broadcast by several television channels, the party along with its allies could win 350 seats or more, far ahead of the 272 needed for a simple majority. That would hand Modi a rare, third straight term in office.\n\n\"It's a litmus test for Mr. Modi. When elections started, it appeared to be a one-horse race. He appeared very invincible, very formidable and raised the bar very high,\" according to political analyst Rasheed Kidwai.\n\nMany observers had expected an opposition alliance of over two dozen parties that is challenging Modi of cutting into his party's huge Parliamentary majority but exit polls projected that it would not be able to do so and showed the alliance trailing with around 150 seats. However, in the vast, diverse country, exit polls have not always been reliable.\n\n\"The final numbers will depend on whether the BJP can hold ground in populous northern states where the party has secured huge success in the past,\" analyst Kidwai said.\n\nAfter polls closed on Saturday, Modi thanked voters and expressed confidence that the \"people of India have voted in record numbers\" to reelect the government.\n\nHis comments came after he ended two days of meditation at the southernmost tip of India at a memorial for Hindu philosopher Swami Vivekananda -- images released by his party showed him clad in saffron robes with eyes closed and prayer beads in hand.\n\nThe opposition's hopes of making gains rest on tapping into growing resentment over high unemployment that faces the country's huge youth population and rising prices.\n\nCongress Party leader, Rahul Gandhi, who was the face of the opposition campaign, focused his campaign on the need to create jobs and growing wealth inequality in the country and said the government's policies have favored the rich at the expense of the poor. The party has promised cash transfers to poor women and a guarantee of apprenticeships for college graduates. It has also raised concerns about democratic backsliding under Modi.\n\nThe Congress Party has been marginalized over the last decade amid the BJP's rise into a formidable political force under Modi - it only holds 52 seats in Parliament.\n\n\"Much will depend on how the Congress Party and its allies perform in swing states like Maharashtra in the west, Bihar in the east and Karnataka in the south,\" according to Kidwai.\n\nThe opposition faces a daunting task. To make significant gains it would also have to fare well in populous northern states, where the BJP is well entrenched and where its Hindu nationalist agenda resonates the most. The BJP, on its part, hopes to expand its influence in some southern states where it has virtually no presence.\n\nThe election campaign has been called one of India's most divisive. At rallies, Modi charged the Congress Party of being pro-Muslim and of planning to hand benefits reserved for lower caste Hindus to Muslims if it is voted into power - analysts said the polarizing rhetoric was a bid to shore up support among his Hindu base after voting got off to a lackluster start last month.\n\nIn a letter on Thursday addressed to voters in Punjab, former Prime Minister Manmohan Singh accused Modi of indulging in the \"most vicious form of hate speeches that are purely divisive in nature\" during the campaign and accused him lowering the dignity of the Prime Minister's office.\n\nPunjab was among the seven states and one federal territory that voted on Saturday.\n\nOnly India's first prime minister, Jawaharlal Nehru, secured a third straight term in office. The winning party is expected to form the next government by mid-June before the term of the present Parliament ends.", "source": {"uri": "voanews.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "VOA Voice of

It's a stunning blow to a leader who has dominated Indian politics since he first took power a decade ago.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg\n\nModi's Bharatiya Janata Party was leading in 241 seats, short of the 272 needed to form a government and well behind the 303 it won in the 2019 election. The opposition bloc, known as the Indian National Developmental Inclusive Alliance, was on course to win more than 220 seats, the results showed.\n\nModi now needs to secure the support of two key members of his broader National Democratic Alliance who control some 30 seats -- enough to flip the balance of power in parliament. Leaders of those two parties have a history of switching sides, and only joined up with Modi a few months ago, making it unclear whether they will stick with him or back the opposition bloc.\n\nIndia Election Results 2024 -- Follow Live Results\n\nIndia's NSE Nifty 50 Index tumbled 5.9%, its worst day in more than four years, as it became clear the election outcome would be much closer than expected. Stocks had hit a record high on Monday after exit polls released over the weekend showed Modi would coast to an easy victory in the marathon, six-week election. Before voting kicked off on April 19, he had boldly predicted that his alliance would win a whopping 400 seats.\n\n\"This is not an election -- it is a kind of political earthquake,\" said Niranjan Sahoo, senior fellow with the New Delhi-based Observer Research Foundation who has written several books on Indian politics. \"Even if Modi becomes the prime minister, his position will be diminished to a great extent. He will not be the same Modi.\"\n\nThe result is a disappointment for the 73-year-old leader, who has been the main face of the BJP's election campaign and built the party primarily around himself. Besides raising questions about Modi's own future as prime minister, a weak coalition government will likely make it difficult for him to push through tough economic reforms or further his Hindu nationalist agenda assuming he returns to power.\n\nThe lackluster performance marks the first major setback at national polls for Modi. He had looked unbeatable heading into the election, backed by one of the world's fastest-growing economies and the fulfillment of key promises appealing to India's Hindu majority, including the building of a temple on the site where a 500-year-old mosque had been torn down.\n\nYet more than 20 opposition parties, spearheaded by Rahul Gandhi, formed a united front in a bid to stop Modi's once-dominant electoral machine. A mixture of regional and caste-based groups, the alliance focused on appealing to voters who felt left out of India's growth story, which has been marked by growing inequality, pervasive joblessness, rising living costs and growing demand for welfare support.\n\nSigns of trouble for Modi emerged after the first of seven rounds of voting. A dip in turnout triggered a broad get-out-the-vote effort that saw Modi adopt a more strident tone, firing up his Hindu nationalist base with divisive anti-Muslim rhetoric and attacks on the opposition's welfare policies.\n\nModi had appealed to India's 1.4 billion people with a combination of business-friendly policies, welfare measures for the poor and Hindu nationalist policies. He had pledged more of the same in his third term, vowing measures to create jobs while also replacing India's religion-based marriage and inheritance laws with a uniform civil code -- a measure that Muslims, Christians and other minorities oppose because it would prevent them from adhering to some faith-based laws.\n\nThose more contentious proposals may now be off the table. The results also call into question whether Modi would have the political capital to implement contentious changes to land and labor laws, as well as a slew of other reform measures needed to achieve his goal of turning India into a developed nation by mid-century.\n\nEven with a reduced mandate or a change in government, India's growth trajectory should largely remain positive. Business leaders from Elon Musk to Jamie Dimon have hailed India's potential as an alternative to China, with some economists projecting that the nation's $3.5 trillion economy can become the largest contributor to global growth within the next five years.\n\n\"Political stability has been at the very core of both economic growth and investor sentiment over the last decade,\" said Sumeet Abrol, a partner at business consultancy Grant Thornton Bharat. \"The verdict of the world's largest democracy will put decisive leadership to reforms to a test the markets haven't seen in the last decade, leaving investor sentiment exposed to cautiousness and volatility in the near term.\"\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek", "source": {"uri": "ca.finance.yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo!

REUTERS/Adnan Abidi\n\nBy YP Rajesh\n\nNEW DELHI (Reuters) - India's Prime Minister Narendra Modi is expected to win a record-equalling third consecutive term in office on Tuesday when the 642 million votes cast in the world's largest election are counted.\n\nExit polls have projected a big win for Modi and if they are confirmed - they have often got the outcome wrong in India - Modi's Hindu nationalists will have triumphed in a vitriolic campaign in which parties accused each other of religious bias and of posing a threat to sections of the population.\n\nInvestors have already cheered the prospects of another Modi term, expecting it to deliver for India further years of strong economic growth and pro-business reforms, while a possible two-thirds majority in parliament could allow major changes to the constitution, rivals and critics fear.\n\nNearly one billion people were eligible to vote in the seven-phase, seven-week poll which began on April 19 and concluded on June 1, held in searing summer heat with temperatures touching nearly 50\u00b0 Celsius (122\u00b0 Fahrenheit) in some parts.\n\nYet more than 66% of registered voters turned out, just one percentage point lower than the previous election in 2019, belying fears that voters might shun a contest thought to be a foregone conclusion in Modi's favour.\n\nModi, 73, who first swept to power in 2014 by promising growth and change, is seeking to be only the second prime minister after India's independence leader Jawaharlal Nehru to win three straight terms.\n\nHe began his campaign by showcasing his record in office including economic growth, welfare policies, national pride, Hindu nationalism and his own personal commitment to fulfilling promises which he called \"Modi's Guarantee\".\n\nHowever, he changed tack after low voter turnout in the first phase and accused the opposition, especially the Congress party which leads an alliance of two dozen groups, of favouring India's 200 million Muslims - a shift analysts said made the campaign coarse and divisive.\n\nThey said the pivot may have been aimed at firing up the Hindu nationalist base of Modi's Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) to draw them to vote. Modi defended himself against criticism that he is stoking divisions between Hindus and Muslims to win votes and said that he was only faulting the opposition campaign.\n\nVERY HOPEFUL, SAYS OPPOSITION\n\nThe opposition INDIA alliance, led by Rahul Gandhi's Congress party, denied it favoured Muslims in the Hindu-majority country and said Modi would destroy the constitution if he returned to power and end affirmative action enjoyed by the so-called backward castes. The BJP rejects this.\n\nThe opposition alliance also promised more welfare measures and handouts, with surveys saying unemployment, inflation and rural distress were the main concerns of voters.\n\nTV exit polls released on Saturday after voting ended projected the BJP-led National Democratic Alliance could win a two-thirds majority in the 543-member lower house of parliament.\n\nSeveral major polls projected the BJP alone could win more than the 303 it won in 2019.\n\nThe projections pushed Indian shares to lifetime highs on Monday while the rupee gained and bond yields dropped, as investors were buoyed by expectations of sustained economic growth.\n\nExit polls, which are conducted by polling agencies, have a patchy record in India, with analysts saying it is a challenge to get them right in the large and diverse country.\n\nOpposition parties dismissed them saying they were unscientific and did not reflect reality.\n\n\"We are very hopeful that our results are completely opposite to what the exit poll is saying,\" former Congress party president and Rahul Gandhi's mother, Sonia, said on Monday.\n\n(Reporting by YP Rajesh; Editing by Toby Chopra)\n\nSign Up for Springs AM Update Your morning rundown of the latest news from Colorado Springs and around the country\n\nSign Up View all of our newsletters.

The Hindu nationalist leader has won the seat in the last two elections with huge margins.\n\nAll eyes are now on Tuesday, when votes will be counted for all 543 elected seats in the lower house of Parliament. As India uses electronic voting machines, results are expected the same day.\n\nThe elections will test the popularity of 73-year-old Modi, whose image as a strong leader and champion of Hindu nationalism has been boosted by a host of welfare measures for tens of millions of poor people during his decade in power.\n\nThe Bharatiya Janata Party campaign was dominated by the Indian leader, who crisscrossed the country to hold over 200 rallies.\n\nBefore elections got underway, the BJP was expected to cruise to an easy victory. The party had set a target of winning a supermajority by winning 400 seats.\n\nMost observers say it could fall short of that ambitious goal even though it is expected to win a majority.\n\n\"It's a litmus test for Mr. Modi. When elections started it appeared to be a one-horse race. He appeared very invincible, very formidable and raised the bar very high,\" political analyst Rasheed Kidwai told VOA.\n\nBut he said an opposition alliance of more than two dozen parties that is challenging Modi has put up a spirited fight.\n\n\"The final numbers will depend on whether the BJP can hold ground in populous northern states where the party has secured huge success in the past,\" he said.\n\nOn Friday, the Indian leader started two days of meditation at the southernmost tip of India at a memorial for Hindu philosopher Swami Vivekananda -- images released by his party showed him clad in saffron robes with eyes closed and prayer beads in hand.\n\nBoth Modi and the opposition alliance have exuded confidence about winning.\n\nThe opposition's hopes of making gains rest on tapping into growing resentment over high unemployment that faces the country's huge youth population and rising prices.\n\nCongress Party leader, Rahul Gandhi, who was the face of the opposition, focused his campaign on the need to create jobs and growing wealth inequality in the country and said the government's policies have favored the rich at the expense of the poor. The party has promised cash transfers to poor women and a guarantee of apprenticeships for college graduates. It has also raised concerns about democratic backsliding under Modi.\n\nThe Congress Party has been marginalized over the last decade amid the BJP's rise into a formidable political force under Modi - it only holds 52 seats in Parliament.\n\nPolitical observers said the party and its allies could regain some momentum.\n\n\"Much will depend on how the Congress Party and its allies perform in swing states like Maharashtra in the west, Bihar in the east and Karnataka in the south,\" according to Kidwai.\n\nStill the opposition faces a daunting task. To make significant gains it would also have to fare well in populous northern states, where the BJP is well entrenched and where its Hindu nationalist agenda resonates the most. The BJP, for its part, hopes to expand its influence in some southern states where it has virtually no presence.\n\nThe election campaign has been called one of India's most divisive. At rallies, Modi charged that the Congress Party was pro-Muslim and planned to hand benefits reserved for lower caste Hindus to Muslims if it is voted into power - analysts said the polarizing rhetoric was a bid to shore up support among his Hindu base after voting got off to a lackluster start last month.\n\nIn a letter addressed to voters in Punjab on Thursday, former Prime Minister Manmohan Singh accused Modi of indulging in the \"most vicious form of hate speeches that are purely divisive in nature\" during the campaign and accused him of lowering the dignity of the prime minister's office.\n\nPunjab was among the seven states and one federal territory that voted Saturday.\n\nOnly India's first prime minister, Jawaharlal Nehru, secured a third straight term in office.

Who is he?", "body": "NEW DELHI (AP) -- India's Prime Minister Narendra Modi, who claimed victory for his alliance in an election seen as a referendum on his decade in power, is a popular but polarizing leader who has presided over a fast-growing economy while advancing Hindu nationalism.\n\nModi, 73, is only the second Indian prime minister to win a third straight term.\n\n\u00d7\n\nAlready a Subscriber? Sign in You are logged in Switch accounts\n\nHis Hindu nationalist Bharatiya Janata Party failed to secure a majority on its own -- as it did in 2014 and 2019 -- after facing a stronger than expected challenge from the opposition. But together with other parties in his National Democratic Alliance, his bloc won enough seats for a slim parliamentary majority and to form his third consecutive government, Election Commission data showed Tuesday.\n\nTo supporters, Modi is a larger-than-life figure who has improved India's standing in the world, helped make its economy the world's fifth-largest, and streamlined the country's vast welfare program, which serves around 60% of the population. To some, he may even be more than human.\n\nARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW ARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW\n\nBut to critics, he's a cult leader who has eroded India's democracy and advanced divisive politics targeting the Muslims who make up 14% of the country's population. They say he has also increasingly wielded strong-arm tactics to subdue political opponents, squeeze independent media and quash dissent.\n\nModi's government has rejected such accusations and says democracy is flourishing.\n\nPolitical analysts say Modi's victory was driven by social welfare programs that provided benefits from food to housing, and the strident Hindu nationalism that has consolidated a majority of Hindu votes for his party. Hindus make up 80% of India's population.\n\nThe economy is growing by 7% and more than 500 million Indians have opened bank accounts during Modi's tenure, but that growth hasn't created enough jobs, and inequality has worsened under his rule, according to some economists.\n\nModi began his election campaign two months ago by promising to turn India into a developed country by 2047 and focused on highlighting his administration's welfare policies and a robust digital infrastructure that have benefited millions of Indians.\n\nARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW ARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW\n\nBut as the campaign progressed, he increasingly resorted to anti-Muslim rhetoric, calling them \"infiltrators\" and making references to a Hindu nationalist claim that Muslims were overtaking the Hindu population by having more children. Modi also accused the opposition of pandering to the minority community.\n\nConspicous piety has long been a centerpiece of Modi's brand, but he's also begun suggesting that he was chosen by God.\n\nIn a TV interview during the campaign, he said \"When my mother was alive, I used to believe that I was born biologically. After she passed away, upon reflecting on all my experiences, I was convinced that God had sent me.\"\n\nIn January, he delivered on a longstanding Hindu nationalist ambition by leading the opening of a controversial temple on the site of a razed mosque.\n\nAfter campaigning ended last week, Modi went to a Hindu spiritual site for a televised 45-hour meditation retreat. Most Indian TV channels spent hours showing the event.\n\nARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW ARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW\n\nBorn in 1950 to a lower-caste family in western Gujarat state, as a young boy Modi joined the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh, a paramilitary, right-wing group which has long been accused of stoking hatred against Muslims. RSS is the ideological parent of Modi's BJP.\n\nThe tea seller's son got his first big political break in 2001, becoming chief minister of his home state of Gujarat. A few months in, anti-Muslim riots ripped through the region, killing at least 1,000 people. There were suspicions that Modi quietly supported the riots, but he has denied the allegations.\n\nIn 2005, the U.S. revoked Modi's visa, citing concerns that he did not act to stop the communal violence. An investigation approved by the Indian Supreme Court later absolved Modi, but the stain of the dark moment has lingered.\n\nThirteen years later, Modi led his Hindu nationalist party to a spectacular victory in the 2014 national elections after promising sweeping reforms to jumpstart India's flagging economy.\n\nBut Modi's critics and opponents say his Hindu-first politics have bred intolerance, hate speech and brazen attacks against the country's minorities, especially Muslims.\n\nARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW ARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW\n\nMonths after securing a second term in 2019, his government revoked the special status of disputed Kashmir, the country's only Muslim-majority state, and split it into two federally governed territories. His government passed a law that grants citizenship to religious minorities from Muslim countries in the region but excludes Muslims.\n\nDecision like these have made Modi hugely popular among his diehard supporters who hail him as the champion of the Hindu majority and see India emerging as a Hindu majoritarian state.\n\nModi has spent his political life capitalizing on religious tensions for political gain, said Christophe Jaffrelot, a political scientist and expert on Modi and the Hindu right. During his time as a state leader, he pioneered a embrace of Hindu nationalism unlike anything seen before in Indian politics.\n\n\"That style has remained. It was invented in Gujarat and today it is a national brand,\" Jaffrelot said.\n\nRead more on the India Election at thestar.com", "source": {"uri": "thestar.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The

National Democratic Alliance (NDA) is going to form the government for the third time, we are grateful to the people,\" Modi told cheering supporters at his party headquarters in New Delhi, referring to the initials of his political alliance. \"This is a victory for the world's largest democracy.\"\n\nPreliminary figures from the election commission indicate Modi's ruling Bharatiya Janata Party falling short of securing the 272 seats needed to win an outright majority in parliament, a stunning upset that leaves them reliant on longstanding coalition partners to form a government.\n\nModi is still set to form a government with the help of his NDA allies - a third consecutive term and a landmark that makes him one of the most successful politicians in post-independence India.\n\nBut the results are nonetheless something of a personal blow to Modi, who had triumphantly vowed to win a 400-seat supermajority in this year's election - and romped to victory the last two contests with a simple majority for the BJP, turning his Hindu nationalist right-wing party into an electoral juggernaut.\n\nIndia's opposition, who had largely been written off in the polls and by many analysts, portrayed the result as a rejection of Modi's divisive style.\n\nRahul Gandhi, the leader of India's National Congress, said early election results showed that the \"country has unanimously and clearly\" stated that it does not want Modi and his party to run the country.\n\n\"We do not appreciate the way they have run this country for the last 10 years so that is a huge message for Mr. Narendra Modi,\" he said outside his party's headquarters in New Delhi.\n\nCongress led an alliance of opposition parties that tried to topple Modi. While they look set to have failed in that task, they have dented his previous aura of electoral invincibility.\n\nPreliminary results also suggest they have chipped away at BJP seats, including in some of the ruling party's traditional strongholds. Congress alone are currently set to double the number of seats they won in 2019, even taking key seats in traditional BJP strongholds.\n\nThe election commission preliminary figures currently have the BJP's alliance winning around 300 seats compared to 230 for the opposition alliances.\n\nElection authorities are still counting votes and final results are expected in the coming hours.\n\nMeanwhile Indian stocks plunged Tuesday as Modi's dream of a landslide victory slipped away, raising doubts about his ability to push through more aggressive economic reforms.\n\n'Sent by god'\n\nTo his millions of supporters in the Hindu majority nation, 73-year-old Modi is an icon whose policies have transformed ordinary people's lives and helped realize the nascent promise of social mobility in a country once left impoverished by colonialism now embracing the 21st century with economic growth and confidence.\n\nWhen he ran for office in 2014, he said he was a \"servant\" to India's 1.4 billion citizens. Five years later, he positioned himself as the nation's \"chowkidar\" or \"watchman,\" promising to guard them from all possible threats. This year, he claimed to have been sent by god, chosen by the divine to \"represent all the people of India.\"\n\nBut to many religious minorities in the diverse democracy, that final statement is both loaded and fearsome.\n\nReligious persecution and Islamophobia have increased sharply on his watch, with critics accusing him of tacitly endorsing sectarianism to bolster his party's Hindu-nationalist dreams.\n\nThey say the prime minister is dragging India away from the constitutionally secular roots and transforming India into a majoritarian Hindu state, an evolution with potentially profound implications in a giant nation with a troubled history of explosive inter-communal violence.\n\nGiven India's strategic position in Asia and its booming economy, Modi's victory will reverberate far beyond its borders, capturing the attention of the United States, China and Russia in particular.\n\nWashington has long seen New Delhi as a regional crucial bulwark against an increasingly assertive China. But at the same time India remains close to Moscow and has thirstily snapped up cheap Russian oil despite the invasion of Ukraine and western-led sanctions.\n\nModi now sets his sights on deepening his transformation of India, with the goal of turning the vast country into a developed nation by 2047, the centenary of independence from colonial British rule. He inherited a rising economy and India's growth remains impressive, filled with a populous young workforce.\n\nBut that same workforce is also chronically underemployed, with youth unemployment spiraling and much of the country's growing wealth distributed unequally.\n\nFrom April 19 to June 1, more than 640 million people cast their vote at polling stations across the country, from the high peaks of the Himalayas to the remote jungles of the west. And though turnout slightly dipped from the record levels of 2019, that a democratically elected leader won a third term speaks to his levels of popularity.\n\n\"No one can do for us what our Prime Minister Modi can,\" said BJP worker Rajgopal Kashyap, from the party's headquarters in New Delhi. \"He has come to us as an instrument of God. He will take our country forward and is the only one who can run the country.\"\n\nNo modern Indian politician has been able to establish the cult-like following that Modi has.\n\nAt his rallies, tens of thousands gather in religious devotion to glimpse a man they say they hope never loses his grip on power. His face is plastered on buses and billboards across the country, and his voice enters the homes of millions every month via his flagship radio program and increasingly pliant media landscape.\n\n\"Look at the way he has projected his personality,\" his unofficial biographer Nilanjan Mukhopadhyay told CNN. \"Very finely manicured, (someone) who exudes power. He is a very performative political leader. He is no less than a rock star on the stage.\"\n\nSupporters say he is the best person to cement the country's rank as a major global player.\n\n\"For us middle-class people, (Prime Minister Narendra Modi) is the only one who has done anything, who has shined India's name abroad,\" said Surjeet Singh, a driver in New Delhi.\n\nPolitical scientist Christophe Jaffrelot says such sentiment \"can be seen across the board.\"\n\nThere's a feeling that Modi makes Indians \"proud again,\" he said. \"There is a sense in India of vulnerability, lack of self-esteem. So, to be recognized as a great power despite everything is attributed to him.\"\n\n'We won't be safe'\n\nModi projects himself as an outsider from humble origins. The son of a tea seller from a small town in Gujarat state, his story, his colleagues say, resonates with millions. \"He comes from a poor background and that helps him understands the people of India,\" Varanasi BJP president Dileep Patel previously told CNN.\n\nOver the last decade his administration has upgraded the country's aging transport network, building highways to connect small villages with major cities. He has overseen the development of new power plants and maritime projects and, according to recent remarks from Modi himself, subsidized the construction of some 40 million concrete homes for improvised families.\n\nHis decade in power has not been without controversy.\n\nModi faced widespread criticism early in his tenure when he banned India's 500 and 1,000 rupee bank notes, deeming them \"worthless pieces of paper,\" sparking panic in the cash heavy economy.\n\nIn 2019, he faced the wrath of angry farmers when they took to the streets to demand guaranteed prices for their crops in the biggest protests the country has ever seen. Two years later, critics blamed him for mismanaging the country's response to the Covid-19 pandemic, which led to more than half a million deaths, according to official figures.\n\nAnd for some observers, a troubling, divisive pattern has also emerged through the years.\n\nAnother five years of Modi, said Congress supporter Sunita Gautam, will be \"horrible plight for women\" and minorities.\n\n\"We won't be safe. It's horrible for Muslims. It's horrible for Dalits. Who is it good for?\" she asked. \"Modi promised employment for youth but look at the number of people unemployed.\"\n\nThis breaking news story has been updated.\n\nThe-CNN-Wire\n\n\u2122 & \u00a9 2024 Cable News Network, Inc., a Warner Bros.

As it progressed over seven phases until 1 June, a deadly heatwave gripped the country, with temperatures almost touching 50C in areas, leading to deaths of dozens of voters and polling officials.\n\nCounting begins at 8am on Tuesday, and results are expected the same day. Vote counting is done simultaneously at counting stations in each of the 543 constituencies around the country.\n\nRelated: 'He likes scaring people': how Modi's right-hand man, Amit Shah, runs India\n\nAccording to a flurry of exit polls released on Saturday night, Modi and his Bharatiya Janata party (BJP) are looking at a decisive win and may even gain seats to win a two-thirds majority in parliament, which would allow the government to make far-reaching amendments to the constitution.\n\nIt would be a historic achievement for Modi, India's strongman prime minister, whose Hindu nationalist politics have significantly re-shaped India's secular democracy over the past decade. No prime minister since Jawaharlal Nehru, India's first post-independence premier, has won three consecutive terms.\n\nAs the election unfolded, allegations of irregularities by the BJP began emerge. Opponents alleged the BJP was undermining India's democratic processes through the harassment and intimidation of opposition candidates and parties and suppression of Muslim voters who are not the BJP's usual vote bank. BJP leaders, including the prime minister himself, were accused of openly violating election rules as they resorted to polarising anti-Muslim rhetoric on the campaign trail.\n\nOpposition parties also accused the BJP of using state machinery to go after them, including the arrest of senior opposition figures and the freezing of the funds of the Congress party by the tax authorities.\n\nUS thinktank Freedom House said this year the BJP had \"increasingly used government institutions to target political opponents\".\n\nOn Sunday, Arwind Kejriwal, one of the most prominent opposition leaders and the chief minister of Delhi, was returned to jail after briefly being released on a temporary bail in order to campaign in the elections. Kejriwal has alleged the corruption case against him is \"politically motivated\" by the Modi government in order to undermine his party, a charge the BJP denies.\n\nRahul Gandhi, the most prominent member of the opposition's once-formidable Congress party and scion of a dynasty that dominated Indian politics for decades, was convicted of criminal libel last year after a complaint by a member of Modi's party.\n\nRelated: 'Modi builds highways but where are our jobs?': rising inequality looms over India's election\n\nHis two-year prison sentence saw him disqualified from parliament until the verdict was suspended by a higher court and raised concerns over democratic norms.\n\nHemant Soren, the former chief minister of the eastern state of Jharkhand, was also arrested in February in a separate corruption probe.\n\nKejriwal, Rahul Gandhi and Soren are all members of an opposition alliance composed of more than two dozen parties, but the bloc has struggled to make inroads against Modi. According to predictions, the alliance, which includes the Congress party, will get just only 125 to 165 seats out of 543.\n\nModi was widely seen as a frontrunner even before elections began. Over his ten years as prime minister, the cult of personality around him has grown while his power has become deeply entrenched. Several exit polls suggested that the BJP's dominance would increase further this time, with gains in southern states such as Tamil Nadu and eastern states such as West Bengal, where the party had previously struggled to gain strong support due to regional opposition.\n\n\"On one very basic level, the election didn't matter,\" said Neelanjan Sircar, a senior fellow at the Centre for Policy Research in Delhi. \"The dominant view was always that Modi and the BJP are coming back, irrespective of the numbers. The bigger question mark is: what genuine democratic legitimacy will be derived from this election?\"\n\nIndia's opposition sought to dismiss the exit poll projections, which they described as \"bogus\" and \"fraudulent\" and alleged they were deliberate attempts to justify rigging of the elections.\n\nThe mainstream media is seen to have been brought under the thumb of the BJP government and predominately pro-Modi narratives were broadcast during the campaign, including dozens of fawning interviews with the prime minister where he proclaimed several times to have been chosen by God.\n\nYet analysts warned that that the one-sided media narrative and election being seen as fait accompli before campaigning even began had led to a growing mistrust in the electoral system among the public. During the campaign, the election commission - the body tasked with regulating polls - was among those widely accused of being \"spineless\" and no longer a neutral observer after it ignored repeated calls to hold Modi and the BJP account for repeated alleged violations of election rules.\n\nOne of the most prominent figures vocalising these frustrations over the campaign was Dhruv Rathee, an Indian YouTuber whose videos criticising the Modi government and alleging an erosion of India's democratic processes have earned him 21 million subscribers, far outreaching Modi's social media presence.\n\nRathee has been releasing political commentary videos since 2017 but over the course of the election he rose to become a household name as one of the few who dared to voice dissent.\n\n\"This is the least fair election in India's history,\" said Rathee from Germany, where he now lives. \"Opposition leaders have been put in jail, anyone who stands up to the BJP is harassed by the state or by police and the BJP has been given free rein to violate all the election rules and stir up hatred. There's nothing fair about it.\"\n\nAs campaigning came to a close, Modi - who had appeared at over 200 rallies over the course of campaigning - took himself on a 45-hour meditation retreat at a spiritual site in Tamil Nadu. Though it was said to be in isolation, hundreds of tv cameras were present and it was broadcast live across 24 hour news channels.\n\n\"Sources\" told right wing media that the prime minister would be surviving on a liquid-only diet of coconut water and grape juice.", "source": {"uri": "uk.news.yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo News UK"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

Let's have a look at how world media covers the elections.\n\nPrime Minister Narendra Modi-led Bhartiya Janata Party has won the maximum number of seats but short fall of securing a majority. In India, there are 543 seats in the lower house and \"272\" is the magical number to claim a majority. Although the Saffron party has secured a large chunk of votes, the results were not as per the expectations claimed by PM Modi and the exit polls of nearly all media outlets. Ever since the election campaign started, the BJP boasted of securing 400 seats. It coined \"abki bar 400 par\" (This time, we will win more than 400 seats). However, the slogan does not pass to the voters, at least in Uttar Pradesh, where the BJP was pretty sure to register a majority of Lok Sabha seats.\n\nAs the world's most populous democracy voted in the seven phases from April 20 to June 1, the world media covered it extensively. Let's have a look at how world media, including Pakistan's Dawn, the UK's BBC, Qatar-based Al Jazeera and the US's New York Times.\n\n\"India election vote count shows Modi alliance heading to majority but no landslide\"- Pakistan-based Dawn news portal has published a long article with this headline.\n\nWhile the Chinese mouthpiece, Global Times, has published an opinion with a header- \"Can the dragon and the elephant dance together?\". Here, the dragon stands for China whereas \"the elephant\" stands for India.\n\nCNN, an American broadcaster and news website, has published with header- \"Modi facing shock result\".\n\nMeanwhile, Qatar-based Al Jazeera wrote- \"Modi-led BJP loses majority in big setback\".\n\nNew York Times, an American media, wrote- \"India's Election Results Suggest a Setback for Modi\" as its header.\n\nRT News, a Russian media outlet, described \"Indian election surprise as opposition rises to challenge Modi\" as its lead.\n\nNearly 970 million people -- more than 10% of the world's population -- were eligible to vote and turnout averaged 66%, according to official data. The tallying at counting centres in 543 constituencies could stretch well into the evening before final results are announced, though substantial leads are likely to emerge earlier.\n\nWhat Modi says after winning Varanasi constituency\n\nPM Modi says his coalition is on the path to a third straight term in government after India's marathon election. \"People have placed their faith in NDA, for a third consecutive time! This is a historical feat in India's history,\" Modi said in a post on X, referring to the National Democratic Alliance headed by his party. He said he will continue to work and fulfil the aspirations of the people.\n\nAs Modi posted his comment, his coalition had won 128 seats and led in 157 races, according to the Election Commission. A total of 272 seats are needed to form a majority government.\n\nHow India's Opposition party, INDIA, reacts\n\nIndia's opposition Congress party has called its alliance's strong showing in the polls a \"win for democracy\" and a \"moral and political loss\" for PM Modi. Congress party President Mallikarjun Kharge told a news conference in New Delhi that because no party had a clear majority, the mandate was against Modi. \"Our fight has not ended yet. We will continue to fight for the country's development, for the constitution, for the benefit of the people,\" Kharge said.\n\nModi's coalition led in a majority of seats Tuesday in India's general election, according to early figures, but faced a stronger challenge from the opposition than expected.\n\nRahul Gandhi, the face of the Congress party's campaign, said the results showed India does not want Modi. \"People's clear message to PM Modi and Home Minister Amit Shah is that we don't want you to run the nation,\" Gandhi said. \"The poorest of this country have defended the constitution of India.\"\n\n(With inputs from agency)", "source": {"uri": "indiatvnews.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "India TV News"}, "authors": [{"uri": "ajit_kumar@indiatvnews.com", "name": "Ajit Kumar",

However, its coalition partners have gained additional seats.\n\nThe results are a personal blow to Mr Modi, who has always secured majorities in elections as both chief minister of Gujarat state and India's prime minister, and dominated the country's politics for a decade.\n\nThe verdict marks a surprising revival for the Congress Party-led INDIA opposition alliance, defying earlier predictions of its decline, and sharply diverging from both exit polls and pre-election surveys.\n\nMore than 640 million people voted in a marathon seven-week election, hailed as a \"world record\" by election authorities. Nearly half of the voters were women.\n\nMany world leaders have crawled across the finishing line in their third term elections and Mr Modi is no exception. The BJP remains India's single largest party by seats, and if Mr Modi secures a third term with his allies, the prime minister matches the record of Jawaharlal Nehru, India's first premier.\n\nBut the significant loss of seats for his party - more than 50 - dims the allure of a third term, especially given Mr Modi's campaign targeting 400 coalition seats, making anything less seem like an under-achievement.\n\nThis has led to jubilation in the Congress camp and some despair in BJP quarters. Despite the BJP emerging as the single largest party, the burden of hype and expectations has left many of their supporters disheartened.\n\nMr Modi's supporters believe securing a third term can be attributed to several factors: a record of stable governance, the appeal of continuity, efficient welfare programmes, and the perception that he has enhanced India's global image.\n\nTo his Hindu nationalist base, Mr Modi delivered on key manifesto promises: revoking the autonomy of Indian-administered Kashmir, building the Ram temple in Ayodhya and implementing a controversial citizenship law. Many BJP-ruled states have implemented laws tightening regulations on interfaith marriages.\n\nThe BJP's significant drop in seats may be linked to joblessness, rising prices, growing inequality and a controversial army recruitment reform, among other things. Mr Modi's harsh and divisive campaign, particularly targeting Muslims, could also have alienated voters in some regions.\n\nHis ambitious slogan \"Ab ki baar, 400 paar,\" aiming for more than 400 seats for his NDA alliance, may have backfired, with such a massive majority raising fears of constitutional changes among the poor.\n\nMr Modi's party faced its largest setback in Uttar Pradesh (UP), a state larger than the United Kingdom and three times as populous. With 80 parliamentary seats, UP holds significant sway in national politics - many consider it the gateway to Delhi. Both Mr Modi and Rahul Gandhi hold seats there.\n\nMr Modi's popularity has been also attributed to his mastery of branding, transforming routine events into spectacles and astute messaging. A weak opposition and a largely friendly media also helped him build his brand.\n\nThe election results show that Brand Modi has lost some of its shine, indicating that even Mr Modi is susceptible to anti-incumbency. In other words, he is not as invincible as many of his supporters believed. This offers renewed hope to the opposition.\n\nA return to coalition politics\n\nIndia has a history of chaotic coalition governments, although some in the early 1990s and 2000s played a significant role in implementing economic reforms.\n\nIf the BJP forms the government, it will be dependent on allies and will need to adopt a more consultative and deliberative approach.\n\nThis dependency makes it vulnerable to collapse if allies feel neglected. The party, once perceived as all-powerful, is now reliant on allies, unlike in 2014 and 2019.\n\nA jolt to the dominant BJP\n\nMr Modi's uninterrupted decade-long reign at the top has underscored India's embrace of what some political scientists term the one-party dominant system.\n\nThis has five key traits: a charismatic leader, unrivaled control over resources and communication, unmatched organisational machinery, and an opposition in disarray. Shrinking freedoms also characterise a one-party dominant system.\n\nMr Modi's BJP is not the first party to dominate Indian politics. For many years after Independence the Congress ruled without a break. Tuesday's result has restored India to what many consider \"normal politics\", with a range of parties sharing and competing for power.\n\nA resurgent opposition\n\nThe results will energise the much-criticised Congress-led opposition.\n\nIn February, the diverse coalition known as INDIA, short for Indian National Developmental Inclusive Alliance, faced turmoil when one of its key leaders, Nitish Kumar, exited - only to later rejoin the BJP.\n\nBut led by Rahul Gandhi, the opposition ran a spirited campaign and narrowed the gap, in the face of a partisan media and despite fewer resources.\n\nThere is more hope for them ahead. The BJP holds about a third of India's 4,000- plus state assembly seats and has lost to regional parties before. Over the next 14 months, five states are set for elections - all could be keenly contested.\n\nWith contests in Maharashtra, Jharkhand, and Haryana this year, the BJP could face substantial competition. Delhi's upcoming election may pose challenges, while Bihar in October presents a regional hurdle.\n\nSo what could a potential third term for Mr Modi mean?\n\nIndia needs much more work and some healing.\n\nThe economy, fueled by government spending, is on the upswing. Yet inequality is rising. Private investment and consumption must increase, and the poor and the middle class will need more money in their pockets to spend more.\n\nThat will not happen if there are not enough jobs. In a country bristling with ambition and frustration, younger voters are likely drift from the BJP - around two-fifths of India's billion-plus people are under 25.\n\nMr Modi has drawn criticism for marginalising Muslims, India's largest minority, who have borne the brunt of violence. His government faces accusations of stifling dissent, with leading opposition figures jailed on what they say are trumped-up charges.\n\nBut third terms have often proved to be rocky for many leaders, with unforeseen and unpredictable events blowing governments and their plans off course.", "source": {"uri": "yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

Modi is taking the country to a different level in the world.\"\n\nThe BJP has dismissed opposition speculation that Modi, 73, might hang up his boots once he reaches 75, like some other party leaders have done in recent years. Modi has said he wants to lay the groundwork for India to become a fully developed nation by 2047, the 100th year of independence from British colonial rule.\n\n\"Modi will now probably enter in what I call the legacy phase of his prime ministership, driving India forward politically, economically, diplomatically and even militarily,\" said Bilveer Singh, deputy head, department of political science, at the National University of Singapore.\n\nThe idea would be to make the country a \"strong regional power that is also a counterbalance to China, but not to serve Western interest as is sometimes alleged, but mainly to promote India's interest, power and place in international politics\".\n\nA reduced mandate for Modi's ruling alliance forecloses the possibility of changes to India's secular constitution that opposition groups had warned against. Any such measures require the support of two-thirds of members of parliament.\n\nConcerns have grown in recent years that the BJP's Hindu nationalist agenda has polarised the country with Modi himself turning up the rhetoric, accusing the main opposition Congress of appeasing Muslims for votes.\n\nYashwant Deshmukh, founder of CVoter polling agency and a political analyst, said the BJP's top goal of introducing common civil laws to replace Islam's sharia-based customs and other religious codes would have to go on the back burner.\n\n\"These will have to be debated,\" he said.\n\n(Reporting by Shivangi Acharya, Rupam Jain and Krishna N.

Assuming the BJP has less than a majority [on its own]this obviously leads to a lot of speculation about room for maneuver [Modi] must lead the government.\n\nExit polls released over the weekend after voting concluded suggested Modi would comfortably win the election, projecting the ruling alliance to win between 353 and 401 seats. During the campaign, Modi and the BJP predicted that the NDA would win as many as 400 seats.\n\nIf the numbers don't change, it's a return to the alliance politics that characterized India from 1989 to 2014, said Pratap Bhanu Mehta, a senior fellow at the Center for Policy Research in New Delhi. In this sense, a much more negotiated government will be required.\n\nMehta added: I'm not sure businesses will like it.\n\nInfrastructure, a crucial policy initiative of the BJP, led the sell-off, with shares of Adani Ports, Adani Enterprises and Oil and Natural Gas Corporation falling 25 per cent, 25 per cent and 21.5 per cent respectively.\n\nMany Indians expected a clear victory for Modi in an election seen as a referendum on his decade in power and at the end of a campaign largely focused on the personality of the 73-year-old prime minister. A victory would make him the first Indian prime minister to serve three consecutive terms since independence leader Jawaharlal Nehru.\n\nGovernment officials had announced an ambitious program of economic reforms for a third term. India has been one of the world's fastest growing economies since the end of the Covid-19 pandemic, and the Prime Minister had expressed his aim of becoming the world's third largest economy, from the current fifth, during of his third term in office and a developed economy by 2047, the centenary of independence.\n\nBut job creation has failed to keep pace with new entrants to the labor market, and Tuesday's early voting trends showed that the BJP is on track to fall short of a parliamentary majority on its own. 272 votes he received during Modi's first two terms.\n\nThe party is also expected to lose some seats in its political stronghold in the Hindi-speaking north, notably in the most populous state of Uttar Pradesh.\n\nIn 10 years, we have become accustomed to a stable government, Swapan Dasgupta, a right-wing commentator, told Indian channel CNN-News18. The current trend in voting results, he said, augurs instability in the country. [NDA] exemption.\n\nFinal results are expected Tuesday evening or Wednesday morning. The results are the culmination of a six-week staggered voting process that began in April.\n\nIn India, voting is taking place in stages due to logistical and security challenges in a country of more than 1.4 billion people. The Election Commission of India said 642 million voters out of nearly a billion registered voters had cast their ballots.\n\nThe result will strengthen the Congress, which was widely seen as a political force in decline after losing seats in India's previous two polls.\n\nBefore the vote, some opposition figures had questioned the integrity of India's electronic voting machines and accused the Modi government of pre-poll repression, after some Congress bank accounts were frozen and two senior figures in the opposition have been imprisoned as part of corruption investigations.\n\nHowever, some commentators saw Tuesday's result as proof that Indian voters were still free to exercise their will.\n\nIndian democracy is not in danger, and I don't think the institutions have been captured as the opposition claimed, said Sugata Srinivasaraju, author and journalist. It will likely be a weakened Modi moving towards a coalition, but we don't have the final results yet.", "source": {"uri": "exbulletin.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "ExBulletin"}, "authors": [],

Modi is taking the country to a different level in the world.\"\n\nThe BJP has dismissed opposition speculation that Modi, 73, might hang up his boots once he reaches 75, like some other party leaders have done in recent years. Modi has said he wants to lay the groundwork for India to become a fully developed nation by 2047, the 100th year of independence from British colonial rule.\n\n\"Modi will now probably enter in what I call the legacy phase of his prime ministership, driving India forward politically, economically, diplomatically and even militarily,\" said Bilveer Singh, deputy head, department of political science, at the National University of Singapore.\n\nThe idea would be to make the country a \"strong regional power that is also a counterbalance to China, but not to serve Western interest as is sometimes alleged, but mainly to promote India's interest, power and place in international politics\".\n\nA reduced mandate for Modi's ruling alliance forecloses the possibility of changes to India's secular constitution that opposition groups had warned against. Any such measures require the support of two-thirds of members of parliament.\n\nConcerns have grown in recent years that the BJP's Hindu nationalist agenda has polarised the country with Modi himself turning up the rhetoric, accusing the main opposition Congress of appeasing Muslims for votes.\n\nYashwant Deshmukh, founder of CVoter polling agency and a political analyst, said the BJP's top goal of introducing common civil laws to replace Islam's sharia-based customs and other religious codes would have to go on the back burner.\n\n\"These will have to be debated,\" he said.\n\n(Reporting by Shivangi Acharya, Rupam Jain and Krishna N.

It later got relief from the Supreme Court.\n\nMarch 14: Data revealed by the poll watchdog showed that business houses Vedanta, Airtel and Essel were among the top funders of political parties through a mechanism that allowed individuals and companies to anonymously donate money to political parties until it was scrapped by the top court.\n\nModi's BJP had garnered most of the money through this route since 2018, when it was introduced, bringing focus to the vast difference in its war chest compared to its opponents.\n\nMarch 16: The poll watchdog, the Election Commission of India, announced the world's largest election with nearly a billion registered voters would kick off on April 19.\n\nPeople would vote in seven phases over a six-week period.\n\nModi said he was confident of a victory, a claim backed by poll predictions. His party leaders said the ruling alliance would win 400 of the 543 seats in parliament's lower house.\n\nMarch 22: Less than a week after the election was announced, India's financial crime fighting agency, the Enforcement Directorate, arrested the chief minister of the capital Delhi, Arvind Kejriwal, one of the key faces of the united opposition.\n\nThis was the latest in a wave of detentions, raids and questioning of opposition politicians by India's investigative agencies.\n\nApril 19: Voting begins, with jobs, inflation, India's rising global profile and Hindu pride as key issues.\n\nApril 21: A lower voter turnout than at the previous election in 2019 worried the BJP, and Modi changed tack in his campaign speeches.\n\nFrom largely focusing on his government's performance on economic development and welfare schemes earlier, Modi accused Congress of planning to redistribute wealth from majority Hindus to minority Muslims.\n\nApril 25: As the campaign turned more acrimonious, the Congress and the BJP complained to the Election Commission about divisive speeches by each other's leaders. The watchdog sought responses from both sides.\n\nAfter a long delay, which the opposition said allowed Modi to further violate the poll code, it asked both sides to show restraint.\n\nMay 10: Halfway through the election, Kejriwal was given bail and allowed to campaign, boosting the opposition.\n\nIn one of his first speeches, Kejriwal raised doubts whether 73-year-old Modi would continue to be the prime minister after turning 75, an age limit the BJP has spoken about in the past.\n\nTop BJP leaders said the party has no such age limit rule, though.\n\nTo counter voter fatigue and resistance from a resurgent opposition, BJP's ideological parent, the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh stepped in to help Modi's campaign.\n\nJune 1: Voting ended, with Modi's constituency, Varanasi among the 57 in the last phase.\n\nExit polls, prohibited while voting was on, predicted the BJP would record a thumping win, possibly surpassing its 2019 tally of 303 seats.\n\nJune 4: Counting and result.\n\n(Reporting by Krishn Kaushik; Editing by Raju Gopalakrishnan)", "source": {"uri": "usnews.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "U.S. News & World Report"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

That is where his satisfaction will end.\n\nThe early results also showed Modi's Bharatiya Janata party set to lose its majority for the first time since 2014 -- a stunning blow to the authority of India's strongest leader in decades and one that would leave him dependent on junior partners in his National Democratic Alliance to govern.\n\nOn Tuesday night, the NDA was ahead in 291 of 543 seats in India's lower house of parliament, far below the more than 350 it held before the vote and the 400 that Modi had set as its target. A motley coalition of anti-BJP opposition parties, known by its acronym INDIA, was on track to nearly double its tally to 234.\n\nConfirmation of the shock result would leave Modi in a weakened position from which to tackle the enormous economic challenges facing India and to undertake the difficult reforms needed to help the world's most populous country secure its status as a rising global power.\n\nModi had lost his \"aura of invincibility\", said Ronojoy Sen, a political scientist at the National University of Singapore.\n\n\"The knives won't be out but\u2009.\u2009.\u2009.\u2009Modi's standing within and outside the party [could] take a beating,\" he said, adding that the BJP's coalition partners would \"take their pound of flesh\".\n\nBefore the results, Modi's government had exuded confidence. At his final campaign rally last week, the prime minister crowed prematurely about scoring a \"hat trick\" of absolute majorities in three successive elections. Exit polls published at the weekend also predicted a resounding victory.\n\nModi brushed off concerns about the result on Tuesday night. \"Our opponents together have not won as many seats as the BJP alone has won,\" he told a crowd of supporters, referring to the roughly 240 seats where the ruling party was in the lead in partial counts. \"The country will write a new chapter with many big decisions in the third term.\"\n\nInternational banks and investors, who have placed bets on India as a pivotal \"China plus one\" economy and growing consumer market, will be keenly watching how durable a coalition government Modi can build.\n\nModi has sold himself to both the Indian public and overseas investors as a strong, decisive leader capable of enacting tough reform and maintaining stable government. But analysts warned that reliance on its NDA partners, which include several smaller regional parties, could force the BJP into concessions such as offering them ministerial posts and dropping politically unpopular reforms.\n\nThe early results triggered a sharp sell-off in Indian equities on Tuesday, with the benchmark Nifty 50 stock index falling 6 per cent.\n\nEmkay Global, a brokerage, warned in a client note that key parts of the BJP's reform agenda, including privatisation and the kinds of labour and land market reforms demanded by foreign manufacturers, would be \"off the table\" if the loss of its majority was confirmed.\n\nShumita Deveshwar, an economist at GlobalData. TSLombard, warned that coalition politics could force the BJP -- which has touted its responsible fiscal policies to foreign investors -- into \"competitive populism\".\n\n\"Any whiff of political volatility makes the markets nervous,\" she said. \"The markets see that if the BJP doesn't have a majority then passing reforms through parliament will be harder\".\n\nBoth the BJP and the INDIA alliance may now seek to shift the balance of power by inducing rival members of parliament to defect to their sides.\n\n\"It will be back to pre-2014\u2009.\u2009.\u2009.\u2009There will be the compulsions of coalition politics,\" said Seshadri Chari, a pro-BJP commentator. But he added that the prime minister knew the \"art of management\"\n\n\"Politics is all about management. I don't see any difficulty as far as Modi is concerned in handling the situation,\" Chari said.\n\nModi went into the election, which ran from April to June 1, enjoying high popularity thanks to his potent blend of Hindu nationalist politics, economic reforms supportive of big business, and development spending.\n\nHis government has spoken of building a $10tn economy by the mid-2030s, more than twice its current size, and vowed to lift the country to developed-economy status by 2047.\n\nBut analysts said Modi appeared to have miscalculated the depth of anti-incumbency feeling and economic dissatisfaction. The BJP seemed to struggle on the campaign trail as the opposition seized on India's widening inequality.\n\nModi, who has been unable to effectively address widespread joblessness despite rapid economic growth, responded by doubling down on polarising religious rhetoric about India's Muslim minority. But the margin of the prime minister's victory even in his own constituency of Varanasi was on Tuesday on track to fall from past elections.\n\nThe Indian National Congress, the BJP's main rival, ran on a platform of boosting welfare spending and creating more government jobs.\n\n\"I am happy with the verdict,\" said Sumit Kumar, a 22-year-old jobseeker in Delhi. \"I did not vote for Modi because he could not give jobs to the youth.\"\n\nBut some foreign investors were optimistic about Modi's prospects. \"I do not expect Modi to change his policies,\" said Alessia Berardi, head of emerging macro strategy at the research arm of European asset manager Amundi. \"Even continuing with what we had so far, I think that is good for investors, and for business.\"", "source": {"uri": "ft.com",

This followed a dip of more than 3% when markets opened.\n\nARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW ARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW\n\nThe country's stock markets have boomed under Modi, whose pro-market policies have made him popular among India's corporations and businesspeople.\n\nWORKERS TAKE HEAT PRECAUTIONS AS VOTES ARE COUNTED IN TEMPERATURES EXPECTED TOO REACH 106F\n\nTemperatures in the Indian capital were down Tuesday from highs in the past week of 45 degrees Celsius (113 degrees Fahrenheit), but election officials and political parties were nonetheless taking precautions as votes were being counted.\n\nWorkers carried cases of water into one air-conditioned counting station in New Delhi early in the morning in preparation, while tents outside for security personnel and others were outfitted with industrial evaporative coolers.\n\nTemperatures in the morning hovered around 37 C (99 F) in New Delhi and were expected to rise to 41 C (106 F) by the end of the day.\n\nARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW ARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW\n\nAt the headquarters of the opposition Congress party, a tent was set up outside, equipped with evaporative coolers, for waiting media.\n\nWOMEN ARE A KEY VOTING BLOC IN INDIA'S 2024 ELECTION\n\nIndian women are a key voting bloc with more of them voting in recent elections than ever before. Most poll experts expect women voters to play a decisive role in determining the 2024 election results.\n\nPolitical parties have been wooing them with monthly cash handouts, subsidized cooking gas cylinders and low-interest loans. Many such programs have particularly helped Modi's Bharatiya Janata party widen its support among them, especially in rural areas. The opposition alliance also tried to gain women's votes by unveiling programs that promised financial aid of $1,200 per year to poor women, and promised to reserve 50% of government jobs for women if voted into power.\n\nWomen make up nearly 49% of India's total electorate. Turnout has grown in each recent major election -- of women who were eligible to vote, 53% voted in 2004; 56% in 2009; 65.5% in 2014; and 67% in 2019.

staggered over the last six weeks.\n\nThat brought the final phase into India's hottest season, with temperatures higher than 45 degrees Celsius (113 Fahrenheit) in some parts of the country, and Kumar said the election officials learned a valuable lesson.\n\n\"We should have completed the election at least one month before,\" he said ahead of the start of the counting. \"We shouldn't have let

There are clear expectations regarding India's growth in terms of economy which has helped.\n\nIf Modi wins a third term, he will equal the record of three terms as prime minister of Jawaharlal Nehru, the country's leader from 1947 to 1964.\n\nThe rising cost of living and unemployment have emerged as key issues in the election, but the discontent does not appear to have damaged Modi's image.\n\nWith the opposition waging its strongest campaign since 2014, independent media on YouTube gaining popularity, and unemployment continuing to be a significant concern for voters, the opposition might rightly have expected good results, said Pratik Dattani, founder of the London-based think tank Bridge. India.\n\nBut it appears that dissatisfaction with the government has not translated into the anger that might be needed to get voters to change their vote.\n\nThis was a referendum on Modi. So voters may have penalized the absence of an opposition prime ministerial candidate, seeing Modi as the best choice for prime minister, Dattani said.\n\nAfter 10 years of BJP rule, the party was bound to suffer from anti-incumbency bias. Even though such sentiments were pervasive among parliamentarians, the BJP probably triumphed by relying on Modi, says Deshmukh.\n\nPeople are extremely disappointed with the sitting MLAs, even the BJP MLAs, but for Modi's sake, they have rejected them, he said.\n\nExit polls indicated that the BJP made significant inroads into southern India as well as eastern India, expanding its influence from its traditional Hindi-speaking regions in the north, central and western India.\n\nIf the exit poll predictions prove correct, it will mean the emergence of the BJP as a national party, no longer confined to the Hindi heartland, said Nilanjan Mukhopadhyay, an independent political commentator.\n\nThis could also mean great support for the idea of Hindutva (Hindu nation) across the country.\n\nThe BJP is expected to win not only in the state of Karnataka, where it is strongest in the southern region, but also in Telangana and Andhra Pradesh, according to exit polls.\n\nDeshmukh said the BJP's vote share is also expected to increase in the states of Kerala and Tamil Nadu, which had earlier proved virtually invincible for the party.\n\nIn the eastern state of West Bengal, the BJP appears neck and neck with the influential regional Trinamool Congress party, Deshmukh said.\n\nModis' legacy\n\nThis may be the last term for Modi, 73, who was once a pariah in the Western world due to religious riots during his time as Gujarat chief minister in 2002 that led to the death of 1,000 to 2,000 people. people, mainly Muslims.\n\nBut thanks to India's economic growth, the country is increasingly seen internationally as a geopolitical counterweight to China.\n\nOpposition members have warned that another Modi term could seriously damage India's secular and democratic traditions, arguing that the BJP's Hindu nationalist agenda has polarized the country.\n\nAnother term for Modi will take India further away from democracy. Modi is fighting against the principles on which India was founded in 1947, said Kingshuk Nag, an independent author and political commentator, adding that Modi's grip on power will only grow if he is re-elected.\n\nObservers expect big business to benefit from a BJP victory, although they say industrial development will favor states like Gujarat and Maharashtra, where the ruling party is more popular, compared to others like West Bengal.\n\nStock analysts are also optimistic about India's growth prospects in the event of a return of the Modis government, expecting reforms to develop infrastructure and boost growth in the manufacturing sector.\n\nThis government has finally understood that the manufacturing sector must increase as a percentage of GDP. They have seen it in the way China has behaved over the last 30 to 40 years, said Shekhar Sambhashivan, director of Indian equity investments at investment management firm Invesco.\n\nAlthough the government says it wants this figure to be closer to around a quarter, even if we assume on a conservative basis they would end up at 20 percent of GDP, he said.\n\nThe BJP has said it wants India to become a fully developed nation by 2047, its 100th anniversary of independence from British colonial rule. It also has the ambitious goal of increasing the size of the world's fifth-largest economy eight-fold, to $29 trillion by then, and increasing per capita income seven-fold, to nearly $18,000.\n\nThis vision seems to have appealed to part of the middle class and the poor of India.\n\nIf Modi succeeds in securing a third term, then he will establish a legacy that is difficult to match, says Mukhopadhyay.\n\nThis would be unprecedented. Nehru benefited from the legacy of the national movement against British rule to help him get elected. In comparison, Modi weathered the opposition without any such legacy.", "source": {"uri": "exbulletin.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "ExBulletin"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

As it progressed over seven phases until 1 June, a deadly heatwave gripped the country, with temperatures almost touching 50C in areas, leading to deaths of dozens of voters and polling officials.\n\nCounting begins at 8am on Tuesday, and results are expected the same day. Vote counting is done simultaneously at counting stations in each of the 543 constituencies around the country.\n\nAccording to a flurry of exit polls released on Saturday night, Modi and his Bharatiya Janata party (BJP) are looking at a decisive win and may even gain seats to win a two-thirds majority in parliament, which would allow the government to make far-reaching amendments to the constitution.\n\nIt would be a historic achievement for Modi, India's strongman prime minister, whose Hindu nationalist politics have significantly re-shaped India's secular democracy over the past decade. No prime minister since Jawaharlal Nehru, India's first post-independence premier, has won three consecutive terms.\n\nAs the election unfolded, allegations of irregularities by the BJP began emerge. Opponents alleged the BJP was undermining India's democratic processes through the harassment and intimidation of opposition candidates and parties and suppression of Muslim voters who are not the BJP's usual vote bank. BJP leaders, including the prime minister himself, were accused of openly violating election rules as they resorted to polarising anti-Muslim rhetoric on the campaign trail.\n\nOpposition parties also accused the BJP of using state machinery to go after them, including the arrest of senior opposition figures and the freezing of the funds of the Congress party by the tax authorities.\n\nUS thinktank Freedom House said this year the BJP had \"increasingly used government institutions to target political opponents\".\n\nOn Sunday, Arwind Kejriwal, one of the most prominent opposition leaders and the chief minister of Delhi, was returned to jail after briefly being released on a temporary bail in order to campaign in the elections. Kejriwal has alleged the corruption case against him is \"politically motivated\" by the Modi government in order to undermine his party, a charge the BJP denies.\n\nRahul Gandhi, the most prominent member of the opposition's once-formidable Congress party and scion of a dynasty that dominated Indian politics for decades, was convicted of criminal libel last year after a complaint by a member of Modi's party.\n\nHis two-year prison sentence saw him disqualified from parliament until the verdict was suspended by a higher court and raised concerns over democratic norms.\n\nHemant Soren, the former chief minister of the eastern state of Jharkhand, was also arrested in February in a separate corruption probe.\n\nKejriwal, Rahul Gandhi and Soren are all members of an opposition alliance composed of more than two dozen parties, but the bloc has struggled to make inroads against Modi. According to predictions, the alliance, which includes the Congress party, will get just only 125 to 165 seats out of 543.\n\nModi was widely seen as a frontrunner even before elections began. Over his ten years as prime minister, the cult of personality around him has grown while his power has become deeply entrenched. Several exit polls suggested that the BJP's dominance would increase further this time, with gains in southern states such as Tamil Nadu and eastern states such as West Bengal, where the party had previously struggled to gain strong support due to regional opposition.\n\n\"On one very basic level, the election didn't matter,\" said Neelanjan Sircar, a senior fellow at the Centre for Policy Research in Delhi. \"The dominant view was always that Modi and the BJP are coming back, irrespective of the numbers. The bigger question mark is: what genuine democratic legitimacy will be derived from this election?\"\n\nIndia's opposition sought to dismiss the exit poll projections, which they described as \"bogus\" and \"fraudulent\" and alleged they were deliberate attempts to justify rigging of the elections.\n\nThe mainstream media is seen to have been brought under the thumb of the BJP government and predominately pro-Modi narratives were broadcast during the campaign, including dozens of fawning interviews with the prime minister where he proclaimed several times to have been chosen by God.\n\nYet analysts warned that that the one-sided media narrative and election being seen as fait accompli before campaigning even began had led to a growing mistrust in the electoral system among the public. During the campaign, the election commission - the body tasked with regulating polls - was among those widely accused of being \"spineless\" and no longer a neutral observer after it ignored repeated calls to hold Modi and the BJP account for repeated alleged violations of election rules.\n\nOne of the most prominent figures vocalising these frustrations over the campaign was Dhruv Rathee, an Indian YouTuber whose videos criticising the Modi government and alleging an erosion of India's democratic processes have earned him 21 million subscribers, far outreaching Modi's social media presence.\n\nRathee has been releasing political commentary videos since 2017 but over the course of the election he rose to become a household name as one of the few who dared to voice dissent.\n\n\"This is the least fair election in India's history,\" said Rathee from Germany, where he now lives. \"Opposition leaders have been put in jail, anyone who stands up to the BJP is harassed by the state or by police and the BJP has been given free rein to violate all the election rules and stir up hatred. There's nothing fair about it.\"\n\nAs campaigning came to a close, Modi - who had appeared at over 200 rallies over the course of campaigning - took himself on a 45-hour meditation retreat at a spiritual site in Tamil Nadu. Though it was said to be in isolation, hundreds of tv cameras were present and it was broadcast live across 24 hour news channels.\n\n\"Sources\" told right wing media that the prime minister would be surviving on a liquid-only diet of coconut water and grape juice.", "source": {"uri": "theguardian.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Guardian"}, "authors": [{"uri":

World's largest nation begins a mammoth day of vote counting after weeks-long election", "body": "(CNN) -- Hundreds of millions of votes cast, more than six weeks of polling, and billions of dollars spent: India on Tuesday will declare a new leader after a mammoth nationwide election that has become a referendum on the last decade of leadership by Prime Minister Narendra Modi.\n\nHis powerful right-wing Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) is seeking a supermajority in the lower house of parliament - or Lok Sabha - a goal which, if successful, would give it an unstoppable mandate to further enshrine its Hindu-nationalist agenda, deepening India's move away from its secular foundations.\n\nGiven India's strategic position in Asia and its booming economy, the election result will reverberate far beyond its borders, capturing the attention of the United States, China and Russia in particular.\n\nSome 642 million people cast their vote in the world's largest election, as swathes of the country was blanketed in searing heat, making people sick and killing dozens.\n\nHoping to unseat India's charismatic but divisive leader is an alliance of more than two dozen parties, including the country's main opposition, the Indian National Congress, which is running on a platform of reducing inequality and upholding democratic institutions which it argues are at risk.\n\nSince assuming power in 2014, Modi has attained levels of popularity not seen in decades, owing to a raft of development and welfare programs, mixed with a strident brand of Hindu nationalism in a country where about 80% of the population are followers of the polytheistic faith.\n\nUnder Modi's leadership, the country of 1.4 billion people has become the world's fastest-growing major economy and a modern global power, making strides in technology and space. Yet, despite these successes, poverty and youth unemployment persist - particularly in rural areas - and the wealth gap has widened.\n\nCritics also say a decade of Modi's governance has led to growing religious polarization, with Islamophobia marginalizing much of the country's more than 200 million Muslims, and religious violence flaring up in a nation with a long history of communal tensions.\n\nPolling began on April 19 and ended on June 1. Nearly 1 billion Indians were eligible to vote for 543 seats in the lower house of parliament. The leader of the party that wins a majority will become prime minister and form a ruling government.\n\nModi has set an ambitious target of securing a 400-seat supermajority, with 370 directly controlled by his BJP - up from 303 in 2019 - and the others from its National Democratic Alliance.\n\nHis BJP centered its manifesto on job creation and anti-poverty programs, with a focus on women, the poor and farmers. He's promised to turn India into a developed nation by 2047 and transform the country into a global manufacturing hub.\n\nYet, on the campaign trail, he has been accused of deploying openly divisive rhetoric that has been condemned as Islamophobic, while casting himself as an instrument chosen by God.\n\nModi sparked a row over hate speech when he accused Muslims - who have been part of India for centuries - of being \"infiltrators,\" and echoing a false conspiracy voiced by some Hindu nationalists that Muslims are displacing the country's Hindu population by deliberately having large families. His BJP released several political videos targeting Muslims, one of which is under investigation by police.\n\nCongress has governed India for much of its independent history, having been instrumental in ending nearly 200 years of British colonial rule. But over the last decade, it has struggled to find relevance - partly due to a series of corruption scandals and infighting - unable to break through Modi's popularity.\n\nRahul Gandhi, the son of the famed Gandhi dynasty, is the face of the party but lost the past two elections to Modi. He is contending once again from the southern state of Kerala and the crucial state of Uttar Pradesh in the north, also India's most populous.\n\nOpposition leaders and parties have faced a slew of legal and financial challenges in the run-up to this year's election, with many accusing the BJP of using state agencies to stifle opponents.\n\nThe arrest in March of the popular Aam Aadmi Party leader, chief minister of Delhi and staunch Modi critic Arvind Kejriwal sparked protests in the capital and prompted claims of a political \"conspiracy\" by his party - claims the BJP has denied.\n\nKejriwal's release on interim bail last month galvanized the opposition to put up a tough fight against the BJP, uniting a group of political leaders who were once divided over ideological differences.\n\nThe Congress' manifesto has also been dubbed one of India's most progressive, pledging \"freedom from fear\" and vowing to protect freedom of speech, expression and religious belief espoused in the constitution.\n\nTurnout across all seven phases has slightly dipped from the record highs of 2019, yet India's general election remains the largest exercise in democracy, with hundreds of millions showing up to determine who will lead the world's most populous country.\n\nThe-CNN-Wire\n\n\u2122 & \u00a9 2024 Cable News Network, Inc., a Warner Bros.

According to Morning Consult, Modi is by far the world's most popular leader, with an approval rating of 74%.\n\nHis Hindu nationalist Bharatiya Janata Party and allied parties appeared to have secured almost 300 of 543 seats in Parliament, according to early results, giving them a simple majority. But the opposition was doing better than expected in an election that exit polls had suggested Modi's alliance would win by a landslide.\n\nBut critics say Modi has also eroded human rights in India, the world's largest democracy, and stoked religious tensions, particularly against India's Muslim minority, with Modi and other BJP candidates accused of hate speech and other inflammatory rhetoric during the campaign. India is also struggling to provide enough jobs for its 1.4 billion people, despite being the world's fastest-growing major economy.\n\nModi's ethos of a Hindu-first nation is now deeply entrenched in Indian politics, raising fears among Muslims and other minority groups over how they will fare during five more years of Modi rule.\n\nIn Modi's home seat of Varanasi, which voted Saturday in the last of seven phases of voting, Tasneem Fatma walked out of a polling station wearing a burqa, saying, \"We want a united India, not for Hindu, Muslim, Sikh, Isai.\"\n\nBut Fatma, 20, a business student, was interrupted by an older man who said there was no religious divide. He also dismissed Fatma's concerns about unemployment, saying, \"If you are educated and if you are capable of the job, you can take the job.\"\n\nAs the discussion grew more heated, police officers asked the man to leave before NBC News could ask for his name.\n\nIndia's election is considered the world's largest, with nearly a billion registered voters and polling that spanned over six weeks. But it was not just the sheer size of the election that posed a challenge for officials.\n\nVoting has taken place amid unusually high temperatures that have exceeded 120 degrees in New Delhi, the capital, and experts say that may have depressed turnout. At least 33 people in three states died of suspected heatstroke just on Friday, Reuters reported, including election officials who were on duty.\n\nAlthough Indian summers are generally hot, scientists say heat waves in India and elsewhere in South Asia are becoming hotter, longer and more frequent at least partly as a result of climate change. Neither the BJP nor the opposition has said much about climate change during the campaign.\n\nThe issue foremost in the minds of voters who spoke with NBC News was jobs. It's an especially big worry for those ages 15 to 29, who make up 83% of unemployed people in India, according to a report in March.\n\n\"Why is nobody talking about rising costs or lack of jobs or poor kids dying or trees being cut?\" Fatma asked.\n\nIndia's opposition parties, led by the Indian National Congress, have tried to use such issues to drive voters away from Modi. Aware of the gargantuan effort it would take to defeat him, the fractured opposition formed an alliance that quickly faltered.\n\nOpposition parties have also accused Modi's government of trying to stifle their campaigns by arresting their leaders and freezing their funds, allegations the BJP denies. Arvind Kejriwal, a vocal Modi opponent who is the chief minister of New Delhi, was arrested in March in connection with corruption allegations, and he returned to jail Sunday after he was granted interim bail in order to campaign. He denies the charges.\n\nToday's India is run by \"a very strong, dominant BJP, which in 1984 had only got four seats in Parliament,\" said Yamini Aiyar, former chief executive of the Center for Policy Research, a highly regarded think tank in New Delhi that has been targeted by a Modi government crackdown on civil society.\n\nIn recent years especially, she said, the BJP has become \"creepingly authoritarian.\"\n\n\"Our democracy is at stake,\" Aiyar said.\n\nAccording to Freedom House, a nonprofit pro-democracy organization in Washington, elections in India are generally considered free and fair, but they are being held in an environment in which freedom of expression is shrinking. It cited the arrests and prosecutions of journalists, information manipulation using artificial intelligence and other technologies, and Indian authorities' demands that social media companies remove online content critical of the government, among other issues.\n\nModi's shaky rights record can make things awkward for Washington, which views India as an important counterweight to China. Though India is not a formal U.S. ally, it is an important defense partner and a member of strategic security groupings such as the Quad, which also includes the U.S., Australia and Japan.\n\nModi, who rarely takes live questions from journalists, pushed back against criticism at a joint news conference with President Joe Biden during a state visit to Washington last year.\n\n\"In India's democratic values, there's absolutely no discrimination, neither on basis of caste, creed or age or any kind of geographic location,\" he said.\n\nU.S. authorities also say Indian agents may have been involved in the attempted assassination last year of a Sikh activist living in New York. India denies the allegations, saying such a crime would be \"contrary to government policy.\"\n\nExperts say the U.S. relationship with Modi will continue to strengthen, regardless of who wins the U.S. presidential election in November.\n\n\"China remains the elephant in the room or the presence that is shaping the alignments and realignments across the world,\" Aiyar said.", "source": {"uri":

It later got relief from the Supreme Court.\n\nMarch 14: Data revealed by the poll watchdog showed that business houses Vedanta, Airtel and Essel were among the top funders of political parties through a mechanism that allowed individuals and companies to anonymously donate money to political parties until it was scrapped by the top court.\n\nModi's BJP has garnered most of the money through this route since 2018, when it was introduced, bringing focus to the vast difference in its war chest compared to its opponents.\n\nMarch 16: The poll watchdog, the Election Commission of India, announced the world's largest election with nearly a billion registered voters would kick off on April 19.\n\nPeople would vote in seven phases over six weeks.\n\nModi said he was confident of a victory, a claim backed by poll predictions. His party leaders said the ruling alliance would win 400 of the 543 seats in parliament's lower house.\n\nMarch 22: Less than a week after the election was announced, India's financial crime-fighting agency, the Enforcement Directorate, arrested the chief minister of the capital Delhi, Arvind Kejriwal, one of the key faces of the united opposition.\n\nThis was the latest in a wave of detentions, raids and questioning of opposition politicians by India's investigative agencies.\n\nApril 21: A lower voter turnout than at the previous election in 2019 worried the BJP, and Modi changed tack in his campaign speeches.\n\nFrom largely focusing on his government's performance on economic development and welfare schemes earlier, Modi accused Congress of planning to redistribute wealth from majority Hindus to minority Muslims.\n\nApril 25: As the campaign turned more acrimonious, the Congress and the BJP complained to the Election Commission about divisive speeches by each other's leaders. The watchdog sought responses from both sides.\n\nAfter a long delay, which the opposition said allowed Modi to further violate the poll code, it asked both sides to show restraint.\n\nMay 10: Halfway through the election, Kejriwal was given bail and allowed to campaign, boosting the opposition.\n\nIn one of his first speeches, Kejriwal raised doubts about whether 73-year-old Modi would continue to be the prime minister after turning 75, an age limit the BJP has spoken about in the past.\n\nTop BJP leaders said the party has no such age limit rule, though.\n\nTo counter voter fatigue and resistance from a resurgent opposition, BJP's ideological parent, the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh stepped in to help Modi's campaign.\n\nExit polls, prohibited while voting was on, predicted the BJP would record a thumping win, possibly surpassing its 2019 tally of 303 seats.", "source": {"uri": "dawn.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Dawn"}, "authors": [{"uri": "reuters@dawn.com", "name":

In some versions, he emerged from the lake clutching a baby crocodile.\n\nThe tea stall at the train station, where he worked as a boy helping his father, remains on the platform, drawing visitors curious about the leader. An illustrated poster in the lobby of a campus built around his former school -- where teenagers are brought to be inspired as part of a leadership program -- sums up his life in seven stages of transformation from \"youth\" to a \"global leader.\"\n\nThe burnishing of Modi's roots in the town of Vadnagar into something resembling legend reflects the way he has been able to build his legacy while reshaping the economic, political and cultural fabric of India over a decade in power. If Modi wins a third term -- as he is widely expected to do -- when the votes of the nation's general election are counted on Tuesday, he will be poised to overwrite the legacy of India's first leader and further his vision of turning India into an economic power that draws national pride from its Hindu past.\n\nOver India's lengthy national election, Modi has said that he and his Hindu nationalist Bharatiya Janata Party are planning not for the next five years but for at least the next 20. A minister in his cabinet compared his outlook to those of other leaders who have reshaped their nations, such as Deng Xiaoping in China or Lee Kuan Yew in Singapore.\n\n\"These are the people who really thought that 'this is my society, this is my country, I want to take it there,'\" said Ashwini Vaishnaw, minister of railways in the Modi government. \"And you start working -- you start galvanizing everybody in that direction.\"\n\nFor decades, Indians lived in a country that bore the imprint of its first prime minister, Jawaharlal Nehru, an English-speaking Cambridge-educated member of India's elite who forged newly independent India into a pluralistic democracy against extraordinary odds. Reassured by the pledges of independence leaders Mahatma Gandhi and Nehru, millions of Muslims stayed in India in 1947, when Partition created two nations from British-ruled India, rather than leaving for Pakistan, where Islam is the official religion.\n\nModi is from a different mold. One of six children, he grew up in more modest circumstances than Nehru, who was the son of an affluent lawyer. From his childhood, he was drawn to a secretive group that believes that Hindu culture defines Indian identity, a principle it calls on India's Muslims and Christians to accept. The focus of the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh, or RSS, on discipline and obedience, shaped Modi's worldview and ideas about leadership.\n\n\"He believes that a leader has to be a good follower in the first place,\" said Urvish Kantharia, the author of a book on the prime minister, called \"This is Narendra Modi,\" which Modi gave to visitors when he was a chief minister in Gujarat.\n\nBut first, the group offered him a path of escape from the conventional life his family charted for him.\n\nWhen Modi was first seeking to be prime minister in 2014, his election filings stunned India's national political establishment: The politician, widely believed to be single, revealed he was married to a woman named Jashodaben, a retired schoolteacher in Gujarat.\n\nA teenage Modi didn't want to marry, according to people who knew him growing up and a biography. But he succumbed to pressure from his family to follow through on a match they had arranged. His father cried when Modi tried to resist the marriage, said Shamaldas M. Modi, a former classmate and cousin. The prospects of his younger siblings and cousins would be ruined, family members remonstrated with him.\n\nSoon after the wedding, Modi packed a small shoulder bag and left town, his cousin said. Modi has said little about what he did then, except for the fact that he spent time in West Bengal and India's Himalayan region, where gods and humans have long sought wisdom and inner peace, according to Hindu scriptures. Current and former officials say those years, when he retreated from the world, shaped him as a future leader.\n\n\"He is privileged to have spent some years in the pursuit of a different life. He couldn't get it -- that is different -- but he was in some kind of a discovery,\" said Nripendra Misra, Modi's principal secretary in his first term. The two men remain close.\n\nIn the Modi government's second term, the prime minister entrusted Misra with a key Hindu nationalist project -- overseeing the construction of a temple in the city of Ayodhya on a site that many Hindus believe to be the birthplace of the Hindu divinity Ram. A Hindu mob in 1992 tore down a mosque that previously stood there, and many Hindus believe that medieval Mughal troops in the 1500s built the mosque over a temple.\n\nAt the temple's inauguration in January -- which fulfilled a promise integral to the BJP's rise -- Modi was at the center of the religious rites, alongside the chief of the RSS.\n\nThe group, which was founded in 1925 for \"national reconstruction,\" was banned briefly after the 1948 assassination of Mahatma Gandhi by a militant Hindu nationalist influenced by its ideology. Modi, born in 1950, encountered the organization when he was 8 years old, as many children in small towns across India have, and was drawn to its discipline. Youngsters attending the group's gatherings at the time undertook exercise routines and heard exhortations to serve the motherland, at times donning an official uniform of khaki shorts and a cap. The organization's senior leaders live simply and rarely marry, to devote themselves to the nation.\n\nWhen Modi resurfaced from his travels, in his early 20s, he applied to become an RSS activist and the group's state headquarters in the city of Ahmedabad became his home.\n\n\"The RSS gave him a sense of identity,\" said Nilanjan Mukhopadhyay, a journalist who first met Modi three decades ago, and later interviewed him as chief minister several times for a biography. \"It was also a kind of family he was embracing, leaving behind the family he was born in.\"\n\nThe group is deeply intertwined with Modi's party. In 1987, RSS leaders tapped Modi to help build the relatively new BJP into a political force in the state.\n\nModi quickly became known for a relentless work ethic. He created a state media wing for the first time, said Yamal Vyas, now the BJP's spokesman for the state. He trained young men answering the phone in the party's office to greet callers as though they were at a company, \"Namaste, you've reached the BJP.\"\n\nDuring the 1995 state assembly elections, he called each of the party's 182 candidates starting at 5 a.m. each day to ask what he could do to help their campaigns, according to Vyas. The party won a majority and formed a government without coalition partners -- setting a template for Modi's future electoral dominance in national polls.\n\nThe defining political crisis of his career came in 2002 when a fire on a train killed nearly 60 Hindu activists. Years later, courts in Gujarat found a group of Muslim men guilty of conspiring to start the fire. Hindu activists called for a strike. In that volatile atmosphere, mobs attacked Muslim neighborhoods and leaders, leaving at least 1,000 people dead, most of them Muslims.\n\nIn 2012, an investigative team answering to India's Supreme Court said that it found no evidence of wrongdoing by Modi in connection with the riots. Modi has faced calls to express regret or apologize over the 2002 violence, which he hasn't done. For years, he faced a U.S. visa ban over the violence under his watch, but it was dropped once he was elected prime minister. Modi has always denied any wrongdoing.\n\nHis office didn't respond to detailed questions sent by email or grant a request for an interview.\n\nAs trials over the attacks and investigations into his actions made their way to India's top court, Modi instead focused his efforts on fixing the state's huge budget deficit, building roads and improving the power supply. In 2003, he hosted the first edition of Vibrant Gujarat, an investor summit. Mukesh Ambani, the chairman of Reliance Industries, one of India's biggest conglomerates, was at the small inaugural event, where he announced plans to invest billions of dollars in the state.\n\nThose efforts, which helped the state grow by more than 9% a year, on average, and which he promoted as the \"Gujarat model,\" were key to rebuilding Modi's global reputation and helping him become a national leader, according to political experts.\n\nWhen Modi took the stage this April in the city of Agra, home of the Taj Mahal, his appearance injected fresh energy into a crowd that had been wilting in the heat. Some climbed on chairs to take videos. Many raised placards with the slogan: \"I am Modi's family.\"\n\nThey chanted in a call and response: \"One more time: Modi in power!\"\n\nIf Modi wins a third consecutive majority for his party, he would become the first Indian leader since Nehru and his Indian National Congress party to do so, a testament to his personal popularity and ability to consolidate Hindu voters.\n\nBut as he pushes to reinvent what it means to be Indian, the country's Muslims say they feel increasingly disenfranchised, and civil society groups, independent news outlets and political opponents say they have been targeted by government machinery. Several political scholars and think tanks rate India's civil society as less free after a decade of Modi's governance. For his part, Modi has defended his record on upholding democratic principles, including during his U.S. state visit last year, saying at the time that \"Democracy is in our DNA.\"\n\nIn these elections -- in which the party fielded only one Muslim among its hundreds of candidates -- Modi, in one speech, referred to Muslims as \"infiltrators\" and \"people who have more children.\" Political experts say that echoed language he used at times in 2002 in Gujarat.\n\nOfficials close to him say they expect Modi to return his attention to the economy and efforts to make India a manufacturing hub now that big-ticket elements of his platform for Hindu supporters have been completed. But Modi's belief that pride in Hindu identity is the foundation of its economic rise will underpin his development philosophy. Modi has pointed to countries such as Japan as an example of a great power built on civilizational pride.\n\n\"He will very often tell you no country in the world which is run well has been able to do well by turning its back on its own civilizational past,\" said Hardeep Singh Puri, oil minister in the Modi government.\n\nThe prime minister has encouraged Indians to embrace his journey as their own. In Agra, he urged people to work not just with him -- but as if they were him.\n\n\"For me, all of you are Modi,\" he said.", "source": {"uri": "livemint.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "mint"},

National Democratic Alliance (NDA) is going to form the government for the third time, we are grateful to the people,\" Modi told cheering supporters at his party headquarters in New Delhi, referring to the initials of his political alliance. \"This is a victory for the world's largest democracy.\"\n\nPreliminary figures from the election commission indicate Modi's ruling Bharatiya Janata Party falling short of securing the 272 seats needed to win an outright majority in parliament, a stunning upset that leaves them reliant on longstanding coalition partners to form a government.\n\nModi is still set to form a government with the help of his NDA partners - a third consecutive term and a landmark that makes him one of the most successful politicians in post-independence India.\n\nBut the results are nonetheless something of a personal blow to Modi, who had triumphantly vowed to win a 400-seat supermajority in this year's election - and romped to victory the last two contests with a simple majority for the BJP, turning his Hindu nationalist right-wing party into an electoral juggernaut.\n\nIndia's opposition, who had largely been written off in the polls and by many analysts, portrayed the result as a rejection of Modi's divisive style.\n\nRahul Gandhi, the leader of India's National Congress, said early election results showed that the \"country has unanimously and clearly\" stated that it does not want Modi and his party to run the country.\n\n\"We do not appreciate the way they have run this country for the last 10 years so that is a huge message for Mr. Narendra Modi,\" he said outside his party's headquarters in New Delhi.\n\nCongress led an alliance of opposition parties that tried to topple Modi, 73. While they look set to have failed in that task, they have dented his previous aura of electoral invincibility.\n\nPreliminary results also suggest they have chipped away at BJP seats, including in some of the ruling party's traditional strongholds. Congress alone are currently set to double the number of seats they won in 2019.\n\nThe election commission preliminary figures currently have the BJP's alliance winning around 300 seats compared to 230 for the opposition alliances.\n\nElection authorities are still counting votes and final results are expected in the coming hours.\n\nThis is a breaking news story and will be updated.\n\nCNN's Esha Mitra, Manveena Suri, Sania Farooqui, Jerome Taylor and Alex Stambaugh contributed to this report.", "source": {"uri": "cnn.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "CNN"}, "authors": [{"uri": "rhea_mogul@cnn.com", "name": "Rhea Mogul", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Narendra_Modi", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Narendra Modi"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/India", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "India"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Democratic_Alliance", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "National Democratic Alliance"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coalition_government", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Coalition government"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parliament", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Parliament"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bharatiya_Janata_Party", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Bharatiya Janata Party"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parliamentary_group", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Parliamentary group"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democracy", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Democracy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Delhi", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "New Delhi"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "New Delhi"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hindu_nationalism", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Hindu nationalism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Majority", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Majority"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indian_National_Congress", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Indian National Congress"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Right-wing_politics", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Right-wing politics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supermajority", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Supermajority"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Snap_election", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Snap election"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rahul_Gandhi", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Rahul Gandhi"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CNN", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "CNN"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Entertainment/Party_Supplies", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Entertainment/Party Supplies", "wgt": 17}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Children/Parties", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Children/Parties", "wgt": 17}, {"uri": "dmoz/Home/Entertaining/Party_Planning", "label": "dmoz/Home/Entertaining/Party Planning", "wgt": 17}, {"uri": "dmoz/Home/Entertaining/Holidays", "label": "dmoz/Home/Entertaining/Holidays", "wgt": 16}, {"uri": "dmoz/Home/Entertaining/Children", "label": "dmoz/Home/Entertaining/Children", "wgt": 16}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 98}], "image": "https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/gettyimages-2152508702.jpg?c=16x9&q=w_800,c_fill", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9616128", "eventUri": "eng-9616128", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.3411764705882352, "wgt": 135, "relevance": 1}

He has twice before marked the end of voting with meditation.\n\n\"Some may call me crazy, but I am convinced that [God] sent me for a purpose. Once the purpose is achieved, my work will be done,\" he said in an interview last month with local news channel NDTV.\n\n\"[God] does not reveal his cards. He just keeps making me do things,\" he said.\n\nThis is how India has rallied to get more than 642 million eligible voters to cast their ballots, and what you should expect as the results roll in.\n\nMr Modi and his Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) are likely to win a rare third term with a thumping majority, according to exit polls released by Indian media organisations on Saturday night.\n\nMost of the polls project the BJP and their allies, known together as the National Democratic Alliance (NDA) could win a two-thirds majority in the 543-member lower house of parliament, where only 272 is needed for a simple majority.\n\nIf they reach this threshold, it will allow the government to usher in far-reaching amendments to the constitution.\n\nThe polls predict the NDA could win between 353 and 401 seats, hammering the opposition INDIA alliance led by the largest opposition party -- Congress -- who are projected to win between 125 and 182 seats.\n\nThe alliance is a group of more than two dozen political parties that rallied against what they say is Mr Modi's divisive politics and uneven management of India's economic growth.\n\nBut it is important to remember that exit polls have a patchy history in India and often get the outcome wrong.\n\nMallikarjun Kharge, the president of the Congress party, maintained the coalition would secure a majority and form government.\n\nAt a press conference, Mr Kharge said the PM had made the campaign all about himself.\n\n\"In 15 days, he took Congress's name 232 times, he used 'Modi' 758 times,\" he said.\n\n\"He named the INDIA alliance 573 times ... he didn't say anything about unemployment and inflation.\"\n\nThe seven-phase vote began on April 19 and concluded on June 1, held in scorching heat with temperatures rising above 50 degrees Celsius in parts of the country including New Delhi.\n\nDozens of poll workers have died from heat strokes or other health complications related to the sweltering temperatures in recent days.\n\nAt least 33 workers died in a single day in the state of Uttar Pradesh.\n\nIndia's chief election commissioner, Rajeev Kumar, said on June 3 a record-breaking 642 million voters had cast their ballots in the general election -- around a 66 per cent voter turnout.\n\nBut he conceded that the poll should have concluded in April to avoid intense heatwaves, calling it a \"learning experience\".\n\nIndia is used to searing summer temperatures, but years of scientific research have found climate change is worsening heatwaves as they become longer and more frequent.\n\nThe election was a Herculean exercise involving 15 million polling officials and security personnel, 1 million polling stations, more than 8,000 candidates and 744 political parties.\n\nVoting machines were transported to the remotest parts of the country by foot, helicopter, boat and camelback to ensure no voter was left behind.\n\nDespite these efforts, there were allegations of voter suppression and threats against opposition candidates in parts of the country, including Uttar Pradesh and Mr Modi's home state of Gujarat.\n\nOpposition leaders accused the BJP government of using state agencies to threaten and arrest rivals and block access to campaign funding.\n\nOn June 2, one of the most prominent opposition leaders, Chief Minister of Delhi Arvind Kejriwal, was returned to jail after being briefly let out to campaign in the elections.\n\nHe alleges the corruption case against him is politically motivated to undermine his party.\n\nThe BJP denies the allegation.\n\nAI-generated deepfakes were also used for the first time during the election, with the Election Commission struggling to track them.\n\nMr Modi initially focused his campaign on his economic achievements and commitment to Hindu revivalism.\n\nBut he soon switched to targeting the main opposition Congress Party, accusing them of favouring India's minority Muslims -- which the party denies.\n\nThe opposition campaigned on welfare programs for vulnerable communities and saving India's democratic values -- which they say have regressed under Mr Modi's rule -- an allegation he denies.\n\nFor voters, the main issues were unemployment and the rising cost of living.\n\nThe task of counting began on June 4 at 12:30pm AEST, with results expected on the same day.",

World's largest nation begins a mammoth day of vote counting after weeks-long election", "body": "Hundreds of millions of votes cast, more than six weeks of polling, and billions of dollars spent: India on Tuesday will declare a new leader after a mammoth nationwide election that has become a referendum on the last decade of leadership by Prime Minister Narendra Modi.\n\nHis powerful right-wing Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) is seeking a supermajority in the lower house of parliament - or Lok Sabha - a goal which, if successful, would give it an unstoppable mandate to further enshrine its Hindu-nationalist agenda, deepening India's move away from its secular foundations.\n\nGiven India's strategic position in Asia and its booming economy, the election result will reverberate far beyond its borders, capturing the attention of the United States, China and Russia in particular.\n\nSome 642 million people cast their vote in the world's largest election, as swathes of the country was blanketed in searing heat, making people sick and killing dozens.\n\nHoping to unseat India's charismatic but divisive leader is an alliance of more than two dozen parties, including the country's main opposition, the Indian National Congress, which is running on a platform of reducing inequality and upholding democratic institutions which it argues are at risk.\n\nIndia's Prime Minister Narendra Modi shows his ink-marked finger after casting his vote outside a polling station in Ahmedabad, India, on May 7, 2024.\n\nAdnan Abidi/Reuters\n\nSince assuming power in 2014, Modi has attained levels of popularity not seen in decades, owing to a raft of development and welfare programs, mixed with a strident brand of Hindu nationalism in a country where about 80% of the population are followers of the polytheistic faith.\n\nUnder Modi's leadership, the country of 1.4 billion people has become the world's fastest-growing major economy and a modern global power, making strides in technology and space. Yet, despite these successes, poverty and youth unemployment persist - particularly in rural areas - and the wealth gap has widened.\n\nCritics also say a decade of Modi's governance has led to growing religious polarization, with Islamophobia marginalizing much of the country's more than 200 million Muslims, and religious violence flaring up in a nation with a long history of communal tensions.\n\nPolling began on April 19 and ended on June 1. Nearly 1 billion Indians were eligible to vote for 543 seats in the lower house of parliament. The leader of the party that wins a majority will become prime minister and form a ruling government.\n\nModi has set an ambitious target of securing a 400-seat supermajority, with 370 directly controlled by his BJP - up from 303 in 2019 - and the others from its National Democratic Alliance.\n\nHis BJP centered its manifesto on job creation and anti-poverty programs, with a focus on women, the poor and farmers. He's promised to turn India into a developed nation by 2047 and transform the country into a global manufacturing hub.\n\nYet, on the campaign trail, he has been accused of deploying openly divisive rhetoric that has been condemned as Islamophobic, while casting himself as an instrument chosen by God.\n\nModi sparked a row over hate speech when he accused Muslims - who have been part of India for centuries - of being \"infiltrators,\" and echoing a false conspiracy voiced by some Hindu nationalists that Muslims are displacing the country's Hindu population by deliberately having large families. His BJP released several political videos targeting Muslims, one of which is under investigation by police.\n\nCongress has governed India for much of its independent history, having been instrumental in ending nearly 200 years of British colonial rule. But over the last decade, it has struggled to find relevance - partly due to a series of corruption scandals and infighting - unable to break through Modi's popularity.\n\nRahul Gandhi, the son of the famed Gandhi dynasty, is the face of the party but lost the past two elections to Modi. He is contending once again from the southern state of Kerala and the crucial state of Uttar Pradesh in the north, also India's most populous.\n\nCongress leader Rahul Gandhi shows his ink-marked finger after casting his vote during the sixth phase of Lok Sabha elections, on May 25, 2024 in New Delhi, India.\n\nRaj K Raj/Hindustan Times/Sipa/Reuters\n\nOpposition leaders and parties have faced a slew of legal and financial challenges in the run-up to this year's election, with many accusing the BJP of using state agencies to stifle opponents.\n\nThe arrest in March of the popular Aam Aadmi Party leader, chief minister of Delhi and staunch Modi critic Arvind Kejriwal sparked protests in the capital and prompted claims of a political \"conspiracy\" by his party - claims the BJP has denied.\n\nKejriwal's release on interim bail last month galvanized the opposition to put up a tough fight against the BJP, uniting a group of political leaders who were once divided over ideological differences.\n\nThe Congress' manifesto has also been dubbed one of India's most progressive, pledging \"freedom from fear\" and vowing to protect freedom of speech, expression and religious belief espoused in the constitution.\n\nTurnout across all seven phases has slightly dipped from the record highs of 2019, yet India's general election remains the largest exercise in democracy, with hundreds of millions showing up to determine who will lead the world's most populous country.", "source": {"uri": "cnn.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "CNN"}, "authors": [{"uri":

India's 44-day multiphase election will determine the next national government.\n\nIndia uses electronic voting machines so counting the hundreds of millions of votes should proceed quickly. Election officials expect to complete the vote tally by late June 4 or early on June 5.\n\nThe party of Prime Minister Narendra Modi is almost certain to emerge victorious. After the final polls closed on June 1, media organizations and polling companies released their exit polls. These polls are unanimous: Expect a large win by Modi's Bharatiya Janata Party. Unless there is an historic miss by the polling firms, the only uncertainty involves the size of Modi's margin of victory - rather than the victory itself.\n\nModi had announced a goal of securing 400 seats in India's 543-seat lower house of parliament, the Lok Sabha. His BJP-led National Democratic Alliance (NDA) only needs 272 seats to retain its majority in the new legislature. Most exit polls predict a comfortable majority for Modi's coalition with more than a dozen smaller parties. But these polls suggest the NDA will fall short of the 362-seat supermajority needed for most constitutional amendments.\n\nOnly one Indian government, elected in 1984, has secured more than 400 seats, making Modi's goal all the more audacious.\n\nIf Modi returns as anticipated as prime minister, he will become the first Indian prime minister to serve more than ten years continuously since Indira Gandhi did so from 1966 to 1977. If Modi, who is 73, were to serve the entirety of this new government's constitutionally permitted five-year term, he would become the longest-serving prime minister since India's first prime minister, Jawaharlal Nehru, who was in office from India's independence in1947. Nehru died in office in 1964 at the age of 74.\n\nWhile the big story is likely to be the scale of Modi's victory, his successor may soon become a topic of interest. It's likely that sometime during this coming parliamentary term media and public interest will shift to the question of who will succeed Modi, and lead the Bharatiya Janata Party juggernaut. The BJP currently has no obvious successor waiting in the wings, which will make the media speculation even more intense.

National Democratic Alliance (NDA) is going to form the government for the third time, we are grateful to the people,\" Modi told cheering supporters at his party headquarters in New Delhi, referring to the initials of his political alliance. \"This is a victory for the world's largest democracy.\"\n\nPreliminary figures from the election commission indicate Modi's ruling Bharatiya Janata Party falling short of securing the 272 seats needed to win an outright majority in parliament, a stunning upset that leaves them reliant on longstanding coalition partners to form a government.\n\nModi is still set to form a government with the help of his NDA partners - a third consecutive term and a landmark that makes him one of the most successful politicians in post-independence India.\n\nBut the results are nonetheless something of a personal blow to Modi, who had triumphantly vowed to win a 400-seat supermajority in this year's election - and romped to victory the last two contests with a simple majority for the BJP, turning his Hindu nationalist right-wing party into an electoral juggernaut.\n\nIndia's opposition, who had largely been written off in the polls and by many analysts, portrayed the result as a rejection of Modi's divisive style.\n\nRahul Gandhi, the leader of India's National Congress, said early election results showed that the \"country has unanimously and clearly\" stated that it does not want Modi and his party to run the country.\n\n\"We do not appreciate the way they have run this country for the last 10 years so that is a huge message for Mr. Narendra Modi,\" he said outside his party's headquarters in New Delhi.\n\nCongress led an alliance of opposition parties that tried to topple Modi, 73. While they look set to have failed in that task, they have dented his previous aura of electoral invincibility.\n\nPreliminary results also suggest they have chipped away at BJP seats, including in some of the ruling party's traditional strongholds. Congress alone are currently set to double the number of seats they won in 2019.\n\nThe election commission preliminary figures currently have the BJP's alliance winning around 300 seats compared to 230 for the opposition alliances.\n\nElection authorities are still counting votes and final results are expected in the coming hours.\n\nThis is a breaking news story and will be updated.\n\nThe-CNN-Wire\n\n\u2122 & \u00a9 2024 Cable News Network, Inc., a Warner Bros.

Results are due to be released on 4 June.\n\nIn India's most populous state of Uttar Pradesh, at least 15 died of heat stroke, reported the <em>Press Trust of India</em>.\n\nThe dead include seven home guard soldiers, three sanitation workers, one clerk posted at the Chief Medical Officer's office, one consolidation officer, and one worker in the home guard team, Dr Raj Bahadur Kamal, the principal of Mirzapur's Maa Vindhyavasini Autonomous State Medical College, told the agency.\n\nHe said they were brought to the facility with high fever and high blood pressure.\n\nTwo polling officials died in UP's Sonbhadra district. \"A polling party was supposed to leave from the dispatch centre in Robertsganj today. Three polling officials including a police personnel and others fell ill due to heat. Two polling officials have died. The CMO mentioned heatstroke-like symptoms were seen in the polling officials who were brought here,\" reported ANI quoting Sonbhadra DM Chandra Vijay Singh.\n\nFourteen people died in Bihar on Thursday, officials said, including 10 people involved in organising the election. Election officials are typically required to stand on duty all day, often outdoors. Five fatalities were reported in the Bhojpur district, said the disaster management department. Three election officials died in Rohtas and one each in Kaimur and Aurangabad districts.\n\nThe department said it has initiated the process of granting compensation to the families of those who died.\n\nDespite the blistering hot summer, hundreds of thousands lined up outside polling stations to cast their ballot for the last 57 parliamentary seats being contested on Saturday, including in prime minister Narendra Modi's constituency in the Hindu holy city of Varanasi.\n\nIn Kolkata, the capital of West Bengal, voters lined up outside polling stations early on Saturday morning to avoid the scorching heat, with temperatures expected to reach 34C amid 75 per cent humidity.\n\nThe election is considered one of the most consequential in India's history. If Mr Modi wins, he'll be only the second Indian leader to retain power for a third term after Jawaharlal Nehru, the country's first prime minister.\n\nNearly 970 million voters -- more than 10 per cent of the world's population -- were eligible to elect a new parliament for five years. More than 8,300 candidates are running for office.\n\nMost polls show Mr Modi and his Bharatiya Janata Party leading over the broad opposition alliance that's challenging them, led by the Congress party. Exit polls are due to be released after voting closes on Saturday, and not before 6pm.\n\nMr Modi's campaign began on a platform of economic progress, with promises to improve the lives of the poor and turn India into a developed nation by 2047. But his and his party's rhetoric have turned increasingly shrill in recent weeks as he gave back-to-back incendiary speeches that targeted the country's Muslim minority, who make up 14 per cent of India's 1.4 billion people.\n\nHis party has faced stiff resistance from the opposition alliance and its main face, Rahul Gandhi of the Congress party. They have attacked Mr Modi over his Hindu nationalist politics and are hoping to benefit from growing economic discontent.\n\nPre-poll surveys showed that voters were increasingly worried about unemployment, the rise in food prices and an overall sentiment that only a small portion of Indians have benefitted despite brisk economic growth under Mr Modi, making the contest appear closer than initially anticipated.", "source": {"uri": "independent.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Independent"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heat_stroke", "type":

On Sunday afternoon, an Election Day poll showed Prime Minister Narendra Modi's party leading.\n\nHow do you hold an election with 970 million eligible voters?\n\n-The exercise logistics and endurance are absolutely incredible, says Kathinka Froestad. She is Professor of Modern South Asian Studies at the University of Oslo.\n\nWith more than 1.4 billion people, India will overtake China in 2023 as the world's most populous country.\n\nOne of the things I find most interesting is the unimaginable scale of this election. How an incredible number of people have the right to vote, and how extremely complicated, expensive and tedious it is to arrange elections in such a country.\n\nCurrent Prime Minister Narendra Modi has been ranked as the front-runner in this year's elections. He has already been prime minister for 10 years, but is very popular with many voters.\n\n-He is greatly loved by his followers and is seen as the great and powerful man of India. Frostad says it will bring India into a new era.\n\nModi's Hindu nationalist Bharatiya Janata Party also has a very good political organization that has been adept at tipping elections in its favour, she says.\n\nTelevision channel NDTV collated the results of the two election day polls on Sunday. These results show that Modi's ruling Hindu nationalist party can win more than 350 seats in the lower house of the Indian National Assembly. The number of council seats is 543, so they will have a clear majority.\n\nMeanwhile, the 73-year-old has made himself unpopular.\n\n- There are many who believe that he exaggerated in his claim that India has achieved tremendous economic success, and at the same time there are many Indians who do not participate in that progress.\n\nShe also mentions the authoritarian direction Modi has taken in India, and that Modi sometimes has divisive Hindu nationalist rhetoric.\n\n- It's getting a little interesting. Many of those involved in the political debate believe that Modi's popularity is not as high as was thought just a few weeks ago.\n\n- She says he is very hated by those who prefer other parties.\n\nThe alternative to the Bharatiya Janata Party is a coalition led by the secular opposition Congress Party, along with a number of regional parties.\n\n- They agree on some matters, including their desire to oust Modi from power. At the same time, they are mutual rivals and disagree about a lot. So the alliance is fragile.\n\nShe says, among other things, that they are not clear about who the prime ministerial candidate is.\n\n- They do not have a coherent program.\n\nThe elections began on April 19, and were carried out in seven rounds in different parts of the country. The final of the seven rounds will be held on Saturday, June 1. The results of the Lok Sabha elections are expected to appear on June 4.\n\nThe election was largely about the economy and what India's cultural heritage should be, says Frostad.\n\n- What architecture, what memorials to pay attention to, what collective expressions and collective memory India should have.\n\nModi represents Hindus first, even if they do not say so explicitly.\n\nShe says there is an ongoing battle over who India should be for.\n\nThe country is deeply religious and religion is a central identity marker for Indians. Nearly 80 percent of the population is Hindu, while 14 percent of the population is Muslim. In addition, there are many Christians, Sikhs, Buddhists and Jains.\n\nIndia has also been criticized for moving in an authoritarian direction. Is it a real democracy?\n\nThere is a lot of talk about Modi and his party's strong control over a number of state institutions that are supposed to be neutral, such as the Electoral Commission, the media, and other institutions.\n\n- It is increasingly difficult to stop them in their actions - but at the same time we have seen that the Indian Supreme Court has at times sided against the BJP. I must also say that this election campaign has shown that the media, and perhaps some newspapers in particular, are more critical than I have seen them in a long time. I would say the photo is probably shared.", "source": {"uri": "brytfmonline.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "brytfmonline"}, "authors": [{"uri": "bond_robertson@brytfmonline.com", "name": "Bond Robertson", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Narendra_Modi", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Narendra Modi"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/India", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "India"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hindu_nationalism", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Hindu nationalism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_Oslo", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "University of Oslo"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Asia", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "South Asia"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bharatiya_Janata_Party", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Bharatiya Janata Party"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Suffrage", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Suffrage"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prime_minister", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Prime minister"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/China", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "China"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "China"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NDTV", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "NDTV"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coalition_government", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Coalition government"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indian_National_Congress", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Indian National Congress"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Authoritarianism", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Authoritarianism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secularism", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Secularism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lower_house", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Lower house"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sikhs", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Sikhs"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christians", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Christians"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hindus", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Hindus"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muslims", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Muslims"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jainism", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Jainism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lok_Sabha", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Lok Sabha"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supreme_Court_of_India", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Supreme Court of India"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buddhism", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Buddhism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democracy", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Democracy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Religion", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Religion"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Entertainment/Party_Supplies", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Entertainment/Party Supplies", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Campaigns_and_Elections", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Campaigns and Elections", "wgt": 19}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Children/Parties", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Children/Parties", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "dmoz/Home/Entertaining/Party_Planning", "label": "dmoz/Home/Entertaining/Party Planning", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 95}], "image": "https://akamai.vgc.no/v2/images/23bbca08-c314-45e1-9d4d-c127735988b7?format=auto&w=1080&s=616518b410e9828d9c5983ba98b6960a5d04e88a", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9616128", "eventUri": "eng-9616128", "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-04-19", "textStart": 2618, "textEnd": 2626}, {"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-06-01", "textStart": 2756, "textEnd": 2762}, {"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-06-04", "textStart": 2829, "textEnd": 2835}], "sentiment": 0.1529411764705881, "wgt": 132, "relevance": 1}

A party or coalition needs a simple majority of 272 to form the government, and the leader of the winning party or coalition has a decisive role in choosing the next head of state.\n\nThe trends by late evening clearly suggested that the BJP will fall short of a single-party majority and will have to cobble the magic number of 272 with the help of its allies.

First, despite India's economic growth, the promised benefits didn't reach the masses, with the unemployment rate remaining high. Second, the BJP's push for Hindu nationalism may have alienated some voters who worry about its dominance threatening India's traditional political system.\n\nIn his third term, Modi is likely to stay consistent with his foreign policy, Qian said, adding that the government could leverage global and regional shifts to boost India's political, economic and diplomatic strength, enhancing its international presence.", "source": {"uri": "chinadaily.com.cn", "dataType": "news", "title": "China Daily"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coalition_government", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Coalition government"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Narendra_Modi", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Narendra Modi"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Democratic_Alliance", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "National Democratic Alliance"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lok_Sabha", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Lok Sabha"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bharatiya_Janata_Party", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Bharatiya Janata Party"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2019_United_Kingdom_general_election", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "2019 United Kingdom general election"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Landslide_victory", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Landslide victory"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exit_poll", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Exit poll"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Majority", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Majority"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_election", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "General election"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indian_National_Congress", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Indian National Congress"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/India", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "India"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/One-party_state", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "One-party state"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hindu_nationalism", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Hindu nationalism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ideology", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Ideology"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Head_of_state", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Head of state"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tsinghua_University", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Tsinghua University"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foreign_policy", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Foreign policy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Welfare", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Welfare"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Associated_Press", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Associated Press"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unemployment", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Unemployment"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economic_growth", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Economic growth"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Entertainment/Party_Supplies", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Entertainment/Party Supplies", "wgt": 17}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics", "wgt": 20}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Children/Parties", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Children/Parties", "wgt": 17}, {"uri": "dmoz/Home/Entertaining/Party_Planning", "label": "dmoz/Home/Entertaining/Party Planning", "wgt": 17}, {"uri": "dmoz/Home/Entertaining/Children", "label": "dmoz/Home/Entertaining/Children", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 70}], "image": "http://img2.chinadaily.com.cn/images/202406/05/665f40b2a31082fc2b6f3f31.jpeg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9616128", "eventUri": "eng-9616128", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.411764705882353, "wgt": 132, "relevance": 1}

They (BJP) don't say it openly but they have given enough subtle hints,\" said political analyst Sunita Aaron.\n\n\"The BJP manifesto mentioned only the Ram temple, but political parties can always change tracks.\"\n\n- 'Absolute power' -\n\nCelebrations at India's ruling BJP party headquarters saw Hindu faithful followers party, but minorities including the country's 200-million-plus Muslims are more worried at their return to power\n\nModi's third term could also likely see the \"divisive\" revision of electoral boundaries based on population.\n\nThat would likely mean a significant expansion of seats in northern states -- which the BJP considers its heartland -- reducing the overall parliamentary punch of opposition areas in the relatively less-populous south.\n\n\"It will be quite testing for the Indian union and the federal polity,\" Manivannan said, calling the proposal \"quite divisive\".\n\n\"The southern states won't take it lying down,\" Manivannan added. \"Absolute

The BJP itself was leading in 239 seats, compared with 303 at the last election in 2019.\n\nFinal results are expected to come later on Tuesday or early Wednesday.\n\n\"The BJP's reliance on allies to form the government is a slap in the face,\" said Milan Vaishnav at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace think-tank in Washington.\n\n\"At this stage, NDA allies will extract their pound of flesh, which will have an impact not just in terms of policymaking but also in terms of the composition of the cabinet. (Earlier) the BJP could dictate terms with very little regard for its coalition partners.\"\n\nModi, a strong leader, has not had to rely on alliance partners in the past and it was not clear how easily he would cope.\n\n\"Modi is not known as a consensual figure,\" said New Delhi-based political commentator Arathi Jerath. \"So, it'll be very interesting to see how he manages the pulls and pressures of a coalition government.\"\n\nPopulism and welfare policies will \"gain currency\" as Modi will have to depend on regional leaders like N. Chandrababu Naidu in the southern state of Andhra Pradesh and Nitish Kumar in Bihar in the east, who support such policies, said political analyst Rasheed Kidwai.\n\nNaidu's Telugu Desam Party and Kumar's Janata Dal (United) said they would endorse Modi for prime minister.\n\nModi called the win for his alliance historic and said that \"we will continue the good work done in the last decade to keep fulfilling the aspirations of people\".\n\nThe BJP, which had campaigned on India's spectacular economic expansion, its growing international stature and the party's Hindu-first agenda, has acknowledged unemployment was a factor in the election.\n\n\"Employment is a challenge that we also accept and whatever best can be done is being done,\" spokesperson Gopal Krishna Agarwal said.\n\nThe unemployment rate in India rose to 8.1% in April from 7.4% in March, according to the private think-tank Centre for Monitoring Indian Economy, compared with around 6% before the COVID-19 pandemic. Modi first came to power in 2014 on the promise of creating 20 million jobs a year, but has fallen far short of that.\n\nGovernment estimates for the latest January-March quarter show that the urban unemployment rate in the 15-29 age group ticked higher to 17%, from 16.5% in the prior quarter.\n\nDespite India's impressive economic growth of more than 8%, rural distress has increased as incomes have fallen amid rising food prices.\n\nSuch economic growth has meant wealth is concentrated in the richest 1% of India's population.\n\nWhile headline inflation hovering around 5% is relatively low, food inflation of above 8% since November 2023 has hit the poor hard. Prices of vegetables and cereals have risen by double digits for most of the last year.\n\nModi was seeking one of India's biggest mandates in the six-week-long election after most opinion polls conducted before voting began had predicted a big victory for him, driven by his personal popularity, free cereal for the poor, new roads and bridges, and his courting of majority Hindus.\n\nBut a fall in voter turnout in the first stage of the seven- phase election worried the BJP, several party officials said. A pollster, who declined to be named citing private conversations, said he got calls from \"panicked\" BJP officials asking if \"something was going wrong. Why aren't people coming?\".\n\nAt the same time, some analysts told TV debates that opposition attempts to woo the masses with promises of affirmative action, bigger handouts and more jobs were gaining traction.\n\nThat is when Modi changed tack.\n\nHaving earlier focused on economic development, India's image and such issues, he switched back to accusing the opposition of favouring minority Muslims at the cost of Hindus.\n\n\"I believe that the polarising campaign that the prime minister ran this time, the kind of, you know, hyped-up media outreach that he did, I think these were all signs that he was worried,\" said political commentator Arati Jerath.\n\nThe BJP said Modi was their best bet to put their message across.\n\n\"We discussed internally how our work, economic development, India's global image and such things sometimes do not set the narrative,\" said spokesperson Agarwal.\n\n\"The politics is such that other things dictate the narrative, and the BJP must also respond accordingly. For our narrative to work, the prime minister is the best communicator.\"\n\nHowever, with the BJP falling short of a majority on its own, its promises like a uniform civil code for all religions, opposed by some Muslims, and simultaneous state and national elections, will likely be put on the back burner. They could be replaced by policies aimed at more bread-and-butter issues as its allies could demand.\n\n\"Modi has seemingly lost his aura of electoral invincibility,\" said Michael Kugelman, director of the Washington-based Wilson Center's South Asia Institute think tank.\n\n\"He remains highly popular, and his party likely would have done even worse if he weren't leading it. This is a leader who has repeatedly bounced back from political and policy setbacks and retained large public mandates.

The Indian leader set to become prime minister for third time", "body": "A decade in power and seeking a third consecutive term as prime minister, Narendra Modi has said he \"has big plans for India and no one needs be spooked by them\".\n\nComing from a leader who was once persona non-grata in the US and the UK for his suspected role in sectarian violence, the assurance betrays a climate of fear and uncertainty that Mr Modi's leadership has engendered for sections of the Indian society.\n\nOpposition parties claim that India is sliding \"towards dictatorship\" as a result of Mr Modi's \"authoritarian tendencies\" and the sectarian politics of his ruling Hindu nationalist BJP.\n\nFollow our live coverage on 2024 India general elections.\n\nAnother term for the BJP government would prove \"disastrous for India and its global reputation as the world's largest democracy\", Dr Shubranshu Mishra, professor of politics and international relations at the University of Exeter told The Independent.\n\nMr Modi took power in 2014, and retained it in 2019, riding a cresting tide of revanchist Hindu nationalism. He is, for the most part, leaning on the same appeal to win a third term, which no prime minister has managed since the first one, Jawaharlal Nehru, in 1962.\n\nMr Modi, 73, has long portrayed himself as an outsider who came from a humble family background, unlike most of his predecessors and current rivals from political dynasties and sociocultural elite.\n\nHe was born into a family of grocers in Vadnagar town in the western state of Gujarat and claimed to have spent his teenage years manning a tea stall with his brother near a bus station.\n\nAt the age of 17, he left his wife Jashodaben to live an ascetic life. He does not have any children and the only glimpse of his closely guarded private life were his occasional meetings with his mother, Heeraben Modi, until her passing in 2022.\n\nAt an early age, Mr Modi was attracted to the ideology of Hindu nationalism and attended classes run by the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh, the mothership of a network of Hindu right-wing groups, including the BJP. It's where he is said to have honed his oratory as a pracharak, or propagandist.\n\nHe moved laterally from the Sangh to the BJP in 1987 just as the party was gaining broader support within the Hindu majority with its militant advocacy for the destruction of the medieval Babri mosque, which it claimed was built on the birthplace of the Hindu deity Ram.\n\nThe mosque was eventually torn down by a Hindu mob in 1992 and Mr Modi, now prime minister, inaugurated a grand Ram Temple on its site earlier this year.\n\nThe construction of the temple and especially the highly publicised and choreographed inauguration was seen by his critics as an attempt by Mr Modi to cement his appeal among his Hindu nationalist supporters.\n\nAfter several years as a middlerung functionary in the BJP's national setup, Mr Modi was sent to his home state of Gujarat, to steady the party's government in the state. Against expectations, he led the BJP to victory in the December 2002 elections.\n\nThe victory, however, came on the back of a sectarian pogrom in which Mr Modi's administration was accused of being complicit in. The pogrom, marked by massacres and gang rapes, left an estimated 2,000 Muslims dead.\n\nMr Modi has rejected the allegations and an investigation ordered by the Supreme Court found no evidence to support prosecuting him.\n\nStill, the allegations made him a pariah in the West for years. He was denied entry to the US and the UK over concerns about human rights violations for years until it became clear he was going to be the prime minister.\n\nAt home, Mr Modi was now firmly installed as the face of Hindu nationalism in Gujarat, and beyond, and won back-to-back state elections in 2007 and 2012. He introduced a series of highly publicised infrastructure and industrial policies which he sold to the rest of the country as the \"Gujarat model\" of development.\n\nThe rhetorical melding of Hindu nationalism and material development would prove potent as Mr Modi set his sights on New Delhi.\n\nAhead of the 2014 national elections, the BJP installed Mr Modi as its prime ministerial candidate. BJP won the election handily, consigning the Congress, grappling with multiple corruption scandals, to its worst defeat ever.\n\nAfter taking office, Mr Modi cast himself as the leader who would finally make India a developed country, announcing a slew of programmes to build and modernise roads, railways, power plants, airports, seaports, public transportation, and nearly 40 million concrete homes for the poor.\n\nHe also faced flak for decisions such as the overnight demonetisation of 500 and 1,000 rupee currency notes to supposedly crack down on black money and terrorism funding, and the handling of the border crisis with China.\n\nAt the same time, he was blamed for rising sectarian violence, especially against Muslims, and for the widening crackdown on dissent, free press and political opposition.\n\nNone of this could stop his triumphant march back to power in 2019.\n\nIn his second term, Mr Modi went about bringing the BJP's pet projects to fruition. His government enacted a citizenship law that is considered discriminatory towards Muslims, revoked the autonomous status of Jammu and Kashmir's autonomy, and constructed the Ram Temple in Ayodhya.\n\nMr Modi has rejected criticism of his policies and priorities claiming that his government works for the welfare of all citizens without discriminating.\n\nHis government, however, had to withdraw a slate of laws seeking to restructure India's agriculture sector after thousands of farmers launched a year-long protest in the capital.\n\nStill, Mr Modi enjoys a 75 per cent approval rating, according to Morning Consult, the highest among 25 world leaders tracked by the US data intelligence company.\n\n\"This will be the last opportunity for the people to save democracy in India. If Narendra Modi wins another election, there will be a dictatorship in the country,\" Mallikarjun Kharge, president of the opposition party Congress, said in February. \"The BJP will rule India like (Vladimir) Putin in Russia.\"\n\n\"If rights are ignored, then dictatorship will be imminent.\"\n\nHe was commenting after several prominent opposition leaders were put under investigation, raided and jailed by federal agencies controlled by Mr Modi's government.\n\nProf Mishra echoed the concerns. \"The upcoming Indian elections will place serious challenges on the country's democratic and secular values,\" he said. \"The ruling party's authoritarian hold on various institutions, including the election commission and Hindu majoritarianism that targets minority groups, are major concerns.\"\n\n\"The outcome of the elections will determine whether India can preserve its democratic and secular values or continue its democratic decline under the Hindu nationalist prime minister Modi.\"\n\nMr Modi, who has not given a press conference in his 10 years in power, sought to dispel such concerns ahead of the elections when he told the news agency ANI that \"his big plans\" were for the overall development of the country.\n\n\"My decisions are not to scare anyone or to diminish anyone,\" he said when asked about his remark that his decade in power was just a trailer.",

All told, 66.95 percent of the nation's eligible voters cast their ballots, 1 percent less than in the elections five years ago but still an incredible display of democracy in action.\n\nThe good news for Mr. Modi is that he is expected to win a third five-year term as leader of what is by far the world's largest democracy. The bad news is that, with 288 members of his National Democratic Alliance projected to win seats, he'll barely have enough votes in the Lok Sabha to be sure he's really in charge of the government.\n\nFar from winning the \"landslide\" of more than 400 seats that Mr. Modi had counted on, his ruling Bharatiya Janata Party now has to negotiate with friends and allies to be sure their leader will stay in power. Already the historic Congress Party -- which had controlled the Lok Sabha under India's longest-serving prime minister, Jawaharlal Nehru, and his daughter, Indira Gandhi -- is calling for Mr. Modi's resignation.\n\nSmelling blood, exultant Congress leaders talked as if their candidates had actually won the votes they needed to make a historic comeback.\n\nA leader of the Congress, Rahul Gandhi, grandson of Indira and son of Sanjiv Gandhi, who succeeded Indira as prime minister after her assassination in 1984, said leaders of the \"India Alliance,\" dominated by the Congress, would soon decide whether to try to organize a centrist bloc capable of forcing Mr. Modi out of power.\n\nThat appeared unlikely, but a leader of the Congress, Jairam Ramesh, said the count \"proved that the outgoing prime minister is going to become former.\" Now is the time, he said, for Mr. Modi to \"take moral responsibility and resign\" - \"the message of this election.\"\n\nWhile expected to keep his job as the first three-term prime minister since Nehru, Mr. Modi might have to rethink or tone down his emphasis on Hindu nationalism in a country of 1.4 billion people, including 200 million Muslims. He also faces severe opposition from the nation's Sikh minority of about 24 million, most of them in the Punjab region north of Delhi, where Sikh firebrands are demanding \"independence.\"\n\nMore troublesome for many Indians is that, as India has grown economically and militarily, improving ties with Washington while standing firm against Chinese encroachment along its northern borders, most people below a small upper crust are not sharing in the nation's seeming success story.\n\n\"The BJP's Hindutva or Hindu nationalist ideology has not resonated throughout the country, particularly in the south where the party does not control any of the five state governments.,\" the senior research fellow for South Asia, Asia-Pacific at London's influential Chatham House, Chietigj Bajpaee, writes, citing \"concerns about youth unemployment (which accounts for over 80 percent of the country's unemployed) and inflation,\" notably food prices.\n\nAt a press conference, Rahul Gandhi played upon deep-seated class and caste differences, saying \"India's poorest and backward stood up to save the Constitution.\" The Times of India quoted him as saying, \"The people have given a clear message to PM Modi, 'We do not want you.'\"\n\nMore realistically, though, the paper ran the headline: \"Stage set for NDA 3.0 despite INDIA bloc's impressive gains\" -- and reported Mr. Modi's party \"winning only 241 seats, 31 seats short of majority and a whopping 62 seats less than its tally in the 2019 polls.\"", "source": {"uri": "nysun.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The New York Sun"},

Polarising Indian leader on cusp of winning 2024 election", "body": "A decade in power and seeking a third consecutive term as prime minister, Narendra Modi has said he \"has big plans for India and no one needs be spooked by them\".\n\nComing from a leader who was once persona non-grata in the US and the UK for his suspected role in sectarian violence, the assurance betrays a climate of fear and uncertainty that Mr Modi's leadership has engendered for sections of the Indian society.\n\nIt is this sense of fear and uncertainty that opposition parties and critics of Mr Modi are seeking to tap into as India prepares to vote in the national elections that start on 19 April and end with the declaration of results on 4 June.\n\nThey claim that India is sliding \"towards dictatorship\" as a result of Mr Modi's \"authoritarian tendencies\" and the sectarian politics of his ruling Hindu nationalist BJP.\n\nAnother term for the BJP government would prove \"disastrous for India and its global reputation as the world's largest democracy\", Dr Shubranshu Mishra, professor of politics and international relations at the University of Exeter told The Independent.\n\nMr Modi took power in 2014, and retained it in 2019, riding a cresting tide of revanchist Hindu nationalism. He is, for the most part, leaning on the same appeal to win a third term, which no prime minister has managed since the first one, Jawaharlal Nehru, in 1962.\n\nMr Modi, 73, has long portrayed himself as an outsider who came from a humble family background, unlike most of his predecessors and current rivals from political dynasties and sociocultural elite.\n\nHe was born into a family of grocers in Vadnagar town in the western state of Gujarat and claimed to have spent his teenage years manning a tea stall with his brother near a bus station.\n\nAt the age of 17, he left his wife Jashodaben to live an ascetic life. He does not have any children and the only glimpse of his closely guarded private life were his occasional meetings with his mother, Heeraben Modi, until her passing in 2022.\n\nAt an early age, Mr Modi was attracted to the ideology of Hindu nationalism and attended classes run by the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh, the mothership of a network of Hindu right-wing groups, including the BJP. It's where he is said to have honed his oratory as a pracharak, or propagandist.\n\nHe moved laterally from the Sangh to the BJP in 1987 just as the party was gaining broader support within the Hindu majority with its militant advocacy for the destruction of the medieval Babri mosque, which it claimed was built on the birthplace of the Hindu deity Ram.\n\nThe mosque was eventually torn down by a Hindu mob in 1992 and Mr Modi, now prime minister, inaugurated a grand Ram Temple on its site earlier this year.\n\nThe construction of the temple and especially the highly publicised and choreographed inauguration was seen by his critics as an attempt by Mr Modi to cement his appeal among his Hindu nationalist supporters.\n\nAfter several years as a middlerung functionary in the BJP's national setup, Mr Modi was sent to his home state of Gujarat, to steady the party's government in the state. Against expectations, he led the BJP to victory in the December 2002 elections.\n\nThe victory, however, came on the back of a sectarian pogrom in which Mr Modi's administration was accused of being complicit in. The pogrom, marked by massacres and gang rapes, left an estimated 2,000 Muslims dead.\n\nMr Modi has rejected the allegations and an investigation ordered by the Supreme Court found no evidence to support prosecuting him.\n\nStill, the allegations made him a pariah in the West for years. He was denied entry to the US and the UK over concerns about human rights violations for years until it became clear he was going to be the prime minister.\n\nAt home, Mr Modi was now firmly installed as the face of Hindu nationalism in Gujarat, and beyond, and won back-to-back state elections in 2007 and 2012. He introduced a series of highly publicised infrastructure and industrial policies which he sold to the rest of the country as the \"Gujarat model\" of development.\n\nThe rhetorical melding of Hindu nationalism and material development would prove potent as Mr Modi set his sights on New Delhi.\n\nAhead of the 2014 national elections, the BJP installed Mr Modi as its prime ministerial candidate. BJP won the election handily, consigning the Congress, grappling with multiple corruption scandals, to its worst defeat ever.\n\nAfter taking office, Mr Modi cast himself as the leader who would finally make India a developed country, announcing a slew of programmes to build and modernise roads, railways, power plants, airports, seaports, public transportation, and nearly 40 million concrete homes for the poor.\n\nHe also faced flak for decisions such as the overnight demonetisation of 500 and 1,000 rupee currency notes to supposedly crack down on black money and terrorism funding, and the handling of the border crisis with China.\n\nAt the same time, he was blamed for rising sectarian violence, especially against Muslims, and for the widening crackdown on dissent, free press and political opposition.\n\nNone of this could stop his triumphant march back to power in 2019.\n\nIn his second term, Mr Modi went about bringing the BJP's pet projects to fruition. His government enacted a citizenship law that is considered discriminatory towards Muslims, revoked the autonomous status of Jammu and Kashmir's autonomy, and constructed the Ram Temple in Ayodhya.\n\nMr Modi has rejected criticism of his policies and priorities claiming that his government works for the welfare of all citizens without discriminating.\n\nHis government, however, had to withdraw a slate of laws seeking to restructure India's agriculture sector after thousands of farmers launched a year-long protest in the capital.\n\nStill, Mr Modi enjoys a 75 per cent approval rating, according to Morning Consult, the highest among 25 world leaders tracked by the US data intelligence company.\n\n\"This will be the last opportunity for the people to save democracy in India. If Narendra Modi wins another election, there will be a dictatorship in the country,\" Mallikarjun Kharge, president of the opposition party Congress, said in February. \"The BJP will rule India like (Vladimir) Putin in Russia.\"\n\n\"If rights are ignored, then dictatorship will be imminent.\"\n\nHe was commenting after several prominent opposition leaders were put under investigation, raided and jailed by federal agencies controlled by Mr Modi's government.\n\nProf Mishra echoed the concerns. \"The upcoming Indian elections will place serious challenges on the country's democratic and secular values,\" he said. \"The ruling party's authoritarian hold on various institutions, including the election commission and Hindu majoritarianism that targets minority groups, are major concerns.\"\n\n\"The outcome of the elections will determine whether India can preserve its democratic and secular values or continue its democratic decline under the Hindu nationalist prime minister Modi.\"\n\nMr Modi, who has not given a press conference in his 10 years in power, sought to dispel such concerns ahead of the elections when he told the news agency ANI that \"his big plans\" were for the overall development of the country.\n\n\"My decisions are not to scare anyone or to diminish anyone,\" he said when asked about his remark that his decade in power was just a trailer.",

During the polls Modi escalated polarizing rhetoric in incendiary speeches that targeted the country's Muslim minority.\n\nAnother victory would cement Modi as one of the country's most popular and important leaders.

Opposition parties were fighting an election machinery with which media, bureaucracy and all constitutional authorities have aligned. This was not an election between opposition and the ruling party, but a fight between opposition and all these institutions and the media,\" Prof Apoorvanand said.\n\n\"If BJP wins, the worrying element is a merger of bureaucracy and a large section of police with the BJP.

Or so claims nearly every exit poll released since the end of voting on Saturday evening. Yet, these surveys have proved spectacularly wrong in the past, and they must be read even more cautiously this time around because of the Modi government's outsize sway on the television stations that commission them.\n\nMind you, the actual count on Tuesday may well give enough seats to the Bharatiya Janata Party-led National Democratic Alliance for it to stake a claim for a third straight five-year term. But 350-plus NDA lawmakers in a 543-member parliament, as predicted by nearly every exit poll, sounds like an unrealistically large mandate. It ought to be taken with a pinch of salt by investors intending to join the stocks rally that's almost certain to take off Monday.\n\nA 350-seat haul will be a repeat of NDA's 2019 performance. Back then, Modi had turned airstrikes on a terrorist training camp in Pakistan into the central plank of his reelection bid. This time, however, national security was not an election issue. Yes, Modi did consecrate a controversial Hindu temple to expand his vote base. But that project was done and dusted by January. In 2024, the right-wing leader turned his muscularity inward: Muslims, the biggest religious minority, faced nonstop dog whistles and complained of large-scale voter suppression.\n\nHowever, such tactics are unlikely to have led to a dramatic consolidation of Hindu votes, not when the opposition INDIA alliance ran a spirited campaign focused on surging youth unemployment, high cost of living, and rampant crony capitalism. Modi chose to elevate himself above such earthly concerns. \"I'm convinced that God has sent me,\" he told a TV channel owned by tycoon Mukesh Ambani. In another interview -- to a station controlled by Gautam Adani, the centi-billionaire from his home state of Gujarat -- Modi spoke of his 1,000-year vision.\n\nAmbani and Adani are Asia's richest businessmen. The Adani Group's market value has soared by $25 billion since polling began in phases on April 19.\n\nA generous mandate for the NDA is a ringing endorsement of Modi, such is the Indian prime minister's personality cult. And if that is really the outcome, then it means the welfare benefits that a big section of the population already receives -- free food, cooking-gas subsidy, some cash for small farmers, and handouts for constructing village homes and toilets -- are preferred by voters to any alternative based on new rights, such as the urban employment guarantee or expansion of affirmative action proposed by the Congress Party.\n\nThis is good news for markets. Investors reckon that while Modi's social policies may be deeply polarizing, his fiscal stance will be conservative, which will help India attract capital away from China. A massive ramp-up is expected in infrastructure and private capital expenditure under Modi 3.0, despite constrained mass consumption and inadequate household savings.\n\nThe opposition grouping, however, believes that the people's real preferences are very different, and that the exit polls are nothing but psychological warfare. If so, it is working. Rahul Gandhi's Congress first decided to boycott discussions of exit polls, and then did a U-turn.\n\nThe anti-Modi coalition of more than two dozen parties has proved surprisingly resilient despite not having a prime ministerial candidate yet. The absence of an alternative leader may have dissuaded voters who wanted to see a credible challenger.\n\nWith several of its prominent leaders in jail ahead of the elections, and the taxman freezing bank accounts of the Congress Party, the alliance fought hard -- both on the ground and in social media. For a government that has already enjoyed a decade in power to return with its majority intact will leave political opposition dispirited and irrelevant. It may not be able to keep the flock together for another five years. Muddying the picture still further, the less-than-transparent conduct of the Election Commission has also come under a cloud.\n\nAs has the partisan role of media moguls, though not exactly for the first time. The 2004 exit polls were also wrong. They gave the ruling NDA coalition between 240 to 275 seats in a fresh election. It ended up with 187, and the government was booted out. What makes this year's surveys highly unusual is that at least three of them are projecting the NDA to snag as many as 400 seats, a forecast that happens to match the slogan given by Home Minister Amit Shah, Modi's No. 2.\n\nAlthough Modi has denied any such plans, INDIA alliance leaders have warned that 400 seats for the Modi government may mean a change in the country's secular constitution. Irrespective of whether they have some signal value or are pure noise, the exit polls have at least put the idea of an eventual Hindu state into play.\n\nAndy Mukherjee is a Bloomberg Opinion

The BJP itself was leading in 239 seats, compared with 303 at the last election in 2019.\n\nFinal results are expected to come later on Tuesday or early Wednesday.\n\n\"The BJP's reliance on allies to form the government is a slap in the face,\" said Milan Vaishnav at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace think-tank in Washington.\n\n\"At this stage, NDA allies will extract their pound of flesh, which will have an impact not just in terms of policymaking but also in terms of the composition of the cabinet. (Earlier) the BJP could dictate terms with very little regard for its coalition partners.\"\n\nModi, a strong leader, has not had to rely on alliance partners in the past and it was not clear how easily he would cope.\n\n\"Modi is not known as a consensual figure,\" said New Delhi-based political commentator Arathi Jerath. \"So, it'll be very interesting to see how he manages the pulls and pressures of a coalition government.\"\n\nPopulism and welfare policies will \"gain currency\" as Modi will have to depend on regional leaders like N. Chandrababu Naidu in the southern state of Andhra Pradesh and Nitish Kumar in Bihar in the east, who support such policies, said political analyst Rasheed Kidwai.\n\nNaidu's Telugu Desam Party and Kumar's Janata Dal (United) said they would endorse Modi for prime minister.\n\nModi called the win for his alliance historic and said that \"we will continue the good work done in the last decade to keep fulfilling the aspirations of people\".\n\nThe BJP, which had campaigned on India's spectacular economic expansion, its growing international stature and the party's Hindu-first agenda, has acknowledged unemployment was a factor in the election.\n\n\"Employment is a challenge that we also accept and whatever best can be done is being done,\" spokesperson Gopal Krishna Agarwal said.\n\nThe unemployment rate in India rose to 8.1% in April from 7.4% in March, according to the private think-tank Centre for Monitoring Indian Economy, compared with around 6% before the COVID-19 pandemic. Modi first came to power in 2014 on the promise of creating 20 million jobs a year, but has fallen far short of that.\n\nGovernment estimates for the latest January-March quarter show that the urban unemployment rate in the 15-29 age group ticked higher to 17%, from 16.5% in the prior quarter.\n\nDespite India's impressive economic growth of more than 8%, rural distress has increased as incomes have fallen amid rising food prices.\n\nSuch economic growth has meant wealth is concentrated in the richest 1% of India's population.\n\nWhile headline inflation hovering around 5% is relatively low, food inflation of above 8% since November 2023 has hit the poor hard. Prices of vegetables and cereals have risen by double digits for most of the last year.\n\nTURNOUT TROUBLE\n\nModi was seeking one of India's biggest mandates in the six-week-long election after most opinion polls conducted before voting began had predicted a big victory for him, driven by his personal popularity, free cereal for the poor, new roads and bridges, and his courting of majority Hindus.\n\nBut a fall in voter turnout in the first stage of the seven- phase election worried the BJP, several party officials said. A pollster, who declined to be named citing private conversations, said he got calls from \"panicked\" BJP officials asking if \"something was going wrong. Why aren't people coming?\".\n\nAt the same time, some analysts told TV debates that opposition attempts to woo the masses with promises of affirmative action, bigger handouts and more jobs were gaining traction.\n\nThat is when Modi changed tack.\n\nHaving earlier focused on economic development, India's image and such issues, he switched back to accusing the opposition of favouring minority Muslims at the cost of Hindus.\n\n\"I believe that the polarising campaign that the prime minister ran this time, the kind of, you know, hyped-up media outreach that he did, I think these were all signs that he was worried,\" said political commentator Arati Jerath.\n\nThe BJP said Modi was their best bet to put their message across.\n\n\"We discussed internally how our work, economic development, India's global image and such things sometimes do not set the narrative,\" said spokesperson Agarwal.\n\n\"The politics is such that other things dictate the narrative, and the BJP must also respond accordingly. For our narrative to work, the prime minister is the best communicator.\"\n\nHowever, with the BJP falling short of a majority on its own, its promises like a uniform civil code for all religions, opposed by some Muslims, and simultaneous state and national elections, will likely be put on the back burner. They could be replaced by policies aimed at more bread-and-butter issues as its allies could demand.\n\n\"Modi has seemingly lost his aura of electoral invincibility,\" said Michael Kugelman, director of the Washington-based Wilson Center's South Asia Institute think tank.\n\n\"He remains highly popular, and his party likely would have done even worse if he weren't leading it. This is a leader who has repeatedly bounced back from political and policy setbacks and retained large public mandates. With the results we're seeing today, that narrative of resilience has been dealt a big blow.\"\n\n(Reporting by Krishna N.

That is well above the 272 needed for a majority in the lower house. On its own, the BJP may win about 327 seats -- although that is lower than the target it set itself.\n\nIndia has a population of 1.4 billion and 970 million people were eligible to vote. Modi put Hindu supremacy and the scapegoating of the country's 220 million Muslims at the centre of his campaign.\n\nSushant Singh, a lecturer at Yale University, wrote Modi \"put a target on Indian Muslims' backs\". He \"redirected the anger of poor and marginalised Hindu communities away from crony capitalists and the privileged upper castes\".\n\nSome polls showed Modi's lead narrowing during the six-week election campaign. Whenever that happened, he increased the anti-Muslim assaults.\n\nRana Ayyub wrote in the Washington Post recently, \"In just the past four months, Mumbai and adjoining cities in the state of Maharashtra witnessed 50 anti-Muslim hate rallies.\n\n\"They were attended by thousands of Hindus, often led and participated in by leaders of the BJP. I have attended four such rallies all across western India.\n\n\"I saw vast crowds, from young children to 80-year-olds marching in the streets, expressing 'Hindu akrosh' (Hindu rage). They called for 'termites' and 'bearded traitors' -- all terms for Muslims in Modi's India -- to be wiped from the face of the country.\n\n\"I saw young women holding placards asking Muslims to choose between 'Pakistan or Qabristan' (Pakistan or the graveyard).\"\n\nSuch tactics divert from the country's deep poverty and rampant inequality. Some 800 million Indians depend on free food grains from the government. These food packages pre-dated the Modi government but during the Covid pandemic Modi made them free. He extended the programme for five years during the run-up to the election\n\nTypically families receive 25kg of free rice and wheat a month. People top that up with work that pays as little as \u00a32 a day for 12 hours' labour, such as in road construction or in soya bean fields.\n\nFamilies go through extreme hardship to send one of their children to university. But according to recent studies, 42 percent of graduates have been unable to find a job,\n\nMeanwhile, at the other end of the scale last year, there were 200 Indians on the Forbes billionaires list -- the most ever.\n\nModi survives partly because the Congress Party, the principal opposition force, is totally ineffective. Congress was once the preferred party of the Indian ruling class. It ruled for most of the country's post-independence years.\n\nIt made some promises during the election to help farmers, extend health care, loosen anti-union laws and increase the lowest wages. It also attacked Modi and his close ties to India's two wealthiest billionaires, Mukesh Ambani and Gautam Adani.\n\nBut its manifesto said \"the most immediate objective\" of a Congress Party-led government \"will be to restore a healthy, fearless and trustworthy climate for businesses\". It went on, \"We will conduct a comprehensive review of the current rules and regulations and repeal or amend them in order to restore freedom to industry, business and trade.\"\n\nWhen it headed the government, Congress was just such a pro-corporate government.\n\nWestern imperialism pretends not to see Modi's repression. Leaders in Britain and the US will congratulate him if he wins because they see him as a partner in ramping up confrontation with China.\n\nThe hope to unify workers and the poor and to defeat Modi comes in a united struggle from below. Farmers have repeatedly fought Modi using the most militant methods -- and sometimes won. Two years ago up to 200 million people joined a two-day strike over privatisation.\n\nSuch actions have to move from being one-off tokens to a consistent strategy of resistance.", "source": {"uri":

THE Indian the capital is in the grip of a terrible heat wave and a serious water shortage.\n\nLarge parts of the country experience extreme temperatures for days. But climate change was barely mentioned during the entire 44-day, seven-phase voting process.\n\nLast weekend, while the Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi While enjoying his post-election meditation at a cool coastal temple, more than 50 people - including 33 election workers - died from heatstroke.\n\nAlthough the heat is thought to have contributed to a drop in turnout in some constituencies, more than half a billion people still had their say. This represents a little more than half of the 970 million registered voters.\n\nExit polls suggest Mr Modi and his Hindu nationalist party, the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), have secured a third term.\n\nThese polls have been found to be inaccurate in the past and, on this occasion, some resulted in certain parties winning more seats than they contested.\n\nHowever, if the predictions prove even close to accurate, Mr. Modi will owe his victory to a slick campaign that presented him as the embodiment of India.\n\nHis rousing rally speeches sounded more like sermons, and his party spent billions on social media and an army of influencers to amplify his cult persona.\n\nWe watched Harish Burnwal broadcast to his subscribers on YouTube. His channel has almost a million subscribers and there is no doubt that Mr Modi has won a new majority.\n\nHe said messages were pouring in during his live broadcasts and they were full of support for the Prime Minister.\n\nMr. Burnwal described Mr. Modi as having an \"aura\" and said he had received feedback from around the world that showed the global Indian community was also supporting him to win.\n\nThis is not necessarily true for Indian Muslims. Those we met at Monday prayers in Delhi were hoping the exit polls were wrong.\n\nDuring Mr. Modi's first decade in power, Muslims were subjected to violence and treated as second-class citizens.\n\nIn his election speeches, the Prime Minister described Muslims as \"infiltrators\" who have \"many children\". He even called the vote for the opposition Congress party a vote for jihad.\n\nSuch Islamophobic This rhetoric came as no surprise to author Ziya Us Salam, whose latest book is titled Being Muslim in Hindu India.\n\nHe and his family have faced abuse because of their faith, and he says many Muslims have started changing what they wear and how long they keep their beards, so as not to stand out.\n\nHe told me that all faiths and minority communities could see life become more difficult during a third term of Mr Modi.\n\nSuddenly, in neighborhoods where people of multiple faiths have lived in harmony, the seeds of discord are sown.\n\nHe believes they are fighting to save the Indian Constitution and the secular society it guarantees.\n\nThis is the longest and hottest election in Indian history, and the outcome could prove to be one of the most controversial.\n\nWe have heard many words used to describe Mr. Modi. For some he is a deity, for others a dictator. We will soon know if most Indians still want to call him their prime minister.\n\nOpposition parties still believe they may have done enough to prevent Mr. Modi from securing the majority he would need to expand his autocratic agenda.\n\nThe fate of 1.4 billion people and India's founding freedoms rest on Tuesday's outcome.", "source": {"uri": "exbulletin.com", "dataType": "news", "title":

Or so claims nearly every exit poll released since the end of voting on Saturday evening. Yet, these surveys have proved spectacularly wrong in the past, and they must be read even more cautiously this time around because of the Modi government's outsize sway on the television stations that commission them.\n\nMind you, the actual count today may well give enough seats to the Bharatiya Janata Party-led National Democratic Alliance for it to stake a claim for a third straight five-year term. But 350-plus NDA lawmakers in a 543-member parliament, as predicted by nearly every exit poll, sounds like an unrealistically large mandate. It ought to be taken with a pinch of salt by investors intending to join the stock rally that's almost certain to take off.\n\nA 350-seat haul will be a repeat of NDA's 2019 performance. Back then, Mr Modi had turned airstrikes on a terrorist training camp in Pakistan into the central plank of his reelection bid. This time, however, national security was not an election issue. Yes, Mr Modi did consecrate a controversial Hindu temple to expand his vote base. But that project was done and dusted by January. In 2024, the right-wing leader turned his muscularity inward: Muslims, the biggest religious minority, faced nonstop dog whistles and complained of large-scale voter suppression.\n\nHowever, such tactics are unlikely to have led to a dramatic consolidation of Hindu votes, not when the opposition INDIA alliance ran a spirited campaign focused on surging youth unemployment, high cost of living, and rampant crony capitalism. Mr Modi chose to elevate himself above such earthly concerns. \"I'm convinced that God has sent me,\" he told a TV channel owned by tycoon Mukesh Ambani. In another interview -- to a station controlled by Gautam Adani, the centi-billionaire from his home state of Gujarat -- Mr Modi spoke of his 1,000-year vision.\n\nMr Ambani and Mr Adani are Asia's richest businessmen. The Adani Group's market value has soared by US$25 billion since polling began in phases on April 19.\n\nA generous mandate for the NDA is a ringing endorsement of Mr Modi, such is the Indian prime minister's personality cult. And if that is really the outcome, then it means the welfare benefits that a big section of the population already receives -- free food, cooking-gas subsidy, some cash for small farmers, and handouts for constructing village homes and toilets -- are preferred by voters to any alternative based on new rights, such as the urban employment guarantee or expansion of affirmative action proposed by the Congress Party.\n\nThis is good news for markets. Investors reckon that while Mr Modi's social policies may be deeply polarising, his fiscal stance will be conservative, which will help India attract capital away from China. A massive ramp-up is expected in infrastructure and private capital expenditure under Modi 3.0, despite constrained mass consumption and inadequate household savings.\n\nThe opposition grouping, however, believes that the people's real preferences are very different, and that the exit polls are nothing but psychological warfare. If so, it is working. Rahul Gandhi's Congress first decided to boycott discussions of exit polls, and then did a U-turn.\n\nThe anti-Modi coalition of more than two dozen parties has proved surprisingly resilient despite not having a prime ministerial candidate yet. The absence of an alternative leader may have dissuaded voters who wanted to see a credible challenger.\n\nWith several of its prominent leaders in jail ahead of the elections and the taxman freezing bank accounts of the Congress Party, the alliance fought hard -- both on the ground and on social media. For a government that has already enjoyed a decade in power to return with its majority intact will leave political opposition dispirited and irrelevant. It may not be able to keep the flock together for another five years. Muddying the picture still further, the less-than-transparent conduct of the Election Commission has also come under a cloud.\n\nAs has the partisan role of media moguls, though not exactly for the first time. The 2004 exit polls were also wrong. They gave the ruling NDA coalition between 240 to 275 seats in a fresh election. It ended up with 187, and the government was booted out. What makes this year's surveys highly unusual is that at least three of them are projecting the NDA to snag as many as 400 seats, a forecast that happens to match the slogan given by Home Minister Amit Shah, Mr Modi's No 2.\n\nAlthough Mr Modi has denied any such plans, INDIA alliance leaders have warned that 400 seats for the Modi government may mean a change in the country's secular constitution. Irrespective of whether they have some signal value or are pure noise, the exit polls have at least put the idea of an eventual Hindu state into play.\u2009Bloomberg\n\nAndy Mukherjee is a Bloomberg Opinion columnist covering industrial companies and financial services in Asia.

Final results are expected early Wednesday.\n\nAs of Tuesday evening, Modi's Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) was leading in 240 seats, short of the 272 needed to form a government in the 543-seat lower house -- and well behind the 303 seats it won in the 2019 election.\n\nThe Congress-led opposition bloc, known as the Indian National Developmental Inclusive Alliance (INDIA), was on course to win 229 seats, the results showed.\n\nIndian stock markets plunged across the board on Tuesday, posting their worst session in more than four years, as voting trends showed the National Democratic Alliance (NDA) headed by Modi's party would fall well short of a predicted landslide victory.\n\nModi had set a target of more than 400 seats for the Alliance, but as of Tuesday evening it was leading in only about 290, according to Election Commission data about three-quarters of the way through the count.\n\nThe NSE Nifty 50 share index sank 5.9% and the S&P BSE Sensex tumbled 5.7%, posting their steepest decline on an election outcome day since 2004.\n\nThe stock market rout came after blue-chip indices surged to record highs on Monday as exit polls had projected a much bigger margin of victory for Modi.\n\nThe damage was widespread: 12 of the 13 major indices ended the day lower, while the more domestically focussed small-cap and mid-cap indexes sank 8%.\n\nState-run companies plunged 16.4% and energy stocks sank 12.5% to record their worst day ever. Finance stocks retreated 7.9%, infrastructure sank 10.2% and realty plunged 9%, with the trio recording their worst sessions since March 2020.\n\nWhile Modi will win a rare third term in office, a smaller-than-expected mandate means he will have to lean more on his allies for support, and that means urgently addressing issues like unemployment, inflation and economic disparities in the world's most populous nation.\n\n\"The BJP's reliance on allies to form the government is a slap in the face,\" said Milan Vaishnav at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace in Washington.\n\n\"At this stage, NDA allies will extract their pound of flesh, which will have an impact not just in terms of policymaking but also in terms of the composition of the cabinet. (Earlier) the BJP could dictate terms with very little regard for its coalition partners.\" (Story continues below)\n\nHow will the strongman cope?\n\nModi, a strongman leader by nature, has not had to rely on alliance partners in the past and it was not clear how easily he would cope.\n\n\"Modi is not known as a consensual figure,\" said New Delhi-based political commentator Arathi Jerath. \"So, it will be very interesting to see how he manages the pulls and pressures of a coalition government.\"\n\nPopulism and welfare policies will \"gain currency\" as Modi will have to depend on regional leaders like N Chandrababu Naidu in the southern state of Andhra Pradesh and Nitish Kumar in Bihar in the east, who support such policies, said political analyst Rasheed Kidwai.\n\nModi called the win for his alliance historic and said that \"we will continue the good work done in the last decade to keep fulfilling the aspirations of people\".\n\nThe BJP, which had campaigned on India's spectacular economic expansion, its growing international stature and the party's Hindu-first agenda, has acknowledged unemployment was a factor in the election.\n\n\"Employment is a challenge that we also accept and whatever best can be done is being done,\" spokesperson Gopal Krishna Agarwal said.\n\nThe unemployment rate in India rose to 8.1% in April from 7.4% in March, according to the private think-tank Centre for Monitoring Indian Economy, compared with around 6% before the Covid-19 pandemic.\n\nModi first came to power in 2014 on the promise of creating 20 million jobs a year, but has fallen far short of that.\n\nDespite India's impressive economic growth of more than 8%, rural distress has increased as incomes have fallen amid rising food prices.\n\nSuch economic growth has meant wealth is concentrated in the richest 1% of India's population.\n\nOpposition attempts to woo the masses with promises of affirmative action, bigger handouts and more jobs were gaining traction during the campaign, analysts said.\n\nThat forced Modi to change tack, they added.\n\nHaving earlier focused on economic development, he switched back to accusing the opposition of favouring minority Muslims at the cost of Hindus.\n\n\"I believe that the polarising campaign that the prime minister ran this time, the ... hyped-up media outreach that he did, I think these were all signs that he was worried,\" said political commentator Arati Jerath.\n\n\"Modi has seemingly lost his aura of electoral invincibility,\" said Michael Kugelman, director of the Washington-based South Asia Institute.\n\n\"He remains highly popular, and his party likely would have done even worse if he weren't leading it.\".", "source": {"uri": "bangkokpost.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Bangkok Post"}, "authors": [],

His charisma, combined with an emphasis on infrastructure development, welfare payments to the poorest and a polarising Hindu nationalism, looked unbeatable. Mr Modi exuded a confidence that matched those predictions. He claimed that his Bharatiya Janata Party () and its allies would win upwards of 400 seats in the 543-seat parliament.\n\nEarly results from the vote count on June 4th appeared to put that target out of reach. After more than 50% of the votes had been counted, Mr Modi's alliance still looked headed for victory, with the and its allies ahead in 290 seats, compared with the opposition's 235. Yet the itself appeared to be on course to lose more than 60 seats compared with the last election in 2019, with results mid-afternoon putting its tally at 238, down from 303 in 2019. Crucially, that means that it will rely on its alliance partners to control parliament (272 seats are needed for a majority). Final results are expected late on Tuesday or early on Wednesday. The spectacle of the Modi machine faltering has shocked the public, the political world and financial markets: the country's benchmark share index fell by 6%.\n\nThe electoral surprise follows a deeply divisive campaign. From the start, opposition politicians and other critics had bemoaned the lack of a level playing field in the election. Opposition politicians were jailed on corruption charges that they called politically motivated. Congress, the main opposition party, said its bank accounts were frozen, hindering campaigning. Meanwhile Mr Modi used at times stridently anti-Muslim campaign rhetoric. All of this may have been motivated by worries about diminishing support for the .\n\nThe biggest upset may turn out to be the giant northern state of Uttar Pradesh () in the 's Hindi-speaking heartland. In 2019 the won 62 of the state's 80 seats. This time, early results suggested that tally fell to 35, with a vote swing of 9% away from the and its allies. Thirty-five seats are expected to go to the left-wing Samajwadi Party, which is a member of the opposition alliance and focused on the rights of lower-caste groups and religious minorities. The constituencies lost by the include Faizabad, home to the city of Ayodhya, where Mr Modi inaugurated a large new Hindu temple in January. The temple occupies the spot where a mob of Hindu nationalists demolished an ancient mosque in 1992.\n\nThe also suffered large losses in Rajasthan and in Maharashtra, a rich industrial state in the west that is home to Mumbai, India's business capital. The seats it lost there mostly went to Congress, which looked on course to nearly double its national seat count to 99, compared with 52 in 2019.\n\nWhat went wrong for the ? Its overall vote share across India actually increased, from 36.7% in 2019 to around 39% this year. The party also managed to make some small gains in the south and east, where it had not previously been able to make inroads. Yet its losses in critical areas like mean that its power in parliament is set to plummet. A sense that the economy is not delivering for ordinary people may have been a big factor: despite strong growth figures, voters cited inflation and unemployment as concerns. The upset in and Rajasthan may reflect worries among members of lower castes that the might roll back affirmative-action policies. The opposition had tapped into such fears, emphasising Mr Modi's closeness to oligarchs and claiming that the might remove constitutional protections for lower-caste groups and religious minorities. Critically the prime minister's once all-powerful personal appeal has dimmed and has been unable to make up for these concerns.\n\nFor India three big questions now loom. First, can the form a stable government? The answer is, probably. The will still be by far the biggest party in parliament, with more than twice as many seats as the Congress. Unless there is a major rebellion within the party, Mr Modi is likely to be able to continue as prime minister. He will have to strike deals with two of his alliance partners, Telugu Desam and Janata Dal (United), two regional parties from the southern state of Andhra Pradesh and the eastern state of Bihar, respectively. Their leaders, Chandrababu Naidu and Nitish Kumar, will now emerge as kingmakers and attempt to extract favours from the on appointments, benefits for their states and policy. Both are already being courted by the opposition alliance. Mr Kumar, in particular, is notorious for switching sides, presenting a particular risk. Yet given the 's deep pockets, Mr Modi may also be able to entice parties away from the opposition to shore up his alliance.\n\nThe second question is how, once it is formed, that government might operate. Mr Modi's favoured style is strong-man executive rule with little debate in the cabinet or parliament. Now he will have to negotiate and make compromises. That will complicate policymaking, particularly a 100-day agenda that was expected to implement a currently stalled set of labour reforms and revamp policies intended to boost the manufacturing industry, including the government's flagship industrial-subsidy scheme. Mr Modi may now feel he needs to pay more attention to the immediate economic needs of groups whose votes his party failed to win by unleashing a new wave of welfare schemes. A fear of less predictable policymaking, fewer reforms and a welfare splurge explains the stockmarket fall.\n\nThe final question is how the surprise result changes India in the long run. The idea of Mr Modi ruling for another ten years is now far less likely given his personal brand has dimmed, with the result that the succession question will loom large. While short-term economic policy making may deteriorate, over time a more open style of politics could be helpful. Many of the changes most needed by India's economy -- including reforms to land acquisition, the power sector and agriculture -- require co-operation with state governments and politically important social groups like farmers. India's reforms in the early-1990s and 2000s were made by coalition governments.\n\nThere is a danger that the disappointed leader may choose to double down on his more authoritarian tendencies and amplify his polarising religious rhetoric. All the same the fear that India might inexorably evolve towards a more autocratic form of government has receded: the has failed to win enough seats to ram through constitutional changes; the opposition parties have been given a new lease of life; and debate and dissent will be reinvigorated. That may be the most lasting consequence of the 2024 general election. \u25a0", "source": {"uri": "economist.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Economist"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

Most pollsters said voters were not vocal about their electoral preference and expressed their disdain for the political system, a reason for polling percentage in 2024 being about three percentage points less than in 2019. But Modi, as it turns out, remained their first choice.\n\nIf the exit poll results are true, we can come to three easy conclusions.\n\nFirst, there is no other leader in India who can match Modi's popularity and his ability to influence and sway popular imagination. The party worked in tandem: The BJP was always geared up to quickly build a narrative on issues raised by Modi in speeches and interviews, giving little time to the opposition to counterattack.\n\nNo opposition leader can match Modi's energy for campaigning as he addressed more rallies and gave interviews compared to what Congress president, Mallikarjun Kharge, and Congress leader Rahul Gandhi did together.\n\nOn some days, the Modi held up to four election rallies and then a road show in sweltering heat. This was also a reflection of the BJP's superior financial heft and better manpower management ability compared to the opposition.\n\nDespite holding over 220 rallies, Modi continuously came up with new barbs targeting the opposition and his team clearly had a better strategy on building narratives.\n\nBe it the old issue of the Katchatheevu Island off the Tamil Nadu coast being handed over to Sri Lanka to wealth redistribution to inheritance tax, the Modi-led BJP was ahead of the opposition in building political narratives.\n\nSecond, the BJP's bid to polarise the elections on religious lines claiming that the opposition parties were framing policies for \"appeasement\" politics seems to have had an impact across the country. The BJP was able to create chatter over its unsubstantiated claim that the Congress plans to take away assets from Hindus and give them to Muslims, even though the latter did not make any such claim either in its manifesto or in speeches given by the party's leaders.\n\nModi expectedly took credit for building Ram temple in Ayodhya and showcased himself as a guardian of the Hindu religion and Sanathan Dharma, while branding the opposition as anti-Hindu and pro-Muslim. The BJP was also able to create antagonism for the Congress' secular politics, saying it was pro-Muslim and anti-Hindu.\n\nThird, it appears that voters were swayed by the BJP's claims that Modi has improved India's global position and world leaders listened to Modi like no other PM in the country's history. Attempts to decimate India's first prime minister Jawaharlal Nehru's legacy aided the BJP to showcase Modi as a better PM than him.\n\nFrom bringing back Indian students from Ukraine to conducting the G20 summit in New Delhi to Modi receiving awards from some international organisations helped the BJP to create a narrative that India had emerged as a global power. Building that narrative was well planned and delivered by the BJP to its voters through lakhs of WhatsApp channels.\n\nThe exit poll results, if true, clearly show that development politics have taken a backseat and religion-based politics directed at one community has mainstreamed. People now tend to vote more on religion-based issues such as Hindu pride and anti-Muslim propaganda than on well-thought-out road maps to develop the nation. Religion-based politics has clearly bridged the caste divide for the BJP. To top it, the opposition has failed to dent Modi's popularity.", "source": {"uri": "hindustantimes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Hindustan Times"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

The BJP alone could win around 327 seats, although this figure is lower than the target it has set for itself.\n\nIndia has a population of 1.4 billion and 970 million people were eligible to vote. Modi has placed Hindu supremacy and scapegoating of the country's 220 million Muslims at the center of his campaign.\n\nSushant Singh, a lecturer at Yale University, wrote that Modi had put a target on the backs of Indian Muslims. He diverted the anger of poor and marginalized Hindu communities away from crony capitalists and privileged upper castes.\n\nSome polls showed Modi's lead narrowed during the six weeks of election campaigning. Each time this happened, he increased the attacks against Muslims.\n\nRana Ayyub recently wrote in the Washington Post: In the last four months alone, Mumbai and neighboring cities in the state of Maharashtra have witnessed 50 anti-Muslim hate rallies.\n\nThousands of Hindus participated, often led and participated by BJP leaders. I have attended four such gatherings across western India.\n\nI saw large crowds, ranging from young children to octogenarians, marching through the streets, expressing Hindu akrosh (Hindu rage). They called for all terms used for Modis Muslims in India to be erased from the face of the country.\n\nI saw young women holding signs asking Muslims to choose between Pakistan or Qabristan (Pakistan or the cemetery).\n\nSuch tactics distract from the country's deep poverty and endemic inequality. Some 800 million Indians depend on free food grains provided by the government. These food parcels predated the Modi government, but during the Covid pandemic, Modi made them free. He extended the program for five years in the run-up to the elections.\n\nTypically, families receive 25 kg of free rice and wheat per month. People supplement this with work that pays only 2 per day for 12 hours of work, such as in road construction or in soybean fields.\n\nFamilies face extreme difficulty sending one of their children to college. But according to recent studies, 42 percent of graduates failed to find a job,\n\nMeanwhile, at the other end of the scale, last year there were 200 Indians on the Forbes list of billionaires, the most ever.\n\nModi survives in part because the Congress Party, the main opposition force, is completely ineffective. The Congress was once the preferred party of India's ruling class. He ruled for most of the years following the country's independence.\n\nHe made some promises during the election to help farmers, expand health care, relax anti-union laws and raise lower wages. He also attacked Modi and his close ties to India's two richest billionaires, Mukesh Ambani and Gautam Adani.\n\nBut his platform indicates that the most immediate goal of a Congress Party-led government will be to restore a healthy, courageous and trustworthy climate for business. He continued: We will conduct a comprehensive review of the current rules and regulations and repeal or amend them in order to restore freedom of industry, business and commerce.\n\nWhen running the government, Congress was exactly a pro-corporate government.\n\nWestern imperialism pretends not to see Modi's repression. British and American leaders will congratulate him if he wins, because they see him as a partner in escalating confrontation with China.\n\nThe hope of unifying workers and the poor and defeating Modi comes from a united struggle from below. Farmers have fought Modi repeatedly using the most militant methods and sometimes won. Two years ago, nearly 200 million people took part in a two-day strike against privatization.\n\nSuch actions must move from mere tokens to a coherent strategy of resistance.", "source": {"uri":

But he's lost face - or more specifically, dozens of seats and his outright majority, as millions of Indians desert his Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), angered by its nationalist propaganda, corruption and surging unemployment.\n\nThe serious setback, and revival of the opposition, may also curb Modi's bombast on the international stage.\n\nModi, 73, likes to present himself as Vishwaguru, or teacher to the world, thanks to crushing electoral mandates he's previously enjoyed in the world's most populous country - and democracy - with its 950 million registered voters.\n\nBut in a symbolic reversal of Modi's fortunes, the BJP on Tuesday conceded a constituency where the inauguration of a grand Hindu temple just months ago by the premier was seen as an event that would cement his legacy and another steam-rolling BJP victory.\n\nThe Hindu nationalist party also looks set for heavy losses in the bellwether northern state of Uttar Pradesh, as the opposition socialist Samajwadi Party and the Congress (or Indian National Congress) party fronted by Rahul Gandhi, 53, of the Nehru-Gandhi dynasty, raced ahead in more than half of its 80 seats.\n\nTwo regional allies in Modi's coalition, the Telugu Desam Party and Janata Dal (United), say they will still back him. So although Modi's party looks like it will fall short of a majority, the coalition will gain the 272-plus seats needed. The possibility of a Congress-led coalition looks remote.\n\nBut it's very different from the BJP claims that it would romp to another outright win.\n\nAccording to Chietigj Bajpaee, senior research fellow for South Asia at London's Chatham House think tank: \"Falling well short of its 370 seat target (400 with coalition partners) will make the BJP more beholden to coalition partners in the National Democratic Alliance that it leads. It is also likely to dent the Modi brand to some degree.\"\n\nDr Subir Sinha, director of the SOAS South Asia Institute in London, told : \"It will be very interesting to see how Modi reacts, when he has been used to big majorities. Domestically, large parts of his progamme - like labour forms - will be put on hold.\"\n\nHe adds: \"Internationally, a lot of his bluster was about the fact that he had a massive mandate from the world's biggest population. That was how he was pressing his claims for things like a permanent seat on the UN Security Council. This bluster was built on weak foundations, and these look even weaker now.\"\n\nBajpaee thinks Modi will still demonstrate bombast on the world stage, but agrees it will be constrained.\n\n\"The Modi government has projected an image of India as a rising and more confident power.\n\n\"Some of this relates to India's material accomplishments (e.g. India as world's fastest growing major economy). However, there is also an ideological angle as the Modi government pursues a more assertive foreign policy and seeks to promote India as a civilisational state. All of this will continue under a third term Modi government, although it will be constrained to a degree by its weaker mandate.\n\nUnder a politically weakened Modi, or less probably a coalition fronted by Rahul Gandhi, grandson of Indira Gandhi, India will remain a big player on the global stage. India's economy is expected to become the third largest in the world by the end of the decade\n\nHowever, the administration will likely face challenges abroad and at home as it seeks to keep its economy growing at around 7 per cent of gross domestic product per year. One black cloud for India, according to Gopal Nadadur, of the Atlantic Council's South Asia Center, could be the US and EU, ramping up protectionism. This would dampen manufacturing growth in India by limiting foreign direct investment and exports.\n\nIndia's geopolitically important but complex relations with Russia and China are unlikely to undergo any sudden changes. Russia remains a key strategic partner. India is dependent on Russian military hardware and raw materials, and this is underpinned by historical links - India's longstanding commitment to strategic autonomy in its foreign policy and the legacy of Indo-Soviet cooperation during the Cold War.\n\nBut Bajpaee thinks the India-Russia relationship will continue to undergo a \"managed decline as New Delhi deepens relations with the West and Moscow moves closer to Beijing\". He says that India \"increasingly appears to be the odd man out in forums where Russia and China play a prominent role, such as the Brics and SCO\", as India seeks to promote a more balanced worldview that is non-western but not anti-western, unlike Russia, China or Iran.\n\nBut India's relations with the West have not been without tensions. Recent allegations of Indian complicity in assassination plots in several countries have set alarm bells ringing in some western capitals. But India's growing economic might has seen many countries, including the US and UK, reluctant to criticise New Delhi.\n\nSinha notes, however, that India's international reputation in some western nations - notably the US, France and Germany - has already fallen sharply amid growing criticism of Modi's authoritarian tendencies.\n\nFabricated legal cases have been mounted against critics of the Modi government. Amnesty International halted its work in India in 2020 amid what it later called an \"incessant witch hunt\" by the government. Journalists have been harassed or sent to jail and India has slipped to 161st out of 180 countries in the World Press Freedom Index, just three spots above Russia.\n\nOne of the most resonant messages in Congress's election manifesto has been: \"We promise you freedom from fear\".\n\nGandhi, as the face of Congress (the party is led by family loyalist Mallikarjun Kharge), has suffered constant attacks and ridicule from Modi and BJP figures. But pundits think his moderate, secular message and ambitious stunts such as a nationwide march have won over many voters.\n\n\"I think Rahul Gandhi will get credit, not just for mobilisation, for his marches, but also for continuously clarifying the Congress's ideological pitch against the BJP,\" Rahul Verma, political analyst at the Centre for Policy Research think tank in New Delhi, told Reuters.\n\nIt looks like Modi will remain in power, with reduced political authority. Some in India have already suggested he might consider his position - and more moderate figures, such as his defence minister Rajnath Singh or his infrastructure minister Nitin Jairam Gadkari, to assume the reins.\n\n\"But that wouldn't be like Modi,\" says Sinha. \"He thinks he should be in power no matter what.\"", "source": {"uri": "inews.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "inews.co.uk"},

But with results still coming in on June 4, 2024, the party, led by Prime Minister Narendra Modi, looked to be heading to only a narrow parliamentary majority.\n\nThe BJP needs 272 seats to form a government on its own, failing which it will need the help of its coalition partners, the National Democratic Alliance.\n\nThe Conversation U.S. spoke with Sumit Ganguly, distinguished professor of political science and the Tagore chair in Indian Cultures and Civilizations at Indiana University, to understand more about the election results and what they mean for Indian democracy.\n\nThe BJP had talked about an overwhelming victory, but it seems it will not get a majority. How do you explain these results?\n\nPart of the answer lies in the Modi government's failure to realize that while economic benefits had been substantial, their distribution has been uneven. India has seen a growth in inequality and persistent unemployment both in rural and urban areas. Unemployment of those aged 20 to 24 years is at a high of 44.49%. And that is the overall national number; that data does not tell us that it may be much worse in certain regions.\n\nThe other explanation is that Modi's exploitation of historic Hindu-Muslim tensions seems to have run its natural course. You can beat the religious drum - and Modi did with rhetoric including calling Muslims \"infiltrators\" - but then the day-to-day issues of jobs, housing and other such necessities take over, and these are the things people care about the most.\n\nBJP made a miscalculation, in my analysis. It failed to realize that in a country where only 11.3% of children get adequate nutrition, Hindu pride cannot be eaten - ultimately, it's the price of potatoes and other essentials that matter.\n\nLet's talk about Uttar Pradesh, the northern Indian state with 80 parliamentary seats. It plays a crucial role in any national election, and Modi and his alliance are set to lose the state. What happened?\n\nIt's another example of the same miscalculation we are seeing nationally by the BJP. The chief minister of the state,Yogi Adityanath, saw himself as a firebrand Hindu nationalist leader and likely a successor of Modi.\n\nBut he, too, failed to take into account how his policies were playing out in the poorer segments of the state's population, who are mainly Muslims and those at the bottom of India's caste hierarchy.\n\nHe pursued grand infrastructure projects such as new highways and airports, and those might well have appealed to the middle class - but not to the poor.\n\nAdditionally, years of presiding over a state government that has used police power to suppress dissent, often those of the poor and marginalized, have taken their toll on Adityanath's support.\n\nWhat explains BJP's inroads into the southern state of Kerala, where it is on course to make history by winning a parliamentary seat for the first time?\n\nThe gains in the south are perplexing and will require more data on voting patterns for a more accurate analysis.\n\nHistorically, the BJP has not been able to make inroads into the southern states for a number of reasons. These include linguistic subnationalism owing to the hostility toward Hindi.\n\nThe other issue in the south is that the practice of Hinduism is quite different, including festivals and other regional traditions. The BJP's vision of Hinduism is based on the \"great tradition\" of northern India, which believes in the trinity of Brahma, Vishnu and Shiva as the creator, the sustainer and the destroyer gods.\n\nThe southern states are also engines of economic growth and end up subsidizing the poorer states of the north. As a consequence, there is resentment against the BJP, which has long had its political base in northern India.\n\nIn July 2023, 26 opposition parties formed a coalition called INDIA - the Indian National Developmental and Inclusive Alliance - to challenge the BJP in the election. Were they given a fair chance?\n\nNo, the playing field was far from level. The mass media has been mostly co-opted by the ruling BJP to advance its agenda. Apart from one or two regional newspapers, all the national dailies scrupulously avoid any criticism of the BJP, and the major television channels mostly act as cheerleaders of the government's policies.\n\nA number of intelligence agencies are alleged to have been used for blatantly partisan purposes against the opposition parties. Political leaders have been jailed on charges that may prove to be dubious. For example, Arvind Kejriwal, the highly popular chief minister of New Delhi, was charged with alleged improprieties in the allocation of liquor licenses and jailed just days after election dates were announced.\n\nDespite the electoral losses, Modi is expected to return as prime minister for a third term. Given that the BJP got just two seats in the 1984 elections, what factors led to the party's meteoric rise?\n\nThe BJP has built a solid organizational base across the country, unlike the Indian National Congress, the principal opposition party. And the Congress party has done little to revitalize its political foundations, which had eroded in the 1970s after then-Prime Minister Indira Gandhi imposed a state of emergency and a non-Congress government came into power for the first time.\n\nThe BJP has also appealed to the sentiments of the majority Hindu population through slogans that paint India's principal minority, Muslims, as the source of myriad societal problems. Hate crimes against Muslims and other minorities surged across India over the past few years.\n\nFinally, the BJP also benefited from economic reforms that the earlier Congress government had set in motion from the 1990s, including a national goods and services tax and the privatization of the loss-making, state-owned airline, Air India, thereby contributing to substantial economic growth in India.\n\nIn December 1992, Hindu nationalists destroyed the 16th-century Babri Mosque. How crucial was that to BJP's rise to power? And what should we read into BJP losing its seat in Ayodhya?\n\nThe destruction of the Babri Mosque certainly galvanized an important segment of the Hindu electorate and led to a growth in support for the BJP. In 1999 - just seven years after the event - the BJP first came to power in a coalition government in which it had 182 out of 543 seats in the Indian Parliament. Two national elections later, in 2004, Modi assumed office as the prime minister with a clear-cut majority of 282 seats.\n\nIn January 2024, just a few months before the election, Modi inaugurated a newly constructed temple in Ayodhya, the site of the Babri Mosque. It was a carefully stage-managed event with an eye on votes.\n\nHowever, BJP lost its seat in Ayodhya. It's possible that all the fanfare around the new temple appealed to people outside of Ayodhya - but not to the city's residents who continued to deal with waste mismanagement and other issues.\n\nWhat's next for Modi? And what do the results tell us about Indian democracy?\n\nIt's certainly possible that Modi will form the government with coalition partners. I believe that Modi, as an astute politician, will most likely learn from this setback and adapt his tactics to new realities.\n\nThe results might also be a useful corrective - the Indian voter has once again demonstrated that he or she might be willing to put up with some things but not others.\n\nIndian voters have demonstrated in the past that when they see democracy being threatened, they tend to punish leaders with autocratic tendencies. We saw this when the late Prime Minister Indira Gandhi suffered a crushing defeat in the elections in 1977. The elections followed a state of emergency that Gandhi had imposed on the country, suspending all civil liberties. Back then, it was India's poor who voted her out of power.\n\nThis time around, we might need to wait on additional electoral data about how particular caste and income groups voted.", "source":

Although exit polls will not be released until the final phase concludes on June 1, indications point towards a likely third consecutive term for Prime Minister Narendra Modi and his Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP)-led government.\n\nDespite expectations of a smooth victory for the BJP, the election has presented some unexpected challenges. Voter turnout has been lower than anticipated, with the first four phases recording a participation rate of 66.95 percent -- approximately one percent lower than in the 2019 election. The fifth phase saw the lowest turnout at 62.2 percent, although the sixth phase showed a slight increase to 63.37 percent. Factors such as hot weather and voter apathy have been cited as possible reasons for the decline, but it remains uncertain whether this will benefit the opposition or the BJP.\n\nThe marginal drop in turnout has caused concern within the BJP, leading its candidates, including Modi, to intensify their Hindu nationalist rhetoric. The party's Hindutva ideology has not found widespread resonance, particularly in southern India where the BJP does not control any state governments. During the campaign, several inflammatory statements were made, including a controversial remark by Modi suggesting that a Congress Party victory would lead to wealth redistribution among 'infiltrators' and communities with higher birth rates -- a veiled reference to India's Muslim population. Modi denied the implication, but his candidates further stoked tensions by accusing Congress of engaging in 'vote Jihad' against the BJP.\n\nThese developments highlight the BJP's struggle to maintain control over the political narrative and its anxiety about achieving its ambitious target of 370 seats (or 400 with coalition partners) in the 543-seat Lok Sabha (lower house of parliament). The BJP has framed the election as a national personality contest centered on Modi. However, local politics and economic issues have dominated the campaign across many states. Key concerns include youth unemployment, which accounts for over 80 percent of the country's unemployed, and high food price inflation despite overall headline inflation being under control.\n\nSome irregularities have been observed in the release of polling data, with delays and discrepancies between tentative numbers released on polling days and final official figures. Additionally, there have been sporadic instances of election-related violence, intimidation, corruption, and disinformation, much of which has spread through social media. Despite these issues, Indian democracy remains largely intact procedurally. Recent state elections have seen fewer recounts and complaints about vote rigging compared to previous contests.\n\nThe judiciary has also demonstrated its independence during this election cycle. In mid-February, the Supreme Court ruled that electoral bonds, a fundraising tool, are unconstitutional as they provide an unfair advantage to the ruling party. Earlier this month, the court granted interim bail to Arvind Kejriwal, leader of the Aam Admi Party, allowing him to campaign after his March arrest. These decisions show that checks and balances persist within India's institutions, even if they do not always favor the BJP.\n\nA surprising result similar to the 2004 general election, when the BJP-led government of then Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee was defeated, seems unlikely. The BJP is in a much stronger position now compared to 2004, while the opposition remains weak and fragmented. The Congress Party, once a dominant force, is now a shadow of its former self. The opposition coalition, known as INDIA (India National Developmental and Inclusive Alliance), has struggled with defections and a lack of consensus on seat-sharing arrangements in several states.\n\nThe key aspect to watch will be the margin of the BJP's victory. If the party secures more than the 272 seats needed to form a government but fewer than the 303 seats it currently holds, it will become more dependent on its coalition partners in the National Democratic Alliance. Even if the BJP surpasses its current seat count but falls short of its 370-seat target, it could still impact Modi's standing to some degree. Under such pressure, the BJP might become more entrenched in its ideological roots, especially due to influence from the Sangh Parivar, a group of Hindu nationalist organizations to which the BJP belongs.\n\nRegardless of the seat counts, the anticipated third term for Modi will likely continue to challenge India's secular framework. The government's Hindu nationalist agenda aims to erode the divide between state and religion, pushing to transform India into a 'Hindu Rashtra' (Hindu nation). This trajectory will maintain pressure on the country's secular credentials, shaping the future of India's political and social landscape.", "source": {"uri": "eurasiareview.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Eurasia Review"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bharatiya_Janata_Party", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Bharatiya Janata Party"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Narendra_Modi", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Narendra Modi"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voter_turnout", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Voter turnout"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/India", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "India"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2019_United_Kingdom_general_election", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "2019 United Kingdom general election"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exit_poll", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Exit poll"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ideology", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Ideology"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inflation", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Inflation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_India", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "South India"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muslims", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Muslims"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hindu_nationalism", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Hindu nationalism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hindutva", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Hindutva"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disinformation", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Disinformation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Birth_rate", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Birth rate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coalition_government", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Coalition government"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indian_National_Congress", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Indian National Congress"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lok_Sabha", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Lok Sabha"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parliament", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Parliament"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Corruption", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Corruption"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jihad", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Jihad"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lower_house", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Lower house"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unemployment", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Unemployment"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Congress", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United States Congress"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democracy", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Democracy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_media", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Social media"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sangh_Parivar", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Sangh Parivar"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atal_Bihari_Vajpayee", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Atal Bihari Vajpayee"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arvind_Kejriwal", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Arvind Kejriwal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aam_Aadmi_Party", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Aam Aadmi Party"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Entertainment/Party_Supplies", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Entertainment/Party Supplies", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Socialism", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Socialism", "wgt": 9}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Campaigns_and_Elections", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Campaigns and Elections", "wgt": 16}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Government_Operations", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Government Operations", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 99}], "image": "https://www.eurasiareview.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/a-217.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9616128", "eventUri": "eng-9616128", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-06-04", "textStart": 110, "textEnd": 116}, {"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-06-01", "textStart": 194, "textEnd": 200}], "sentiment": 0.04313725490196085, "wgt": 123, "relevance": 1}

(Earlier) the BJP could dictate terms with very little regard for its coalition partners.\"\n\nModi, a strong leader, has not had to rely on alliance partners in the past and it was not clear how easily he would cope.\n\n\"Modi is not known as a consensual figure,\" said New Delhi-based political commentator Arathi Jerath. \"So, it'll be very interesting to see how he manages the pulls and pressures of a coalition government.\"\n\nPopulism and welfare policies will \"gain currency\" as Modi will have to depend on regional leaders like N. Chandrababu Naidu in the southern state of Andhra Pradesh and Nitish Kumar in Bihar in the east, who support such policies, said political analyst Rasheed Kidwai.\n\nNaidu's Telugu Desam Party and Kumar's Janata Dal (United) said they would endorse Modi for prime minister.\n\nModi called the win for his alliance historic and said that \"we will continue the good work done in the last decade to keep fulfilling the aspirations of people\".\n\nThe BJP, which had campaigned on India's spectacular economic expansion, its growing international stature and the party's Hindu-first agenda, has acknowledged unemployment was a factor in the election.\n\n\"Employment is a challenge that we also accept and whatever best can be done is being done,\" spokesperson Gopal Krishna Agarwal said.\n\nThe unemployment rate in India rose to 8.1% in April from 7.4% in March, according to the private think-tank Centre for Monitoring Indian Economy, compared with around 6% before the COVID-19 pandemic. Modi first came to power in 2014 on the promise of creating 20 million jobs a year, but has fallen far short of that.\n\nGovernment estimates for the latest January-March quarter show that the urban unemployment rate in the 15-29 age group ticked higher to 17%, from 16.5% in the prior quarter.\n\nDespite India's impressive economic growth of more than 8%, rural distress has increased as incomes have fallen amid rising food prices.\n\nSuch economic growth has meant wealth is concentrated in the richest 1% of India's population.\n\nWhile headline inflation hovering around 5% is relatively low, food inflation of above 8% since November 2023 has hit the poor hard. Prices of vegetables and cereals have risen by double digits for most of the last year.\n\nTURNOUT TROUBLE\n\nModi was seeking one of India's biggest mandates in the six-week-long election after most opinion polls conducted before voting began had predicted a big victory for him, driven by his personal popularity, free cereal for the poor, new roads and bridges, and his courting of majority Hindus.\n\nBut a fall in voter turnout in the first stage of the seven- phase election worried the BJP, several party officials said. A pollster, who declined to be named citing private conversations, said he got calls from \"panicked\" BJP officials asking if \"something was going wrong. Why aren't people coming?\".\n\nAt the same time, some analysts told TV debates that opposition attempts to woo the masses with promises of affirmative action, bigger handouts and more jobs were gaining traction.\n\nThat is when Modi changed tack.\n\nHaving earlier focused on economic development, India's image and such issues, he switched back to accusing the opposition of favouring minority Muslims at the cost of Hindus.\n\n\"I believe that the polarising campaign that the prime minister ran this time, the kind of, you know, hyped-up media outreach that he did, I think these were all signs that he was worried,\" said political commentator Arati Jerath.\n\nThe BJP said Modi was their best bet to put their message across.\n\n\"We discussed internally how our work, economic development, India's global image and such things sometimes do not set the narrative,\" said spokesperson Agarwal.\n\n\"The politics is such that other things dictate the narrative, and the BJP must also respond accordingly. For our narrative to work, the prime minister is the best communicator.\"\n\nHowever, with the BJP falling short of a majority on its own, its promises like a uniform civil code for all religions, opposed by some Muslims, and simultaneous state and national elections, will likely be put on the back burner. They could be replaced by policies aimed at more bread-and-butter issues as its allies could demand.\n\n\"Modi has seemingly lost his aura of electoral invincibility,\" said Michael Kugelman, director of the Washington-based Wilson Center's South Asia Institute think tank.\n\n\"He remains highly popular, and his party likely would have done even worse if he weren\u00b4t leading it. This is a leader who has repeatedly bounced back from political and policy setbacks and retained large public mandates. With the results we're seeing today, that narrative of resilience has been dealt a big blow.\"\n\n(Reporting by Krishna N.

The Indian capital is in the grip of a punishing heatwave, and a critical water shortage.\n\nLarge parts of the country are enduring extreme temperatures for days on end. But climate change was barely mentioned during the entire 44-day, seven phase, voting process.\n\nOn the final weekend, while India Prime Minister Narendra Modi was enjoying his post-election meditation in a cool coastal temple, more than 50 people - including 33 election workers - died due to heatstroke.\n\nAlthough the heat is thought to have contributed to a lower turnout in some constituencies, more than half a billion people have still had their say. That's just over half of the 970 million registered voters.\n\nExit polls suggest Mr Modi and his Hindu nationalist party, the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), have secured a third term.\n\nThese polls have proved inaccurate in the past, and on this occasion, there were some which had certain parties winning more seats than they had contested.\n\nHowever, if the predictions are even close to correct, Mr Modi will owe his victory to a slick campaign which has presented him as the embodiment of India.\n\nHis rousing rally speeches were more like sermons, and his party has spent billions on social media and an army of influencers to amplify his cult persona.\n\nWe watched Harish Burnwal broadcasting to his followers on YouTube. His channel has almost a million subscribers, and he was in no doubt Mr Modi has won another majority.\n\nHe said messages flood in during his livestreams and they have been filled with support for the prime minister.\n\nMr Burnwal described Mr Modi as having an \"aura\", and said he has received comments from around the world which show the global Indian community is also backing him to win.\n\nThat is not necessarily true for Muslim Indians. Those we met at Monday prayer in Delhi were hoping the exit polls are wrong.\n\nDuring Mr Modi's first ten years in power, Muslims have been subjected to violence, and treated like second class citizens.\n\nIn election speeches the prime minister referred to Muslims as \"infiltrators\" who have \"many children\". He even described a vote for the opposition Congress party as ''vote jihad\".\n\nSuch Islamophobic rhetoric was no surprise for the author Ziya Us Salam, whose latest book is called 'Being Muslim in Hindu India'.\n\nHe and his family have been subjected to abuse because of their faith, and he says many Muslims have started changing what they wear and how long they keep their beards, in order not to stand out.\n\nHe told me all minority faiths and communities could find life becoming harder during a third term of Mr Modi.\n\nSuddenly in neighbourhoods where people of multiple faiths have lived in harmony, the seeds of discord are being sown.\n\nHe feels they are in a fight to save the Constitution of India and the secular society it guarantees.\n\nThis has been the longest and hottest election in India's history, and the result could prove to be one of the most divisive.\n\nWe've heard many words used to describe Mr Modi. To some he is a deity, to others a dictator. We will soon know whether most Indians still want to call him their prime minister.\n\nThe opposition parties still believe they might have done enough to prevent Mr Modi getting the majority he will need to extend his autocratic agenda.\n\nThe fate of 1.4 billion people and the founding freedoms of India rest on Tuesday's result.", "source": {"uri": "itv.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "ITV Hub"}, "authors": [{"uri": "debi_edward@itv.com", "name": "Debi Edward", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Narendra_Modi", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Narendra Modi"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/India", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "India"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muslims", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Muslims"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exit_poll", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Exit poll"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Water_scarcity", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Water scarcity"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_election", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "General election"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Temple", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Temple"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meditation", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Meditation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Climate_change", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Climate change"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Delhi", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Delhi"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Delhi"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hindu_nationalism", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Hindu nationalism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sermon", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Sermon"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bharatiya_Janata_Party", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Bharatiya Janata Party"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prime_minister", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Prime minister"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voter_turnout", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Voter turnout"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cult", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Cult"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/YouTube", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "YouTube"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_media", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Social media"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hindus", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Hindus"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Islam_in_India", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Islam in India"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constitution_of_India", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Constitution of India"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dictator", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Dictator"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deity", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Deity"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indian_National_Congress", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Indian National Congress"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Islamophobia", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Islamophobia"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jihad", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Jihad"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secularism", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Secularism"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Entertainment/Party_Supplies", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Entertainment/Party Supplies", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Campaigns_and_Elections", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Campaigns and Elections", "wgt": 16}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Children/Parties", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Children/Parties", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Online_Issues_Polls", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Online Issues Polls", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Home/Entertaining/Party_Planning", "label": "dmoz/Home/Entertaining/Party Planning", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 97}], "image": "https://images.ctfassets.net/pjshm78m9jt4/EspzZUmbe8rRECk8oLSVS/a55f5bdd690be19f3a0943ef7b5b383f/0306_MODI_AP.jpg?fm=jpg&fit=fill&w=1600&h=900&q=80", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9616128", "eventUri": "eng-9616128", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.1529411764705882, "wgt": 121, "relevance": 1}

Log in.\n\nThe opposition INDIA alliance, led by the centrist Congress party, is expected to make gains and is projected to win around 220 seats, the report said. In the Indian parliament, a party or coalition that wins 272 seats can form the government.\n\nThe final votes were cast on Saturday in the seventh phase of the election, which saw people in eight of India's 36 states and territories take their turns at the ballot.\n\nModi and the BJP had long been projected to win decisively. Exit polls, though sometimes inconsistent, showed the party extending its control of the lower house.\n\nModi had set a goal for his BJP-led alliance to secure 400 seats, up from about 350 won in 2019.\n\nThe incumbent was so assured of being reelected this year that he declared victory on social media three days before the official results were scheduled to be announced on Tuesday.\n\n\"I can say with confidence that the people of India have voted in record numbers to reelect the NDA government,\" he wrote on X.\n\nThe weekslong election involved a bitter feud between the BJP and its main opposition, the Congress Party.\n\nThe Congress Party has formed its own bloc with about 20 opposition groups to oust Modi, campaigning on promises to relieve the nation's unemployment woes. However, the new alliance is undermined by differences in ideologies and contested leadership.\n\nModi, a polarizing but popular leader, has spent much of the election blasting the Congress and its promised policies in controversial attacks. At one point, he accused the opposition of planning to take India's wealth and redistribute it to the Muslim minority.\n\nWhile not specifically criticizing Muslims in his rally speeches, he has used terms such as \"infiltrators\" that are widely believed to allude to the minority.\n\nHis party's ideology, Hindutva, promotes building a Hindu nation and has been criticized as a nationalist movement that foments hate speech and right-wing extremism.\n\nBJP's rivals have also accused the party of attempting to stifle opposition leaders.

They (BJP) don't say it openly but they have given enough subtle hints,\" said political analyst Sunita Aaron.\n\n\"The BJP manifesto mentioned only the Ram temple, but political parties can always change tracks.\"\n\n- 'Absolute power' -\n\nModi's third term could also likely see the \"divisive\" revision of electoral boundaries based on population.\n\nThat would likely mean a significant expansion of seats in northern states -- which the BJP considers its heartland -- reducing the overall parliamentary punch of opposition areas in the relatively less-populous south.\n\n\"It will be quite testing for the Indian union and the federal polity,\" Manivannan said, calling the proposal \"quite divisive\".\n\n\"The southern states won't take it lying down,\" Manivannan added. \"Absolute

We had also predicted that BJP will break all records and spread its wings to the southern and eastern states as well, notching a couple of seats even in states where it was so far almost non-existent.\n\nIn several OpEd articles that have been published in recent weeks, this author had stated that the narrative set by the Modi government for \"Abki Baar, Charsau Paar\" (This time, we will cross the tally of 400) will fall short by perhaps 15-20 seats only. We had also stated that the ruling BJP on its own will overshoot the performance it delivered in the 2019 elections and will cross the last tally of 303. Our prediction has been that NDA will notch about 370-385 and BJP will clock anywhere between 310-340. In 2019, the BJP had won 303 seats on its own, while its NDA partners had added another 50 to the tally.\n\nI quote from our published article - \"The overwhelming sentiment, at least for the time being, is for a BJP hat-trick, with Modi having reframed, redefined and reinterpreted all political discourses. Modi is a 'creative disruptor'. He speaks the language of 21st century 'Young India'. With an unmatched youth population in the country, more than two-third Indians being between the age group of 15 and 59, there is a huge \"demographic dividend\" which only Modi could reap because his story of 'rebooting India' is a powerful one. It is a story of myriad social welfare schemes benefitting millions in rural hinterland, progress in education, public health and sanitation, economic development as well as pacy advancements in science and technology.....\"\n\nThe exit polls have come as a shock to the YouTube media gang that had formed a Dissent Club against the Modi government and predicted a complete disaster for ruling BJP and was adamant that nothing could bring Modi to have a hat-trick. They had predicted a INDIA alliance government led by Gandhi family scion Rahul Gandhi as Prime Minister,\n\nTill the very last minute, Modi has continued to build his image of being a tireless and incorruptible karyakarta (worker) of the party. With his magnetic personality and powerful oratory, he has managed to woo the masses like never before. Modi weaves a powerful narrative which keeps the country first and individual interests later.\n\nThose who were predicting losses for BJP in the Hindi heartland were also basing their predictions on the basis of a lower turnout percentage, whereas a lower turnout has no impact on the final results. Let me give an example. For example in 2014, Delhi's voting percentage was 70%. In 2019, the voting percentage fell sharply to 60% but the result was the same. Both the times, BJP swept all seven seats in the national capital.\n\nIn fact, one question that gets asked very often is whether the image appeal of Modi to the voters across India is growing or shrinking. The verdict this time will set this dilemma to rest. I think the entire election has been carried on the shoulders of a single individual and that is Modi. There is no doubt that he continues to attract the huge gamut of women and youth voter base. His appeal has now gone to newer geographies where so far BJP had never opened its account and where it is expected that Modi charisma will work and they will clock a few seats.\n\nThe second important noteworthy point is about the increasing sense of a Hindu religious-political identity, which the party has carefully and consciously nurtured in the last ten years. Towards the fag end of the election, Modi himself went overboard to drive that narrative across to the majority Hindu community. The political assertion of a Hindu religious identity was so visible in the last 48 hours as Modi sat in meditation at the memorial of one of the most revered Indian saints of all times, Swami Vivekanand, thereby signifying the construction of an inclusive Hindu identity.\n\nThe consecration of the Shri Ram Mandir in January this year was a watershed moment and the correction of historical injustices meted out to the religious majority were also factors that drummed up huge support in favour of Modi. What is more, he managed to carry out the impossible by giving a sense of cultural and political representation to backward and Dalit sub-groups which had so far never aligned themselves with the BJP. Be it Ayodhya or Kashmir or Remembrances of Partition Horrors, Modi swayed the average Hindu like never before. Although the BJP has always believed that if the Hindus unite, they can make the minorities irrelevant, but it has been the charismatic personality and aggression of Modi that has made this possible as an electoral model and opportunity.", "source": {"uri": "eurasiareview.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Eurasia Review"}, "authors": [{"uri": "manoranjana_gupta@eurasiareview.com", "name":

And it's a very tightly controlled narrative with a tremendous spin machine to provide that aura.\n\nExcept his brother said the tea-selling story wasn't entirely accurate and that Modi, like the rest of their siblings, had simply been helping their father. So the truth is not clear.\n\nNonetheless, Indians were \"mesmerized\" by the story, seen as a \"backlash against nepotism, entitlement and dynastic politics,\" says political analyst Sanjay Jha.\n\n\"He continues to be given the benefit of the doubt; some even believe he can do evil. In the equation of perception, he is first among equals, giving him carte blanche to do whatever he wants. It's surreal.\"\n\nWhen did he take his first steps in politics?\n\nHis big turning point came when he was chosen as the chief minister of Gujarat state in 2001. He held the post for over a decade, transforming the state into an economic powerhouse and raising its profile public to run for the post of Prime Minister.\n\nHe was investigated in 2002 after a dispute between Hindu pilgrims and vendors at Godhra railway station escalated into violence amid allegations that a Muslim mob had set fire to a train .\n\nThe incident claimed the lives of 59 people and triggered large-scale riots across Modi's state. An overwhelming number of Muslims were killed and thousands of their homes and businesses were destroyed.\n\nModi and his administration were accused of being complicit in the violence and not doing enough to stop it, but India's Supreme Court cleared him. Modi has always denied these allegations and has never expressed remorse.\n\nHow did he achieve the status of God?\n\nEvery time Modi makes a public appearance, crowds of thousands gather to catch a glimpse of him.\n\nThe music, prayers and shouts of Modi's name ring out with decibels that make your eardrums ring. His face is printed on dozens of cutouts, posters and banners.\n\nThis is what it looks like when you have a 75% approval rating.\n\nOn social media, an army of more than 100,000 party activists are working tirelessly to spread Modi's message directly to his supporters.\n\nWhen did he first become the face of Hindu nationalism?\n\nModi was just eight years old when he joined the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS), an organization dedicated to making India a Hindu nation.\n\nNever hesitant to flaunt his religious identity, a trait most Indian politicians would shy away from, Modi wears it with pride.\n\n\"He presented himself as a Hindu leader who developed a certain sense of pride among his fellow Hindus,\" says Sushant Singh, a lecturer in political science at Yale University.\n\n\"Hindu nationalism has gained ground in society, with marginalization and victimization of Muslims and Christians.\"\n\nModi took center stage at the consecration of the controversial Ram temple in Ayodhya, built atop the ruins of a 16th-century mosque demolished by far-right mobs in 1992.\n\nHindus believe that Lord Ram was born exactly on the spot where the mosque was built in 1529.\n\nDid he keep his wife a secret?\n\nWhen he first entered politics, Modi presented himself as single, childless and married solely for the cause of building a stronger India.\n\nBut it later emerged he had a secret wife - a fact only revealed when he filed paperwork to run for prime minister in 2014.\n\nFollowing tradition, his family arranged a marriage when he was 18. Shortly after, he left home and the marriage was never consummated.\n\nHis wife, Jashodaben, was discovered living a middle-class life years later. She has never spoken publicly about Modi, except to question the government's decision to provide him with bodyguards.\n\n\"I have to cook for them... It's really chaotic when I travel, because I use public transportation and the guards follow me in an air-conditioned car.\"\n\nLearn more:\n\nIndia's 'gross inequalities' laid bare as hundreds wait for water\n\nMinority communities worried about Modi's third term\n\nAre his claims about economic success valid?\n\nModi never hesitates to boast of his economic achievements and emphasizes that they concern all Indian citizens.\n\nBut is he using religion and nationalism as a smokescreen to less rosy economic situation?\n\nWhile it is true that India has overtaken Britain to become the world's fifth largest economy, its GDP per capita remains dismal.\n\nUnemployment is a persistent problem and thousands of young men are risking their lives to seek a better future outside India. Indians constitute the third largest nationality in terms of illegal immigration to the United States.\n\nInequalities have reached a historic high, even more flagrant than under colonial Britain. According to a report by the Paris-based World Inequalities Lab, the richest 1% of India's population controls 40% of the country's wealth.\n\nIndia ranks 111th out of 125 countries in the Global Hunger Index (2023) report. The government, however, rejected the report's findings.\n\nIndia is home to more than a third of the world's malnourished children under five.\n\nLast year, Modi announced the extension of a free food ration program to 800 million Indians for the next five years.\n\nAccording to the government, more than 250,000 Indians have renounced their citizenship in 2022. If all is well, why are they leaving in such alarming numbers?\n\nIs he a threat to Indian democracy?\n\nDissent and demonstrations against Modi or the government were met with violent police repression.\n\nSince 2014, more than 20,700 NGOs - including international NGOs like Amnesty International and Oxfam - have had their permission to work in India revoked after allegedly violating strict foreign funding laws.\n\nModi has denied using state agencies to target his opponents.\n\nHis administration says India's democratic institutions are strong, pointing to high turnout in recent elections that gave Modi's party a clear mandate.\n\nHowever, Indian media discovered that corruption investigations involving 23 of the 25 opposition politicians were dropped after they defected to the BJP.\n\nIndian journalists have been beaten, threatened and paid off, and the country ranks 161st out of 180 countries for press freedom.\n\n\"Indian democracy has collapsed over the last decade,\" says Harsh Mander, a fierce critic of Modi, whose home and NGO have been repeatedly raided by federal agencies.\n\n\"Our judicial system has not been consistent in defending constitutional values and the media acts as supporters of the ruling government and spreads hatred against Muslim minorities.\"", "source": {"uri": "exbulletin.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "ExBulletin"},

And it's a very tightly controlled narrative with a formidable spin machine to provide that aura.\n\nExcept his brother has said this tea-selling story isn't entirely accurate, and that Modi, like the rest of their siblings, just helped their father. So the truth is unclear.\n\nNevertheless, Indians were \"mesmerised\" by the story as a \"backlash against nepotism, entitlement and dynastic politics\", political analyst Sanjay Jha says.\n\n\"They continue to give him the benefit of the doubt; some even believe he can do wrong. In the perception equation, he is first among equals, giving him carte blanche to do whatever he wishes. It is surreal.\"\n\nWhen did he get his first break in politics?\n\nHis big break came when he was chosen to be chief minister of the state of Gujarat in 2001. He held the role for more than a decade, transforming the state into an economic powerhouse and building his public profile to make a run for the premiership.\n\nHe came under scrutiny in 2002 after an argument between Hindu pilgrims and vendors at Godhra station erupted into violence amid allegations a Muslim mob set fire to a train.\n\nThe incident saw 59 people lose their lives and sparked large-scale riots across Modi's state. An overwhelming number of Muslims were killed and thousands of their homes and businesses were destroyed.\n\nModi and his administration were accused of being complicit in the violence and of not doing enough to stop it, but India's Supreme Court cleared him. Modi has always denied the allegations and has never expressed remorse.\n\nHow did he achieve god-like status?\n\nWhenever Modi makes a public appearance, crowds of thousands gather for a glimpse of him.\n\nMusic, prayers and shouts of Modi's name blare at decibels that make your eardrums ring. His face is printed on dozens of cut-outs, posters and banners.\n\nThis is what it's like when you have a reported 75% approval rating.\n\nOn social media, an army of more than 100,000 party workers strive tirelessly to spread Modi's message directly to his followers.\n\nWhen did he first become the face of Hindu nationalism?\n\nModi was just eight years old when he joined the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS), an organisation dedicated to making India a Hindu nation.\n\nNever shy of showing off his religious identity, a trait most Indians politicians would baulk at, Modi wears it with pride.\n\n\"He has portrayed himself as a Hindu leader who has built a certain sense of pride in fellow Hindus,\" says Sushant Singh, a lecturer in political science at Yale University.\n\n\"Hindu nationalism has gained ground in society, with a marginalisation and victimisation of Muslims and Christians.\"\n\nModi took centre stage in the consecration of the controversial Ram temple in Ayodhya, built atop the ruins of a 16th-century mosque that was torn down by right-wing mobs in 1992.\n\nHindus believe Lord Ram was born on the exact same spot where the mosque was built in 1529.\n\nDid he keep his wife a secret?\n\nWhen he first entered politics, Modi presented himself as single, childless and married only to the cause of building a stronger India.\n\nBut it later transpired he had a secret wife - a fact only revealed when he filled in the paperwork to run for prime minister in 2014.\n\nIn keeping with tradition, his family had arranged a marriage when he was 18. Soon afterwards he left home and the marriage was never consummated.\n\nHis wife, Jashodaben, was discovered living a middle class life years later. She has never spoken publicly about Modi except to question the government's decision to provide her with bodyguards.\n\n\"I have to cook for them... It gets really chaotic when I travel, because I use public transport and the guards follow me in an air-conditioned car.\"\n\nRead more:\n\nIndia's 'glaring inequalities' laid bare as hundreds wait for water\n\nMinority communities anxious about prospect of Modi's third term\n\nDo his claims of economic success stack up?\n\nModi is never shy of boasting about his economic achievements and emphasises they are for every citizen of India.\n\nBut does he use religion and nationalism as a smokescreen for a less rosy economic picture?\n\nWhile it's true that India has overtaken Britain as the fifth-largest economy in the world, its GDP per capita remains dismal.\n\nUnemployment is a persistent problem, and thousands of young men risk their lives to seek a better future outside India. Indians are the third-highest nationality when it comes to illegal migration into the United States.\n\nInequality is at a historic high, even more stark than under colonial Britain. According to a report by the Paris-based World Inequalities Lab, the top 1% of India's population controls 40% of the nation's wealth.\n\nIndia ranks 111th of the 125 nations in the Global Hunger Index (2023) report. The government, however, has rejected the report's findings.\n\nIndia is home to more than a third of the world's malnourished children under the age of five.\n\nLast year Modi announced the extension of a free food ration scheme to 800 million Indians for the next five years.\n\nAccording to the government, more than 250,000 Indians renounced their citizenship in 2022. If all is well, why are they leaving in such alarming numbers?\n\nIs he a threat to India's democracy?\n\nDissent and protests against Modi or the government have been met with violent police crackdowns.\n\nSince 2014, more than 20,700 NGOs - including international ones such as Amnesty International and Oxfam - have had their licences to work in India revoked after they allegedly violated strict foreign funding laws.\n\nModi has denied using state agencies to target his opponents.\n\nHis administration says India's democratic institutions are robust, pointing to high voter turnout in recent elections that have delivered Modi's party a clear mandate.\n\nHowever, Indian media have found corruption investigations involving 23 of 25 opposition politicians were shelved after they defected to the BJP.\n\nJournalists in India have been beaten, threatened and paid off, and the country ranks 161 out of 180 countries for press freedom.\n\n\"India's democracy in the last decade has collapsed quite substantially,\" says Harsh Mander, a fierce critic of Modi, whose home and NGO have been raided multiple times by federal agencies.\n\n\"Our judiciary has not been consistent in the defence of constitutional values and the media acts as cheerleaders of the ruling government and propagate hate against Muslim minorities.\"", "source": {"uri": "news.sky.com", "dataType": "news",

His Hindu nationalist Bharatiya Janata Party, or BJP, is still projected to finish in first place, securing Modi a third term in office, but the BJP may not win a legislative majority for the first time in over a decade. (Washington Post)\n\nIndia's lengthy voting period -- just over six weeks -- is a necessity for a country with such a large population and area, but it also lends itself to mixed signals emerging throughout the process. Before voting began, Modi set expectations high, repeating the slogan \"Ab ki baar, 400 paar,\" meaning the BJP and its allies were aiming to surpass 400 seats in the 543-member lower house of parliament.\n\nThat would have been a stunning majority, but at the time it was not unthinkable. Modi and his Hindu nationalist movement have been utterly dominant in Indian politics for the past decade. And in the lead-up to the vote, Modi's government cracked down on the opposition, jailing the chief ministers of two opposition-controlled states and freezing the bank account of the Indian National Congress, the country's main opposition party. Exit polls released over the weekend suggested that the BJP was indeed headed for a landslide win.\n\nBut as we wrote in the Daily Review a few weeks ago, there were also signs during the voting process that India's opposition was gaining momentum. Now, it appears that the most likely scenario coming out of the elections is a coalition government led by the BJP. That will leave Modi in power as PM while simultaneously serving as a rebuke of his time in office so far.\n\nIt will take some time to sort out the exact reasons for Modi's stumble and the opposition's resurgence, but in many ways the shift is simply part of the self-correcting nature of democracies. For supporters of India's democracy, that should be reassuring. Modi's time in office has seen significant democratic backsliding, most notably in the targeting of religious minorities, as well as crackdowns on dissent and press freedoms. But the opposition's performance in this election suggests that the integrity of India's electoral democracy remains sturdy.\n\nIt will also be reassuring to Modi's critics that his party will likely be forced into a coalition government. While that will lead to some more uncertainty in terms of government policies, it will also introduce more political constraints on Modi and the BJP's most illiberal tendencies. Most significantly, many of the BJP's allies, which the party will need to rely on for a parliamentary majority, are opposed to the Hindu nationalist agenda openly adopted by Modi and his party. The return to form of the previously moribund political opposition is also a good outcome for India, if not for Modi, offering a plurality of choice without which no democracy can survive.\n\nRead more: WPR's free Insight on India under Modi.\n\nMore than three and a half years after declaring bankruptcy, Zambia is on the verge of no longer being in default. The country's international bondholders will vote through a $13.4 billion debt restructuring today, making Zambia the first country to complete the G-20's Common Framework for Debt Treatments.\n\nEstablished in 2020, the Common Framework is aimed at addressing the global debt crisis via debt restructuring for low-income countries. Zambia has in many ways been a test case for the scheme, and the country's experience underscores that the Common Framework must still address many issues to be fit for purpose, as Layna Mosley laid out in 2022.\n\nSpanish and French farmers blocked roads along the border between the two countries yesterday, protesting against what they say is unfair competition from outside the EU. The protests come just days before European Parliament elections, which begin Thursday and continue through the weekend.\n\nEarlier this year, similar demonstrations swept across Europe, with farmers blocking motorways and capital cities to protest against environmental restrictions by the EU, in some cases for weeks at a time. As John Boyce wrote in March, EU leaders' uncharacteristic willingness to backtrack on key policies in response to the protests underscores growing fears that the populist far right will capitalize on farmers' anger in upcoming elections.\n\nSomalia plans to expel thousands of Ethiopian troops stationed in the country unless Addis Ababa reneges on a deal signed between Ethiopia and the breakaway Somali region of Somaliland earlier this year.

Become an Insider and start reading now. Have an account? Log in.\n\nThough India is still counting the votes in its 2024 general election, one unexpected trend is emerging: Modi's party is projected to lose its majority in Parliament. That's a big blow to Modi, whose party was long expected to win a full majority in Parliament.\n\nNow, he'll have to gather enough allies to form a government.\n\nThe BJP's main opposition party, the Indian National Congress, performed better than expected, according to preliminary results.\n\nThe Indian National Congress had set a goal to double its 52 seats in Parliament, and as of Tuesday afternoon, it had a lead in almost 100 seats, The New York Times reported. It was also leading in nearly 230 races, according to the Times.\n\nIn an election that saw record voter turnout -- with 642 million people voting, according to Al Jazeera, in the seven-phase process that began in April and ended on Saturday -- the surprise results indicate that voters' trust in the BJP is waning.\n\nThe BJP's Hindutva ideology promotes Hindu nationalism, which critics have accused of stoking anti-Muslim hate and right-wing extremism.\n\nModi has even accused the Congress party of plotting to redistribute India's wealth to the Muslim minority, BI previously reported. Modi has denied targeting the Muslim minority to win the favor of the Hindu majority, Reuters reported.\n\nThough Modi is still popular across India, some see him as an authoritarian leader, and his opponents called signs of his fading power a victory for democracy on Tuesday.\n\nThe president of the Congress, Mallikarjun Kharge, called the election a \"moral and political loss\" for Modi, adding that, \"This is public's victory and a win for democracy,\" PBS News Hour reported.\n\nRaghuram Rajan, the former Reserve Bank of India Governor, echoed Kharge's sentiment in a post on LinkedIn.\n\n\"The Indian voter has spoken,\" Rajan wrote. \"And what a wise decision! This is a win for Indian democracy and a win for the Indian economy.

They (BJP) don't say it openly but they have given enough subtle hints,\" said political analyst Sunita Aaron.\n\n\"The BJP manifesto mentioned only the Ram temple, but political parties can always change tracks.\"\n\nModi's third term could also likely see the \"divisive\" revision of electoral boundaries based on population.\n\nThat would likely mean a significant expansion of seats in northern states -- which the BJP considers its heartland -- reducing the overall parliamentary punch of opposition areas in the relatively less-populous south.\n\n\"It will be quite testing for the Indian union and the federal polity,\" Manivannan said, calling the proposal \"quite divisive\".\n\n\"The southern states won't take it lying down,\" Manivannan added. \"Absolute power demolishes

Some 642mn Indians cast their votes in the seven-phase, multi-week poll in the midst of a heatwave. The Bharatiya Janata party leader, Narendra Modi, announced on Tuesday, as expected, that he would come back for a third consecutive term -- the first such hat-trick since independence prime minister Jawaharlal Nehru. But he returns humbled.\n\nThe BJP is on course to lose its own outright majority, and with its allies it is set to take fewer seats in India's lower house than in 2019 -- well short of the resounding win exit polls had suggested. It leaves Modi weakened, and more beholden to coalition partners and the opposition. Businesses and investors were banking on continuity and a stronger majority. Stocks, bond prices and the rupee tumbled.\n\nThe surprise outcome could, however, prove to be supportive to the long-term development of the world's most populous nation and fastest-growing major economy. Indeed, if it encourages the hubristic, Hindu nationalist BJP to engage in more deliberative policymaking and enlivens Indian democracy, just when many feared it was flickering, it could strengthen the country's rise.\n\nWinning a historic third term shows Modi remains popular. Many Indians still approve of his decade-long leadership. Since his first term in 2014, road, rail and energy infrastructure has boomed across the country, India has created a digital welfare state and the nation's confidence on the world stage has grown. But, this vote shows that Indians want more from their government.\n\nDespite impressive reductions in poverty, income and wealth inequality is among the world's highest. Indians are worried about the lack of jobs and high inflation. The BJP must now address these grassroots issues -- alongside its grand vision to turn India into a developed country by 2047 -- if it wants to stay in power. Clearly, efforts to amplify Modi's chaiwala-turned-world-leader image, reinforce Hindu nationalism and heighten polarisation -- all evident during the campaign -- have produced diminishing returns at the ballot box.\n\nFor the BJP, the vote is also a wake-up call that it cannot block dissent and govern effectively. Over the past decade, the party and its supporters have muzzled the free press, intimidated opponents and discriminated against Muslims. Any fears that the BJP might amass a two-thirds majority, which would allow it to reform the constitution too, are now also allayed. The opposition, despite divisions, made gains, underlining the growing discontent.\n\nThe election result is likely to slow some of the BJP's economic reform agenda. But it is also an opportunity to fix underlying strains, which can put India's rise on firmer foundations. For that, the BJP will need to work with other parties to ensure India's growth is more inclusive. That means improving education, empowering more women to enter work and undertaking liberalising market reforms -- which ought to have support across the political spectrum.\n\nIf it wants to be more responsive to all voters' needs, the BJP must also reverse its democratic backsliding. That means encouraging, not hindering, independent media, stopping discrimination against Muslims and investing in credible national statistics. A more transparent and peaceful India only raises its investment appeal.\n\nA strong and democratic India matters, for its people -- and the world. The nation has one of the largest and youngest workforces, its consumers are already a major market, and multinationals consider India central to \"China plus one\" supply-chain strategies. Voters have also shown that its democracy is resilient. Over the next five years, a weakened Modi can still help turn India's vast economic potential into reality, but only if he takes the right message from these polls.", "source": {"uri": "ft.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Financial Times News"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bharatiya_Janata_Party", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Bharatiya Janata Party"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Narendra_Modi", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Narendra Modi"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/India", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "India"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democracy", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Democracy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hindu_nationalism", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Hindu nationalism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exit_poll", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Exit poll"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jawaharlal_Nehru", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Jawaharlal Nehru"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Independence", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Independence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coalition_government", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Coalition government"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rupee", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Rupee"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lower_house", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Lower house"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prime_minister", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Prime minister"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/G20", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "G20"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Distribution_of_wealth", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Distribution of wealth"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Welfare_state", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Welfare state"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grassroots", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Grassroots"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inflation", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Inflation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Developed_country", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Developed country"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poverty", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Poverty"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muslims", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Muslims"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Independent_politician", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Independent politician"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_backsliding", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Democratic backsliding"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chinese_economic_reform", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Chinese economic reform"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Political_spectrum", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Political spectrum"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Discrimination", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Discrimination"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supermajority", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Supermajority"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multinational_corporation", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Multinational corporation"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/China", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "China"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "China"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Economic", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Economic", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Campaigns_and_Elections", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Campaigns and Elections", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Democracy", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Democracy", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 75}], "image": "https://www.ft.com/__origami/service/image/v2/images/raw/https%3A%2F%2Fwww.ft.com%2F__origami%2Fservice%2Fimage%2Fv2%2Fimages%2Fraw%2Fhttps%253A%252F%252Fd1e00ek4ebabms.cloudfront.net%252Fproduction%252Fbf86e08d-9461-4d7a-aa9a-4b2209ea8707.jpg%3Fsource%3Dnext-article%26fit%3Dscale-down%26quality%3Dhighest%26width%3D700%26dpr%3D1?source=next-opengraph&fit=scale-down&width=900", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9616128", "eventUri": "eng-9616128", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1764705882352942, "wgt": 117, "relevance": 1}

There is keen interest among Indo-Trinidadians in the elections as obtained in interviews by this writer. Incumbent Prime Minister Narendra Modi is on the ballot for his third term. He is expected to win his seat of Varanasi by a landslide.\n\nVaranasi is home to some of India's holiest Hindu shrines. Thousands of Hindus from Trinidad visit the city annually, going back for the last 50 years. This writer polled constituents on Modi's performance. Modi has been the best parliamentary rep of his constituency since elections were first held in the early 1950s. In fact, he has been the best rep of all constituencies over the last decade. Modi is no stranger to Trinidad, having visited twice before he became chief minister of Gujarat (2002 till 2014) for Hindu and Ramayana conferences. He was to revisit Trinidad (and Guyana) in November 2018 following a G-20 summit in Argentina, but the trip was cancelled at the last minute because of the need to rush to Delhi for a political emergency.\n\nThis writer has been lobbying for a Modi visit to the Caribbean (Trinidad, Guyana) for a summit with Caribbean leaders. It is hoped that it will happen in 2025 or 2026, if Modi wins re-election. Since Trinidad, Guyana, Suriname hold elections in 2025 with incumbents preoccupied with re-election, a Modi visit is unlikely unless it takes place early 2025. The PM of T&T and other Caricom leaders should invite the Indian PM to strengthen relations with the region. India has been very generous, with all kinds of assistance from health to loans to infrastructure to technology, among other areas.\n\nWill Modi win re-election? Most opinion polls forecast a Modi victory. But the margin of victory is questioned. The incumbent BJP that Modi leads claims it will win 350 seats, and its NDA partners another 50, for a total of 400 of the 543 seats. Polls suggest substantially less. The opposition Congress party says it will win enough seats to form a coalition government with its alliance partners called the INDIA bloc. Some 272 seats are needed to form a government. BJP is likely to get more than that on its own. However, a lower turnout than in 2019 of some 8% has been a cause of concern among political analysts. There are 968 million voters on the roll, with turnout about 62%.\n\nIndian Trinbagonians have been keenly following the election campaign in India and are anxious about the outcome. Most want Modi and the BJP to win another term because of the major transformation of India under his ten-year tenure. Also, Modi has deepened relations with the Caribbean and Latin states, increasing developmental aid and scholarships for studies of Caribbean nations at Indian universities.\n\nBased on multiple visits last year and this year and informal polling with voters in various parts of the country, it is the view of this writer that BJP is projected to win over 300 seats. Several seats are expected to be close, especially in northern constituencies, and can go either way. The opposition has not presented itself as a strong alternative and lacks a likeable, credible leader who could pose a threat to Modi. The BJP is very strong in the north and will get an overwhelming majority of the seats in northern states and a small number of seats in the south where the opposition is very strong.\n\nUnlike Trinidad, a candidate can run for two seats but can only hold one if victorious in both, resigning the other. The de facto opposition leader Rahul Gandhi contested two seats and is likely to win both. Unlike in T&T, voters can reject all the candidates for a seat -- none of the above (or NOTA) is an option, and voting is electronic, with ballots cast in machines.

Initial exit polls predict a significant majority win for Prime Minister Narendra Modi, potentially granting him the mandate for crucial economic reforms. However, concerns about constitutional changes and artificial intelligence's role in the election process have emerged.\n\nIndia's general election , with nearly a billion eligible voters, ended on Saturday. Votes are to be counted on Tuesday and results will be known later that day.\n\nHere are some takeaways from the six-week election : * Prime Minister Narendra Modi is set to be re-elected with an even bigger majority, according to weekend exit polls. Most predicted a two thirds majority for his ruling alliance in the 534-member parliament, reflecting his dominance over the world's most populous nation.\n\nBut such surveys have a mixed record because of difficulties polling in a nation of 1.4 billion people. * If voters indeed hand Modi a rare third consecutive term, it will provide him the political capital to push through difficult economic reforms such as easier land acquisition and labour laws for businesses, as well as measures to modernise the vast but slowing farm sector.\n\n* A two thirds majority in parliament also opens the way for changes to India's constitution. Modi's critics fear his Hindu nationalist-led alliance will seek to undermine India's secular foundations. Modi has denied plans to change the constitution. * India's markets are set to cheer a thumping Modi victory, seeing it as the best hope for sustained economic growth, an investment spurt and reforms over the next five years. The S&P BSE Sensex and NSE Nifty 50 indices could gain between 1% and 2% on Monday on the exit polls, analysts said.\n\n* About 968 million people were eligible to vote in what officials described as the world's biggest democratic event, spread over seven phases since April. Voting machines were transported to remote corners of the vast nation by foot, helicopter and even camelback to ensure every voter was able to participate including a family of five in a Himalayan village that had a polling station of their own.\n\n* The staggered election also turned out to be one of the hottest, with temperatures of over 45 degrees Celsius (113 Fahrenheit) in some parts. Paramedics were on hand with oral hydration salts at polling stations in Delhi, where mist machines and water dispensers were also installed for voters. Overall turnout was lower than in previous elections, which officials and commentators attributed to the heat as well as apathy.\n\n* Artificial Intelligence and AI-generated deepfakes were used for the first time in an Indian election, with authorities struggling to track them. Two of India's A-lister Bollywood actors were seen criticizing Prime Minister Narendra Modi in fake videos and asking people to vote for the opposition Congress party, prompting a police investigation.\n\n(This story has not been edited by Devdiscourse staff and is auto-generated from a syndicated feed.)", "source": {"uri": "devdiscourse.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Devdiscourse"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exit_poll", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Exit poll"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_election", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "General election"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Narendra_Modi", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Narendra Modi"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/India", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "India"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chinese_economic_reform", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Chinese economic reform"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parliament", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Parliament"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Artificial intelligence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hindus", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Hindus"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constitution_of_India", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Constitution of India"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BSE_SENSEX", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "BSE SENSEX"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Stock_Exchange_of_India", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "National Stock Exchange of India"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secularism", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Secularism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economic_growth", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Economic growth"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constitution", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Constitution"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hindi_cinema", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Hindi cinema"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polling_station", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Polling station"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deepfake", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Deepfake"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Staggered_elections", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Staggered elections"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elections_in_India", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Elections in India"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voting_machine", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Voting machine"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indian_National_Congress", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Indian National Congress"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Himalayas", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Himalayas"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voter_turnout", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Voter turnout"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democracy", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Democracy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Delhi", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Delhi"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Delhi"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Science/Social_Sciences/Economics", "label": "dmoz/Science/Social Sciences/Economics", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Campaigns_and_Elections", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Campaigns and Elections", "wgt": 25}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Online_Issues_Polls", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Online Issues Polls", "wgt": 20}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Alternative_Political_Systems", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Alternative Political Systems", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 84}], "image": "https://www.devdiscourse.com/remote.axd?https://devdiscourse.blob.core.windows.net/imagegallery/27_05_2019_12_10_31_1940386.jpg?width=920&format=jpeg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9616128", "eventUri": "eng-9616128", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1137254901960785, "wgt": 116, "relevance": 1}

The outlets have denied those accusations.\n\nWhile observers had pointed to a number of economic issues that might hold the BJP back from a historic third win, analysts say the prime minister\u2019s overwhelming appeal appeared to have outweighed other concerns.\n\n\u201cModi\u2019s popularity has emerged as the biggest theme, despite issues like unemployment and inflation,\u201d said Yashwant Deshmukh, an independent political commentator and founder of research firm C-Voter.\n\n\u201cPeople expect Modi to be a better solution provider than Rahul Gandhi or any other opposition leader,\u201d he said. \u201cThere is a definite expectation about India\u2019s growth story in terms of the economy that has helped.\u201d\n\nIf Modi won a third term, he will equal the three-term record of prime minister of Jawaharlal Nehru, the country\u2019s leader from 1947 to 1964.\n\nRising costs of living and unemployment emerged as key issues in the election, but the discontent did not seem to have damaged Modi\u2019s image.\n\n\u201cWith the opposition running its strongest campaign since 2014, independent media on YouTube rising in popularity and unemployment continuing to be an important concern for voters, the opposition could rightly have expected to perform strongly,\u201d said Pratik Dattani, founder of London-based think tank Bridge India.\n\n\u201cBut it looks like discontent towards the government has not translated into the anger that might be required for voters to change their votes.\n\n\u201cThis was a referendum on Modi. So perhaps voters penalised the lack of a prime ministerial candidate in the opposition, viewing Modi as the best choice for prime minister,\u201d Dattani said.\n\nAfter 10 years of BJP rule, the party was expected to suffer from anti-incumbency bias. While such sentiments were pervasive when it came to members of parliament, the BJP likely triumphed by riding on Modi, Deshmukh says.\n\n\u201cPeople are hugely disappointed with sitting MPs, even with the BJP MPs, but for the sake of Modi they have voted them back,\u201d he said.\n\nExit polls indicated that the BJP has made significant inroads into southern India as well as eastern India, broadening its influence from its traditional Hindi-speaking heartlands in north, central and western India.\n\n\u201cIf the exit polls prediction turns out to be correct, then it means the emergence of the BJP as a nationwide party, no longer restricted to the Hindi heartland,\u201d said Nilanjan Mukhopadhyay, an independent political commentator.\n\n\u201cIt could also mean a great endorsement across the country for the idea of Hindutva (Hindu nation).\u201d\n\nThe BJP is set to gain in not only the state of Karnataka, where it has been the strongest in the southern region, but also in Telangana and Andhra Pradesh, according to exit polls.\n\nDeshmukh said the BJP\u2019s vote share is also expected to increase in the states of Kerala and Tamil Nadu, which had previously proved to be virtually uncrackable for the party.\n\nIn the eastern state of West Bengal, the BJP appears poised neck-to-neck with the influential Trinamool Congress regional party, Deshmukh said.Modi\u2019s legacy\n\nIt may be the last term in office for 73-year-old Modi, who was once a pariah in the western world because of religious riots that occurred while he was the chief minister of Gujarat in 2002 that led to the deaths of 1,000-2,000 people, mostly Muslims.\n\nBut thanks to India\u2019s economic growth, the country is increasingly being embraced internationally as a geopolitical counterbalance against China.\n\nOpposition members have warned that another term for Modi could severely damage India\u2019s secular and democratic traditions, arguing that the BJP\u2019s Hindu nationalist agenda has polarised the country.\n\n\u201cAnother term for Modi will move India away from democracy. Modi is battling the principles on which India was set up in 1947,\u201d said Kingshuk Nag, an author and independent political commentator, adding that Modi\u2019s grip on power is only likely to increase if he is elected again.\n\nObservers expect major businesses to benefit from a BJP win, although they believe industrial development will favour states like Gujarat and Maharashtra, where the ruling party is more popular, over others like West Bengal.\n\nStock market analysts are also optimistic about India\u2019s growth prospects if Modi\u2019s government returns, expecting a push for reforms to develop infrastructure and boost manufacturing growth.\n\n\u201cThis government has finally realised that manufacturing as a percentage of GDP has to go up. They have seen that in how China has done in the last 30-40 years,\u201d said Shekhar Sambhashivan, India equities investment director at investment management company Invesco.\n\n\u201cWhile the government says it wants it to be closer to about a quarter, even if we assume on a conservative basis, they would land up at 20 per cent of GDP,\u201d he said.\n\nThe BJP has said it wants India to become a fully developed nation by 2047, its 100th year of independence from British colonial rule. It also has the ambitious goal of increasing the size of the world\u2019s fifth-largest economy by about eight times to US$29 trillion by then, and increase the per capita income about seven fold to nearly US$18,000.\n\nThat vision appears to have appealed to sections of India\u2019s teeming middle class and the poor.\n\nIf Modi is successful in securing a third term, then he would establish a legacy that would be hard to match, Mukhopadhyay says.\n\n\u201cIt would be unprecedented. Nehru had the advantage of the legacy of the national movement against British rule to help him get elected. Compared to that, Modi has weathered the opposition without any such legacy.\u201d", "source": {"uri": "scmp.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "South China Morning Post"}, "authors": [], "concepts":

It also alienated the leadership of the ultra-right-wing Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS) or National Volunteer Corps, which founded the BJP in 1980 as its political wing, providing it with activists during the elections to gaslvanise voters.\n\n[ Modi's BJP party retains power in Indian state bordering China as exit polls predict emphatic win ]\n\nThe RSS imparts spiritual guidance to the BJP, and for decades its unvoiced writ has dominated the party's top leadership; anyone who defies it does so at their own cost, as Modi has now realised, with voter turnout falling.\n\nIn seven weeks of intense campaigning, Modi and Shah purposefully declined to either acknowledge or address voter concerns such as spiralling unemployment, especially among young people, the high cost of living and mounting inflation.\n\n[ Potential India-Pakistan war signalled as Modi's election rhetoric grows more worrying ]\n\nInstead, they focused on perpetuating the BJP's agenda of Hindutva or Hindu hegemony across India through numerous Islamophobic speeches. They targeted India's 200-odd million Muslims, comprising about 15 per cent of the country's population of 1.4 billion, referring pejoratively to them as infiltrators - or terrorists - which found limited resonation among the electorate.\n\nThe two leaders also spooked voters by pledging, if elected, to take India to war with neighbouring nuclear-rival Pakistan to recover a third of the disputed Himalayan territory of Kashmir. The BJP, Shah said last week, was not intimidated by Pakistan's nuclear weapons.\n\nModi also underestimated the 26-party opposition Indian National Developmental Inclusive Alliance (INDIA), which fought a cohesive campaign.\n\nPolitical commentators, meanwhile, say the implications of a politically weakened BJP as part of a coalition would have a positive effect on India's domestic politics as well as its social and religious dynamics. They also say a coalition would resurrect the effectiveness of parliamentary debate and scrutiny.\n\nThey anticipate that, to some extent, it could stem the march of the BJP's Hindu majoritarianism and the demolition of more mosques to build temples in their stead. It may well restrain Modi from exercising control over all aspects of governance and from imposing restrictions on press freedom, civil liberties and human rights activists.\n\nA weakened BJP could also slow the implementation of contentious measures such as the Citizenship Amendment Act which had previously triggered riots in which scores of people had died. Muslims were excluded from the Act which offered an amnesty to illegal immigrants from neighbouring countries.\n\n[ India election: Modi deploys anti-Muslim rhetoric ahead of latest round of voting ]\n\nBJP plans to introduce a Uniform Civil Code to replace India's religion-specific civil laws, which citizens claimed was aimed at curbing their religious practices, could also be deferred. The code dictates who a person can wed, how to end marriages and how to manage inheritances.\n\nAlthough BJP leaders were confident that Modi would emerge as India's prime minister for a record third term as head of a multiparty National Democratic Alliance, some party insiders hinted at the possibility of him being replaced, as he is widely considered too uncompromising to manage an alliance.",

Israel's military declares four more hostages dead\n\nIndia's 1.4 billion people are subject to a common criminal law, but rules on personal matters such as marriage, divorce and inheritance vary based on customary traditions.\n\nWomen's rights vary considerably depending on which code they fall under -- Hindu sons and daughters theoretically enjoy equal inheritance rights, while Muslim daughters are only entitled to a fraction of any male heir's inheritance.\n\nMany right-wing politicians, jurists and reformists have described these custom-based codes as regressive and have lobbied for a legal framework that would apply to all Indians equally.\n\nBut many communities, particularly Muslims, fear the new law would encroach on their religious laws and see it as an attack on their identity and against India's constitution.\n\nWith their fresh mandate, the BJP is also likely to see calls from Hindu activists to take more religious sites from Muslims.\n\nThe calls have grown louder since Modi inaugurated a grand temple to the deity Ram in January, built on the grounds of a centuries-old mosque in Ayodhya razed by Hindu zealots in 1992.\n\nOther locations across India's north include Mathura and Varanasi, where activists have sought to replace centuries-old Islamic monuments with Hindu temples.\n\n\"This is definitely going to be an issue in the coming years. They (BJP) don't say it openly but they have given enough subtle hints,\" said political analyst Sunita Aaron.\n\n\"The BJP manifesto mentioned only the Ram temple, but political parties can always change tracks.\"\n\n- 'Absolute power' -\n\nModi's third term could also likely see the \"divisive\" revision of electoral boundaries based on population.\n\nThat would likely mean a significant expansion of seats in northern states -- which the BJP considers its heartland -- reducing the overall parliamentary punch of opposition areas in the relatively less-populous south.\n\n\"It will be quite testing for the Indian union and the federal polity,\" Manivannan said, calling the proposal \"quite divisive\".\n\n\"The southern states won't take it lying down,\" Manivannan added. \"Absolute power demolishes reason, you have to be cautious about that.\"\n\nabh/pjm/gle/tym", "source": {"uri": "reformer.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Brattleboro Reformer"}, "authors": [{"uri":

They do not fail to hide their contempt for this fact.\"\n\nModi was born in 1950 in the western state of Gujarat, the third of six children whose father sold tea at a railway station.\n\nModi has dedicated himself to promoting Hindu supremacy in constitutionally secular India\n\nAn average student, his gift for rousing oratory was first seen with his keen membership of a school debate club and participation in theatrical performances.\n\nBut the seeds of his political destiny were sown at the age of eight when he joined the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS), a hardline nationalist group.\n\nModi dedicated himself to its cause of promoting Hindu supremacy in constitutionally secular India, even walking out of his arranged marriage soon after his wedding aged 18.\n\nRemaining with his wife -- whom he never officially divorced -- would have hampered his advancement through the ranks of the RSS, which expected senior cadres to stay celibate.\n\n- Deadly riots -\n\nThe RSS groomed Modi for a career in its political wing, the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), which through the 1990s was growing into a major force.\n\nHe was appointed chief minister of Gujarat in 2001 but the following year the state was rocked by sectarian riots, sparked by a fire that killed dozens of Hindu pilgrims.\n\nAt least 1,000 people were killed in the ensuing violence, with most of the victims Muslims.\n\nModi was appointed chief minister of Gujarat in 2001 but the following year the state was rocked by sectarian riots\n\nModi was accused of both helping stir up the unrest and failing to order a police intervention.\n\nModi later told a BBC reporter that his main weakness in responding to the riots was not knowing \"how to handle the media\".\n\nA probe by India's top court eventually said there was no evidence to prosecute Modi, but the international fallout saw him banned from entering the United States and Britain for years.\n\nHowever, it was a testament to India's changing political tides that his popularity only grew at home.\n\nHe built a reputation as a leader ready to assert the interests of Hindus, who he contended had been held back by the secularist forces that ruled the country almost continuously since independence from Britain.\n\n- 'A new history' -\n\nCritics have sounded the alarm over a spate of prosecutions directed at Modi's political rivals and the taming of a once-vibrant press\n\nCritics have sounded the alarm over a spate of prosecutions directed at Modi's political rivals and the taming of a once-vibrant press.\n\nIndia's Muslim community of more than 200 million is also increasingly anxious about its future.\n\nModi's rise to the premiership was followed by a spate of lynchings targeting Muslims for the slaughter of cows, a sacred animal in the Hindu tradition.\n\nBut Western democracies have sidestepped rights concerns in the hopes of cultivating a regional ally that can help check China's assertiveness.\n\nModi was last year accorded the rare honour in the US of a joint address to Congress and a White House state reception at President Joe Biden's invitation.\n\nHe has taken credit for India's rising diplomatic and economic clout, claiming that under his watch the country has become a \"vishwaguru\" -- a teacher to the world.\n\nOnly now is India assuming its rightful global status, his party contends, after the historical subjugation of the country and its majority faith -- first by the Muslim Mughal empire and then by the British colonial project.\n\nModi's government has refashioned colonial-era urban landscapes in New Delhi, rewritten textbooks and overhauled British-era criminal laws in an effort to erase what it regards as symbols of foreign domination.\n\nModi's government has refashioned colonial-era urban landscapes in New Delhi, rewritten textbooks and overhauled British-era criminal laws\n\nThis project reached its peak in January when Modi presided over the opening of a new Hindu temple in the town of Ayodhya, built on grounds once home to a centuries-old Mughal mosque razed by Hindu zealots in 1992.\n\nModi said during the elaborate ceremony that the temple's consecration showed India was \"rising above the mentality of slavery\".\n\nHe added: \"The nation is creating the genesis of a new history.\"", "source": {"uri": "dailymail.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title":

Votes are to be counted on Tuesday and results will be known later that day.\n\nHere are some takeaways from the six-week election :\n\n* Prime Minister Narendra Modi is set to be re-elected with an even bigger majority, according to weekend exit polls. Most predicted a two thirds majority for his ruling alliance in the 534-member parliament, reflecting his dominance over the world's most populous nation.\n\nBut such surveys have a mixed record because of difficulties polling in a nation of 1.4 billion people.\n\n* If voters indeed hand Modi a rare third consecutive term, it will provide him the political capital to push through difficult economic reforms such as easier land acquisition and labour laws for businesses, as well as measures to modernise the vast but slowing farm sector.\n\n* A two thirds majority in parliament also opens the way for changes to India's constitution. Modi's critics fear his Hindu nationalist-led alliance will seek to undermine India's secular foundations. Modi has denied plans to change the constitution.\n\n* India's markets are set to cheer a thumping Modi victory, seeing it as the best hope for sustained economic growth, an investment spurt and reforms over the next five years. The S&P BSE Sensex and NSE Nifty 50 indices could gain between 1% and 2% on Monday on the exit polls, analysts said.\n\n* About 968 million people were eligible to vote in what officials described as the world's biggest democratic event, spread over seven phases since April.\n\nVoting machines were transported to remote corners of the vast nation by foot, helicopter and even camelback to ensure every voter was able to participate including a family of five in a Himalayan village that had a polling station of their own.\n\n* The staggered election also turned out to be one of the hottest, with temperatures of over 45 degrees Celsius (113 Fahrenheit) in some parts.

India's most powerful political dynasty now struggling to make a mark", "body": "Rahul Gandhi - the scion of India's most prominent political dynasty - is often pitched as an alternative candidate.\n\nMr Gandhi, though he is not officially the leader, is the centre of gravity of the Congress, the primary opposition to Mr Modi's ruling Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP).\n\nHe belongs to the Gandhi family, the most prominent of India's many political dynasties whose members have ruled the republic for nearly half of its existance. His great-grandfather, Jawaharlal Nehru, was India's first prime minister and his grandmother, Indira Gandhi, and father, Rajiv Gandhi, both held the post subsequently. Indira Gandhi was also India's first woman PM.\n\nAfter Mr Gandhi's father was assassinated in 1991, his Italian-born mother, Sonia Gandhi, rose to lead the Congress.\n\nShe was widely seen as being the power behind the throne when the party returned to office in 2004 and governed for a decade.\n\nBy the time Mr Modi took power in 2014 - riding a wave of public anger against a Congress regime beset with multiple corruption scandals - Mr Gandhi had emerged as the leader of the opposition party and, thus, the main challenger to the prime minister.\n\nAlthough his party suffered many electoral setbacks since and lost its national dominance to the BJP - Mr Gandhi quit as the Congress chief after a crushing defeat to Mr Modi in the 2019 election - he's still regarded as the chief opposition leader.\n\nIn which role he has challenged Mr Modi over his Hindu nationalist government's handling of the increasing persecution of religious minorities, corruption, crony capitalism, rising inflation, erosion of democratic values, especially secularism, and rural agrarian distress.\n\nMr Gandhi undertook a crosscountry walkathon last year, called Bharat Jodo Yatra (Unite India March), walking from Tamil Nadu in the south to Kashmir in the north and, then earlier this year, from east to west, engaging tens of thousands of citizens and galvanising the opposition.\n\nIn all, the parliamentarian walked over 10,000km to rally the country against Mr Modi and his ruling party's \"divisive politics\".\n\nIn recent months, he has also attacked the federal government for failing to stop bloodshed in the northeastern state of Manipur, which has been riven by sectarian violence since last year.\n\n\"This election is fundamentally different. I don't think democracy has been at as much at risk, the constitution has been at as much risk as it is today,\" Mr Gandhi declared early this month while campaigning for the elecion alongside his sister Priyanka Gandhi Vadra, herself a prominent Congress leader.\n\nThe elections are spread over seven phases of voting, with the first phase set for 19 April and the counting for 4 June.\n\nMr Gandhi is contesting from his Wayanad constituency in southern Kerala state where he enjoys popularity.\n\nAs the elections have drawn near, Mr Gandhi has ramped up his attacks on the prime minister. At a campaign rally in Kerala's Kozhikode on 16 April, he described Mr Modi as \"an instrument of five or six of India's biggest and richest businessmen\".\n\nMr Gandhi has been leading the opposition's charge at a time when Mr Modi's ruling party has been accused of employing the state machinery, particularly the criminal justice system, to crack down on its rivals. In the last few years, federal agencies have investigated, raided or arrested several leading opposition figures, and even jailed some, notably Delhi chief minister Arvind Kejriwaland former Jharkhand chief minister Hemant Soren.\n\nMr Gandhi himself was shunted out of parliament after a lower court convicted him of defamation for allegedly \"mocking\" the Modi surname in a 2019 campaign speech.\n\nMr Gandhi had asked: \"Why do all thieves have Modi as their surname?\" He was referring to Nirav Modi, a fugitive diamond tycoon, Lalit Modi, a former Indian Premier League chief banned for life by the country's cricket for alleged corruption, and prime minister Modi.\n\nHe was reinstated five months later after the Supreme Court suspended his conviction.\n\nMore recently, Mr Gandhi's party has seen its bank accounts frozen over a tax dispute. The party's president, Mallikarjun Kharge, said tax authorities have demanded 35bn rupees ($426m) from the party in unpaid dues.\n\nIt is in this political climate that Mr Gandhi is seeking to dislodge Mr Modi's seemingly iron grip on power. To this end, the Congress has cobbled together a broad alliance with regional parties called the Indian National Developmental Inclusive Alliance, INDIA for short and effect.\n\nThe coalition has developed cracks in recent months, but it still enjoys backing from major political players in northern, southern and western India that have regional dominance against Mr Modi.\n\nINDIA has vowed to build a more secular and inclusive society by reversing what its supporters have described as the BJP's Hindu majoritarianism outlook, which has resulted in rising persecution of Muslims, Christians and lower caste Hindus as well as a shrinking space for dissent and free media.\n\nThey have argued that another term for Mr Modi would mean an end to India's status as a secular, democratic country.\n\nIf and how this message clicks with India's Hindu majority in particular will likely determine the success of Mr Gandhi and his coalition in the impending elections.", "source": {"uri":

Most predicted a two thirds majority for his ruling alliance in the 534-member parliament, reflecting his dominance over the world's most populous nation.\n\nBut such surveys have a mixed record because of difficulties polling in a nation of 1.4 billion people.\n\n* If voters indeed hand Modi a rare third consecutive term, it will provide him the political capital to push through difficult economic reforms such as easier land acquisition and labour laws for businesses, as well as measures to modernise the vast but slowing farm sector.\n\n* A two thirds majority in parliament also opens the way for changes to India's constitution. Modi's critics fear his Hindu nationalist-led alliance will seek to undermine India's secular foundations. Modi has denied plans to change the constitution.\n\n* India's markets are set to cheer a thumping Modi victory, seeing it as the best hope for sustained economic growth, an investment spurt and reforms over the next five years. The S&P BSE Sensex and NSE Nifty 50 indices could gain between 1% and 2% on Monday on the exit polls, analysts said.\n\n* About 968 million people were eligible to vote in what officials described as the world's biggest democratic event, spread over seven phases since April.\n\nVoting machines were transported to remote corners of the vast nation by foot, helicopter and even camelback to ensure every voter was able to participate including a family of five in a Himalayan village that had a polling station of their own.\n\n* The staggered election also turned out to be one of the hottest, with temperatures of over 45 degrees Celsius (113 Fahrenheit) in some parts.

His party's performance this year looks set to surpass that of 2019 when it won 303 seats.\n\nHis growing appeal is largely down to what his supporters and critics say is an amping up of nationalism to appeal to Hindus, who make up 80 per cent of the country's 1.4 billion population.\n\nIn January, he caused outrage among Muslims when he fulfilled a long-held demand from the RSS that he open a Hindu temple on the site of a demolished 16th-century mosque. He has also been accused of giving Islamophobic speeches.\n\nIf Mr Modi wins another term as prime minister, many fear India will drift even further towards Right-wing ideologies and embolden the BJP to change India's secular constitution, curtail civil liberties and further marginalise India's minorities, especially Muslims.\n\nOpposition Congress president Mallikarjun Kharge said on Wednesday: \"In this election, if you don't defeat the BJP, then both our constitution and democracy will be at risk, along with your future.\"\n\nDebasish Roy Chowdhury, an author and critic of Mr Modi's government, said: \"A triumphant Modi will intensify his efforts to reorder India as a Hindu-first ethnic democracy and dismantle its secular republic. The culture war against Muslims will get a lot nastier. But that won't make much difference to the West.\"\n\n\"There's just too much money to be made in India at the moment to be worrying about such trifles as minority rights in a brown country. Besides, if the West can live with Netanyahu after Gaza, Modi is nothing.\"\n\nSpeaking as exit polls were emerging, Mr Modi said he was confident the \"people of India have voted in record numbers to reelect the NDA government.\"\n\n\"They have seen our track record and the manner in which our work has brought about a qualitative change in the lives of the poor, marginalised and downtrodden,\" Mr Modi wrote on X.\n\nOn Sunday, supporters in his constituency of Varanasi - the spiritual capital of Hinduism began celebrating, convinced he will maintain an unassailable lead by Tuesday, when the results are announced.\n\n\"For us, he's already re-elected,\" 48-year-old tea stall worker Bharat Lal Yadav said.", "source": {"uri": "uk.news.yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo News

He is also contesting his current seat in Wayanad, Kerala, where he has a comfortable lead over Annie Raja of Communist Party of India. In India, people can contest multiple seats and must choose only one to take up as an MP.\n\nFollow our live coverage for 2024 Indian elections.\n\nHe belongs to the Gandhi family, the most prominent of India's many political dynasties whose members have ruled the republic for nearly half of its existance. His great-grandfather, Jawaharlal Nehru, was India's first prime minister and his grandmother, Indira Gandhi, and father, Rajiv Gandhi, both held the post subsequently. Indira Gandhi was also India's first woman PM.\n\nAfter Mr Gandhi's father was assassinated in 1991, his Italian-born mother, Sonia Gandhi, rose to lead the Congress.\n\nShe was widely seen as being the power behind the throne when the party returned to office in 2004 and governed for a decade.\n\nBy the time Mr Modi took power in 2014 - riding a wave of public anger against a Congress regime beset with multiple corruption scandals - Mr Gandhi had emerged as the leader of the opposition party and, thus, the main challenger to the prime minister.\n\nAlthough his party suffered many electoral setbacks since and lost its national dominance to the BJP - Mr Gandhi quit as the Congress chief after a crushing defeat to Mr Modi in the 2019 election - he's still regarded as the chief opposition leader.\n\nIn which role he has challenged Mr Modi over his Hindu nationalist government's handling of the increasing persecution of religious minorities, corruption, crony capitalism, rising inflation, erosion of democratic values, especially secularism, and rural agrarian distress.\n\nMr Gandhi undertook a crosscountry walkathon last year, called Bharat Jodo Yatra (Unite India March), walking from Tamil Nadu in the south to Kashmir in the north and, then earlier this year, from east to west, engaging tens of thousands of citizens and galvanising the opposition.\n\nIn all, the parliamentarian walked over 10,000km to rally the country against Mr Modi and his ruling party's \"divisive politics\".\n\nIn recent months, he has also attacked the federal government for failing to stop bloodshed in the northeastern state of Manipur, which has been riven by sectarian violence since last year.\n\n\"This election is fundamentally different. I don't think democracy has been at as much at risk, the constitution has been at as much risk as it is today,\" Mr Gandhi declared early this month while campaigning for the elecion alongside his sister Priyanka Gandhi Vadra, herself a prominent Congress leader.\n\nMr Gandhi is contesting from his Wayanad constituency in southern Kerala state where he enjoys popularity.\n\nAs the elections have drawn near, Mr Gandhi has ramped up his attacks on the prime minister. At a campaign rally in Kerala's Kozhikode on 16 April, he described Mr Modi as \"an instrument of five or six of India's biggest and richest businessmen\".\n\nMr Gandhi has been leading the opposition's charge at a time when Mr Modi's ruling party has been accused of employing the state machinery, particularly the criminal justice system, to crack down on its rivals. In the last few years, federal agencies have investigated, raided or arrested several leading opposition figures, and even jailed some, notably Delhi chief minister Arvind Kejriwaland former Jharkhand chief minister Hemant Soren.\n\nMr Gandhi himself was shunted out of parliament after a lower court convicted him of defamation for allegedly \"mocking\" the Modi surname in a 2019 campaign speech.\n\nMr Gandhi had asked: \"Why do all thieves have Modi as their surname?\" He was referring to Nirav Modi, a fugitive diamond tycoon, Lalit Modi, a former Indian Premier League chief banned for life by the country's cricket for alleged corruption, and prime minister Modi.\n\nHe was reinstated five months later after the Supreme Court suspended his conviction.\n\nMore recently, Mr Gandhi's party has seen its bank accounts frozen over a tax dispute. The party's president, Mallikarjun Kharge, said tax authorities have demanded 35bn rupees ($426m) from the party in unpaid dues.\n\nIt is in this political climate that Mr Gandhi is seeking to dislodge Mr Modi's seemingly iron grip on power. To this end, the Congress has cobbled together a broad alliance with regional parties called the Indian National Developmental Inclusive Alliance, INDIA for short and effect.\n\nThe coalition has developed cracks in recent months, but it still enjoys backing from major political players in northern, southern and western India that have regional dominance against Mr Modi.\n\nINDIA has vowed to build a more secular and inclusive society by reversing what its supporters have described as the BJP's Hindu majoritarianism outlook, which has resulted in rising persecution of Muslims, Christians and lower caste Hindus as well as a shrinking space for dissent and free media.\n\nThey have argued that another term for Mr Modi would mean an end to India's status as a secular, democratic country.\n\nIf and how this message clicks with India's Hindu majority in particular will likely determine the success of Mr Gandhi and his coalition in the impending elections.", "source": {"uri":

Among them is Rahul Gandhi's great-grandfather, the first and longest-serving leader of independent India, Jawaharlal Nehru.\n\nYet India has changed dramatically since the time when Nehru led the Congress party, with Saturday's exit polls indicating that Modi's Hindu nationalist alliance will take more than 350 parliamentary seats when the full results of the country's general election are announced on Tuesday.\n\nCongress and its allies are forecast to win barely a third of that number, making it a third election in a row where India's grand old party has desperately underperformed. They say the BJP's widespread abuse of government investigative agencies to harass opposition leaders and parties, including a total freeze on Congress's bank accounts, mean this election has been neither free nor fair.\n\nBut it is also significant that cracks were already starting to show even in Rae Bareli and Amethi, two neighbouring constituencies in Uttar Pradesh that were once the safest of seats for Congress, when The Independent visited last month. For years the Rae Bareli seat was represented by Sonia Gandhi, former Congress president and wife of the assassinated former prime minister Rajiv Gandhi. She has stepped aside for a seat in India's upper house of parliament, leaving her son Rahul to take over the constituency, and poor exit poll numbers aside he is still expected to win here.\n\nWhile support for the Gandhis still seemed strong in Rae Bareli, voters in Amethi told The Independent they were questioning what Congress has to offer them given its weakened status across the country, and whether five years with a Congress MP would really make for positive change in a relatively rural and impoverished region. It gets to the heart of a question that will be picked over in the weeks to come - did Congress run an effective and positive campaign, or focus too much energy on trying to paint Modi as India's bogeyman? And what does yet another election loss say about the future of a family that has ruled India for more than half of the last 77 years?\n\nWhen Gandhi does take to the stage, he is quick to go on the attack. \"This election is the strangest one in the history of independent India,\" he begins. \"Because the BJP and [its ideological parent organisation] RSS are fighting the elections to obliterate the Constitution. Their leaders have clearly said they will change the Constitution of India once voted to power.\"\n\nGandhi is referencing concerns that Modi, emboldened in a third term, will try to remove references from the Constitution to India being a secular nation, and instead declare it a country for Hindus. Modi has said he has no plans to do this, but it's a talking point for many die-hard BJP supporters and such fears have hardly been assuaged by an aggressive election campaign full of anti-Muslim rhetoric.\n\nThe Independent spoke one-on-one with Gandhi's sister, Priyanka Gandhi-Vadra, who is herself a top party strategist and star campaigner. Asked what Congress had to offer voters at this election, she said: \"Our pitch is very simple. Mr Modi's policies have been extremely, they've actually been harmful for the poor of this country, for the farmers, for labourers [and] even for the middle class. Frankly, he has not done anything to strengthen them.\n\n\"We are saying that his policies have all been skewed towards three or four of his oligarch friends to whom he seems to be handing everything, even the nation's assets,\" she says, an apparent reference to Modi's close ties with billionaire industrialists like Mukesh Ambani and Gautam Adani, the country's two richest men.\n\n\"And we are saying that we want to put in place a government that is focused on solving your problems and focused on strengthening you so that you can face all these problems that have multiplied under Modi's rule.\"\n\nWhile most would agree that this election has been far from fair for Congress and its allies, the party is also facing criticism for an apparent inability to recover from the landslide losses of 2014 and 2019 and provide a viable alternative to Modi. Sugata Srinivasaraju, journalist and author of a book on Rahul Gandhi, Strange Burdens, suggests the Gandhis have spent too much of the election preparing to defend their own roles in the party in the event that they lose.\n\n\"They are creating a ground already to say that the elections may not be so credible after all. That it is possible they are stolen. They are planting doubts with regard to the electoral processes,\" he tells The Independent.\n\n\"My question is when you spent so much energy on a negative campaign, on berating Modi, you could have spent a part of that energy to positively approach your own party. What have you done concretely to reorganise your party?\"\n\nFacing relentless criticism from the government benches that Congress exists as a party only to further the ambitions of one family, in 2022 the party held an election to appoint a president from outside the party's ranks. Among those running were Shashi Tharoor, a former high-ranking UN official and author popular with Indian liberals and young people. In the end the party chose Mallikarjun Kharge, a Gandhi loyalist who Srinivasaraju describes as no more than a \"rubber stamp\" for the family.\n\n\"Why didn't you, in the last 10 years, focus [on rebuilding the party] after your first loss in 2014?\" he asks the Gandhis. \"Why didn't you spend that energy building the infrastructure and network for your party? You did not focus on that, you just placed it on one side. You thought you will come back by default again.\"\n\nThere are a host of reasons given by voters in Amethi for why they are turning their backs on the Gandhis, and these range from the local to the religious.\n\nSeveral cite Modi's inauguration of a temple to Lord Ram in Ayodhya, also in Uttar Pradesh, as a moment of pride for them as Hindus. With the Ram Temple's first phase hastily built in time for Modi to declare it open just before the election, it was another moment of history in the country's lurch towards Hindu nationalism, with the prime minister acting as high priest at a grand monument to Hinduism's most important deity - on the site of an illegally demolished mosque.\n\nAwadh Prasad Patel, who sings holy songs at religious gatherings, vows to vote for Mr Modi, saying members of his caste support the party. \"Only Muslims and a few Dalits [formerly Untouchables] might vote for Congress,\" he says. \"I am a farmer and a follower of deity Lord Ram. And Modi put an end to the issue of Ram temple. So we would be voting for them.\"\n\n\"For the longest time, there was no road here. Just potholes,\" Chotey Lal Sahu, a 65-year-old from Berara, a village in the Amethi constituency, tells The Independent. \"It was filled with water (during the rainy season). But now there is a road. Its construction has eased things for us,\" he says.\n\n\"Under this government, we are getting ration, we are getting pension. This is the first time the country has a vegetarian prime minister, as well as a vegetarian chief minister,\" he added, referring to the firebrand local BJP leader in the state, chief minister Yogi Adityanath.\n\nRam Shankar, from Tiloi in Amethi, vociferously backs the BJP. \"Rahul gave us a lot. But Thakurs [upper caste men] have taken everything. From land to grazing area to pond. There is nothing left.\n\n\"I raised a complaint about waste pipe leaking but the police came and beat me. They also beat my father,\" he says. \"I will vote for the BJP. At least they give money to farmers and have waived off some of my loans.\n\n\"I do not care what Rahul Gandhi or his family did, as I was not there. We will only vote for those who will fight for our rights. There is no road, it is just mud. People s*** on the roadside. And our head of village never visits us.\"\n\nIssues relating to caste and religious politics are powerful tools to sway voters here in Uttar Pradesh, and Congress has been seen as largely reactive in its response to the way Hindutva [Hindu-first] policies have won waves of support for Modi's party. For a time Congress was accused of doing \"soft Hindutva\", showing Gandhi touring Hindu temples as a way of saying the party could still appeal to the religious group that makes up around 80 per cent of the population.\n\nBut more recently the party has realised it will never win back the die-hard Hindu nationalists that make up the BJP's base, Srinivasaraju says, and it is instead \"trying to present the Congress as a complete opposite to the philosophy of the BJP\".\n\n\"[Gandhi] started speaking about federalism and balkanised caste politics, which was in contrast to the centralised and pan-Indian imagination the Congress was known for not so long ago. He started saying that India was a union of states and not exactly a nation,\" he says. \"I think Rahul Gandhi is trying to occupy a kind of high moral ground because there is nothing else left.\"\n\nMany will question whether Congress picked the right strategies for this election if the results on Tuesday go in line with what the exit polls are saying. But whatever reckoning is due, it seems certain that the party's first response will be to publicly question the fairness of the world's largest election.\n\n\"It's the first, possibly the first election in the history of India, where chief ministers from opposition parties have been imprisoned during election time,\" says Gandhi-Vadra, as she highlights the challenges faced by the opposition. \"There has been a massive attack on opposition leaders in India. Not just opposition leaders, but on free and fair media. So there's hardly any journalists now who will take an independent stand. The ones who did have either been imprisoned or cases have been put against them.\n\n\"On every front, whether it's activists, journalists, political parties or movie stars who have raised their voices. On every front, the government has attacked them.\" The harsh reality for the Gandhi family and its party is that it has had no real defence against the onslaught it has faced from the man now set to become the first after Nehru to win three terms as India's prime minister.", "source": {"uri": "uk.news.yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo News UK"}, "authors": [{"uri":

They may not agree with pursuing fully either the sangh parivar's agenda or Modi's pet projects\n\nWithin hours of the publication of this article, the counting of the votes for the 18th Lok Sabha will begin. By this evening, the declared results and the leads should be sufficient to point to the victor of this long-drawn-out election. All Indians will follow the twists and the turns of the counting process for at stake will be the formation of the Central government. As India is now the world's most populous country, a rising power and the fifth-largest economy in the world, the election results will also arouse great interest in the international community as well as in the boardrooms of multinational companies.\n\nThe election campaign reflected India's ideological and political polarisation. The Bharatiya Janata Party-led ruling dispensation kept its focus on its standard themes -- nationalism, Hindu consolidation, welfare schemes for people's benefit, raising the country's global prestige and profile and Narendra Modi's persona. The Opposition Indian National Developmental Inclusive Alli\u00adan\u00adce, which included the Congress, side-stepped these issues. Instead, it kept hammering on the situation of the deprived battling inflation and unemployment besides harping on the growing disparity between the rich and the poor. Thus, there was a surfeit of declamatory speeches and rallies but there was little engagement on issues impacting the lives of the people and confronting the nation.\n\nUnlike the 2014 and 2019 elections, there was no single, grand idea underpinning this election unless it is held that it was all about Modi. In 2014, corruption and, in 2019, nationalist sentiment arising out of the Pulwama terrorist attack and the Indian air force's Balakot action had formed the respective evocative cores of the campaigns. If the BJP had hoped that the Ram mandir would provide the glue to its campaign, it would have been disappointed. The election, therefore, became an aggregation of regional polls with the BJP expected to dominate -- though not as it did in 2014 and in 2019 -- the north and the west but be on a weaker wicket in the south and the east. This has made the election difficult to predict, though most foreign and domestic observers feel that Prime Minister Modi will return to power.\n\nThe real question is whether the BJP will be able to secure a majority on its own as it did in 2014 and 2019. That it will become the single-largest party is not in doubt but the exact number it secures will only be known today. Modi and his die-hard followers believe that he will do better than in 2019. This is possible but there is no certainty that it will be so. Modi's ego will be bruised if he does not get a majority. This is because he has not failed to do so in any election in which he has led the BJP. A problem for Modi and the BJP may arise if its numbers fall 30 or 40 seats below the majority mark of 272 seats. This is because Modi has only led governments with clear majorities. It requires special skills -- Atal Bihari Vajpayee had these in abundance -- to hold a coalition together; incidentally, Vajpayee did not have a second fit in the BJP or in Indian politics as a whole.\n\nIf Modi wins a clear majority, he will act to fulfil the remaining part of the sangh parivar's agenda and his own pet projects. The former category will include the adoption of a Uniform Ci\u00advil Code perhaps not through the action of state governments but through Parliament. He will also seek to ensure that the Gyanvapi mosque in Varanasi and the Krishna Janmasthan matters are resolved in a manner which is satisfactory to the sangh parivar. In the latter category, the issues of simultane\u00adous elections and economic decisions to make the Indian economy the world's third-largest will take primacy. However, will he focus on reducing disparities in income and wealth which will only increase if the economy grows according to the present model? That is unlikely.\n\nModi's problems will arise if he heads a coalition government that will be vulnerable to pressure from allies. They may not agree with pursuing fully either the sangh parivar's agenda or Modi's pet projects. They may also put pressure on how he wishes to conduct his foreign policy though this may not be a priority for them. This will take him into unfamiliar territory and he will not find it easy to show flexibility.\n\nWhat about the Congress? There is little doubt that Rahul Gandhi has matured. The sobriquet, 'Pappu', is no longer attached to him. He will have to, in all likelihood, remain in the Opposition and show the skills to build the party's organisation in the Hindi heartland where the mood of the Hindu majority has certainly turned rightward over the past decade. A long political struggle lies ahead for him to rebuild the Congress machinery from the grass-roots. In addition, he will have to continue to pursue the party's ideological agenda.\n\nWhatever may be the outcome of the election in terms of government formation, one matter is certain: ideological fractures in India will remain. This is because there has been no attempt in the political class to bridge the great divide -- broadly, the two distinct visions of India that are present today all across society and the polity. A principal component of these visions is the role of religion in public and national life. It is undeniable that different formations within the national movement had different conceptions of religion as an ingredient of Indian nationalism. The Muslim League and some right-wing Hindu organisations believed that religion had to be the fundamental element in nationalism. However, the Congress, which was the main vehicle of the freedom movement, believed that religion should remain in the private domain and should not impact State policy. Certainly, the State could not discriminate between citizens on the basis of religion. It is this principle that is a basic feature of the Constitution. For many Indians, it is this principle that is under challenge. The struggle over this constitutional feature and ideal will continue irrespective of the election result.", "source": {"uri": "telegraphindia.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Telegraph"},

In his 10 years in power, Modi has never had to rely on coalition partners. The election marks not only the end of single-party control in India's parliament, but also the BJP's having peaked. Coalition governments -- the natural order for India's democracy since the late 1980s, except for the past decade -- are back to stay.\n\nWhile India's Bharatiya Janata Party and Prime Minister Narendra Modi appear poised to return to power for a third consecutive term -- a feat accomplished by a premier only once before in the country's history -- they are much diminished, having failed to secure a parliamentary majority on their own. In his 10 years in power, Modi has never had to rely on coalition partners. The election marks not only the end of single-party control in India's parliament, but also the BJP's having peaked. Coalition governments -- the natural order for India's democracy since the late 1980s, except for the past decade -- are back to stay.\n\nThe BJP's supremacy over the past decade was the result of several factors. In Modi, the party had a once-in-a-generation leader whose charisma and communication abilities placed him head and shoulders above the competition in terms of popularity among voters. Religious appeals, welfare programs (especially those aimed at women and the poor), and organizational capabilities that gave the party a superior ground game all helped. So did a ruthlessness in deploying the dark arts of politics, a disunited and weak opposition, and access to oodles of campaign finance.\n\nThe BJP's manifest hegemony appeared to presage its continued dominance of the Indian political landscape well into the future. But from the summit, the only way is down. Of course, the party may stay near its peak for a while and climb down slowly -- but that is not a matter of if, but when.\n\nAlthough robust political competition is a hallmark of democracies, a surprisingly large number have been dominated by a single political party for long periods of time. Examples include Japan's Liberal Democratic Party, the Christian Democrats in Italy, the Institutional Revolutionary Party (PRI) in Mexico, and the Democratic Party in Botswana. India itself was dominated by the Indian National Congress party for many decades, and the communist Left Front ran the state of West Bengal unchallenged for three-and-half decades.\n\nWhen in power, these dominant parties seemed unassailable -- until they were not. In some cases, this happened when economic development and technological change altered the structure of the economy and the relative power of different social groups. The green revolution in India, for example, empowered farmers from middle castes who had long been excluded from the Congress party's social coalition. Their economic ascendency translated into political power that pushed out the Congress in populous North Indian states. The shift from manufacturing to services and the concomitant decline of unions also undermined a major social base of the dominant left-of-center parties.\n\nIn many postcolonial states, the party that led the country to independence enjoyed a special legitimacy. But with each successive generation, societal memories of epochal historical events faded. It took seven decades with the PRI in Mexico and three decades with the African National Congress in South Africa (as last week's election results demonstrate). India's Congress party played a pivotal role in the nation's freedom struggle, but while the halo effect persisted for decades, it inevitably dimmed.\n\nDominant parties can also fade because of national crises driven by international events -- such as an economic shock or a defeat in wars. But for many of them, the longer that they are in power, the more that institutional sclerosis sets in. Call it the law of political entropy. As the French political scientist Maurice Duverger put it in the 1960s, the dominant party \"wears itself out in office, it loses its vigor, its arteries harden. ... Every domination bears within itself the seeds of its own destruction.\"\n\nThe longer that the BJP was in power, the more that those seeds sprouted within the party. The BJP's singular strength has been its leader, Narendra Modi. The Congress party also had such a leader in Indira Gandhi, who -- like Modi -- towered above her contemporaries. The popularity of both leaders far outweighed that of their parties.\n\nBut that very strength became their Achilles' heel as a personality-driven style of party and politics emerged. For the BJP, increasing centralization, declining intraparty democracy, and the cutting-to-size of regional leaders who were not subserviently loyal to national the leader all took their toll. Efforts to engineer defections from opposition parties (through both blandishments and coercion) meant that gradually, the party became a magnet for opportunists rather than those with deep ideological commitments.\n\nUnder Modi's rule, such coercion often took the form of dropping corruption cases against opposition party members who defected to the BJP. But this did not mean that the defectors became less corrupt; a leopard doesn't change its spots. There's little wonder, then, that even though the BJP had ridden an anti-corruption wave to power in 2014, preelection polls published in April this year found that more than half of respondents (55 percent) believed that corruption had increased in the past five years. Committed party workers have begun to lose interest as party hoppers brought in for short-term gains crowd them out in coveted positions. A favorite goal of the BJP's leadership was to create a Congress mukt Bharat (\"An India free of the Congress\"). Ironically, in attempting to do so, the BJP became the embodiment of that very Congress culture.\n\nIf the art of victory is learned in defeat, for the BJP, the opposite is proving true. Each new victory brought a validation of the party's strategies, whether muzzling critics, coercing opponents, or marginalizing religious minorities. The premium on loyalty increased, and voices of dissent become more quiescent. The initial self-confidence that allowed for risk-taking became an overconfidence spilling over to reckless behavior -- exemplified by allegations of India's intelligence agencies seeking to silence overseas critics in Canada and the United States.\n\nThe arrogance meant that the party overlooked three countervailing forces.\n\nFirst, the manifest reality that no party in India wins with a majority of the votes. For a party to win in India's first-past-the-post system, it needs a plurality of votes -- which requires a fragmented opposition. The more hegemonic that the BJP became, the more authoritarian that it became, putting pressure on opposition parties and their leaders. But instead of weakening them, it brought them together. Nothing concentrates the mind like a fight for survival, and, while imperfect and incomplete, the opposition's decision to join forces in the so-called INDIA coalition limited vote fragmentation.\n\nSecond, while successful political parties embody a set of ideas and ideologies that are yoked to policies and programs, all ideas have their life cycles. Postwar Keynesianism had its day for a quarter-century, and neoliberalism subsequently had its own for about three decades. Both are pass\u00e9 today. Political Islam rode high for around three decades after the Iranian revolution, but its energies have since flagged. In India, the secular socialist idea had a run for nearly a half-century, but its increasing opportunism tripped it up, and it was gradually pushed out as the BJP tapped into the plentiful waters of the anxieties and resentments of the Hindu majority.\n\nBut the Hindutva ideology has its limits, too. Even though the BJP did deliver on its promise on constructing a Ram temple on the site of a historic mosque, the expected political payoffs did not materialize. In this election, the BJP failed to win even the constituency where the temple was built. Populism can -- and does -- secure votes for a while. But India's complex social mosaic cannot be easily pigeonholed into binary categories.\n\nThird, ideologies do not address the quotidian challenges facing voters. The wellsprings of voter discontent run deep, and addressing them is -- and will be -- difficult.\n\nThe foremost challenge is the economy, which has simply been unable to supply decent jobs in adequate numbers. More and more Indians have formal education credentials but meager skills, a sad testimony to the poor quality of the country's education system. Rising aspirations are hitting the brick wall of precarious jobs as India continues to struggle to strengthen its manufacturing sector. At some point, the millions of disgruntled youths will find ways to voice their frustrations.\n\nThese challenges will be greater given the extraordinary technological changes that are upending labor markets -- not just in manufacturing, but also the tech services that have been India's one categorical success. Even robust growth is unlikely to produce the sort of labor demand that one might have expected in the past. And a febrile politics will be rocked even more in the future, as technological change in the form of artificial intelligence is poised to further political turmoil. Managing this will be hard in the best of circumstances. In a polity where polarization is actively encouraged, it's hard to be sanguine about where this may lead.\n\nIndia's election was held under a searing heat wave, a vivid reminder of the inexorable impacts of climate change, whose afflictions are mounting. Indian agriculture is particularly vulnerable as temperatures climb and rainfall patterns change. A bedraggled urban India will face further pressures as the recent water shortages in India's booming information technology capital, Bengaluru, illustrate. And this is just the beginning.\n\nThese are all exceedingly difficult challenges no matter which political party is in power in India. But for now, the one silver lining is that while commentators and experts have been deeply apprehensive about India's democracy, its voters clearly seem to be less so.

Among them is Rahul Gandhi's great-grandfather, the first and longest-serving leader of independent India, Jawaharlal Nehru.\n\nYet India has changed dramatically since the time when Nehru led the Congress party, with Saturday's exit polls indicating that Modi's Hindu nationalist alliance will take more than 350 parliamentary seats when the full results of the country's general election are announced on Tuesday.\n\nCongress and its allies are forecast to win barely a third of that number, making it a third election in a row where India's grand old party has desperately underperformed. They say the BJP's widespread abuse of government investigative agencies to harass opposition leaders and parties, including a total freeze on Congress's bank accounts, mean this election has been neither free nor fair.\n\nBut it is also significant that cracks were already starting to show even in Rae Bareli and Amethi, two neighbouring constituencies in Uttar Pradesh that were once the safest of seats for Congress, when The Independent visited last month. For years the Rae Bareli seat was represented by Sonia Gandhi, former Congress president and wife of the assassinated former prime minister Rajiv Gandhi. She has stepped aside for a seat in India's upper house of parliament, leaving her son Rahul to take over the constituency, and poor exit poll numbers aside he is still expected to win here.\n\nWhile support for the Gandhis still seemed strong in Rae Bareli, voters in Amethi told The Independent they were questioning what Congress has to offer them given its weakened status across the country, and whether five years with a Congress MP would really make for positive change in a relatively rural and impoverished region. It gets to the heart of a question that will be picked over in the weeks to come - did Congress run an effective and positive campaign, or focus too much energy on trying to paint Modi as India's bogeyman? And what does yet another election loss say about the future of a family that has ruled India for more than half of the last 77 years?\n\nWhen Gandhi does take to the stage, he is quick to go on the attack. \"This election is the strangest one in the history of independent India,\" he begins. \"Because the BJP and [its ideological parent organisation] RSS are fighting the elections to obliterate the Constitution. Their leaders have clearly said they will change the Constitution of India once voted to power.\"\n\nGandhi is referencing concerns that Modi, emboldened in a third term, will try to remove references from the Constitution to India being a secular nation, and instead declare it a country for Hindus. Modi has said he has no plans to do this, but it's a talking point for many die-hard BJP supporters and such fears have hardly been assuaged by an aggressive election campaign full of anti-Muslim rhetoric.\n\nThe Independent spoke one-on-one with Gandhi's sister, Priyanka Gandhi-Vadra, who is herself a top party strategist and star campaigner. Asked what Congress had to offer voters at this election, she said: \"Our pitch is very simple. Mr Modi's policies have been extremely, they've actually been harmful for the poor of this country, for the farmers, for labourers [and] even for the middle class. Frankly, he has not done anything to strengthen them.\n\n\"We are saying that his policies have all been skewed towards three or four of his oligarch friends to whom he seems to be handing everything, even the nation's assets,\" she says, an apparent reference to Modi's close ties with billionaire industrialists like Mukesh Ambani and Gautam Adani, the country's two richest men.\n\n\"And we are saying that we want to put in place a government that is focused on solving your problems and focused on strengthening you so that you can face all these problems that have multiplied under Modi's rule.\"\n\nWhile most would agree that this election has been far from fair for Congress and its allies, the party is also facing criticism for an apparent inability to recover from the landslide losses of 2014 and 2019 and provide a viable alternative to Modi. Sugata Srinivasaraju, journalist and author of a book on Rahul Gandhi, Strange Burdens, suggests the Gandhis have spent too much of the election preparing to defend their own roles in the party in the event that they lose.\n\n\"They are creating a ground already to say that the elections may not be so credible after all. That it is possible they are stolen. They are planting doubts with regard to the electoral processes,\" he tells The Independent.\n\n\"My question is when you spent so much energy on a negative campaign, on berating Modi, you could have spent a part of that energy to positively approach your own party. What have you done concretely to reorganise your party?\"\n\nFacing relentless criticism from the government benches that Congress exists as a party only to further the ambitions of one family, in 2022 the party held an election to appoint a president from outside the party's ranks. Among those running were Shashi Tharoor, a former high-ranking UN official and author popular with Indian liberals and young people. In the end the party chose Mallikarjun Kharge, a Gandhi loyalist who Srinivasaraju describes as no more than a \"rubber stamp\" for the family.\n\n\"Why didn't you, in the last 10 years, focus [on rebuilding the party] after your first loss in 2014?\" he asks the Gandhis. \"Why didn't you spend that energy building the infrastructure and network for your party? You did not focus on that, you just placed it on one side. You thought you will come back by default again.\"\n\nThere are a host of reasons given by voters in Amethi for why they are turning their backs on the Gandhis, and these range from the local to the religious.\n\nSeveral cite Modi's inauguration of a temple to Lord Ram in Ayodhya, also in Uttar Pradesh, as a moment of pride for them as Hindus. With the Ram Temple's first phase hastily built in time for Modi to declare it open just before the election, it was another moment of history in the country's lurch towards Hindu nationalism, with the prime minister acting as high priest at a grand monument to Hinduism's most important deity - on the site of an illegally demolished mosque.\n\nAwadh Prasad Patel, who sings holy songs at religious gatherings, vows to vote for Mr Modi, saying members of his caste support the party. \"Only Muslims and a few Dalits [formerly Untouchables] might vote for Congress,\" he says. \"I am a farmer and a follower of deity Lord Ram. And Modi put an end to the issue of Ram temple. So we would be voting for them.\"\n\n\"For the longest time, there was no road here. Just potholes,\" Chotey Lal Sahu, a 65-year-old from Berara, a village in the Amethi constituency, tells The Independent. \"It was filled with water (during the rainy season). But now there is a road. Its construction has eased things for us,\" he says.\n\n\"Under this government, we are getting ration, we are getting pension. This is the first time the country has a vegetarian prime minister, as well as a vegetarian chief minister,\" he added, referring to the firebrand local BJP leader in the state, chief minister Yogi Adityanath.\n\nRam Shankar, from Tiloi in Amethi, vociferously backs the BJP. \"Rahul gave us a lot. But Thakurs [upper caste men] have taken everything. From land to grazing area to pond. There is nothing left.\n\n\"I raised a complaint about waste pipe leaking but the police came and beat me. They also beat my father,\" he says. \"I will vote for the BJP. At least they give money to farmers and have waived off some of my loans.\n\n\"I do not care what Rahul Gandhi or his family did, as I was not there. We will only vote for those who will fight for our rights. There is no road, it is just mud. People s*** on the roadside. And our head of village never visits us.\"\n\nIssues relating to caste and religious politics are powerful tools to sway voters here in Uttar Pradesh, and Congress has been seen as largely reactive in its response to the way Hindutva [Hindu-first] policies have won waves of support for Modi's party. For a time Congress was accused of doing \"soft Hindutva\", showing Gandhi touring Hindu temples as a way of saying the party could still appeal to the religious group that makes up around 80 per cent of the population.\n\nBut more recently the party has realised it will never win back the die-hard Hindu nationalists that make up the BJP's base, Srinivasaraju says, and it is instead \"trying to present the Congress as a complete opposite to the philosophy of the BJP\".\n\n\"[Gandhi] started speaking about federalism and balkanised caste politics, which was in contrast to the centralised and pan-Indian imagination the Congress was known for not so long ago. He started saying that India was a union of states and not exactly a nation,\" he says. \"I think Rahul Gandhi is trying to occupy a kind of high moral ground because there is nothing else left.\"\n\nMany will question whether Congress picked the right strategies for this election if the results on Tuesday go in line with what the exit polls are saying. But whatever reckoning is due, it seems certain that the party's first response will be to publicly question the fairness of the world's largest election.\n\n\"It's the first, possibly the first election in the history of India, where chief ministers from opposition parties have been imprisoned during election time,\" says Gandhi-Vadra, as she highlights the challenges faced by the opposition. \"There has been a massive attack on opposition leaders in India. Not just opposition leaders, but on free and fair media. So there's hardly any journalists now who will take an independent stand. The ones who did have either been imprisoned or cases have been put against them.\n\n\"On every front, whether it's activists, journalists, political parties or movie stars who have raised their voices. On every front, the government has attacked them.\" The harsh reality for the Gandhi family and its party is that it has had no real defence against the onslaught it has faced from the man now set to become the first after Nehru to win three terms as India's prime minister.", "source": {"uri": "independent.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Independent"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

The president will nominate the remaining two seats in the 545-seat chamber.\n\nThe election commission said turnout in the fourth-phase poll held on May 13 was 69.16 percent, the highest in the seven-phased voting. The fifth-phase poll on May 20 yielded the lowest at 62.2 percent, while the figure for overall turnout was not given.\n\nThe previous election in 2019 had a turnout of 67.1 percent, with the BJP winning 303 seats and the main opposition Indian National Congress securing just 52.\n\nCongress, which is leading a coalition of more than a dozen opposition parties, has said that it aims to win over 295 seats and form the government.\n\nThe center-left Congress party had ruled India for over 50 years but was defeated in the previous two elections under the leadership of Rahul Gandhi, the son of the late Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi.\n\nUnder Modi's leadership since 2014, India has achieved high economic growth, with the country climbing to fifth from 10th in gross domestic product over the past decade.\n\nThe government of the Hindu-nationalist party also implemented policies that favor the Hindu majority.\n\nIt inaugurated a Hindu temple built on the site of a 16th-century mosque destroyed by a Hindu mob in 1992 and enforced a discriminatory citizenship law that only allows members of non-Muslim minorities facing persecution in neighboring countries to acquire Indian

The outgoing prime minister, after 10 years of uninterrupted power, won the parliamentary elections on Tuesday, June 4, with a narrow majority, at the end of a six-week marathon election. The results are currently being consolidated. Some 642 million Indians turned out to vote, braving the country's heatwave.\n\nModi matches his illustrious predecessor, Jawaharlal Nehru, the prime minister of independence, elected three times. But his victory falls short of expectations. Modi had asked Indians to give him 370 seats, 400 with his coalition, i.e. two-thirds of the majority in the Lok Sabha, the lower house of Parliament, required to amend the Constitution. He has failed, obtaining with his allies around 290 seats, barely more than the simple majority, set at 272 seats, despite his party's, the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), fierce campaigning on the ground and social media, and despite his personal involvement. The omnipresent prime minister held 206 public rallies and gave 80 interviews during the six-week campaign. Defenders of democracy and secularism can rest assured that Modi will not have the means to make major constitutional changes.\n\nThe state of Uttar Pradesh, India's most populous and strategic one with 80 MPs, illustrates the shift in opinion and the crystallization of anger. Modi had counted on the construction of the Ram temple in Ayodhya to win by a landslide. But on Tuesday morning, the opposition was in the lead, seemingly close to defeating the BJP, represented by the fanatical monk Yogi Adityanath.\n\nThe BJP is retreating to its strongholds in the Hindi-speaking belt, in the north and west of the country, and is barely making inroads in the previously impregnable south and east. However, the gains made in these regions do not compensate for losses elsewhere.\n\nOver the past few weeks, many pockets of discontent had been heard on the ground. You just had to listen: farmers, unemployed young people, the poor stunned by inflation, Muslims stigmatized by Modi, those relegated by growth, Ladakhis on hunger strike, all were expressing their disappointment with the prime minister. The Modi magic is over. In his constituency of Benares, he won by a narrow margin.\n\nFor the opposition and the Congress, this could be the start of a process of reconquest, if they know how to remain united. For the first time since 2014, the Nehru-Gandhi party, which governed the country for a quarter of a century before going under, succeeded in rallying a grand coalition of around 30 parties, even if there were still around 100 constituencies where candidates were in competition. The Congress Party's strongman, Rahul Gandhi, finally assumed the role of leader while avoiding the trap of arrogance toward his partners, as the Congress had not nominated a candidate for the post of prime minister. Finally, the opposition chose campaign themes that resonated with the concerns of the poor and modest: social justice and equality.", "source": {"uri": "lemonde.fr", "dataType": "news", "title": "Le

victory signs, Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi was hailed by his adoring Hindu nationalist party faithful with a rock star-like welcome to celebrate a third term Tuesday.\n\nThe 73-year-old beamed a wide grin as crowds cheered and reached forward to touch his hand at the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) national headquarters in New Delhi.\n\nModi showed no visible sign of disappointment that he had not won the landslide he had wanted, powering through gold ticker tape flurries down a narrow corridor between his admirers.\n\n\"I am indebted to all fellow citizens for their support and love,\" he told cheering crowds.\n\nVictory for Modi -- whose BJP and allies were on track to win 291 out of 543 elected seats -- rested on the premier's appeal to the Hindu majority, and he reached out to thank his supporters.\n\n\"I bow in front of all those who voted and all the people of India,\" he said, waving at the crowds.\n\nDressed in his usual attire of a gleaming white kurta flowing shirt and trousers -- with a blue waistcoat on top -- Modi promised a \"new chapter for development\" for the country.\n\n\"We will move forward with new energy, new enthusiasm and new resolve,\" he added.\n\n- 'No contender' -\n\nLoyalists had begun partying in BJP centres soon after counting started on Tuesday -- some launched fireworks while others banged out beats on drums, all wrapped in the saffron of the Hindu faith.\n\nAmong the throng, there seemed little recognition that the BJP's much derided opposition rivals had, for the first time in a decade, ensured Modi's party failed to secure an overall majority of its own.\n\n\"Apart from Modi, there is no contender,\" said 26-year-old BJP supporter Akash Sharma.\n\nBut figures from the election commission showed the BJP will need to rely on its alliance partners to push through legislation in this parliament.\n\nBJP supporter Apoorva Shukla, 23, said she was excited about the next term.\n\n\"The kind of development we've had in the past 10 years, I believe it's going to be a level higher this time,\" she said.\n\nThe polls were staggering in their size and logistical complexity, with voters casting their ballots in megacities New Delhi and Mumbai, as well as in sparsely populated forest areas and the disputed Muslim-majority region of Kashmir.\n\nUS think tank Freedom House said this year that the BJP had \"increasingly used government institutions to target political opponents\".\n\nBut Modi declared: \"Our victory is a win of the world's biggest democracy.\"", "source": {"uri": "today.rtl.lu", "dataType": "news",

But that is precisely what India's opposition parties achieved on Tuesday even though they are, numerically speaking, unlikely to win the 2024 general election.\n\nWith the votes still being tallied across the 543 constituencies, as a number of them are too close to call, we won't know the final result until Wednesday. But it appears that the governing Bharatiya Janata Party will end up with the highest number of seats in the lower house of Parliament. The National Democratic Alliance, that it is a part of, leads in more than half the number of seats. Assuming the leads hold overnight, the ruling alliance is theoretically poised to form government for the third consecutive time.\n\nAnd yet if one were to gauge the mood on the ground from afar - including by trawling through mainstream and social media channels and talking to people from different walks of life - it is easy assume that the party that's been in power for a decade just got crushed by its opponents.\n\nThat's because, even as the BJP leads the other parties by some distance, it is unlikely to reach the magic figure of 272 seats on its own. This wasn't the case in the 2014 and 2019 general elections, when it clinched 282 and 303 seats and didn't require support from other parties. But now, in a situation where it would need help from its partners in the NDA, the ball is not entirely in its court.\n\nThat in and of itself is a win for the opposition \"India\" alliance that has suffered defeat after electoral defeat over the past 10 years, both at the national and local levels.\n\nHectic parleying has already begun, as the opposition camp has reportedly reached out to some of the smaller NDA parties to jump ship. But regardless of who forms government in the coming days - and the BJP might still be able to hold its flock together - what is crystal clear is that something has shifted in Indian politics: it is almost certain to regress towards the mean.\n\nSince 2014, on the back of brute majorities in Parliament, the administration led by Prime Minister Narendra Modi has dominated national politics. Opposition parties - primarily the Indian National Congress that previously held power for more than five decades - had been beaten to submission, reduced to double-digit MPs in the lower house. The BJP rode the \"Modi wave\" to win elections in a majority of the states and urban centres, albeit with notable setbacks.\n\nDuring this period, the government targeted the opposition by sending investigative agencies after its leaders purportedly to tackle corruption, although critics alleged that the real reason was to co-opt these politicians and their vote banks.\n\nIt also unilaterally pushed through a number of reforms, including the abrogation of Article 370 that gave autonomy to the disputed territory of Jammu-Kashmir and stopping the practice of \"triple talaq\" that empowered Muslim men to unilaterally end their marriage.\n\nWhenever the government faced a public backlash, such as during the passage of three contentious farm laws and a citizen amendment act that appeared to target Muslims, it did the prudent thing and rolled back these reforms. But opposition parties and civil society continued to paint the deeply ideological Hindu nationalist party as a force determined to eventually amend the Constitution that would convert the republic from a liberal, secular democracy to an illiberal, Hindu ethnocracy.\n\nClearly, this narrative was not compelling enough for millions of Indians who were, quite understandably, more focused on the government's economic programmes, infrastructure projects and muscular foreign policy that undoubtedly benefited the country. Until the long-drawn-out general election got under way in May, therefore, it was a given that the BJP would retain power, perhaps with an even bigger mandate.\n\nBut two factors may have come into play, for the election to throw what is effectively a hung verdict.\n\nOne is the economy. India's GDP growth has been impressive since the Covid-19 pandemic, and the Modi government has tamed inflation. But while global media focused on the positives - particularly at a time when multinational companies were adopting the \"China plus one\" strategy of investing in a country other than China - they largely ignored issues like rural distress and youth unemployment.\n\nExperts have often talked about the silent voter, who would opt to make his or her dissent known at the ballot box rather than at protest rallies. Given how well the opposition has fared in this election among rural voters and voters living in the small towns, the silent voter has ultimately prevailed - no matter what the opinion polls, including the exit polls released on Sunday, told us.\n\nThe second factor may have been an acute fear, whether rational or not, among the marginalised sections of society that the BJP would mount an assault on affirmative action as part of its agenda to amend the Constitution. This, many openly feared, would include the reservations that guarantee government jobs, college admissions and welfare schemes to people from the lower caste groups. The India alliance preyed, with success it seems, on this widespread anxiety in this campaign.\n\nAll this means that the BJP, while still a force to reckon with, will be a more diminished one.\n\nIt's important to note that over the past decade, Mr Modi's popularity was such that a cult of personality had emerged that subsumed most of the faultlines and contradictions that have been a feature of Indian politics. Such was his command that politicians, policymakers and government functionaries marched to a sometimes-overcentralised government's tune. The BJP, critics often claimed, was in the midst of pursuing its own One Nation project that, according to some, included a deliberate subordination of the states to the federal government.\n\nSecond, one presumes that with more representatives in Parliament, the opposition will be much stronger for the next five years. This is vital. The hope for millions of Indians must, therefore, the new political equation translates to more robust debates and discussions in Parliament and greater co-operation among parties and governments at all levels.\n\nThis would amount to more than just a moral victory for the people of India.", "source": {"uri": "thenationalnews.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The National"}, "authors": [],

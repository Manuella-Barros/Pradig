Thousands of guests, including foreign heads of countries from seven of India\u2019s neighbourhood, attended the swearing-in ceremony in Delhi. Maldives president Mohamed Muizzu, Sri Lanka\u2019s Ranil Wickremesinghe, and Bangladesh prime minister Sheikh Hasina were among the leaders who landed in Delhi on Sunday to attend the ceremony. Nepal\u2019s prime minister Pushpa Kamal Dahal, Bhutan\u2019s leader Tshering Tobgay and prime minister of Mauritius, Pravind Jugnauth, were also welcomed in Delhi. Mr Modi\u2019s swearing-in ceremony marks the beginning of his third five-year term, making him the only second prime minister in India after Jawaharlal Nehru to lead the country for three consecutive terms. His third term holds significance as it is the first time relying on a fragile coalition with partners who are not averse to switching support after Mr Modi\u2019s Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) failed to win a majority on an electoral setback. The BJP won only 240 seats, less than 272 seats required by any political party to form a government, making Mr Modi dependent on the BJP-led alliance National Democratic Alliance (NDA) that won the most number of seats. The NDA coalition got 293 seats, some 61 ahead of the opposition INDIA alliance led by the Congress party. Mr Modi, who had made the boisterous claim of his party winning 400 seats in a sweeping victory, was forced to cut rushed deals with regional allies who gained prominence as \u201ckingmakers\u201d for giving support to the party. A new cabinet has also been sworn in and includes many new faces while retaining some of the major figures from his previous cabinet in the heavyweight portfolios. Subrahmanyam Jaishankar is retaining the foreign ministry to return as the Minister for External Affairs. (pls confirm) Rajnath Singh will also return as the defence minister of India while Kiren Rijiju is returning for the Earth Science Ministry. Amit Shah, known as Mr Modi\u2019s closest aide, is returning as home minister while union minister Nitin Gadkari is again heading the Road Transport & Highways. The decision on the new cabinet came after an 11-hour long meeting at the prime minister\u2019s residence on Saturday in the presence of Mr Shah and BJP president BJP Nadda. Ahead of the highly anticipated swearing-in ceremony, Mr Modi visited and paid homage to freedom fighter Mahatma Gandhi at his memorial Rajghat in Delhi. He paid tribute to former BJP prime minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee and visited another BJP stalwart, LK Advani, at his residence. In the afternoon, Mr Modi also invited members of parliament who are part of the new cabinet, dubbed as Modi 3.0 in Indian media. He hosted a high tea at his residence and interacted with the ministers. The surprising election results upended widespread expectations before the vote. The populist leader who has been accused by critics of leading the country with politics of polarisation and using all the power levers, including state agencies, at his disposal at target his critics. Analysts have said it is uncharted territory for Mr Modi who has always led governments with a majority even during his time as Gujarat chief minister while singularly enjoying spotlight and relevance. The politics of coalition does not fit in well with \u201cModi\u2019s brand of assertive and go-it-alone politics\u201d, said Michael Kugelman, director of the Wilson Center\u2019s South Asia Institute. \u201cThese results show that the Modi wave has receded, revealing a level of electoral vulnerability that many could not have foreseen,\u201d said Mr Kugelman. Two regional stalwarts N Chandrababu Naidu of Telugu Desam Party\u2019s (TDP) and Nitish Kumar of Janata Dal (United)\u2019s emerged as kingmakers after they were courted by BJP to form the government. These leaders have already put forth demands, including changes in contentious laws, more funds for their states and federal cabinet positions during negotiations on forming a new coalition government. While Mr Modi has embarked on the third term with the new government it is to be seen how the leader will navigate the pulls and pressures of a coalition government.", "summary": "<p>Narendra Modi will lead country under the challenges of coalition government </p>", "url": "https://www.independent.co.uk/asia/india/modi-oath-swearing-in-pm-india-elections-cabinet-2024-b2559395.html", "image": "https://static.independent.co.uk/2024/06/09/14/Screenshot%202024-06-09%20192557.png?width=1200", "video": null, "publish_date": "2024-06-09 13:58:05", "author": "Shweta Sharma", "authors": ["Shweta Sharma"], "language": "en", "catgory": "politics", "source_country": "gb", "sentiment": 0.317}

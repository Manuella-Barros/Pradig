What\u2019s going to happen is this is also going to open up new habitats because that warm kind of temperature is also going to be moving north. \u201cSo, as those warm temperatures increase, as you go further up north, you\u2019re not only going to increase habitat for the ticks, but you\u2019re also increasing habitats for the host range,\u201d said Iwasawa, referring to animals including mice, deer, and raccoons.

(FOX5) - Former Las Vegas councilwoman Michele Fiore is being accused of running a fallen officer charity scheme, and allegedly using the funds to pay for her daughter's wedding.\n\nAccording to the Department of Justice, Fiore - currently serving as a Justice of the Peace in Nye County - was charged with four counts of wire fraud and one count of conspiracy to commit wire fraud on Tuesday. The indictment found that, during her time as a city councilwoman, Fiore solicited donations to build a statue honoring Las Vegas police officers killed in the line of duty.\n\nFiore allegedly promised donors that 100% of their contributions would go toward creating the statue. She is now accused of using the tens of thousands of dollars received for the statue to pay for political fundraising bills, rent, and her daughter's wedding.\n\nIf convicted, Fiore faces a maximum penalty of 20 years in prison for each count.\n\nFiore served as a Republican member of the Nevada State Assembly, representing District 4 from 2012 to 2016.

The charges relate to a fundraising campaign she conducted as a councilwoman, authorities said.\n\nFiore, who did not respond to requests for comment, was on the council from 2017 to 2022. She is currently a justice of the peace in Pahrump Justice Court.\n\nA former state assemblywoman, Fiore also previously served as a Nevada GOP national committeewoman, and in 2022 she ran an unsuccessful campaign for state treasurer.\n\nIn June 2014, Metropolitan Police Department officers Alyn Beck and Igor Soldo were fatally shot by a man who hoped to start a revolution.\n\nThe Las Vegas City Council decided the following year to name a new park for Beck, which would be in Ward 6, the district Fiore represented when she was elected. In 2018, when the city broke ground on the park, Fiore proposed creating a statue of Beck, the indictment said.\n\nA company not named in the indictment agreed to pay for the statue, but Fiore told the sculptor that she had appropriated discretionary money from the city for it, according to the indictment. Brian Hanlon was the sculptor.\n\nAuthorities said Fiore used the project to raise money through a charity and political action committee between July 2019 and January 2020. She told donors the money they gave would pay for the statue or another memorial project, but that wasn't how the money was used, prosecutors alleged.\n\n\"Fiore did not use any of the tens of thousands of dollars in charitable donations for the statue of the fallen officer and instead converted the money to her personal use,\" the Department of Justice said in a news release. \"The donations were used to pay her political fundraising bills and rent and were transferred to family members, including to pay for her daughter's wedding.\"\n\nGov. Joe Lombardo was present at the park's opening in 2020 when he was Clark County sheriff.\n\n\"I'm aware of the serious charges against Michele Fiore related to her time as a city councilwoman,\" he said in a statement on Wednesday. \"It's my hope that complete justice and accountability are established through this investigation and its resulting legal process.\"\n\nFiore served in the Nevada Legislature from 2012 to 2016, garnering national media attention during her tenure. She was appointed to the bench in Pahrump in late 2022.\n\nA clerk with the Nevada Commission on Judicial Discipline said Wednesday that the agency is aware of the federal indictment against Fiore but that \"by law, we're prohibited from commenting any further on the matter.\"\n\nPahrump Justice Court administrator Alisa Shoults said she had not heard about the indictment but that Fiore was scheduled to hear cases Wednesday.\n\nA courtroom baliff denied a Las Vegas Review-Journal reporter access to Fiore's courtroom while she was on the bench Wednesday morning.\n\nLas Vegas attorney George Kelesis said he represents Fiore but declined to comment on the indictment.\n\nThe Las Vegas Review-Journal previously reported that the FBI was investigating Fiore's campaign finances. The Justice Department said the FBI's Las Vegas office is investigating the case.\n\nFiore is scheduled to make her initial appearance in the case on Friday.

George U.S. Courthouse in Las Vegas that she was innocent of the charges.\n\nIn brief prepared remarks on the courthouse steps following the hearing, Fiore, 53, said she has faced \"relentless investigations and continuous attacks\" throughout the past decade.\n\n\"I have served as a city councilwoman and as a judge with integrity, honor and respect,\" Fiore said. \"This indictment is a direct attack on my character. I am tired of the shadow games others have played for the past decade to my family, and my friends, and those who have entrusted me with their votes of confidence. I am sorry, you have to see me here. However, all will be revealed in a court of law.\"\n\nAccording to the federal grand jury indictment, Fiore allegedly solicited donations during her time as a city councilwoman to honor police officers killed while on duty, promising that \"100 percent of the contributions\" would be used to fund the creation of a statue memorializing the officers.\n\nHowever, the funds never paid for the statue and were allegedly used by Fiore to pay her political fundraising bills, rent and for her daughter's wedding, among other purposes.\n\nIf Fiore is convicted, she faces a maximum penalty of 20 years in prison for each count.\n\nRead more: Grand jury indicts ex-Las Vegas Councilwoman Michele Fiore on wire fraud charges\n\nJudge Daniel J. Albregts ordered Fiore, who is listed as a resident of Pahrump, to appear for a Sept. 9 status check in front of U.S. District Judge Jennifer Dorsey. A trial date was set for Sept. 24.\n\n\"There will be no continuances; we want this now and we want it over,\" Fiore said. \"We will not give up my rights for a speedy trial and my day in court.\"\n\nFiore's attorney, Michael Sanft, and prosecutor Dahoud Askar agreed to an exchange of evidence and documents to ensure a quick trial.\n\nAs she was leaving the courthouse, The Nevada Independent asked Fiore if she was concerned about any disciplinary action by the Nevada Commission on Judicial Discipline, which could potentially suspend her from the bench because of the indictment. The commission is the only state disciplinary agency that oversees judges.\n\n\"Of course I am,\" she said. \"I just actually got served walking into court.\"\n\nA spokeswoman for the commission declined comment and as of noon, a complaint hasn't been posted to its website.\n\nOn Thursday, Fiore oversaw hearings in her Pahrump courtroom. In the June primary, she was elected outright to serve another term.\n\nIn 2012, Clark County Family Court Judge Steven Jones was suspended by the commission after being indicted by a federal grand jury on fraud charges. In 2014, after being convicted on the charges, the commission banned Jones from ever serving in any Nevada judicial office, either elected or appointed.\n\nFiore, a Republican, has a long political history in Nevada.

The former Nevada state Assembly and Las Vegas City Council member said she had not yet seen the document.\n\nFiore is accused of wire fraud and conspiracy to commit wire fraud, crimes that each carry a possible penalty of 20 years in prison. Court records do not reflect when Fiore is due for an initial court appearance or whether she has an attorney representing her.\n\nThe grand jury said that when Fiore was a city council member from 2017 to 2022, she promised to use 100% of the contributions she solicited to erect a statue in a city park to honor two Las Vegas police officers who were killed on duty in June 2014.\n\n\"Fiore did not use any of the tens of thousands of dollars in charitable donations for the statue, and instead converted the money to her personal use,\" prosecutors said in a news release.\n\nThe indictment refers to an unnamed co-conspirator who is related to Fiore and traces checks that prosecutors said diverted money to pay Fiore's political fundraising bills, rent and daughter's wedding.\n\nFiore served one term as a Republican in the state Legislature from 2012 to 2016, where she was as an outspoken supporter of gun rights and posed with guns and her family for Christmas cards in 2015. In 2022, Fiore ran as a Republican but lost the statewide race for state treasurer to Democrat Zach Conine.\n\nShe gained national attention backing rancher Cliven Bundy and his family during armed standoffs between militiamen and federal law enforcement officers in Bunkerville, Nevada, in 2014, and at a national wildlife refuge in Malheur, Oregon, in 2016.\n\nFiore was appointed by Nye County lawmakers in December 2022 to serve as a local justice of the peace in rural Pahrump, an hour's drive west of Las Vegas.\n\nCopyright 2024 The Associated Press.

If found guilty, Fiore, a former Republican candidate for governor nicknamed \"Lady Trump,\" could face a maximum sentence of 20 years in federal prison for each charge.\n\nThe Justice Department revealed that during her time on the city council, Fiore gathered donations to erect a statue in memory of Las Vegas Metropolitan Police Officer Alyn Beck, who tragically lost his life in the line of duty on June 18, 2014. Allegedly, Fiore falsely assured donors that all contributions would be solely used for the statue's construction.\n\nHowever, prosecutors say that Fiore \"did not use any of the tens of thousands of dollars in charitable donations for the statue of the fallen officers.\" Instead, she allegedly converted all of the money -- more than $70,000 -- \"for her own personal benefit.\"\n\n\"The donations were used to pay her political fundraising bills and rent and were transferred to family members, including to pay for her daughter's wedding,\" the release states.\n\nAccording to the indictment, the basis for the alleged scheme dates back to December 2018, when the city broke ground on Alyn Beck Memorial Park and Fiore proposed the creation of a statue of Beck that would be erected at the entrance of the park. The construction of the park was paid for by a private real estate development company identified in the indictment as \"Company A.\"\n\nCompany A in August 2019 entered into a purchase contract with the sculptor who created the statue to pay for the statue, installation, and shipping, prosecutors said.\n\n\"Fiore was aware from her role as a City Councilwoman involved in the planning of Alyn Beck Memorial Park that Company A had agreed to pay for the statue,\" the indictment states. \"In January 2020, at a meeting in Fiore's office prior to the unveiling ceremony, Fiore falsely told the sculptor who created the Alyn Beck Statue that she had appropriated! discretionary funds through the City of Las Vegas to pay for the Alyn Beck Statue.\"\n\nBut prosecutors allege that since \"at least as early as July 2019,\" Fiore was soliciting charitable donations under false pretenses for the creation of the statue. Such solicitation allegedly continued until about January 2020.\n\nFiore previously made headlines in 2014, when she went to Cliven Bundy's ranch in Nevada during his militia's standoff with federal agents, and referred to Bundy and his men as \"freedom fighters,\" The Guardian reported. While there, she reportedly put out a call for the federal agents \"not to obey your superiors when given a direct order to attack your fellow Americans fighting for the freedoms granted to us by our constitution.\"\n\nA staunchly pro-gun advocate, Fiore also sparked controversy when she posted an eyebrow-raising family Christmas card in December 2015 in which she and her family -- including a small child -- are all holding firearms.", "source": {"uri": "internewscast.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Internewscast Journal"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

Ms. Fiore and others, including the evangelist Franklin Graham, persuaded the occupiers to surrender without a fight.\n\nThe F.B.I. special agent in charge said afterward that Ms. Fiore's help had been important and thanked her for \"significant assistance.\"\n\nMs. Fiore seemed to have sympathy for the group's charismatic leader, Ammon Bundy, just as she had two years earlier for his father, Cliven Bundy, who in 2014 rallied supporters to join him in defending his cattle from what he described as federal overreach in southern Nevada.\n\nMs. Fiore served in Nevada's state assembly beginning in 2012. She lost a bid to join the U.S. House of Representatives in 2016, then won an election in 2017 to become a member of the City Council in Las Vegas.\n\nIt was during that term, according to the indictment, that Ms. Fiore told donors that she was collecting money to fund a statue in honor of one officer, Alyn Beck. She had also mentioned plans to memorialize another, Igor Soldo. Both men had been working as patrol officers when they were shot and killed at a pizzeria in June 2014.\n\nProsecutors said that even as she was collecting donations, Ms. Fiore already knew that a real estate development company had already agreed to pay for the statue of Mr. Beck, which was unveiled when the park opened in Jan. 2020.\n\nIn her statement, Ms. Fiore said that the indictment \"has been years in the making and has profoundly impacted my life, the lives of my adult children and grandchildren, my friends and especially my constituents. This is unacceptable.\"", "source": {"uri": "dnyuz.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "DNyuz"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stefano_Fiore", "type": "person",

The construction of the park was paid for by a private real estate development company identified in the indictment as \"Company A.\"\n\nCompany A in August 2019 entered into a purchase contract with the sculptor who created the statue to pay for the statue, installation, and shipping, prosecutors said.\n\n\"Fiore was aware from her role as a City Councilwoman involved in the planning of Alyn Beck Memorial Park that Company A had agreed to pay for the statue,\" the indictment states. \"In January 2020, at a meeting in Fiore's office prior to the unveiling ceremony, Fiore falsely told the sculptor who created the Alyn Beck Statue that she had appropriated! discretionary funds through the City of Las Vegas to pay for the Alyn Beck Statue.\"\n\nBut prosecutors allege that since \"at least as early as July 2019,\" Fiore was soliciting charitable donations under false pretenses for the creation of the statue. Such solicitation allegedly continued until about January 2020.\n\nFiore previously made headlines in 2014, when she went to Cliven Bundy's ranch in Nevada during his militia's standoff with federal agents, and referred to Bundy and his men as \"freedom fighters,\" The Guardian reported. While there, she reportedly put out a call for the federal agents \"not to obey your superiors when given a direct order to attack your fellow Americans fighting for the freedoms granted to us by our constitution.\"\n\nA staunchly pro-gun advocate, Fiore also sparked controversy when she posted an eyebrow-raising family Christmas card in December 2015 in which she and her family -- including a small child -- are all holding firearms.", "source": {"uri": "lawandcrime.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Law & Crime"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

But not for making a surprise appearance at the convention, spewing racially insensitive remarks, wielding high-powered weapons in political ads or announcing yet another run for elected office -- nothing so mundane.\n\nThe former Las Vegas City Council member and current Pahrump justice of the peace has been indicted by a federal grand jury for allegedly defrauding donors to a charity purporting to raise funds to create a statue memorializing fallen Las Vegas police officers.\n\nThe one conspiracy and four wire fraud charges stem from Fiore's alleged promise to donors that \"100 percent of the contributions\" would go toward the statue's creation. Instead, prosecutors allege, tens of thousands of dollars in donations wound up in Fiore's pockets and were used to pay political bills, rent and were funneled to family members. Some of the funds were even used to help pay for Fiore's daughter's wedding.\n\nAs detailed in the indictment, the charges are based on repugnant behavior. Fiore is accused of fundraising off the violent deaths of decorated Las Vegas Metropolitan Police Department officers Alyn Beck and Igor Soldo, who were murdered by a pair of self-styled revolutionaries who had been kicked out of the same 2014 Bundy Ranch standoff with federal agents that she had so publicly supported.\n\nShe's accused of soliciting contributions for the memorial statue and directing donations to an account she controlled through an unnamed person despite the fact a company had already volunteered to pay for the project.\n\nThe charges were made public Wednesday morning in a U.S. Department of Justice news release and announced by principal deputy assistant attorney general Nicole M. Argentieri, who heads the criminal division, and Las Vegas FBI Special Agent in Charge Spencer L. Evans, whose office is investigating the case.\n\nNow 53, Fiore has been making headlines for the wrong reasons for a long time. Her home health care business endeavors were plagued by hundreds of thousands of dollars in tax liens for more than a decade and came into focus after she was elected to the state Assembly in 2012. With her rapid rise in 2014 to Assembly majority leader and a coveted assignment as chairwoman of the taxation committee -- positions she was appointed to but removed from before the session started -- the hard-charging fiscal conservative embarrassed fellow GOP legislators but kept on moving. Her home health company, Always There Personal Care, had a history that included $700,000 in liens.\n\nFiore was a high-profile supporter of Bunkerville cattle rancher Cliven Bundy. Bundy's protracted dispute over grazing rights against the Bureau of Land Management was defined by an armed standoff with government agents in 2014 that exposed far-right anger over federal authority in the West. Fiore was a familiar face during the criminal proceedings against Bundy and his family members in a trial that would be dismissed with prejudice in 2018 after a ruling of government evidentiary misconduct.\n\nBy then she had landed a seat on the Las Vegas City Council, where she served with confidence and controversy. From tussling with former council ally Victoria Seaman to her suspicious effort to renovate a hay barn at Floyd Lamb Park at Tule Springs, and the use of her Future for Nevadans PAC funds to pay her daughter's events planning company, she was an ethics disaster waiting to happen.\n\nDuring Fiore's 13 months as mayor pro tem, in 2020 she managed to embarrass the council and community with racially charged comments. At one point, Councilman Cedric Crear wrote a letter to Mayor Carolyn Goodman demanding Fiore's removal from the pro tem role, which enables a councilmember to lead meetings in the mayor's absence. Fiore denied being a bigot, instead accusing Crear of defaming her, and attempted to write off the matter to her \"Brooklyn girl\" upbringing.\n\nAfter exiting the city council under a cloud, she announced a gubernatorial bid in 2022. The short-circuited campaign was defined by an audacious television commercial featuring a pistol-packing Fiore.\n\nWhen that fizzled, she regrouped and made a run for state treasurer despite her history of tax liens. Despite being hounded by former constituents for making a chummy zoning approval on her way out of city hall, in November 2022 she used her undeniable energy and super Trumper credentials to run a competitive race against Democrat Zach Conine, losing by fewer than 20,000 votes.\n\nWhen statewide politics failed, she retreated to Nye County's open arms, pushing for a seat on the county commission before being appointed to the Pahrump justice of the peace spot despite a lack of academic and legal credentials.\n\nWith such a history -- and this is the abbreviated version -- you might wonder what would make anyone want to trust her with their charitable donations. But authorities say tens of thousands of dollars intended to honor brave police officers went to Fiore, her friends and family. The case is being prosecuted by seasoned trial attorneys Dahoud Askar and Alexander Gottfried of the criminal division's Public Integrity Section.\n\nNot surprisingly, Fiore doesn't list her litany of controversies on her LinkedIn page, where she enthuses, \"As I continue to serve my constituents with unyielding integrity and dedication, I eagerly embrace opportunities for growth and learning in the legal field. My commitment to effecting positive change and making a difference remains the driving force in my journey. With an enthusiastic outlook, I am eager to confront future challenges, armed with the same determination that has guided me throughout my life.\"\n\nThe accusations she faces don't exactly comport that shining self-image. As prosecutors will remind you, an indictment is merely an allegation.\n\nBut after all these years, would anything surprise you where Michele Fiore is concerned?", "source": {"uri":

The court hears criminal and traffic matters and small claims cases.\n\nShe and her attorney, Michael Sanft, acknowledged that she was served Friday with paperwork from the state Commission on Judicial Discipline.\n\nThe commission is required by law to suspend a judge with pay if they face a felony charge. Fiore is accused of four felony counts of wire fraud and felony conspiracy to commit wire fraud. Each count carries a possible penalty of 20 years in prison.\n\nSanft said he will represent Fiore in the federal criminal case and in discipline commission proceedings. He said the commission had not suspended Fiore.\n\nFiore, 53, was appointed to the bench by Nye County lawmakers in 2022 after she lost her campaign for state treasurer. She was elected in June to complete the unexpired term of a judge who died last year. Pahrump is an hour's drive west of Las Vegas.\n\nFiore served in the state Legislature from 2012 to 2016 and is an outspoken supporter of gun rights. She made headlines posing with guns and her family for Christmas cards in 2015. She was a Las Vegas councilwoman from 2017 to 2022 before moving to Pahrump.\n\nShe also drew national attention backing rancher Cliven Bundy and his family during and after armed standoffs between self-styled militia members and federal law enforcement officers in Bunkerville, Nevada, in 2014, and at a national wildlife refuge in Oregon in 2016.", "source": {"uri": "ca.news.yahoo.com",

I had long talks with my wife about needing to find a new vocation,\" McConaughey added, after Powell, 35, asked what it felt like during his hiatus. The Academy Award winner recalled telling his wife Camila Alves McConaughey he was considering teaching high school, studying to conduct music or working as a \"wildlife guide\" during this period of time.\n\n\"I honestly thought, 'I stepped out of Hollywood. I got out of my lane.' The lane Hollywood said I should stay in,\" he said. \"And Hollywood's like, 'Well, f--- you, dude. You should have stayed in your lane. Later.' \"\n\nNever miss a story -- sign up for PEOPLE's free daily newsletter to stay up-to-date on the best of what PEOPLE has to offer, from celebrity news to compelling human interest stories.\n\nMcConaughey first broke out in 1993's Dazed and Confused before settling into a run of rom-coms in the early 2000s, most notably costarring with Kate Hudson in 2003's How to Lose a Guy in 10 Days. While McConaughey did not specify when his two-year hiatus took place, he is not credited with any on screen roles in 2007 and 2010. By 2013, he was starring in films like Dallas Buyers Club and The Wolf of Wall Street, the first of which earned him his Oscar in 2014.\n\n\"It was scary. The days are long -- the sense of insignificance,\" McConaughey told Powell. \"But I made up my mind that that's what I needed to do, so I wasn't going to pull the parachute and quit the mission I was on. But it was scary, because I didn't know if I was ever going to get out of the desert.\"\n\nIn May, Powell told The Hollywood Reporter that advice from McConaughey influenced his decision to permanently relocate to Austin as his primary residence after living in Los Angeles for more than 15 years. \"He's like, 'Hollywood is the Matrix, man. You plug in and it's all fake world,' \" Powell recalled McConaughey telling him. \"He's like, 'Then I go to Austin, and I unplug. It's all real. Those are my friends, that's my family, my actions matter there.' \"", "source": {"uri": "people.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "PEOPLE.com"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hollywood,_Los_Angeles", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Hollywood, Los Angeles"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Romantic_comedy", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Romantic comedy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glen_Powell", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Glen Powell"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interview_(magazine)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Interview (magazine)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matthew_McConaughey", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Matthew McConaughey"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genre", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Genre"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Texas", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Texas"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Texas"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Camila_Alves", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Camila Alves"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Academy_of_Motion_Picture_Arts_and_Sciences", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dazed", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Dazed"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Matrix_(franchise)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "The Matrix (franchise)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Academy_Awards", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Academy Awards"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kate_Hudson", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Kate Hudson"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Hollywood_Reporter", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "The Hollywood Reporter"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los_Angeles", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dallas", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Dallas"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Dallas"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Austin,_Texas", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Austin, Texas"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Austin, Texas"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Wolf_of_Wall_Street_(book)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "The Wolf of Wall Street (book)"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Entertainment", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Entertainment", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Scouting/History", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Scouting/History", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Movies/History", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Movies/History", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Music/Movies", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Music/Movies", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Movies/Awards", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Movies/Awards", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 99}], "image": "https://people.com/thmb/8cyavPWLSwDUiUczMufnryqgwGM=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():focal(665x256:667x258)/Matthew-McConaughey-dad-041024-2e12703f1a0e41f19c44c5859ea0561a.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9665294", "eventUri": "eng-9665294", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.192156862745098, "wgt": 212, "relevance": 1}

It was a hell of a shocking thing.\n\n\"I chucked on a backpack and went to Peru for three weeks just so I could hear myself think... Have you had to go, 'I would've done any of these roles, but now I've got to be discerning?'\n\n\"I've had similar runs where I've said no to things, where I'm like, 'Am I being too safe, or am I ferociously chasing what I want? Because sometimes you can get paralyzed in the no's. I've had plenty of times in my career where I'm like, 'I don't know what I want to do, I just know I don't want to do that.'\"", "source": {"uri": "popcrush.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "PopCrush"}, "authors": [{"uri": "bang_showbiz@popcrush.com", "name": "Bang Showbiz", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hollywood,_Los_Angeles", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Hollywood, Los Angeles"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matthew_McConaughey", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Matthew McConaughey"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Romantic_comedy", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Romantic comedy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Camila_Alves", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Camila Alves"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Lincoln_Lawyer_(TV_series)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "The Lincoln Lawyer (TV series)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Typecasting", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Typecasting"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glen_Powell", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Glen Powell"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/True_Detective", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "True Detective"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interview_(magazine)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Interview (magazine)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Academy_Awards", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Academy Awards"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dallas", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Dallas"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Dallas"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A_Time_to_Kill_(Grisham_novel)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "A Time to Kill (Grisham novel)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Levi_Strauss_&_Co.", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Levi Strauss & Co."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joel_Schumacher", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Joel Schumacher"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Legal_drama", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Legal drama"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hell", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Hell"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peru", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Peru"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Peru"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Performing_Arts/Acting", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Performing Arts/Acting", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Employment/Careers", "label": "dmoz/Business/Employment/Careers", "wgt": 8}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Future/Millennialism", "label": "dmoz/Society/Future/Millennialism", "wgt": 8}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Movies/History", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Movies/History", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Movies/Awards", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Movies/Awards", "wgt": 8}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 98}], "image": "https://townsquare.media/site/252/files/2024/06/attachment-imgjpgaw1hz2vzms8ymdi0lza0lzmwlze3mtq0nju0nzjjcm9wcgvkmjq5nngxnjiylmpwzyyxmdawjjy1ma.jpg?w=1200&q=75&format=natural", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9665294", "eventUri": "eng-9665294", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.2392156862745098, "wgt": 204, "relevance": 1}

McConaughey spoke with Interview Magazine's Glen Powell and said he \"had to leave Hollywood for two years,\" after he struggled to book roles outside of his familiar romcom roots.\n\nThe famous actor explained the challenges he faced and the self-reflection that came along with the experience.\n\n\"I've usually zigged when I felt like Hollywood wanted me to zag,\" McConaughey told Interview Magazine.\n\n\"When I had my rom-com years, there was only so much bandwidth I could give to those, and those were some solid hits for me,\" he said, recognizing the value and significance the romcom genre had on his career.\n\nIn spite of the fame and fortune, the actor wanted more.\n\n\"But I wanted to try some other stuff,\" McConaughey said. \"Dude, it was scary. I had long talks with my wife about needing to find a new vocation.\"\n\nHe went on to describe just how real the conversations became, recalling that he spoke to his wife, Camila Alves McConaughey, about potentially teaching high school or conducting music instead of acting. McConaughey said he even contemplated becoming a wildlife guide during his hiatus from Hollywood.\n\n\"I honestly thought, 'I stepped out of Hollywood. I got out of my lane.' The lane Hollywood said I should stay in,\" he said. \"And Hollywood's like, 'Well, fuck you, dude. You should have stayed in your lane. Later.'\" (RELATED: One Of Music's Biggest Players Calls It Quits Because Everyone Seems To Hate Him)\n\nAfter some focused time reinventing himself, his career did pick back up, and much to his delight, McConaughey found success outside of the romantic comedy genre.

When I had my rom-com years, there was only so much bandwidth I could give to those, and those were some solid hits for me. But I wanted to try some other stuff. Of course I wasn't getting it, so I had to leave Hollywood for two years.\n\n\"I had long talks with my wife about needing to find a new vocation, 'I think I'm going to teach high school classes. I think I'm going to study to be a conductor. I think I'm going to go be a wildlife guide'.\n\n\"I honestly thought, I stepped out of Hollywood. I got out of my lane, the lane Hollywood said I should stay in, and Hollywood's like, 'well f*** you, dude, you should have stayed in your lane'.\n\n\"The days are long, the sense of insignificance. But I made up my mind that that's what I needed to do, so I wasn't going to pull the parachute and quit the mission I was on. But it was scary, because I didn't know if I was ever going to get out of the desert.\"\n\nDespite becoming disillusioned with the film industry, McConaughey said he \"never became cynical about playing my greatest hits\", but added he did not want to rely on them.\n\nMcConaughey was being interviewed by fellow American actor Glen Powell, who has starred in the likes of Top Gun: Maverick, Anyone But You and Hit Man.\n\nDuring the conversation, Powell said he was also concerned about not becoming \"a derivative of myself\" and added that if he did too much work, his life felt \"like a press tour\".\n\nRSS Syndicated Content Published: Thu 20 Jun 2024, 12:46 PM Last updated: Thu 20 Jun 2024, 1:08 PM", "source": {"uri": "con-telegraph.ie", "dataType": "news", "title": "Connaught Telegraph"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hollywood,_Los_Angeles", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Hollywood, Los Angeles"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matthew_McConaughey", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Matthew McConaughey"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Romantic_comedy", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Romantic comedy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Typecasting", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Typecasting"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interview_(magazine)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Interview (magazine)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conducting", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Conducting"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Broadcast_syndication", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Broadcast syndication"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RSS", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "RSS"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pennsylvania", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Pennsylvania"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Pennsylvania"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dazed", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Dazed"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interstellar_(film)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Interstellar (film)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secondary_school", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Secondary school"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dallas", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Dallas"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Dallas"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Top_Gun:_Maverick", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Top Gun: Maverick"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glen_Powell", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Glen Powell"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parachute", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Parachute"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greatest_hits_album", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Greatest hits album"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Film_industry", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Film industry"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Desert", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Desert"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Performing_Arts/Acting", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Performing Arts/Acting", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Movies/History", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Movies/History", "wgt": 17}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Health/Substance_Abuse", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Health/Substance Abuse", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Music/Movies", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Music/Movies", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Support_Groups/Smoking_Cessation", "label": "dmoz/Health/Support Groups/Smoking Cessation", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 96}], "image": "https://imengine.public.prod.cmg.infomaker.io/?uuid=73329299-6906-54ad-be1e-3f82be56e2a4&function=cropresize&type=preview&source=false&q=75&crop_w=0.99999&crop_h=0.99558&x=0&y=0&width=1200&height=675", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9665294", "eventUri": "eng-9665294", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.05098039215686279, "wgt": 196, "relevance": 1}

In an interview obtained by E! News, McConaughey revealed that his decision to step away was driven by a desire to break free from the rom-com stereotype that had come to define his early career.\n\nDuring his rom-com years, which included hits like 'How to Lose a Guy in 10 Days' and 'Failure to Launch,' McConaughey found himself boxed into a specific type of leading man role. \"I wanted to try some other stuff,\" he explained but struggled to find opportunities outside of the romantic comedy genre.\n\nFrustrated by the industry's expectations, McConaughey made the bold choice to leave Hollywood altogether. \"It was scary,\" McConaughey confessed, reflecting on the uncertainty of that period.\n\nHe considered alternative career paths such as teaching high school or becoming a wildlife guide. However, with the support and counsel of his wife, Camila Alves McConaughey, he persevered through this existential crisis about his career direction. \"I honestly thought, 'I stepped out of Hollywood. I got out of my lane.' The lane Hollywood said I should stay in,\" McConaughey recalled in the interview obtained by E! News, while expressing his apprehensions about whether he could successfully transition into different roles upon his return.\n\nHis hiatus, however, proved transformative. McConaughey returned to the limelight with critically acclaimed performances in films like 'The Lincoln Lawyer,' 'The Wolf of Wall Street,' and 'The Dallas Buyers Club,' the latter of which earned him an Academy Award for Best Actor in 2014. Today, McConaughey continues to reside outside the Los Angeles area, preferring the authenticity and human connection he finds in his native Texas. \"You can really be an honest observer of humans in Texas,\" he remarked, contrasting it with the often superficial nature of Hollywood.

Tony Gonzales, R-Texas, discuss their Greenlights Grant Initiative on 'Special Report.'\n\nMatthew McConaughey was not always sure his place was in Hollywood.\n\nBack when the star was best known for his romantic comedies like \"How to Lose a Guy in 10 Days\" and \"The Wedding Planner,\" he said he decided to take a break to rethink his career.\n\n\"I've usually zigged when I felt like Hollywood wanted me to zag,\" the 54-year-old told \"Twisters\" star Glen Powell for an article in Interview magazine. \"When I had my rom-com years, there was only so much bandwidth I could give to those, and those were some solid hits for me. But I wanted to try some other stuff. Of course, I wasn't getting it, so I had to leave Hollywood for two years.\"\n\nMcConaughey said the break was \"scary,\" and he considered leaving acting altogether and starting over again in a completely different career.\n\nGLEN POWELL SAYS MATTHEW MCCONAUGHEY INSPIRED HIM TO LEAVE 'MATRIX'-LIKE HOLLYWOOD FOR TEXAS: 'FAKE WORLD'\n\n\"I had long talks with my wife about needing to find a new vocation,\" he explained. \"'I think I'm going to teach high school classes. I think I'm going to study to be a conductor. I think I'm going to go be a wildlife guide.'\"\n\nThe actor married wife Camilla Alves in 2012, and they share three children together.\n\nThe \"Dallas Buyers Club\" actor said he \"honestly thought, 'I stepped out of Hollywood. I got out of my lane.' The lane Hollywood said I should stay in, and Hollywood's like, 'Well, f--- you, dude. You should have stayed in your lane. Later.'\"\n\nMATTHEW MCCONAUGHEY, CAMILA ALVES LOVE 'THE LACK OF DRAMA' SINCE LEAVING CALIFORNIA FOR TEXAS\n\nHe said, although the time off gave him a feeling of \"insignificance,\" he knew that was what he needed to do, \"so I wasn't going to pull the parachute and quit the mission I was on. But it was scary, because I didn't know if I was ever going to get out of the desert.\"\n\nLIKE WHAT YOU'RE READING? CLICK HERE FOR MORE ENTERTAINMENT NEWS\n\nPowell agreed that even though there are \"ghost stories\" about actors who took a break from the industry and never found their way back, it is still good to let Hollywood \"miss you.\"\n\nMcConaughey, a Texas native, likened it to \"lean horse, long ride.\"\n\nHe explained, \"I don't know about you, but for me, going back to 'A Time to Kill,' after I first had a big success in a major studio picture and became famous, I remembered that the Thursday before that movie opened, there's 100 scripts out there that I would've done, and 99 of them I could not book. Over that one weekend, 99 noes became 99 yeses. I was like, 'What? Three days ago, I'd have done any of these! And now you're asking me which one I want to do?' It was a hell of a shocking thing.\"\n\nCLICK HERE TO SIGN UP FOR THE ENTERTAINMENT NEWSLETTER\n\nMcConaughey said he then grabbed a backpack and headed off to Peru for three weeks, so he could \"hear myself think.\"\n\nHis last rom-com role was in 2009's \"Ghosts of Girlfriends Past,\" and by 2011, he was starring in \"The Lincoln Lawyer.\" In 2014, he won his first Oscar for \"Dallas Buyers Club.\"\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nEarlier in the interview, McConaughey professed, \"Once I felt like I was in Hollywood, I felt comfortable enough to go back home.

After feeling limited by his roles, he returned to critical acclaim with serious performances in films like Dallas Buyer Club . The actor's career saw a resurgence with acclaimed roles in Magic Mike , True Detective , and Interstellar . SCREENRANT VIDEO OF THE DAY SCROLL TO CONTINUE WITH CONTENT\n\nMatthew McConaughey explains why he considered retirement early in his acting career and why he \"had to leave Hollywood.\" After breaking through with a brief but memorable role in Richard Linklater's coming-of-age comedy Dazed and Confused, some of McConaughey's first successful lead roles came in the legal drama A Time to Kill, the sci-fi film Contact, and Steven Spielberg's historical drama Amistad. However, during the 2000s, McConaughey became known for romantic comedies, which caused him to take a two-year hiatus from acting, though he came back better than ever.\n\nDuring a recent conversation with Interview Magazine, McConaughey reflected on why he considered retiring from acting early in his career. The actor, wanting to deviate from rom-coms, found it difficult to secure diverse roles and decided \"to leave Hollywood for two years.\" During this hiatus, he was uncertain about his future, even considering different career paths. Despite this, he remained committed to his decision, even though he was unsure if his career could ever recover. Read McConaughey's full comments below:\n\nI've usually zigged when I felt like Hollywood wanted me to zag. When I had my rom-com years, there was only so much bandwidth I could give to those, and those were some solid hits for me. But I wanted to try some other stuff. Of course I wasn't getting it, so I had to leave Hollywood for two years.\n\nDude, it was scary. I had long talks with my wife about needing to find a new vocation. \"I think I'm going to teach high school classes. I think I'm going to study to be a conductor. I think I'm going to go be a wildlife guide.\" I honestly thought, \"I stepped out of Hollywood. I got out of my lane.\" The lane Hollywood said I should stay in, and Hollywood's like, \"Well, f--k you, dude. You should have stayed in your lane. Later.\"\n\nIt was scary. The days are long -- the sense of insignificance. But I made up my mind that that's what I needed to do, so I wasn't going to pull the parachute and quit the mission I was on. But it was scary, because I didn't know if I was ever going to get out of the desert.\n\nWhy Matthew McConaughey Took A 2-Year Break From Acting & How He Came Back Better Than Ever Close\n\nAs mentioned, McConaughey broke through with a supporting role in Dazed and Confused, and his first success as a leading man came in dramas during the 1990s - such as A Time to Kill, Contact, Amistad, and U-571. However, during the subsequent decade, McConaughey became known for rom-coms, starring in The Wedding Planner, How to Lose a Guy in 10 Days, Failure to Launch, Fool's Gold, and Ghosts of Girlfriends Past - all of which solidified his status as a sex symbol and led to him being typecast as such.\n\nIt was during his rom-com years that McConaughey felt limited by those roles and wanted to explore different types of acting. However, he found it difficult to secure diverse roles, so he decided to take a break from acting for two years. When he returned, he started taking more serious roles again, starting with the legal drama The Lincoln Lawyer, and the following year, he started garnering critical acclaim for his performance as a stripper in Magic Mike and as a fugitive in Mud.\n\nRelated Matthew McConaughey's Best Movies, Ranked\n\nMatthew McConaughey is one of Hollywood's most versatile actors, with a thrilling filmography that offers a nice balance between comedy and drama.\n\nAnother year later, McConaughey reached the pinnacle of his career with his role in Dallas Buyers Club as Ron Woodroof, a cowboy diagnosed with AIDS, which won him an Academy Award for Best Actor. The same year, he had another brief but memorable appearance in The Wolf of Wall Street. Matthew McConaughey's hot streak continued the following year with his role as Rust Cohle in True Detective season 1, earning him an Emmy nomination, and headlined Christopher Nolan's sci-fi blockbuster, Interstellar.\n\nSome of McConaughey's upcoming roles include The Lost Bus and The Rivals of Amziah King .\n\nSource: Interview Magazine", "source": {"uri": "screenrant.com", "dataType":

McConaughey had lengthy discussions with his wife, Camila Alves McConaughey, about the uncertainty of his future. \"It was scary,\" he admitted. \"I was considering teaching high school, studying to conduct music, or even working as a wildlife guide.\"\n\nReflecting on the industry's reaction to his departure, McConaughey said, \"I honestly thought, 'I stepped out of Hollywood. I got out of my lane.' And Hollywood's like, 'Well, f -- you, dude. You should have stayed in your lane. Later.'\"\n\nMcConaughey's breakthrough came with the 1993 film 'Dazed and Confused'. He became a staple in romantic comedies in the early 2000s, notably starring alongside Kate Hudson in 'How to Lose a Guy in 10 Days' (2003). However, he took a noticeable break from acting in 2007 and 2010, with no credited roles during those years. By 2013, he had reinvented himself with dramatic roles in films like 'Dallas Buyers Club' and 'The Wolf of Wall Street'. His performance in 'Dallas Buyers Club' earned him an Oscar in 2014.\n\nDuring his hiatus, Matthew McConaughey faced many doubts. \"The days were long, and the sense of insignificance was overwhelming,\" he said. \"But I was determined to stick to my decision, even though I didn't know if I would ever make it out of what felt like a desert.\"\n\nMcConaughey's insights have also influenced others in the industry. In May, actor Powell shared how McConaughey's advice prompted him to move to Austin after more than 15 years in Los Angeles. \"Matthew told me, 'Hollywood is the Matrix, man. You plug in and it's all fake world,'\" Powell recalled. \"'Then I go to Austin, and I unplug. It's all real. Those are my friends, that's my family, my actions matter there.'\"\n\nMcConaughey's journey underscores the power of taking risks and staying true to oneself, even in the face of uncertainty. His courageous break from Hollywood not only reshaped his career but also highlighted the importance of authenticity in both personal and professional life.", "source": {"uri": "thestatesman.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Statesman"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hollywood,_Los_Angeles", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Hollywood, Los Angeles"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Romantic_comedy", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Romantic comedy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matthew_McConaughey", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Matthew McConaughey"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genre", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Genre"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dazed", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Dazed"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Camila_Alves", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Camila Alves"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kate_Hudson", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Kate Hudson"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dallas", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Dallas"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Dallas"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Academy_Awards", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Academy Awards"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los_Angeles", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Austin,_Texas", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Austin, Texas"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Austin, Texas"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Wolf_of_Wall_Street_(book)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "The Wolf of Wall Street (book)"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Performing_Arts/Acting", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Performing Arts/Acting", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Employment/Careers", "label": "dmoz/Business/Employment/Careers", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Movies/History", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Movies/History", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Music/Movies", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Music/Movies", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Human_Resources/Outplacement", "label": "dmoz/Business/Human Resources/Outplacement", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 96}], "image": "https://www.thestatesman.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Matthew-McConaughey.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9665294", "eventUri": "eng-9665294", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1215686274509804, "wgt": 184, "relevance": 1}

In a recent chat with Glen Powell for Interview Magazine, the actor recalled a period in his career when he chose to step away from the cameras.\n\n\"I've usually zigged when I felt like Hollywood wanted me to zag,\" Matthew, 54, said in an interview published June 10. \"When I had my rom-com years, there was only so much bandwidth I could give to those, and those were some solid hits for me. But I wanted to try some other stuff. Of course I wasn't getting it, so I had to leave Hollywood for two years.\"\n\nFor Matthew -- who starred in box office hits including How to Lose a Guy in 10 Days, Failure to Launch and The Wedding Planner -- he found support in his wife Camila Alves.\n\n\"I had long talks with my wife about needing to find a new vocation,\" he recalled. \"'I think I'm going to teach high school classes. I think I'm going to study to be a conductor. I think I'm going to go be a wildlife guide.' I honestly thought, 'I stepped out of Hollywood. I got out of my lane.' The lane Hollywood said I should stay in, and Hollywood's like, 'Well, f**k you, dude. You should have stayed in your lane. Later.'\"\n\nDuring that period of time, Matthew described the days as \"long\" and feeling a \"sense of insignificance.\"\n\n\"It was scary,\" he added. \"But I made up my mind that that's what I needed to do, so I wasn't going to pull the parachute and quit the mission I was on. But it was scary because I didn't know if I was ever going to get out of the desert.\"\n\nUltimately, Matthew isn't done making movies and TV shows anytime soon. While he still calls Texas home with his wife and their three kids Levi, 15, Vida, 14, and Livingston, 11, the actor recently appeared in Agent Elvis and is expected to star in Oscar nominee Paul Greengrass' upcoming drama The Lost Bus with America Ferrera.\n\nHe's also been able to step out of the Hollywood box by co-founding Pantalones Organic Tequila and serving as an instructor at his alma mater, the University of Texas at Austin.\n\n\"Time slowed down,\" the Just Because children's book author told Southern Living in March when discussing life in Texas. \"Part of that is just the distance between places and the way people move. But it's also the hospitality, the courtesy, the common sense, the lack of drama.\"", "source": {"uri": "hollywoodlife.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Hollywood Life"}, "authors": [{"uri": "mike_vulpo@hollywoodlife.com", "name": "Mike Vulpo", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hollywood,_Los_Angeles", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Hollywood, Los Angeles"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matthew_McConaughey", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Matthew McConaughey"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Record_chart", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Record chart"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Romantic_comedy", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Romantic comedy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glen_Powell", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Glen Powell"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interview_(magazine)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Interview (magazine)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Camila_Alves", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Camila Alves"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conducting", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Conducting"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secondary_school", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Secondary school"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Box_office", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Box office"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agent_Elvis", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Agent Elvis"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drama_(film_and_television)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Drama (film and television)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/America_Ferrera", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "America Ferrera"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Southern_Living", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Southern Living"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tequila", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Tequila"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Academy_Awards", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Academy Awards"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Levi_Strauss_&_Co.", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Levi Strauss & Co."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alma_mater", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Alma mater"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_Greengrass", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Paul Greengrass"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_Texas_at_Austin", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "University of Texas at Austin"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Children's_literature", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Children's literature"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Livingston,_New_Jersey", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Livingston, New Jersey"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Livingston, New Jersey"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Texas", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Texas"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Texas"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Performing_Arts/Acting", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Performing Arts/Acting", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Boxing", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Boxing", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Boxing/Gyms", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Boxing/Gyms", "wgt": 9}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Movies/History", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Movies/History", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Support_Groups/Twelve_Step", "label": "dmoz/Society/Support Groups/Twelve Step", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/matthew-mcconaughey-feature.jpg?quality=100&w=620", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9665294", "eventUri": "eng-9665294", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-06-10", "textStart": 328, "textEnd": 335}], "sentiment": -0.0117647058823529, "wgt": 164, "relevance": 1}

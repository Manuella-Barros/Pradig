The appointment of Deputy Inspector General (Operations) of CRPF Premjit Huidrom, who is a Meitei, raises serious concerns among the Churachandpur communities. The district populace rightfully questions whether the CRPF, under his leadership, can be impartial and trusted to ensure the safety and security of all communities,\" the statement continued.\n\nThe organizations cautioned that removing the Assam Rifles battalion could destabilize the fragile peace in the region and jeopardize residents' safety.\n\nThey warned that if the government proceeded with this \"ill-considered\" decision, the civil society organizations of Churachandpur would not remain silent observers.\n\n\"We call upon the government to reconsider this decision in the interest of peace and stability in Churachandpur,\" the statement further said.\n\nThe Kuki Students' Organisation (KSO) also criticized the decision, calling it \"untimely\" and potentially costly.\n\nThey argued that the Assam Rifles had earned the trust and respect of the hill people through years of effort and dedication, fostering mutual respect and peaceful coexistence.\n\n\"The Assam Rifles, after years of effort and dedication, won the hearts and minds of the hill people, which resulted in mutual respect and peaceful co-existence.

Around 36,000 personnel from the Indian Army and the Central Armed Police Forces (CAPFs) have been deployed in the State since then.\n\nRead Comments", "source": {"uri": "thehindu.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Hindu"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assam_Rifles", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Assam Rifles"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battalion", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Battalion"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jammu_division", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Jammu division"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jammu_and_Kashmir_(union_territory)", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Jammu and Kashmir (union territory)"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kangpokpi_district", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Kangpokpi district"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Myanmar", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Myanmar"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Myanmar"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Churachandpur_district", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Churachandpur district"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Churachandpur district"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meitei_language", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Meitei language"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kuki_people", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Kuki people"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_Reserve_Police_Force", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Central Reserve Police Force"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Hindu", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "The Hindu"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paramilitary", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Paramilitary"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/States_and_union_territories_of_India", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "States and union territories of India"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Terrorism", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Terrorism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manipur", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Manipur"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Manipur"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ethnic_violence", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Ethnic violence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hill_people", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Hill people"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Command_hierarchy", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Command hierarchy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Civil_society", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Civil society"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ajay_Kumar_Bhalla", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Ajay Kumar Bhalla"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_Armed_Police_Forces", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Central Armed Police Forces"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indian_Army", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Indian Army"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ministry_of_Home_Affairs_(India)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Ministry of Home Affairs (India)"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Guns", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Guns", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Guns/Rimfire", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Guns/Rimfire", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Guns/Model_or_Type_Specific", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Guns/Model or Type Specific", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Guns/Shooting", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Guns/Shooting", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 51}], "image": "https://th-i.thgim.com/public/incoming/st3xq8/article68474725.ece/alternates/LANDSCAPE_1200/20240627028L.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9784554", "eventUri": "eng-9784554", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "date": "-01-22", "textStart": 1190, "textEnd": 1200}, {"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-07-28", "textStart": 2075, "textEnd": 2082}], "sentiment": -0.2, "wgt": 223, "relevance": 1}

The legislators described the Assam Rifles as a \"neutral force\" and criticised the proposed replacement as a \"sinister design\", news agency PTI reported.\n\n\"We have come to learn that there is a plan to withdraw the 9th and 22nd Battalions of AR from their current sensitive deployment in Kangvai and Kangpokpi.

The 9th Assam Rifles Battalion has been tirelessly working to ensure stability and harmony between the two communities. Their deep understanding of local dynamics, cultural sensitivities, and the complex socio-political fabric of the region has been instrumental in preventing further escalation of violence and fostering an environment conducive to peace,\" the statement said.\n\nFurther, it said replacing the Assam Rifles battalion with the CRPF would not only be a strategic misstep but also a grave injustice to the people of Churachandpur.\n\nThe organisations said the CRPF, despite its commendable service across the nation, lacked the specific experience and nuanced understanding required to effectively manage the delicate situation in Manipur.\n\n\"The move is particularly alarming due to its perceived sinister design. The appointment of Deputy Inspector General (Operations) of CRPF Premjit Huidrom, who is a Meitei, raises serious concerns among the Churachandpur communities. The district populace rightfully questions whether the CRPF, under his leadership, can be impartial and trusted to ensure the safety and security of all communities,\" the statement said.\n\nThe organisations warned that the removal of the Assam Rifles battalion would destabilize the fragile peace equation in the region and jeopardize the safety of its residents.

administration or a Union Territory for the tribals, urged the Prime Minister and Home Minister separately not to withdraw two battalions of Assam Rifles from the Kuki-Zo-Hmar inhabited tribal areas.The 10 tribal MLAs, including two ministers -- Nemcha Kipgen and Letpao Haokip -- in separate memorandum to Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Home Minister Amit Shah, said that \"it is pertinent to cite that the un-biased service of the Assam Rifles in the fringe areas has been obviously instrumental in prevention of further escalation of violence till date\".\n\n\"The role played by the Assam Rifles so far in maintenance of law and order is absolutely neutral,\" the legislators said in their August 2 memorandum, released to the media on Saturday.\n\nThey claimed that the withdrawal of two battalions of the Assam Rifles from their current sensitive deployment at Kangvai and Kangpokpi is being done following \"pressure from the state government\".\n\nThe MLAs said: \"To maintain the current status-quo particularly in the buffer-zones separating the Meitei and Kuki-Zo communities, the undaunted and unbiased presence of the Assam Rifles is highly indispensable at this stage.\"\n\nOf the 10 tribal MLAs, seven are from the ruling BJP, two are from the Kuki People's Alliance and one is an Independent.\n\nCiting insecurity in Imphal, these legislators have been boycotting the Manipur assembly sessions, including the ongoing budget session, since the ethnic violence broke out in the northeastern state in May last year.\n\nHighly placed official sources in Imphal said that two battalions of the Assam Rifles will be moved from Manipur to Jammu and Kashmir to intensify counter-terror operations.\n\nInstead, two battalions of the Central Reserve Police Force (CRPF) would be deployed in Kuki-Zo-Hmar inhabited Churachandpur and Kangpokpi districts.\n\nThe counter-insurgency trained Assam Rifles, which operates under Army officers, has been hugely deployed since ethnic violence broke out in Manipur on May 3, 2023.\n\nEarlier, many Kuki-Zo-Hmar tribal organisations including Indigenous Tribal Leaders' Forum (ITLF), an apex body of tribals in Manipur, Committee on Tribal Unity (CoTU), World Kuki-Zo Intellectual Council, Zo United, Kuki Students' Organisation are agitating against the withdrawal of the Assam Rifles from the tribal dominated areas and also urged the Prime Minister and Home Minister not to withdraw the para-military force.\n\nOn the other hand, the Coordinating Committee on Manipur Integrity (COCOMI), an umbrella body of the Meitei community and a few other organisations have been demanding the replacement of the Assam Rifles by any other Central Armed Police Force (CAPF).\n\nThe COCOMI recently declared an indefinite boycott of the Assam Rifles in the state.", "source": {"uri": "weeklyvoice.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Weekly Voice"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

This has interfered with the communal designs of the majority Meiteis and their attempt to wipe out minority Kuki-Zo tribes using state machinery.\"\n\nBoth the COCOMI and Kuki-Hmar-Zo tribal

withdrawal of the Assam Rifles from the buffer zones between the hills inhabited by the Kuki-Zo-Hmar community people and the valley, predominantly occupied by the Meitei community.\n\nNoting that the

These two battalions were deployed in once violence-hit Manipur from where they have been directed to shift to Jammu,\" official sources told the Excelsior.\n\nThe battalions will be moving out shortly for Jammu and will be replaced in Manipur by an equal number of paramilitary Central Reserve Police Force (CRPF) jawans, they said.\n\nThe Assam Rifles comes under the Union Ministry of Home Affairs (MHA) and operational control of Army headed by a Lieutenant General-rank officer as the Director General.\n\nEarlier, the Assam Rifles had been part of Annual Shri Amarnath Ji yatra security arrangements in Jammu and Kashmir. However, now they will be part of Security Grid and actively involved in anti-terror operations which are being intensified in the Jammu region by multiple security agencies including Army, paramilitary forces and Jammu and Kashmir Police (JKP).\n\n\"Addition of nearly 2000 jawans of Assam Rifles in the Jammu region will further strengthen Security Grid and help security forces take on the terrorists in jungles and hills where they have taken shelter including inside some natural cave hideouts,\" the sources said.\n\nFew days back, the MHA had airlifted 2000 Border Security Force (BSF) jawans from Odisha for deployment along the International Border in Jammu, Samba and Kathua districts as it was suspected that some of the Pakistani terrorists had infiltrated from the border in these areas as well as neighbouring Punjab.\n\nPrior to this, 3000 more Army personnel were deployed in the region for stepping-up operations against the terrorists.\n\nArmy, CRPF and JKP have also started establishing permanent pickets in the mountainous areas in the region which will be manned 24\u00d77 to keep strict vigil on the terrorists and eliminate them by taking out regular patrol in the forest areas.\n\n\"The strategy will deliver as it will not only keep the hiding militants under check but also stop more terrorists from entering into jungles to take shelter in natural hideouts. Further, movement of the Over Ground Workers (OGWs) who might supply food and other items to the terrorists will be contained,\" the officials said.\n\nAt all these pickets, local police will also be in the forefront as they are well-versed with the routes leading to the forests.\n\nSecurity forces are also in the process of setting up camps in vulnerable areas other than the forests to keep vigil on any kind of movement of the terrorists. The Special Operation Group (SOG) of Jammu Police has also been setting up its camps in the mountainous areas of the region.", "source": {"uri": "dailyexcelsior.com", "dataType": "news", "title":

The Union Home Ministry is considering deploying more boots on ground in Jammu where security challenges are mounting during the ongoing counter terror operations. The strategy involves deployment of more than 2,000 troops of Assam Rifles and over 2,000 BSF personnel to step up security in the terror-hit Jammu region along the India-Pakistan border.\n\nThe Assam Rifles, a central paramilitary force that guards India's border with Myanmar, will be deployed in Jammu for the first time, according to reports. The paramilitary force, popularly known as Sentinels of the Northeast, is likely to have a small base in Jammu and Kashmir soon.\n\nTwo battalions of Assam Rifles, around 2,000 personnel of the oldest paramilitary force, will be drawn from violence-hit Manipur and relocated to Jammu owing to a series of terror attacks in the region after many years of relative peace. The Central Reserve Police Force (CRPF) will replace the Assam Rifles in the hill districts of Churachandpur and Kangpokpi in Manipur.\n\nThe Assam Rifles has been a border guarding force along the Indo-Myanmar border deployed in counter insurgency operations and to assist in maintaining peace in the region.\n\nBesides this, the government has also ordered the extraction of two BSF battalions, comprising more than 2,000 personnel, from Odisha and their deployment in Jammu to help check infiltration and terrorist activities in the hinterland. The decision to \"immediately\" move the two units from the anti-Naxal operations grid to Jammu was taken in the wake of the recent spate of terror attacks in the region, official sources told PTI.\n\nThe two Border Security Force (BSF) units, to be withdrawn from Malkangiri and Koraput districts of Odisha on Home Ministry's directions, are expected to be based in Samba and near the Jammu-Punjab border, the sources said.\n\nThere was a proposal to move two BSF battalions from Odisha to Chhattisgarh to intensify anti-Naxal operations there but these units are now being sent to Jammu, given the current situation.\n\n\"Two recent meetings, one in Delhi and one in Jammu, of the top security brass necessitated bolstering BSF deployment in Jammu. There was a proposal to move two BSF battalions from Odisha to Chhattisgarh to intensify anti-Naxal operations there but these units are now being sent to Jammu, given the current situation,\" said a

A total of 2,000 soldiers from the Assam Rifles, including rifle women, will be deployed to Jammu.\n\nKnown for their expertise in jungle warfare, including mountain climbing and cave finding, Assam Rifles will handle challenging operational situations in forested areas. The Home Ministry has issued the necessary instructions to the Assam Rifles headquarters.\n\nIt is pertinent to mention that the Jammu region, which had remained relatively peaceful from 2005 to 2021 after security forces eradicated decades-long terrorism, has seen a surge in terror attacks over the past month.\n\nEarlier, the government had ordered the extraction of two BSF battalions, comprising more than 2,000 personnel, from Odisha to beef up security in the terror-hit Jammu region along the India-Pakistan border. The decision to \"immediately\" move the two units from the anti-Naxal operations grid to Jammu was taken in the wake of the recent spate of terror attacks in the region.\n\nThe BSF guards more than 2,289 kilometres of the international boundary that runs along Jammu, Punjab, Rajasthan and Gujarat in India's western flank. The Jammu region accounts for 485 kilometres of this border, interspersed with dense forests and mountainous terrain. About a dozen BSF battalions are deployed along the international border region in Jammu.\n\nLast month, Prime Minister Narendra Modi chaired a review meeting to evaluate the security situation in Jammu and Kashmir following a series of terror attacks. The meeting, which included National Security Advisor Ajit Doval and Home Minister Amit Shah, provided a comprehensive overview of the situation.\n\nPM Modi had emphasised the need for a robust deployment of the country's full range of counter-terror capabilities to effectively address the threats. Following the review, he also held a discussion with Union Home Minister Amit Shah, focusing on the strategic deployment of security forces and the operational aspects of counter-terrorism measures. Additionally, the Prime Minister spoke with Jammu and Kashmir Lieutenant Governor Manoj Sinha to get an update on the local administration's efforts and the overall situation on the ground.\n\nAlso

rethink from the Centre.\n\nThe memorandum contended that the presence of the Assam Rifles is indispensable for maintenance of the current status-quo in 'buffer-zones', appealing that they may be replaced by other Battalions of the Assam Rifles instead.\n\nIt also claimed that the decision to withdraw the 9th and 22nd Battalions of the Assam Rifles from Kangvai and Kangpokpi, was taken following pressure from \"bias elements\" in the state government.\n\n\"We have come to learn that there is a plan to withdraw the 9th and 22nd Battalions of the Assam Rifles from their current sensitive deployment at Kangvai and Kangpokpi, following pressure from the communally biased elements in the state government who leave no stone unturned to portray the AR in a bad light just for the simple reason that they stood tall to serve as perhaps the finest neutral force so far\", stated the memorandum.\n\nThe document also maintained that the decision to replace the Assam Rifles battalion with the CRPF at this critical juncture is nothing but a sinister design to expedite the Meitei majoritarian ethnic cleansing campaign against the Kuki-Zo community.\n\nThe 10 MLAs further requested PM Modi's intervention for either withdrawal or rectification of the decision \"in the best interest of justice\".", "source": {"uri": "indiatoday.in", "dataType": "news", "title": "India Today"},

Another AR battalion being sent to Jammu is being deployed from Nagaland.\n\n\"The decision has been taken because the AR was required in Jammu. As they are better integrated with the Army and well trained for counter insurgency operation, we wanted to see if this would work. Moreover, CRPF is well equipped to handle law and order. They have done well in Kashmir Valley, hence some battalions of CRPF are being withdrawn from Jammu and being sent to Manipur,\" the officer said.\n\nSpeaking to ThePrint, MLA Paolienlal Haokip said that it is unfortunate that the Centre conceded to the demand of a Meitei civil society group, which will worsen the problem and the complexities in Manipur.\n\n\"The Central government needs to man up. They cannot succumb to a CM who is commanding a communal militia. If they do that, the worst is about to happen,\" he said.\n\nHe added that this kind of pressure from the majority community is the root of the problem in Manipur and if the Centre thinks this is the way forward, then \"they are worsening the problem\". He added that by removing AR, the Centre sent out a message that they do not trust their own force.\n\n\"The AR tried to balance things out and contain the violence and if the central government cannot see that and succumbed to communal pressure, we are not heading toward a solution to the problem, we are adding fuel to fire,\" he said.\n\nWhen asked about the central government's peace initiatives, including a peace committee set up by the Ministry of Home Affair, Haokip called them a \"sham\".\n\n\"Nothing has been done by the government, that is the tragedy of it. No single meeting has taken place. The home minister said that progress has been made, he met MLAs, met CSOs, but there is no such thing. They are fooling people. That will not lead to any solution,\" he said.\n\nTen Kuki MLAs had also written to PM Modi seeking his intervention to ensure that Assam Rifles continue to guard sensitive areas of the ethnic strife-torn state and are not replaced by CRPF.\n\nMeanwhile, Somorendro Thokchom, Coordinator, COCOMI, said that the decision by the Centre to remove AR is a \"victory\" for Manipur.\n\n\"Assam rifles have been here for years. They are very close to the Kukis. They support Kuki terrorists. They are never neutral. That is why we wanted them to be removed. We have so many proofs to show their connivance with the Kukis. We are grateful to the government for thinking of people of Manipur. It is a victory for us,\" he said to ThePrint.\n\nThe Assam Rifles also issued a statement last week, asserting that it \"plays a critical role in maintaining peace and security in Manipur\" and had adopted a \"balanced approach\" in maintaining security across all regions.\n\nAlso read: Assam Rifles to be deployed in Jammu's Machedi to beef up security grid, jungle warfare the focus\n\n'Centre has conveyed they are with Meiteis'\n\nSpeaking to ThePrint Janghaolun Haokip, Secretary, Kuki Inpi, said that by taking this decision, the Central government has conveyed that it is with the Meiteis and they will go to every extent to appease them.\n\n\"This is a biased and partial decision. This follows the demand of COCOMI, a Meitei civil society group that has been demanding removal of the Assam Rifles, just because they have been a neutral force since the beginning,\" he said.\n\nHaokip asked why should the central government listen to COCOMI while denying the voices of Kuki-zo people?\n\n\"That's how we perceive it. There is no solution unless there is justice for our people. There can be no form of reconciliation,\" he said.\n\nHe added that the Assam Rifles has the experience and knowledge to deal with the problem in the region and has played a role of a neutral force since the beginning of the conflict.\n\nThe Kuki Inpi had also submitted a memorandum to PM Modi requesting urgent intervention and reconsideration of replacing AR with the CRPF in Manipur.\n\nMinlal Gangte, Vice-President of the Kuki Students' Organisation in Churachandpur, asked why the government had to remove AR from Manipur, which is still under turmoil, as it could have done it from any other state from the Northeast.\n\n\"The Assam rifles were painted in the wrong light. They have a long history of keeping law and order in Manipur. They deal with the local people, they understand people, geography, and topography. Since the conflict broke out, they have been manning critical borders between Kuki and Meitei. Why did the government have to remove them at this point when they could have done the same from any other state if the AR was required in Jammu,\" he said.\n\nHe added that Assam Rifle has been a neutral force and have also arrested people of the Kuki community for holding illegal arms. He said that the decision to remove them was taken only because of the pressure from Meiteis.\n\n\"There is a lot of pressure from Meitei. MPs and people and state are asking for removal of AR. We wanted them to remain but no one heard us. Centre is giving into demands of the state, which will prove to be disastrous for Manipur,\" he said.\n\nHe added that the Kukis trusted the AR more as the officers in the force come from the Army. He said with the CRPF taking over, the state (N. Biren Singh government) will take full control of the CRPF too.\n\n\"CRPF will be under Biren Singh and completely against us. This will ensure that their agenda of ethnic cleansing is furthered. Not that we do not have faith in CRPF, but we are apprehensive that they will side with the state. Now we know that the Central government is not with us,\" he said.\n\nHe added that the decision will also further widen the gap between the two communities.\n\n\"The Centre is siding with the Meiteis. It is a clear indication, It shows who they support. This problem can never get solved,\" he said.\n\n(Edited by Zinnia Ray Chaudhuri)", "source": {"uri": "theprint.in", "dataType": "news", "title": "ThePrint"}, "authors": [{"uri": "ananya_bhardwaj@theprint.in", "name": "Ananya Bhardwaj", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meitei_language", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Meitei language"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kuki_people", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Kuki people"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_Reserve_Police_Force", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Central Reserve Police Force"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Insurgency", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Insurgency"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assam_Rifles", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Assam Rifles"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jammu", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Jammu"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Jammu"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Civil_society", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Civil society"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manipur", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Manipur"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Manipur"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ThePrint", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "ThePrint"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meitei_people", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Meitei people"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Narendra_Modi", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Narendra Modi"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Government_of_India", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Government of India"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battalion", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Battalion"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nagaland", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Nagaland"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Nagaland"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chief_minister", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Chief minister"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Member_of_the_Legislative_Assembly_(India)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Member of the Legislative Assembly (India)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ethnic_cleansing", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Ethnic cleansing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Appeasement", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Appeasement"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kashmir_Valley", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Kashmir Valley"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Militia", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Militia"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Army", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Army"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minister_of_Home_Affairs_(India)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Minister of Home Affairs (India)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Terrorism", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Terrorism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assam", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Assam"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Assam"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/N._Biren_Singh", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "N.

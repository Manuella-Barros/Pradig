He pleaded guilty to five counts of sexual abuse of a 13-year-old girl\n\nThe woman worked with police and secretly recored a phone conversation with Sutton who made a series of admissions to sexual abuse.\n\nSutton was convicted after pleading guilty to five offences and did not give any evidence to the court.\n\nDeclining to give evidence meant Sutton's victim did not have to undergo cross-examination.\n\nHowever, it allowed Sutton's lawyer to make assertions in his plea for mitigation that could never be challenged in court, according to The Observer in 2002.\n\nSutton told The Observer he no longer coached children under 16 years of age as 'it's the age of consent'.\n\n'My lawyer told me. That way, no one can say I am a paedophile,' Sutton said.\n\nRead More Australia's Olympics boss lashes out after man who raped a 12-year-old was selected for the Games\n\nMr Hall told Sutton, who was the national triathlon coach preparing a number of athletes for the Sydney Games, that they would 'suffer disadvantage from your absence from the scene'.\n\nSutton was subsequently banned from coaching by several federations, with the International Triathlon Union and Triathlon Australia imposing a three-year sanction.\n\nAustralia's National Olympic Committee told The Australian Sutton was 'banned for life from swimming in Australia following his sexual offences conviction'.\n\nSutton has also been banned for life by USA Triathlon since 2021.\n\nInternational Triathlon Union president Les McDonald commented on Sutton's career following his conviction.\n\nMr McDonald said any athlete coached by Sutton should not be allowed to compete internationally.\n\nHowever, Sutton has been allowed to rebuild his coaching career despite his conviction.\n\nSutton moved to Switzerland after his marriage collapsed following his conviction and has been at the helm of a family-run coaching business in the St Moritz ski resort for more than 20 years.\n\nSutton was given accreditation by China and trained Derron (centre) who won second place\n\nOn his website, Sutton claims to deliver success having crafted the careers of 'many of the sport's icons over the past 35 years' and charges $999 a month for his expertise.\n\nA spokesman for Sutton confirmed he was an accredited coach for China for the Paris Olympics.\n\nHe explained Sutton attended the Olympic games in 2020 in Tokyo, 2016 in Rio de Janeiro and 2012 in London as an accredited member of the Swiss team.\n\nA spokesman for the Swiss national Olympic committee told The Australian that athletes choose their own coach for the Games.\n\n'Brett Sutton does not work for Swiss Olympic, and he does not have any function for our organisation in Paris,' he said.\n\n'Swiss athletes decide for themselves who they work with as personal coaches.'\n\nSutton has since left the Paris Olympics as his athletes finished competing.",

He was given two years in prison, with the sentence suspended for three years.\n\nAccording to The Sunday Times the judge, Robert Hall, said Sutton had interfered with the girl in a 'gross and disgraceful way' and 'abused his role to an inexcusable degree'.\n\nHe did, however, note that as a national triathlon coach he was preparing a number of athletes for the Sydney Games and that they would 'suffer disadvantage from your absence from the scene'.\n\nSutton is banned from coaching by several foundations.\n\n'They are no longer here. They have left the Games,' Adams told reporters when questioned about Sutton. 'In the first instance, it's an issue for the Chinese Olympic Committee.'\n\nHe added: 'Whilst we have safeguarding measures in place, unfortunately things do occur from time to time and we will look into this.'\n\nSutton runs the Trisutto triathlon coaching company, which posted pictures of him at the finish line on Instagram as well as a video of him speaking to Swiss TV after Derron's surprise

convictions should be allowed to attend the Games.\n\nDutch paedophile Steven van de Velde was sentenced to four years in prison after raping a girl\n\nHe was booed by some fans when he made his first appearance on July 28 and has been separated from other Dutch athletes, meaning he is not staying at the athletes' village.\n\n'What is in the past is in the past, and he had his punishment,' van de Velde's teammate Matthew Immers said.\n\nTrisutto says on its website that 'no-one has produced more winning triathletes in the history of our sport' and claims the group has trained four Olympic medallists and 30 world champions.", "source": {"uri": "dailymail.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "Daily Mail Online"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

They have left the Games,\" IOC spokesman told reporters when questioned about Sutton. \"In the first instance, it's an issue for the Chinese Olympic Committee.\"\n\nSutton is associated with Trisutto, a triathlon coaching company.\n\nThe company posted images of him at the finish line, along with a video of him speaking to Swiss TV following Derron's unexpected second-place finish.\n\nIn 1999, Sutton admitted to five sex offenses against a teenage girl in Australia and received a suspended sentence.\n\nAnother controversy has arisen with Dutch beach volleyball player Steven van de Velde, who has a conviction for raping an underaged girl. The focus is now on whether individuals with historic sex abuse convictions should be permitted to attend the Games.\n\nVan de Velde was booed by some fans during his first appearance on July 28 and has been separated from other Dutch athletes, preventing him from staying at the athletes' village.\n\n\"What is in the past is in the past, and he had his punishment,\" van de Velde's teammate Matthew Immers said.\n\nNew agency AFP has contacted the Chinese National Olympic Committee for comment about Sutton.\n\nTrisutto says on its website that \"no-one has produced more winning triathletes in the history of our sport\" and claims the group has trained four Olympic medallists and 30 world champions.\n\nThe TOI Sports Desk excels in a myriad of roles that capture the essence of live sporting events and deliver compelling content to readers worldwide.

Just Ask the Football Coach He Worked Under", "body": "Rick Sutton describes his relationship with one-time assistant coach Tim Walz -- and how the pair managed to take their team to the top.\n\nVice President Kamala Harris' pick for her running mate is widely reported to be a former Minnesota high school football coach whose team won its first state championship ever.\n\nBut it is important to more precisely describe Tim Walz as a one-time assistant coach who served under head coach Rick Sutton at Mankato West High School.\n\nBeing number two has its particular challenges, and if Harris were to consult with Sutton about her choice, she would be assured that Walz proved a quarter-century ago that he is well able to make his informed opinion known and then set his ego aside if the head coach felt otherwise.\n\n\"Tim was really great at selling his point of view and then accepting a different direction,\" Sutton told the Daily Beast Tuesday. \"You can have disagreements, but at some point somebody has to make that decision, and that's going to be the head coach.\"\n\nWalz had previously been an assistant coach and geography teacher at Alliance High School in Alliance, Nebraska, the state where he was raised. His wife, Gewn, was an English teacher there and remained one when they moved to her home state of Minnesota in 1996. He joined her as a social studies teacher at Mankato West High. He also became an assistant football coach after what Sutton recalls as \"an informal interview.\"\n\n\"It was very obvious to me, right from the start that Tim was the guy that we definitely want on our staff,\" Sutton remembered.\n\nHis strengths as a coach were the same he brought as a teacher.\n\n\"I think anybody will tell you that good coaching is good teaching: enthusiasm about your subject, being knowledgeable, very competent, very energetic, very organized, very good at building relationships with players,\" Sutton noted.\n\nThe Mankato West Scarlets were on an extended losing streak of 27 consecutive games when Walz started as linebacker coach and defensive coordinator in 1996. The team was determined to change that.\n\n\"We talked a lot about the process of getting to where we wanted to go,\" Sutton recalled. \"Staying positive on a day-to-day basis and keeping the overall goal in mind. Getting players to believe and trust.\"\n\nBut, even with Walz doing his upbeat part, Sutton guiding the overall effort and everybody giving everything, the Scarlets still lost their first four games in the 1999 season. But those defeats were all against bigger schools. The remaining games were against opponents closer to their own size, and the Scarlets felt sure they could still become state champions.\n\n\"We had very high expectations that year,\" Sutton recalled. \"Our team thought that was something that was achievable, and we just had to keep staying positive, talking about the good things that were happening, and keep bringing the energy.\"\n\nSutton added, \"Coach Walz was always an extremely positive guy.\"\n\nThen, on Nov. 26, 1999, came the state championship game against the Cambridge-Isanti High School BlueJackets at the Metrodome in Minneapolis. The Bluejackets had one of the best running backs in the state, but the Scarlets' defense managed to largely control him. The Scarlets' offense staged a final, 45-yard drive in the last minutes and won 35 to 28.\n\n\"A really, really, really great high school football game,\" Sutton remembered.\n\nWaltz went on to become a U.S. congressman and then Minnesota governor, a role in which he proved to be a number one who could work closely with the number two, Lt. Gov. Peggy Flanagan.\n\nSutton said that after Walz left Mankato West, he sometimes encountered his former colleague in person, and other times saw him interviewed. Walz seemed to be exactly the same man who signed on as an assistant coach a quarter-century ago.\n\n\"He is who he is,\" Sutton said. \"He's not trying to change, to be somebody else because of whatever position he may be in.\"\n\nWalz remained very knowledgeable, very competent, very energetic, very organized, and very good at building relationships.\n\n\"It's the same things that have made Tim successful as a politician as well,:\" Sutton said.\n\nOn Monday, the news broke that Harris had picked Walz to be her running mate. And Sutton -- now co-head coach at the high school in Farmington, MN -- was confident that she made a wise decision.\n\nAs his team approaches a November championship of another kind, with democracy itself at stake, Walz is sure to be his positive, energetic, good-natured self, helping to send out the message that the team can win the really big one.", "source": {"uri": "thedailybeast.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Daily Beast"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mankato_West_High_School", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Mankato West High School"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sutton,_London", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Sutton, London"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Sutton, London"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tim_Walz", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Tim Walz"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Head_coach", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Head coach"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kamala_Harris", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Kamala Harris"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scarlets", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Scarlets"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minnesota", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Minnesota"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Minnesota"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Daily_Beast", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "The Daily Beast"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/High_school_football", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "High school football"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Running_mate", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Running mate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alliance,_Nebraska", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Alliance, Nebraska"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Alliance, Nebraska"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Defensive_coordinator", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Defensive coordinator"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linebacker", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Linebacker"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/English_language", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "English language"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_football", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "American football"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cambridge-Isanti_High_School", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Cambridge-Isanti High School"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lieutenant_Governor_of_New_York", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Lieutenant Governor of New York"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Governor_of_Minnesota", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Governor of Minnesota"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hubert_H._Humphrey_Metrodome", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Hubert H.

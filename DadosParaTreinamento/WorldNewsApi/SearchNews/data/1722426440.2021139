Russia's Foreign Ministry, in a note on its website, said a protest had been issued to Japan's embassy in connection with the announcement that drills would be held with Germany and Spain later this month.

Kishida is placing Tokyo on a path of dangerous escalation in Northeast Asia and throughout the Asia-Pacific region.\" Advertisement \u00b7 Scroll to continue Russia, the statement said, had warned of counter-measures to be taken to ensure the country's defence capability. Japan has thrown its support behind Ukraine since Russia invaded its neighbour more than two years ago. Tokyo and Moscow have failed to resolve a territorial dispute over four islands off Hokkaido described by Japan as the Northern Territories and by Moscow, which controls them, as the Kuril islands. The dispute has prevented the two sides concluding a peace treaty since the end of World War Two, when the islands were seized by the Soviet Union. Japan has periodically expressed unease about Russia strengthening its military infrastructure on the disputed islands.

The public offered mixed reactions on what they would do, had they been face-to-face with the gator.\n\n\"I'd jump on top of it and wrestle that baby down,\" Danny Thomas said.\n\nWKRG News 5 doesn't recommend wrestling an alligator, especially one that Alabama Wildlife Services confirmed was 11 feet long and 300 pounds.\n\nDon't be too shocked at Thomas's response. He wasn't the only Mobilian who said he'd take matters into his own hands.\n\n\"There's a gator? I'm gonna beat up the gator. I'm gonna jump on it,\" Doug Deluca said. \"What else am I supposed to do?\"\n\nJohn Woodham said he probably would wrestle an alligator the size of the one found on Water Street early Thursday morning.\n\n\"If you get a little bit smaller and you get down to like six feet or something, I think I'd probably try to hop on top of it,\" Woodham said. \"Man, okay, but you've gotta think, though. Half of the alligator, half of it is its tail, right? It isn't gonna do nothing with that tail.\"\n\nUnfortunately for Woodham, this gator didn't like being poked by the Alabama Wildlife Services, let alone wrestled.\n\nThe gator wiggled through a hole in a fence on Water Street and was found near the Gulf, Mobile and Ohio Passenger Terminal. (The fence that the gator came through has since been fixed.)\n\nThe Mobile Police Department redirected traffic around the alligator while Alabama Wildlife Solutions led the gator back into the hole in the fence it originally went through.\n\n\"I'm not fighting an alligator,\" David Koch said.\n\nSulynn Creswell said she would run away from the alligator. She also said she's not surprised to hear of an alligator downtown.\n\n\"Alligators are everywhere these days,\" Cresswell said.\n\nAngie Lee quickly pointed out her escape plan had she encountered the gator.\n\n\"I always heard that they run a straight line and they run it very quickly in a short distance,\" Lee said.\n\n\"So, if you zig-zag, they try to follow you and they can't do it very fast.\"", "source": {"uri": "wkrg.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "WKRG News 5"}, "authors": [{"uri": "asher_redd@wkrg.com", "name": "Asher Redd", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alligator", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Alligator"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mobile,_Alabama", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Mobile, Alabama"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Mobile, Alabama"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mobile_Bay", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Mobile Bay"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WKRG-TV", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "WKRG-TV"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Danny_Thomas", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Danny Thomas"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swamp", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Swamp"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gulf_Coast_of_the_United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Gulf Coast of the United States"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pound_sterling", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Pound sterling"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alabama", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Alabama"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Alabama"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mabila", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Mabila"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Koch", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "David Koch"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Wrestling", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Wrestling", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Wrestling", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Wrestling", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://www.wkrg.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/49/2024/05/WKRG-Aligator-in-Downtown-Street-REAX-PKG.00_02_47_20.Still002.jpg?strip=1&w=640", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9555137", "eventUri": "eng-9555137", "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Mobile, Alabama"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.01960784313725483, "wgt": 452992839, "relevance": 2}], "totalResults": 6, "page": 1, "count": 1, "pages": 6}}}

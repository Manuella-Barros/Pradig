It\u2019s an idea that emerged in other places around the world, too. Buddhism, for instance, is grounded in the concept of impermanence: the world, and even we ourselves, are constantly changing, Buddha tells us, and it\u2019s our inability to accept or reconcile ourselves to that impermanence that leads to so much of the pain and suffering we see in the world. These are ancient ideas, but they\u2019re more relevant than ever for today\u2019s organizations and leaders. If change seemed omnipresent and inescapable for Heraclitus and Buddha, then it\u2019s all the more so in today\u2019s VUCA world. Think about all the information overload, fast-changing technologies, and political, social, and economic turmoil we now encounter from one day to the next. Leading in a World in Flux To cope with the complexity, change, and flux that we now see around us, leaders need to understand that they can\u2019t simply ignore or avoid the new reality. Nor can they expect old leadership styles and approaches to be effective and see them through. The reality is that our ever-changing world requires us to find our way to new, more resilient, and interconnected ways of knowing, leading, and succeeding. To lead through the complexities of a world in flux, rather than being led, we can\u2019t simply resign ourselves to drifting, anchorless, and directionless. We need a new understanding and a new approach to leading.

It will also require them to model and teach those capabilities\u2014and, in doing so, to help everyone on their teams to creatively and successfully adapt or learn how to live in uncertainty. The challenge, of course, is finding a path to this kind of clarity. In chaotic times, it can feel challenging to stay clear-headed and optimistic and be an inspiring leader for your team! Time for Knowledge Mindfulness To stay energized and level-headed, leaders need to recognize that the central problem we\u2019re facing is really one of knowledge and Knowledge Maturity. The chaos, confusion, and complexity we feel are symptoms of our knowledge falling out of sync with the fast-changing world around us\u2014or of us losing confidence in our knowledge and feeling that we don\u2019t know where (or who) to turn to for the trusted new kinds of knowledge that we need. All of these challenges can be addressed through Knowledge Mindfulness, which helps us to gain the understanding of knowledge that we need in order to adapt more quickly, effectively, and creatively to cultivate new trusted sources of knowledge and activate the knowledge we already have more confidently and to connect more deeply with others (and with aspects of ourselves!) in order to reach the holistic success we all aspire to, even during chaotic and challenging times. There\u2019s no escaping flux: it\u2019s the very fabric of the world we live in. But as leaders, we can choose how we respond to that flux and how we help our teams navigate these chaotic waters. By adopting Knowledge Mindfulness\u2019s integrative new approach to leadership, we can elevate and evolve our knowledge maturity and thus give ourselves and our teams the conviction and clarity we need to move forward and upward with confidence\u2014even in the challenging and profoundly complex world we now share!

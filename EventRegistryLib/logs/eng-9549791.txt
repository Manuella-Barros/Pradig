A day earlier, the judge in his Florida classified documents case indefinitely postponed that trial date.\n\nTrump and some other defendants in Georgia had tried to get Willis and her office removed the case, saying her romantic relationship with special prosecutor Nathan Wade created a conflict of interest. Superior Court Judge Scott McAfee in March found no conflict of interest existed that should force Willis off the case, but he granted a request from Trump and the other defendants to seek an appeal of his ruling from the Georgia Court of Appeals.\n\nThat intermediate appeals court agreed Wednesday to take up the case. Once it rules, the losing side could ask the Georgia Supreme Court to consider an appeal.\n\nTrump's lead attorney in Georgia, Steve Sadow, said in an email the former president looks forward to presenting arguments to the appeals court as to why the case should be dismissed and why Willis \"should be disqualified for her misconduct in this unjustified, unwarranted political persecution.\"\n\nA spokesperson for Willis declined to comment on the Court of Appeals decision to take up the matter.\n\nIn his order, McAfee said he planned to continue to address other pretrial motions \"regardless of whether the petition is granted ... and even if any subsequent appeal is expedited by the appellate court.\" But Trump and the others could ask the Court of Appeals to stay the case while the appeal is pending.\n\nMcAfee wrote in his order in March the prosecution was \"encumbered by an appearance of impropriety.\" He said Willis could remain on the case only if Wade left, and the special prosecutor submitted his resignation hours later.\n\nThe allegations Willis had improperly benefited from her romance with Wade resulted in a tumultuous couple of months in the case as intimate details of Willis and Wade's personal lives were aired in court in mid-February. The serious charges in one of four criminal cases against the Republican former president were largely overshadowed by the love lives of the prosecutors.\n\nTrump and 18 others were indicted in August, accused of participating in a wide-ranging scheme to illegally try to overturn his narrow 2020 presidential election loss to Democrat Joe Biden in Georgia.\n\nAll of the defendants were charged with violating Georgia's Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations, or RICO, law, an expansive anti-racketeering statute. Four people charged in the case have pleaded guilty after reaching deals with prosecutors. Trump and the others have pleaded not guilty.\n\nTrump and other defendants had argued in their appeal application McAfee was wrong not to remove both Willis and Wade, writing \"providing DA Willis with the option to simply remove Wade confounds logic and is contrary to Georgia law.\"\n\nThe allegations against Willis first surfaced in a motion filed in early January by Ashleigh Merchant, a lawyer for former Trump campaign staffer and onetime White House aide Michael Roman. The motion alleged Willis and Wade were involved in an inappropriate romantic relationship and that Willis paid Wade large sums for his work and then benefitted when he paid for lavish vacations.\n\nWillis and Wade acknowledged the relationship but said they didn't begin dating until the spring of 2022, after Wade was hired in November 2021, and their romance ended last summer. They also testified that they split travel costs roughly evenly, with Willis often paying expenses or reimbursing Wade in cash.\n\nFormer President Donald Trump, with his attorney Todd Blanche, speaks to reporters following the day's proceedings in his trial, Tuesday, May 7, 2024, in New York.

The serious charges in one of four criminal cases against the Republican former president were largely overshadowed by the love lives of the prosecutors.\n\nTrump and 18 others were indicted in August, accused of participating in a wide-ranging scheme to illegally try to overturn his narrow 2020 presidential election loss to Democrat Joe Biden in Georgia.\n\nAll of the defendants were charged with violating Georgia\u00b4s Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations, or RICO, law, an expansive anti-racketeering statute.

Superior Court Judge Scott McAfee in March found that no conflict of interest existed that should force Willis off the case, but he granted a request from Trump and the other defendants to seek an appeal of his ruling from the Georgia Court of Appeals.\n\nAlso Read | India Will Offer Alternative To China for Investors With PM Narendra Modi, Mukesh Ambani, Gautam Adani Reshaping Nation to Become Economic Superpower, Reports CNN.\n\nThat intermediate appeals court agreed on Wednesday to take up the case. Once it rules, the losing side could ask the Georgia Supreme Court to consider an appeal.\n\nThe appeals court's decision to consider the case seems likely to cause a delay in a case and further reduce the possibility that it will get to trial before the November general election, when Trump is expected to be the Republican nominee for president.\n\nAlso Read | Israel-Gaza Conflict: Israel Reopens Kerem Shalom Border Crossing for Delivery of Aid to War-Torn Nation.\n\nIn his order, McAfee said he planned to continue to address other pretrial motions \"regardless of whether the petition is granted ... and even if any subsequent appeal is expedited by the appellate court.\" But Trump and the others could ask the Court of Appeals to stay the case while the appeal is pending.\n\nMcAfee wrote in his order in March that the prosecution was \"encumbered by an appearance of impropriety.\" He said Willis could remain on the case only if Wade left, and the special prosecutor submitted his resignation hours later.\n\nThe allegations that Willis had improperly benefited from her romance with Wade resulted in a tumultuous couple of months in the case as intimate details of Willis and Wade's personal lives were aired in court in mid-February. The serious charges in one of four criminal cases against the Republican former president were largely overshadowed by the love lives of the prosecutors.\n\nTrump and 18 others were indicted in August, accused of participating in a wide-ranging scheme to illegally try to overturn his narrow 2020 presidential election loss to Democrat Joe Biden in Georgia.\n\nAll of the defendants were charged with violating Georgia's Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organisations, or RICO, law, an expansive anti-racketeering statute. Four people charged in the case have pleaded guilty after reaching deals with prosecutors. Trump and the others have pleaded not guilty.\n\nTrump and other defendants had argued in their appeal application that McAfee was wrong not to remove both Willis and Wade, writing that \"providing DA Willis with the option to simply remove Wade confounds logic and is contrary to Georgia law.\"\n\nThe allegations against Willis first surfaced in a motion filed in early January by Ashleigh Merchant, a lawyer for former Trump campaign staffer and onetime White House aide Michael Roman. The motion alleged that Willis and Wade were involved in an inappropriate romantic relationship and that Willis paid Wade large sums for his work and then benefitted when he paid for lavish vacations.\n\nWillis and Wade acknowledged the relationship but said they didn't begin dating until the spring of 2022, after Wade was hired in November 2021, and their romance ended last summer. They also testified that they split travel costs roughly evenly, with Willis often paying expenses or reimbursing Wade in cash.(AP)", "source": {"uri": "latestly.com", "dataType": "news", "title":

The Georgia Court of Appeals issued a brief order granting Trump's request, saying that he can file a notice of appeal within the next 10 days; it's unclear when arguments will be held. The DA's office declined to comment.\n\nTrump attorney Steve Sadow said in a statement on social media that the court granted Trump's appeal of Judge Scott McAfee's decision to allow Willis to continue leading the prosecution, and that the case should be dismissed and Willis disqualified: \"President Trump looks forward to presenting interlocutory arguments to the Georgia Court of Appeals as to why the case should be dismissed and Fulton County DA Willis should be disqualified for her misconduct in this unjustified, unwarranted political persecution.\"\n\nJudge McAfee ruled in mid-March that Willis shouldn't be disqualified from prosecuting Trump and his co-defendants despite their allegation that she had a conflict of interest in the case. They accused Willis of misconduct, alleging she financially benefited from her relationship with special prosecutor Nathan Wade, which led to days of testimony in court about their romance. McAfee ultimately decided found the \"appearance of impropriety\" created by their personal relationship should result in either Willis or Wade leaving the case. Hours later, Willis' office confirmed Wade had resigned and she had accepted his resignation.\n\nMcAfee granted a certificate of immediate review days later, giving Trump and eight of his co-defendants permission to appeal his decision to keep Willis on the case. This gave the court of appeals 45 days to decide whether to hear an appeal on the matter. Lawyers for Trump and the other defendants then asked the appeals court to allow them to challenge the ruling.\n\nThe appeals court decision Wednesday comes as Trump continues to sit for trial in the criminal case he faces in New York; one of four criminal cases against him going to trial.\n\nEditorial credit: Natalia Bratslavsky / Shutterstock.com", "source": {"uri": "wabcradio.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "77 WABC Radio"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fani_Willis", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Fani Willis"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Georgia_Court_of_Appeals", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Georgia Court of Appeals"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/District_attorney", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "District attorney"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Georgia_(U.S._state)", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Georgia (U.S. state)"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Georgia (U.S. state)"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Racketeering", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Racketeering"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2020_United_States_presidential_election", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "2020 United States presidential election"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Appeal", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Appeal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conflict_of_interest", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Conflict of interest"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lawyer", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Lawyer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_media", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Social media"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fulton_County,_Georgia", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Fulton County, Georgia"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Fulton County, Georgia"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special_counsel", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Special counsel"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_(state)", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "New York (state)"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Appellate_court", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Appellate court"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Trials", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Trials", "wgt": 18}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Law", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Law", "wgt": 21}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Flying_Discs/Double_Disc_Court", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Flying Discs/Double Disc Court", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Racquetball/Courts", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Racquetball/Courts", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Bocce", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Bocce", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 52}], "image": "https://dehayf5mhw1h7.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/1494/2024/05/09100534/Shutterstock_57939448333188.webp", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9549791", "eventUri": "eng-9549791", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.2470588235294118, "wgt": 216, "relevance": 1}

appeals court has agreed to review a lower court ruling allowing Fulton County District Attorney Fani Willis to continue to prosecute the election interference case she brought against former President Donald Trump.\n\nMr Trump and some other defendants in the case had tried to get Ms Willis and her office removed from the case, saying her romantic relationship with special prosecutor Nathan Wade created a conflict of interest.\n\nSuperior Court Judge Scott McAfee in March found that no conflict of interest existed that should force Ms Willis off the case, but he granted a request from Mr Trump and the other defendants to seek an appeal of his ruling from the Georgia Court of Appeals.\n\nOnce it rules, the losing side could ask the Georgia Supreme Court to consider an appeal.\n\nThe appeals court's decision to consider the case seems likely to cause a delay and further reduce the possibility that it will get to trial before the November general election, when Mr Trump is expected to be the Republican nominee for president.\n\nIn his order, Judge McAfee said he planned to continue to address other pretrial motions \"regardless of whether the petition is granted... and even if any subsequent appeal is expedited by the appellate court\".\n\nBut Trump and the others could ask the Court of Appeals to stay the case while the appeal is pending.\n\nJudge

resulted in a tumultuous couple of months in the case as intimate details of Ms Willis and Mr Wade's personal lives were aired in court in mid-February.\n\nThe serious charges in one of four criminal cases against the Republican former president were largely overshadowed by the love lives of the prosecutors.\n\nMr Trump and 18 others were indicted in August, accused of participating in a wide-ranging scheme to illegally try to overturn his narrow 2020 presidential election loss to Democrat Joe Biden in Georgia.\n\nAll of the defendants were charged with violating Georgia's Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organisations, or Rico, law, an expansive anti-racketeering statute.\n\nFour people charged in the case have pleaded guilty after reaching deals with prosecutors.\n\nMr Trump and other defendants had argued in their appeal application that Judge McAfee was wrong not to remove both Ms Willis and Mr Wade, writing that \"providing DA Willis with the option to simply remove Wade confounds logic and is contrary to Georgia law\".\n\nThe allegations against Ms Willis first surfaced in a motion filed in early January by Ashleigh Merchant, a lawyer for former Trump campaign staffer and onetime White House aide Michael Roman.\n\nThe motion alleged that Ms Willis and Mr Wade were involved in an inappropriate romantic relationship and that Ms Willis paid Mr Wade large sums for his work and then benefitted when he paid for lavish vacations.\n\nMs Willis and Mr Wade acknowledged the relationship but said they didn't begin dating until the spring of 2022, after Mr Wade was hired in November 2021, and their romance ended last summer.\n\nThey also said that they split travel costs roughly evenly, with Ms Willis often paying expenses or reimbursing Mr Wade in cash.",

McAfee's ruling, though, required Nathan Wade, then a special prosecutor who was romantically involved with Willis, to withdraw from the case. Wade resigned in the wake of McAfee's decision.\n\nThe Georgia Court of Appeals issued a brief order granting Trump's request that it take up his appeal. It's unclear when arguments will be held.\n\n\"President Trump looks forward to presenting interlocutory arguments to the Georgia Court of Appeals as to why the case should be dismissed and Fulton County DA Willis should be disqualified for her misconduct in this unjustified, unwarranted political persecution,\" Sadow said in a statement.\n\nThe district attorney's office declined to comment.\n\nTrump and more than a dozen of his allies were charged in a sprawling racketeering case brought by Willis last year, which accuses them of engaging in an unlawful scheme to overturn the results of the 2020 election in Georgia. The former president and the 18 co-defendants charged alongside him all pleaded not guilty. Four later accepted plea deals.\n\nThe case was derailed after one of those co-defendants, Michael Roman, accused Willis and Wade in January of having an improper romantic relationship that began before Wade was hired to work on the election case in November 2021. Roman, a longtime GOP operative, claimed that Willis financially benefited from the relationship, since Wade allegedly paid for trips, hotel rooms and travel expenses using money he received through his work as a special prosecutor.\n\nTrump, Roman and seven others sought to have Willis and her office removed from the case and the charges against them dismissed.\n\nWade and Willis both acknowledged they were romantically involved, but disputed claims that their relationship began before Wade's hiring. Both took the stand during an evidentiary hearing in February, where Willis forcefully defended herself from allegations of wrongdoing. The two testified that they split the costs associated with their travels, and Willis said she often reimbursed Wade in cash for her share.\n\nMcAfee issued a highly anticipated ruling in March that rejected the effort to have Willis and her office kicked off the case as long as Wade stepped aside, which allowed the prosecution to move forward. But the judge was scathing in his decision and chastised Willis for what he said was a \"tremendous lapse in judgement.\"\n\nMcAfee said that while he could not conclusively establish when Wade and Willis' relationship became romantic, \"an odor of mendacity remains.\" Following his decision, the judge allowed Trump and the eight others to seek review of his ruling from the Georgia Court of Appeals. But McAfee said then that he intended to continue addressing unrelated pretrial matters.\n\nThe defendants submitted a formal application to appeal McAfee's decision in March, and the appeals court had 45 days to decide whether to take up the matter. Trump could ask the Georgia Court of Appeals to pause proceedings while it considers the disqualification issue.\n\nThe court's decision to grant Trump's appeal will likely delay the start of any trial, though no date has been set for it to begin. The case in Fulton County is one of four Trump is facing as he mounts a third bid for the White House. His first criminal trial is currently underway in Manhattan, where local prosecutors charged him with 34 counts of falsifying business records. He pleaded not guilty to those charges.\n\nTwo other cases were brought by special counsel Jack Smith in federal courts in Washington, D.C., and South Florida. The D.C. case involves an alleged effort to subvert the transfer of presidential power after the 2020 election, and the Florida case involves Trump's alleged mishandling of sensitive government records after leaving the White House.\n\nThe former president pleaded not guilty to the federal charges he faces, and trials in each of those cases have been indefinitely postponed.\n\nThe developments in Fulton County mean it's increasingly unlikely that the three outstanding trials will be held before the November presidential election. Trump, the presumptive Republican presidential nominee, is set to face-off against President Biden in a rematch of the 2020 contest.", "source": {"uri": "cbsnews.com", "dataType": "news", "title":

Alex Slitz/Associated Press\n\nThe move seems likely to delay the case and is the second time in as many days that the former president has gotten a favorable ruling that could push any future trials beyond the November election, when he is expected to be the Republican nominee for president. A day earlier, the judge in his Florida classified documents case indefinitely postponed that trial date.\n\nTrump and some other defendants in Georgia had tried to get Willis and her office removed the case, saying her romantic relationship with special prosecutor Nathan Wade created a conflict of interest. Superior Court Judge Scott McAfee in March found that no conflict of interest existed that should force Willis off the case, but he granted a request from Trump and the other defendants to seek an appeal of his ruling from the Georgia Court of Appeals.\n\nThat intermediate appeals court agreed on Wednesday to take up the case.

He does not have that option for the New York or Georgia cases, but legal experts say state prosecutors likely would not move forward while he is president.\n\nAn April Reuters/Ipsos poll found that 60% of registered voters thought it was important that Trump's criminal trials take place before the election. A similar number of registered voters, including one in four Republicans, said they would not vote for Trump if a jury convicted of him of a felony.\n\nCHALLENGE TO WILLIS\n\nTrump and eight of his 14 co-defendants charged in the Georgia case have urged the appeals court to overturn a state judge's March ruling allowing Willis to continue supervising the prosecution.\n\nTrump has pleaded not guilty and accused prosecutors of a politically motivated effort to damage his campaign.\n\n\"The case should be dismissed and Fulton County DA Willis should be disqualified for her misconduct in this unjustified, unwarranted political persecution,\" Steve Sadow, Trump's lead lawyer on the Georgia case, said in a statement.\n\nA spokesperson for Willis' office did not immediately respond to a request for comment today.\n\nThe appeal must be resolved before the case can move to trial.\n\nThe exact timeline is uncertain, but it will likely take at least a few months for lawyers to file legal briefs and schedule arguments. The case could be assigned to the court's April term, which would require a ruling by Nov. 1, four days before the election.\n\nTrump and the eight co-defendants moved to disqualify Willis after revealing that she had had a romance with Nathan Wade, an outside lawyer she hired to help lead the investigation. Wade booked several vacations with Willis while he was being paid by her office, an arrangement the defense argued posed a conflict of interest.\n\nTrump's lawyer has also argued that Willis improperly suggested the defendants and their lawyers had racial motivations. Both Willis and Wade are Black.\n\nWillis and Wade have acknowledged having a relationship, but said it began after Wade was hired to work on the case and ended before charges were filed. Willis' office has denied allegations of misconduct and said the relationship had no impact on the case.\n\nFulton County Judge Scott McAfee ruled the relationship did not pose a conflict of interest but said it created an appearance of wrongdoing. McAfee said Willis' office could remain on the case if Wade stepped aside, which he agreed to do.\n\nMcAfee later gave permission for Trump and his co-defendants to appeal his ruling before trial.\n\nTrump and the 14 co-defendants have pleaded not guilty to racketeering and other charges stemming from what prosecutors allege was a scheme to overturn Trump's narrow defeat in Georgia in the 2020 election. Four others who had been co-defendants in the case have pleaded guilty in deals with the prosecutors.\n\nA trial date has not yet been set.

The judge in Trump's Florida lawsuit involving confidential materials had postponed the trial date indefinitely the day before.\n\nDue to Willis's intimate relationship with special prosecutor Nathan Wade, which clearly seemed like a conflict of interest, Trump and other defendants in Georgia worked to have Willis and her office removed from the case. However, Judge Scott McAfee of the Superior Court ruled in March that there was no conflict of interest that prevented Willis from taking the case.\n\nNevertheless, the judge did approve Trump and the other defendants' request to appeal the decision to the Georgia Court of Appeals.\n\nOn Wednesday, the intermediate appeals court decided to take on the case.\n\nThe former president is looking forward to making arguments to the appeals court about why the case should be dismissed and why Willis \"should be disqualified for her misconduct in this unjustified, unwarranted political persecution,\" according to an email from Trump's lead attorney, Steve Sadow.\n\nRegardless of whether the petition is granted or the appellate court expedites any subsequent appeal, McAfee stated in his ruling that he will still handle other pretrial motions. However, while the appeal is pending, Trump and others may ask the Court of Appeals to halt the case.\n\nThe case was \"encumbered by an appearance of impropriety,\" according to McAfee's March order. He stated that Willis could continue working on the case only if Wade resigned, and a few hours later, the special prosecutor handed in his resignation.\n\nIntimate aspects of Willis and Wade's private lives were revealed in court in mid-February, sparking a turbulent few months in the lawsuit due to claims that Willis had unfairly profited from her relationship with Wade. The romantic lives of the prosecutors completely overshadowed the serious charges in one of the four criminal cases against the former GOP president.\n\nIn August, Trump and eighteen other individuals were indicted on charges of allegedly engaging in an extensive plot to unlawfully reverse his narrow defeat to Democrat candidate Joe Biden in Georgia's 2020 presidential election. The defendants were all accused of breaking Georgia's anti-racketeering law known as the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations, or RICO, law.\n\nEven though four individuals pleaded guilty after reaching deals, Trump has still pleaded not guilty.\n\nIn their appeal filing, Trump and the other defendants contended that McAfee erred in failing to remove Wade as well as Willis, stating that \"providing DA Willis with the option to simply remove Wade confounds logic and is contrary to Georgia law.\"\n\nThe charges against Willis were initially revealed in a motion that Michael Roman's former White House assistant and former Trump campaign member, Ashleigh Merchant, filed early in January. The motion maintained that Wade and Willis were having an improper romantic relationship and that Willis was heavily overpaying Wade for his job while she took equal advantage by benefiting from vacations Wade paid for that she would allegedly later reimburse him for.\n\nStay informed!

He does not have that option for the New York or Georgia cases, but legal experts say state prosecutors likely would not move forward while he is president.\n\nAn April Reuters/Ipsos poll found that 60% of registered voters thought it was important that Trump's criminal trials take place before the election. A similar number of registered voters, including one in four Republicans, said they would not vote for Trump if a jury convicted of him of a felony.\n\nTrump and eight of his 14 co-defendants charged in the Georgia case have urged the appeals court to overturn a state judge's March ruling allowing Willis to continue supervising the prosecution.\n\nTrump has pleaded not guilty and accused prosecutors of a politically motivated effort to damage his campaign.\n\n\"The case should be dismissed and Fulton County DA Willis should be disqualified for her misconduct in this unjustified, unwarranted political persecution,\" Steve Sadow, Trump's lead lawyer on the Georgia case, said in a statement.\n\nA spokesperson for Willis' office did not immediately respond to a request for comment on Wednesday.\n\nThe appeal must be resolved before the case can move to trial.\n\nThe exact timeline is uncertain, but it will likely take at least a few months for lawyers to file legal briefs and schedule arguments. The case could be assigned to the court's April term, which would require a ruling by Nov. 1, four days before the election.\n\nTrump and the eight co-defendants moved to disqualify Willis after revealing that she was romantically involved with Nathan Wade, an outside lawyer she hired to help lead the investigation. Wade booked several vacations with Willis while he was being paid by her office, an arrangement the defense argued posed a conflict of interest.\n\nTrump's lawyer has also argued that Willis improperly suggested the defendants and their lawyers had racial motivations. Both Willis and Wade are Black.\n\nWillis and Wade have acknowledged having a relationship, but said it began after Wade was hired to work on the case. Willis' office has denied allegations of misconduct and said the relationship had no impact on the case.\n\nFulton County Judge Scott McAfee ruled the relationship did not pose a conflict of interest but said it created an appearance of wrongdoing. McAfee said Willis' office could remain on the case if Wade stepped aside, which he agreed to do.\n\nMcAfee later gave permission for Trump and his co-defendants to appeal his ruling before trial.\n\nTrump and the 14 co-defendants have pleaded not guilty to racketeering and other charges stemming from what prosecutors allege was a scheme to overturn Trump's narrow defeat in Georgia in the 2020 election.

appeals court agrees to review ruling allowing DA to stay on Trump case", "body": "Mr Trump and other defendants in the case had tried to get District Attorney Fani Willis and her office removed.\n\nA Georgia appeals court has agreed to review a lower court ruling allowing Fulton County District Attorney Fani Willis to continue to prosecute the election interference case she brought against former President Donald Trump.\n\nMr Trump and some other defendants in the case had tried to get Ms Willis and her office removed from the case, saying her romantic relationship with special prosecutor Nathan Wade created a conflict of interest.\n\nSuperior Court Judge Scott McAfee in March found that no conflict of interest existed that should force Ms Willis off the case, but he granted a request from Mr Trump and the other defendants to seek an appeal of his ruling from the Georgia Court of Appeals.\n\nThat intermediate appeals court agreed to take up the case on Wednesday.\n\nOnce it rules, the losing side could ask the Georgia Supreme Court to consider an appeal.\n\nThe appeals court's decision to consider the case seems likely to cause a delay and further reduce the possibility that it will get to trial before the November general election, when Mr Trump is expected to be the Republican nominee for president.\n\nIn his order, Judge McAfee said he planned to continue to address other pretrial motions \"regardless of whether the petition is granted... and even if any subsequent appeal is expedited by the appellate court\".\n\nBut Trump and the others could ask the Court of Appeals to stay the case while the appeal is pending.\n\nJudge McAfee wrote in his order in March that the prosecution was \"encumbered by an appearance of impropriety\".\n\nHe said Ms Willis could remain on the case only if Mr Wade left, and the special prosecutor submitted his resignation hours later.\n\nThe allegations that Ms Willis had improperly benefited from her romance with Mr Wade resulted in a tumultuous couple of months in the case as intimate details of Ms Willis and Mr Wade's personal lives were aired in court in mid-February.\n\nThe serious charges in one of four criminal cases against the Republican former president were largely overshadowed by the love lives of the prosecutors.\n\nMr Trump and 18 others were indicted in August, accused of participating in a wide-ranging scheme to illegally try to overturn his narrow 2020 presidential election loss to Democrat Joe Biden in Georgia.\n\nAll of the defendants were charged with violating Georgia's Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organisations, or Rico, law, an expansive anti-racketeering statute.\n\nFour people charged in the case have pleaded guilty after reaching deals with prosecutors.\n\nMr Trump and the others have pleaded not guilty.\n\nMr Trump and other defendants had argued in their appeal application that Judge McAfee was wrong not to remove both Ms Willis and Mr Wade, writing that \"providing DA Willis with the option to simply remove Wade confounds logic and is contrary to Georgia law\".\n\nThe allegations against Ms Willis first surfaced in a motion filed in early January by Ashleigh Merchant, a lawyer for former Trump campaign staffer and onetime White House aide Michael Roman.\n\nThe motion alleged that Ms Willis and Mr Wade were involved in an inappropriate romantic relationship and that Ms Willis paid Mr Wade large sums for his work and then benefitted when he paid for lavish vacations.\n\nMs Willis and Mr Wade acknowledged the relationship but said they didn't begin dating until the spring of 2022, after Mr Wade was hired in November 2021, and their romance ended last summer.\n\nThey also said that they split travel costs roughly evenly, with Ms Willis often paying expenses or reimbursing Mr Wade in cash.", "source": {"uri": "shropshirestar.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Shropshire Star"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fani_Willis",

At appealing the decision to keep Fani Willis in charge of those election interference charges from 2020.\n\nIt's a no brainer!\n\nAnd so now Trump's got a 10-day window to file his notice of appeal. I'm sure its already prepared and ready to go!\n\nThis courtroom showdown just took an interesting twist!\n\nGeorgia's state Court of Appeals said Wednesday that it will consider an appeal from former President Donald Trump challenging the decision not to disqualify Fani Willis as the district attorney overseeing the 2020 election interference charges against him.\n\nThe order said that Trump can file a notice of appeal within the next 10 days.\n\nA lawyer for Trump, Steve Sadow, said in a statement that the former president \"looks forward\" to arguing before the appeals court that the case should be dismissed and Willis disqualified \"for her misconduct in this unjustified, unwarranted political persecution.\"\n\nThe DA's office declined to comment.\n\nThe judge presiding over the case, Scott McAfee, ruled in mid-March that Willis shouldn't be disqualified from prosecuting Trump and his co-defendants despite their allegation that she had a conflict of interest in the case. They accused Willis of misconduct, alleging she financially benefited from her relationship with special prosecutor Nathan Wade, which led to days of testimony in court about their romance.\n\nMcAfee ultimately decided found the \"appearance of impropriety\" created by their personal relationship should result in either Willis or Wade leaving the case. Hours later, Willis' office confirmed Wade had resigned and she had accepted his resignation.\n\nIn a statement, Trump attorney Steve Sadow said, \"President Trump looks forward to presenting interlocutory arguments to the Georgia Court of Appeals as to why the case should be dismissed and Fulton County DA Willis should be disqualified for her misconduct in this unjustified, unwarranted political persecution.\"\n\nThe Fulton County DA's office declined to comment to ABC News.\n\nIn March, Judge McAfee declined to disqualify Willis, the Fulton County DA, based on allegations that she and prosecutor Nathan Wade conspired to bring the election interference case to enrich themselves with public money.\n\nAn attorney for Mike Roman, who first filed the disqualification motion in January, said in a statement to ABC News that they are \"very pleased\" with the decision and \"feel confident\" Willis will be disqualified.\n\n\"We are very pleased that the Georgia Court of Appeals agreed that this was an issue of such great importance that it required to be heard prior to any trial in this case,\" Ashleigh Merchant, Roman's attorney, said in the statement. \"We feel confident that, when it reviews the clear evidence of conflict in this case, the Court of Appeals will agree with us and disqualify Ms. Willis and her entire office from further prosecution of this matter and require that a neutral prosecutor be appointed to review whether these charges are even appropriate.\"\n\nLegal experts tell ABC News that while the appeals court's ruling does not automatically pause the interference case, it is very possible the case will be significantly delayed, further reducing the likelihood that there will be a trial in Georgia before the presidential election.\n\nOnce the appeal is docketed, said an order from the court on the disqualification issue can take up to six months, experts said. Judge McAfee had vowed to keep the case going during this time, but Trump and his codefendants can now ask for a stay while the appeal works its way through the system.", "source": {"uri": "100percentfedup.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "100 Percent Fed Up"}, "authors": [{"uri": "m_winger@100percentfedup.com", "name": "M Winger", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fani_Willis", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Fani Willis"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Appeal", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Appeal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/District_attorney", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "District attorney"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lawyer", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Lawyer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2020_United_States_presidential_election", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "2020 United States presidential election"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electoral_fraud", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Electoral fraud"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fulton_County,_Georgia", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Fulton County, Georgia"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Fulton County, Georgia"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special_counsel", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Special counsel"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Georgia_Court_of_Appeals", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Georgia Court of Appeals"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conflict_of_interest", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Conflict of interest"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ABC_News", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "ABC News"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2016_United_States_presidential_election", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "2016 United States presidential election"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prosecutor", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Prosecutor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Georgia_(U.S._state)", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Georgia (U.S. state)"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Georgia (U.S. state)"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Law/Legal_Information", "label": "dmoz/Society/Law/Legal Information", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Crime_and_Justice", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Crime and Justice", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Trials", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Trials", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Law/Courts", "label": "dmoz/Society/Law/Courts", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Law", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Law", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 78}], "image": "https://100percentfedup.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/trump-laughing-fani-willis-sad-2-1200x630-1-1600x900.png", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9549791", "eventUri": "eng-9549791", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.0117647058823529, "wgt": 209, "relevance": 1}

when a Georgia appeals court agreed to hear his bid to disqualify the district attorney prosecuting him for trying to overturn his election loss in the state.\n\nThe ruling prolongs the legal battle over a former romance between Fani Willis, the district attorney in Fulton County, and a one-time top deputy, a relationship defence lawyers have used to try to derail the case.\n\nIt came a day after a federal judge in Florida appointed to the bench by Trump indefinitely postponed the start of his trial on charges of mishandling classified documents after leaving the White House.\n\nThe Republican presidential candidate and eight of his 14 co-defendants charged in the Georgia case have urged the appeals court to overturn a state judge's March ruling that allowed Willis to continue supervising the prosecution.\n\nTheNightlyGet in front of tomorrow's news for FREE\n\nJournalism for the curious Australian across politics, business, culture and opinion.\n\nREAD NOW\n\nThe court's decision to hear the appeal before trial could cause further delays in the case, one of four criminal prosecutions facing Trump as he seeks to unseat Democratic President Joe Biden in the November 5 election.\n\nTrump has pleaded not guilty and accused prosecutors of a politically motivated effort to damage his campaign.\n\n\"The case should be dismissed and Fulton County DA Willis should be disqualified for her misconduct in this unjustified, unwarranted political persecution,\" Steve Sadow, Trump's lead lawyer on the Georgia case, said in a statement.\n\nTrump and the eight co-defendants moved to disqualify Willis after revealing that she had had a romance with Nathan Wade, an outside lawyer she hired to help lead the investigation.\n\nWade booked several holidays with Willis while he was being paid by her office, an arrangement the defence argued posed a conflict of interest.\n\nTrump's lawyer has also argued that Willis improperly suggested the defendants and their lawyers had racial motivations.\n\nWillis and Wade have acknowledged having a relationship but said it began after Wade was hired to work on the case and ended before charges were filed.\n\nWillis' office has denied allegations of misconduct and said the relationship had no effect on the case.\n\nFulton County Judge Scott McAfee ruled the relationship did not pose a conflict of interest but said it created an appearance of wrongdoing.\n\nMcAfee said Willis' office could remain on the case if Wade stepped aside, which he agreed to do.\n\nMcAfee later gave permission for Trump and his co-defendants to appeal his ruling before trial.\n\nTrump and the 14 co-defendants have pleaded not guilty to racketeering and other charges stemming from what prosecutors allege was a scheme to overturn Trump's narrow defeat in Georgia in the 2020 election.\n\nFour others who had been co-defendants in the case have pleaded guilty in deals with the prosecutors.\n\nA trial date has not yet

The ruling prolongs the legal battle over a former romance between Fani Willis, Fulton County's district attorney, and a onetime top deputy, a relationship defense lawyers have used to try to derail the case.\n\nDonald Trump notched another win in his campaign to slow the criminal cases against him on Wednesday, when a Georgia appeals court agreed to hear his bid to disqualify the district attorney prosecuting him for trying to overturn his election loss in the state.\n\nThe ruling prolongs the legal battle over a former romance between Fani Willis, Fulton County's district attorney, and a onetime top deputy, a relationship defense lawyers have used to try to derail the case. The court's decision to hear the appeal before trial means further delay in the case, one of four criminal prosecutions facing the Republican former president as he seeks to unseat Democratic President Joe Biden in the Nov. 5 election.\n\n\"The practical significance is we're not going to have a trial in Georgia prior to the election,\" said Amy Lee Copeland, a former federal prosecutor in the state. The decision came a day after a federal judge in Florida nominated to the bench by Trump indefinitely postponed the start of his trial on charges of mishandling classified documents after leaving the White House.\n\nA federal case related to Trump's attempts to subvert the 2020 election has also been stalled while the U.S. Supreme Court weighs Trump's assertion that former presidents are immune from prosecution for official acts taken while in office. Taken together, recent developments have made it far more likely that Trump's ongoing trial in New York related to hush money payments to a porn star ahead of the 2016 election is the only case that will reach a jury before voters cast their ballots.\n\n\"This shouldn't be a huge surprise,\" Bob Driscoll, a Washington-based defense lawyer who has represented people close to Trump, told Reuters. \"The cases are all factually complex, legally novel, or both.\" If Trump wins the presidency, he can potentially order the Justice Department to drop the two federal cases against him once he takes office in January 2025. He does not have that option for the New York or Georgia cases, but legal experts say state prosecutors likely would not move forward while he is president.\n\nAn April Reuters/Ipsos poll found that 60% of registered voters thought it was important that Trump's criminal trials take place before the election. A similar number of registered voters, including one in four Republicans, said they would not vote for Trump if a jury convicted of him of a felony. CHALLENGE TO WILLIS\n\nTrump and eight of his 14 co-defendants charged in the Georgia case have urged the appeals court to overturn a state judge's March ruling allowing Willis to continue supervising the prosecution. Trump has pleaded not guilty and accused prosecutors of a politically motivated effort to damage his campaign.\n\n\"The case should be dismissed and Fulton County DA Willis should be disqualified for her misconduct in this unjustified, unwarranted political persecution,\" Steve Sadow, Trump's lead lawyer on the Georgia case, said in a statement. A spokesperson for Willis' office did not immediately respond to a request for comment on Wednesday.\n\nThe appeal must be resolved before the case can move to trial. The exact timeline is uncertain, but it will likely take at least a few months for lawyers to file legal briefs and schedule arguments. The case could be assigned to the court's April term, which would require a ruling by Nov. 1, four days before the election.\n\nTrump and the eight co-defendants moved to disqualify Willis after revealing that she was romantically involved with Nathan Wade, an outside lawyer she hired to help lead the investigation. Wade booked several vacations with Willis while he was being paid by her office, an arrangement the defense argued posed a conflict of interest. Trump's lawyer has also argued that Willis improperly suggested the defendants and their lawyers had racial motivations. Both Willis and Wade are Black.\n\nWillis and Wade have acknowledged having a relationship, but said it began after Wade was hired to work on the case. Willis' office has denied allegations of misconduct and said the relationship had no impact on the case. Fulton County Judge Scott McAfee ruled the relationship did not pose a conflict of interest but said it created an appearance of wrongdoing. McAfee said Willis' office could remain on the case if Wade stepped aside, which he agreed to do.\n\nMcAfee later gave permission for Trump and his co-defendants to appeal his ruling before trial. Trump and the 14 co-defendants have pleaded not guilty to racketeering and other charges stemming from what prosecutors allege was a scheme to overturn Trump's narrow defeat in Georgia in the 2020 election. Four others who had been co-defendants in the case have pleaded guilty in deals with the prosecutors.\n\nA trial date has not yet been set.\n\n(This story has not been edited by Devdiscourse staff and

As usual, their prime target is Fulton County District Attorney Fani Willis, and, on Wednesday, a Georgia appeals court agreed to review the bid to get Willis disqualified from prosecuting the RICO case.\n\nAs we previously reported in March, Fulton County Superior Court Judge Scott McAfee ruled earlier this year that a relatively brief romantic relationship between Willis and the special prosecutor she appointed to the case of Trump-and-pals, Nathan Wade, didn't amount to the ethical misconduct and conflict of interest that was asserted by an attorney for RICO defendant Michael Roman, who argued Wade, Willis and her entire office should be barred from prosecuting the case because Willis and Wade were involved in an inappropriate romantic relationship, that Willis paid Wade large sums of money for his work and that she benefitted when he paid for lavish vacations.\n\nMORE: Reclaiming Her Time: Fani T. Willis' Letter to Nathan Wade After Trump's Motion Was Defeated\n\nBut Roman's legal team wasn't able to prove anything outside of the fact that Willis and Wade had a relationship, because arguing things without being able to back them up with evidence is pretty much what happens in Trump Land. So, while McAfee acknowledged that the relationship did present the \"appearance of impropriety,\" he said he couldn't simply remove them from the case \"without sufficient evidence\" of anything else the Roman's people were accusing them of -- which had the MAGA World hopping MAGA mad.\n\nMcAfee did rule that either Willis or Wade had to recuse themselves from the case, which Wade did shortly after, and that should have been enough to put the issue to bed and move the RICO case forward, but it was never going to be enough for Willis' legal opponents, who really only seem to want to delay the case until after the presidential election in November, and, as a bonus, to tear down and humiliate a Black woman whose only \"crime\" was having an active social life.\n\nFrom the Associated Press:\n\nThat intermediate appeals court agreed on Wednesday to take up the case. Once it rules, the losing side could ask the Georgia Supreme Court to consider an appeal.\n\nTrump's lead attorney in Georgia, Steve Sadow, said in an email that the former president looks forward to presenting arguments to the appeals court as to why the case should be dismissed and why Willis \"should be disqualified for her misconduct in this unjustified, unwarranted political persecution.\"\n\nIn his order, McAfee said he planned to continue to address other pretrial motions \"regardless of whether the petition is granted ... and even if any subsequent appeal is expedited by the appellate court.\" But Trump and the others could ask the Court of Appeals to stay the case while the appeal is pending.\n\nTrump's attorneys keep pretending the RICO case represents some grave miscarriage of justice because they want so badly for it to be perceived as normal that a sitting president responded to losing an election by throwing an extended temper tantrum, launching into a propaganda campaign alleging widespread voter fraud that didn't exist, harassing election workers (who are also Black women) who were just doing their jobs, and putting pressure on Georgia officials to \"find votes\" for Trump that also didn't exist.\n\nAnd, again, if Trump, his co-defendants and their legal teams can continue their misogynoir-inspired public attack on Willis, that just puts the icing on their corrupt white nationalist cake.\n\nMAGA Nuts Flood Social Media With White Tears After Fani Willis Isn't Disqualified From Prosecuting Trump\n\n'Whore': Donald Trump Jr. Posts

(Atlanta News First) - The Georgia Court of Appeals has agreed to hear an appeal from former President Donald Trump over a judge's decision allowing Fulton County District Attorney Fani Willis to remain on the case, despite her admitted romantic relationship with a former special prosecutor.\n\nAt the same time, the court has denied a similar appeal from Harrison Floyd, one of the remaining 14 co-defendants and the only person indicted who actually spent time in jail after not posting bail.\n\n\"President Trump looks forward to presenting interlocutory arguments to the Georgia Court of Appeals as to why the case should be dismissed and Fulton County DA Willis should be disqualified for her misconduct in this unjustified, unwarranted political persecution,\" Steve Sadow, one of the former president's lead Georgia attorneys, said immediately after the court's announcement.\n\nOn April 1, Trump and the remaining defendants in Georgia's historic racketeering indictment formally appealed Fulton County Superior Court Judge Scott McAfee's ruling. That appeal came after McAfee gave the green light to allow such an appeal over his decision. The appeal was signed by all of the attorneys representing the remaining co-defendants who have not already settled the case in Fulton County Superior Court.\n\nIn March, McAfee rejected defense efforts to remove Willis and her office over her romantic relationship with special prosecutor Nathan Wade, but he did give the defendants permission to seek a review of his decision from the appeals court. In his ruling, McAfee wrote Willis must remove Wade from the racketeering indictment if she were to remain on the case. Wade resigned just hours after that ruling.\n\n\"While the trial court factually found DA Willis' out-of-court statements were improper and defendants proved an apparent conflict of interest, the trial court erred as a matter of law by not requiring dismissal and DA Willis's disqualification,\" the appeal from Trump's and other defense attorneys said. \"To avoid structural error that would invalidate and require a repeat of the upcoming trials, to establish needed precedent in the area of disqualifying forensic misconduct and to protect and maintain the public's confidence in the integrity of the criminal justice system, (the) court should grant the application.\"\n\n\"President Trump and eight other defendants filed their joint application for interlocutory appeal today. Defendants argued in the trial court that the indictment should have been dismissed and, at a minimum, DA Willis and her office should have been disqualified from prosecuting the case,\" Sadow said in the initial request. \"The Georgia Court of Appeals should grant the application and accept the interlocutory appeal for consideration on the merits.\"\n\nThe move to disqualify Willis began in early January after Michael Roman, one of Trump's co-defendants, and Ashleigh Merchant, Roman's attorney, accused Willis and Wade of having an improper relationship. Both Willis and Wade have since acknowledged a romantic relationship.\n\nThe allegations that Willis had improperly benefited from her romance with Wade upended the case for weeks. Intimate details of Willis and Wade's personal lives were aired in court in mid-February. Trump and 18 others were indicted in August, accused of illegally trying to overturn his narrow 2020 presidential election loss to Democrat Joe Biden in Georgia.\n\nTrump himself has already become the first ex-president in American history to stand trial on criminal charges, as witness testimony continues in his hush money trial. Trump is going on trial on 34 felony counts that he falsified his company's business records in an attempt to cover up a hush-money payment to adult film star Stephanie Clifford, aka Stormy Daniels.\n\nTrump has pleaded not guilty to all of the criminal cases that have been filed against him since he left the White House in 2021, including those filed by Willis.\n\nThe Atlanta-based district attorney indicted Trump and 18 others in August 2023 on charges of engaging in a criminal, racketeering-like attempt to overturn Georgia's 2020 election. That election saw Joe Biden become the first Democrat since Bill Clinton in 1992 to carry Georgia or any other deep Southern state.\n\nMcAfee has also rejected arguments from Trump and his attorneys that the actions of the nation's 45th president are protected by the First Amendment.", "source": {"uri": "wrdw.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "https://www.wrdw.com"}, "authors": [], "concepts":

Superior Court Judge Scott McAfee in March found that no conflict of interest existed that should force Willis off the case, but he granted a request from Trump and the other defendants to seek an appeal of his ruling from the Georgia Court of Appeals.\n\nThat intermediate appeals court agreed on Wednesday to take up the case. Once it rules, the losing side could ask the Georgia Supreme Court to consider an appeal.\n\nThe appeals court's decision to consider the case seems likely to cause a delay in a case and further reduce the possibility that it will get to trial before the November general election, when Trump is expected to be the Republican nominee for president.\n\nIn his order, McAfee said he planned to continue to address other pretrial motions \"regardless of whether the petition is granted ... and even if any subsequent appeal is expedited by the appellate court.\" But Trump and the others could ask the Court of Appeals to stay the case while the appeal is pending.\n\nMcAfee wrote in his order in March that the prosecution was \"encumbered by an appearance of impropriety.\" He said Willis could remain on the case only if Wade left, and the special prosecutor submitted his resignation hours later.\n\nThe allegations that Willis had improperly benefited from her romance with Wade resulted in a tumultuous couple of months in the case as intimate details of Willis and Wade's personal lives were aired in court in mid-February.

Four people charged in the case have pleaded guilty after reaching deals with prosecutors. Trump and the others have pleaded not guilty.\n\nTrump and other defendants had argued in their appeal application that McAfee was wrong not to remove both Willis and Wade, writing that \"providing DA Willis with the option to simply remove Wade confounds logic and is contrary to Georgia law.\"\n\nThe allegations against Willis first surfaced in a motion filed in early January by Ashleigh Merchant, a lawyer for former Trump campaign staffer and onetime White House aide Michael Roman.

He does not have that option for the New York or Georgia cases, but legal experts say state prosecutors likely would not move forward while he is president.\n\nAn April Reuters/Ipsos poll found that 60% of registered voters thought it was important that Trump's criminal trials take place before the election. A similar number of registered voters, including one in four Republicans, said they would not vote for Trump if a jury convicted of him of a felony.\n\nCHALLENGE TO WILLIS\n\nTrump and eight of his 14 co-defendants charged in the Georgia case have urged the appeals court to overturn a state judge's March ruling allowing Willis to continue supervising the prosecution.\n\nTrump has pleaded not guilty and accused prosecutors of a politically motivated effort to damage his campaign.\n\n\"The case should be dismissed and Fulton County DA Willis should be disqualified for her misconduct in this unjustified, unwarranted political persecution,\" Steve Sadow, Trump's lead lawyer on the Georgia case, said in a statement.\n\nA spokesperson for Willis' office did not immediately respond to a request for comment on Wednesday.\n\nThe appeal must be resolved before the case can move to trial.\n\nThe exact timeline is uncertain, but it will likely take at least a few months for lawyers to file legal briefs and schedule arguments. The case could be assigned to the court's April term, which would require a ruling by Nov. 1, four days before the election.\n\nTrump and the eight co-defendants moved to disqualify Willis after revealing that she was romantically involved with Nathan Wade, an outside lawyer she hired to help lead the investigation. Wade booked several vacations with Willis while he was being paid by her office, an arrangement the defense argued posed a conflict of interest.\n\nTrump's lawyer has also argued that Willis improperly suggested the defendants and their lawyers had racial motivations. Both Willis and Wade are Black.\n\nWillis and Wade have acknowledged having a relationship, but said it began after Wade was hired to work on the case. Willis' office has denied allegations of misconduct and said the relationship had no impact on the case.\n\nFulton County Judge Scott McAfee ruled the relationship did not pose a conflict of interest but said it created an appearance of wrongdoing. McAfee said Willis' office could remain on the case if Wade stepped aside, which he agreed to do.\n\nMcAfee later gave permission for Trump and his co-defendants to appeal his ruling before trial.\n\nTrump and the 14 co-defendants have pleaded not guilty to racketeering and other charges stemming from what prosecutors allege was a scheme to overturn Trump's narrow defeat in Georgia in the 2020 election.

In a 51-page appeal, Trump and his co-defendants asked the appeals court to overturn a March 15 decision that allowed Willis to remain on the case if Wade stepped aside.\n\nThe court's Wednesday decision likely means another delay in the Fulton County case, where prosecutors allege Trump and his co-defendants tried to interfere with the Georgia 2020 election results. There is currently no set trial date for the criminal case, but CNN reported Willis wanted to try it this summer.\n\n\"President Trump looks forward to presenting interlocutory arguments to the Georgia Court of Appeals as to why the case should be dismissed and Fulton County DA Willis should be disqualified for her misconduct in this unjustified, unwarranted political persecution,\" Trump's Georgia lawyer, Steve Sadow, said in a statement to The Daily Beast.\n\nThe order says Trump's team can file an appeals notice within the next 10 days.\n\nWade and Willis' relationship was first made public in January, when a defense lawyer for co-defendant Mike Roman accused the DA of misconduct and called for her disqualification. The motion spurred a February evidentiary hearing, where both confirmed they had been in a relationship from early 2022 until last summer. The pair, however, denied Willis financially or politically benefited from her relationship with Wade, whom she hired in November 2021.\n\nJudge Scott McAfee ruled in March that the relationship had the \"significant appearance of impropriety,\" but there was no evidence of an \"actual conflict of interest.\" Wade resigned from his position hours after the ruling.\n\nIn an April response to the appeal, Willis asked the appeals court to uphold McAfee's ruling and noted that the judge declined to dismiss the indictment against Trump and his co-defendants.\n\n\"There being no error by the trial court, the present application merely reflects the applicants' dissatisfaction with the trial court's proper application of well-established law to the facts,\" the motion says. \"Because the applicants have wholly failed to carry their burden of persuasion, this Court should decline interlocutory review.\"", "source": {"uri": "thedailybeast.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Daily

Four others who had been co-defendants in the case have pleaded guilty in deals with the prosecutors.\n\nA trial date has not yet been set.\n\n(Reporting by Andrew Goudsward; Editing by Scott Malone, Lisa Shumaker, Susan Heavey and Jonathan Oatis)", "source": {"uri": "wsau.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "WSAU News/Talk 550 AM \u00b7 99.9 FM | Wausau, Stevens Point"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/District_attorney", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "District attorney"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Georgia_(U.S._state)", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Georgia (U.S. state)"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Georgia (U.S. state)"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fulton_County,_Georgia", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Fulton County, Georgia"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Fulton County, Georgia"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fani_Willis", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Fani Willis"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_federal_judge", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States federal judge"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lawyer", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Lawyer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_House", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "White House"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republican_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Republican Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Florida", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Florida"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Florida"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Washington,_D.C.", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Washington, D.C."}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Washington, D.C."}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Biden", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acquittal", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Acquittal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conflict_of_interest", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Conflict of interest"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Democratic Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Racketeering", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Racketeering"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2020_United_States_presidential_election", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "2020 United States presidential election"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scott_Malone", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Scott Malone"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reuters", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Reuters"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Law/Legal_Information", "label": "dmoz/Society/Law/Legal Information", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Crime_and_Justice", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Crime and Justice", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Trials", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Trials", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Law", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Law", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 88}], "image": "https://storage.googleapis.com/media.mwcradio.com/mimesis/2024-05/08/2024-05-08T135411Z_2_LYNXMPEK470JA_RTROPTP_3_USA-TRUMP-GEORGIA.JPG", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9549791", "eventUri": "eng-9549791", "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Washington, D.C."}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "date": "-11-05", "textStart": 1135, "textEnd": 1141}], "sentiment": -0.1372549019607843, "wgt": 206, "relevance": 1}

Willis (D) to continue prosecuting the election interference case against the former president and several allies.\n\nIn a brief notice, the Georgia Court of Appeals said it had \"granted\" the request for appeal and ordered Trump and his co-defendants to file a \"notice of appeal\" within 10 days.\n\nThe decision comes nearly six weeks after Trump and eight co-defendants accused of illegally conspiring to overturn Trump's 2020 election loss in Georgia asked the court to reverse a decision keeping Willis and her office on the case. The effort to remove her was based on claims she engaged in an improper relationship with an outside attorney she appointed to lead the investigation.\n\nThe Trump filing asked the court to reverse a decision by Fulton County Superior Court Judge Scott McAfee, who said in a March 15 order that Trump and the others had \"failed to meet their burden\" of proving that Willis's romantic relationship with special prosecutor Nathan Wade and allegations that she was financially enriched by trips the two took together were enough of a \"conflict of interest\" to disqualify her from the case.\n\nBut McAfee did find a \"significant appearance of impropriety\" and ruled that either Willis and her office or Wade had to leave the case. Wade resigned later that day.\n\nAttorneys for Trump and his co-defendants argued in their March 29 filing that Wade's departure was not enough to resolve the \"appearance of impropriety\" that has \"cast a pall over these entire proceedings.\" It called McAfee's decision to keep Willis on the case an \"erroneous failure\" and a \"structural error that would not just cause substantial error at trial\" but could later cause a verdict to be overturned.\n\n\"It is neither prudent nor efficient to require the courts, the parties, or taxpayers to run the significant and avoidable risk of having to go through this painful, divisive, and expensive process more than once when an existing structural error can be remedied by this Court now,\" the filing stated.\n\nTrump and the others also argued that McAfee erred in not disqualifying Willis over remarks she made in a Jan. 14 speech at a historic Black church in Atlanta where she suggested that the criticism of her and Wade was racially motivated. McAfee called Willis's speech \"legally improper\" but also said it was unclear if her remarks had met a legal standard for forensic misconduct by a prosecutor.\n\nIn an April 8 response, Willis asked the appellate court to block the appeal and defended McAfee's ruling, arguing the judge \"found the evidence insufficient to establish any actual conflict of interest.\"\n\n\"There being no error by the trial court, the present application merely reflects the applicants' dissatisfaction with the trial court's proper application of well-established law to the facts,\" Willis wrote.\n\nThe prosecution motion also defended Willis's church speech, noting she had not mentioned any defendants by name and noting that, among other things, McAfee found it was \"too far removed from jury selection\" to know if the jury pool had been tainted.\n\n\"A comment suggesting individuals were 'playing the race card' is too vague, brief, and limited in scope to imply any defendant harbored racial prejudice, particularly to the point of requiring disqualification,\" Willis wrote.\n\nAn online court docket suggested the appellate arguments could be heard as early as the court's August term - which runs from Aug. 1 to Nov. 18. But a court spokeswomen said that date depends on the timing of when the full record is received by the appeals court. If the case is slated for the August term, a decision is required by the end of following court term - which begins in December and ends in mid-March 2025.\n\nMcAfee, in granting approval for Trump and the others to appeal his ruling, said he would not pause regular proceedings in the case - though a trial date has not yet been set. Trump and his co-defendants are expected to ask the appeals court to stay those proceedings while they consider whether Willis and her office should remain on the case.\n\nA spokesman for Willis declined to comment.\n\nSteve Sadow, Trump's lead attorney in the Georgia case, said his client \"looks forward\" to presenting arguments to the court of appeals about why the case should be dismissed and Willis \"disqualified for her misconduct in this unjustified, unwarranted political persecution.\"\n\nAshleigh Merchant, an attorney for Mike Roman, the Trump co-defendant who first raised allegations of misconduct, said she was \"very happy\" the court had agreed to hear \"this important issue pre-trial.\"\n\n\"We feel confident that, when it reviews the clear evidence of conflict in this case, the Court of Appeals will agree with us and disqualify Ms. Willis and her entire office from further prosecution of this matter and require that a neutral prosecutor be appointed to review whether these charges are even appropriate,\" Merchant said.\n\nThe developments come as many close to the case believe a trial is increasingly unlikely before the November election. Willis had sought an August trial date - though McAfee still has not ruled on the timing of the trial or whether he will separate the proceedings for Trump and the other 14 remaining co-defendants.\n\nThe appellate court decision means the allegations against Willis are likely to continue to play out throughout the heat of an election year - in which both she and Trump are expected to be on the Georgia ballot this fall.\n\nWillis is facing Democratic challenger Christian Wise Smith in the May 21 primary - though many local Democrats expect her to easily win. Courtney Kramer, an Atlanta-area lawyer who previously worked in the Trump White House and for the Trump campaign, has qualified as the Republican nominee for Fulton County district attorney in the fall. Kramer has already spent months attacking Willis and her handling of the election case - though she faces long odds in winning in the heavily Democratic county.\n\nOn Monday, Wade gave his first public interview about the allegations against him and Willis to ABC News - comments that are likely to provide further fodder as lawyers for Trump and the others seek to have Willis removed and the case dismissed.\n\nIn the interview, Wade defended his relationship with Willis declaring that \"workplace romances are as American as apple pie.\" Pressed on when the relationship began and when it ended, Wade said the duration was from \"early 2022 to late 2023\" - an answer that seemed to sworn contradict testimony that he and Willis gave during a hearing on the motions to disqualify in February.\n\nUnder oath, both Willis and Wade said their relationship had ended in the summer of 2023 before a grand jury issued indictments against Trump and his co-defendants for election interference.", "source": {"uri": "unionleader.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "UnionLeader.com"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/McAfee", "type": "org", "score":

Scott McAfee, the trial judge overseeing the case, ruled in March that Willis could stay on the case as long as Wade resigned. Wade subsequently resigned the same day McAfee issued his decision.\n\nRelated: Fani Willis: 'Train is coming' for Trump despite efforts to derail Georgia case\n\nTrump now has 10 days to file a notice of appeal, the court said. His legal team had asked the court of appeals to consider the case in March and clarify the standard for when a prosecutor should be disqualified.\n\n\"President Trump looks forward to presenting interlocutory arguments to the Georgia court of appeals as to why the case should be dismissed and Fulton county DA Willis should be disqualified for her misconduct in this unjustified, unwarranted political persecution,\" Steve Sadow, Trump's attorney, said in a statement.\n\nThe decision to hear the appeal is a significant win for Trump. It decreases the chances that the case will go to trial before the November election and allows Trump and his lawyers to continue to undermine Willis's credibility and keep questions about her judgment in the public eye. McAfee has already excoriated Willis for her conduct, saying she had a \"tremendous lapse in judgment\".\n\nTrump's attorneys may petition the court to stay the trial pending the outcome of their appeal. Otherwise, the appeal will not immediately impede the prosecution as McAfee takes up pending motions. But if the appeals court decides that Willis must be removed, it would reset the years-long case back to square one while a new prosecutor can be appointed to oversee the case.\n\nLast month, prosecutors urged the appeals court not to hear the appeal. \"The present application merely reflects the applicants' dissatisfaction with the trial court's proper application of well-established law to the facts,\" prosecutors wrote in a 19-page filing.\n\nTrump and more than a dozen of his allies were charged last year with racketeering over his efforts to overturn the 2020 election. Trump and his co-defendants tried to dismiss the case by alleging that Willis's relationship, and statements she made at a Black church in Atlanta suggesting criticism of her was racist, meant she should be recused from the case.\n\nWade defended his relationship with Willis in an interview with ABC News last weekend. \"Workplace romances are as American as apple pie,\" Wade said. \"It happens to everyone. But it happened to the two of us.\"\n\n\"I regret that that private matter became the focal point of this very important prosecution,\" Wade added. \"This is a very important case.\"\n\nThe order

Legal experts said it may take months for the appellate court to hear the case and issue a ruling.\n\nThe court's terse three-sentence announcement reopened the possibility that Willis could be disqualified from the biggest case of her career and one of the most significant state criminal cases in the nation's history.\n\nAt issue is a romantic relationship she had with Nathan Wade, a lawyer she hired to handle the prosecution of Trump. Defense lawyers argued that the relationship amounted to an untenable conflict of interest, and that Willis and her entire office should be removed from the case.\n\nBut March 15, Judge Scott McAfee of Fulton County Superior Court ruled that Willis could keep the case if Wade stepped away from it. Wade resigned a few hours after judge issued his ruling.\n\nSteve Sadow, the lead counsel for Trump in Georgia, said in a statement Wednesday that his client \"looks forward to presenting interlocutory arguments to the Georgia Court of Appeals as to why the case should be dismissed and Fulton County DA Willis should be disqualified for her misconduct in this unjustified, unwarranted political persecution.\"\n\nA spokesperson for Willis' office declined to comment on the appeals court's action.\n\nThe decision is yet another setback for Democrats who hoped the courts would hold Trump accountable before the presidential election for some of the most serious crimes he is accused of committing. Trump is currently on trial in New York in a case involving hush money, but trials in three other criminal cases against him, including the Georgia case, appear increasingly unlikely to begin before November, when voters will decide whether to return him to office.\n\nTrump faces federal election interference charges in Washington, D.C., and a federal prosecution in Florida over mishandling of government documents.\n\nThe Georgia case was already in a kind of administrative limbo over the question of whether Trump is immune from prosecution related to his efforts to overturn his defeat in the 2020 presidential election loss -- efforts that are at the heart of the state indictment handed up in the summer by a Fulton County grand jury.\n\nTrump has argued that presidential immunity, \"rooted in the separation of powers and the text of the Constitution,\" should shield him from being prosecuted for his actions in Georgia. Those efforts include a telephone call Jan. 2, 2021, in which Trump pressed Brad Raffensperger, the Georgia secretary of state at the time, to help him \"find\" enough votes to overturn President Joe Biden's victory.\n\nTrump has also raised the immunity issue in the federal election interference case in Washington, D.C.\n\nThe US Supreme Court heard arguments about the immunity claim last month; it might not rule on the matter until late June or early July.\n\nIn Georgia, Willis' office has told defense lawyers that it would not respond to Trump's immunity motion in that case until after the Supreme Court's decision.\n\nMcAfee's ruling in March had harsh words for Willis, even as it gave her a way to stay on the Trump case. Referring to the fact that Wade had gone on vacation trips with Willis and had paid for some of the costs, the judge wrote that a \"financial cloud of impropriety\" existed. He said Willis and Wade had engaged in \"potential untruthfulness\" in court hearings about the matter.\n\nIn the end, however, McAfee wrote that disqualifying Willis would be overly drastic. He noted that Trump and his codefendants had not shown that their right to due process had been violated \"or that the issues involved prejudiced the defendants in any way.\"\n\nThe appeal of McAfee's decision will slow the prosecution even more. \"We're now talking about this disqualification issue continuing on throughout the summer,\" said Anthony Michael Kreis, a law professor at Georgia State University who has been following the case closely.\n\nThe appeal also spells a rockier road ahead for Willis, a Democrat who took office in 2021 and is now running for a second term.\n\nStill, the appeal may ultimately have little bearing on her race in Fulton County, which is heavily Democratic.\n\nWhile the appeal moves forward, a Republican-dominated committee of the state Senate, formed to investigate Willis, is starting its work.\n\nOn Tuesday, Willis -- appearing with a number of Black church leaders who endorsed her reelection campaign -- said she did not think the committee had the right to subpoena her.\n\nWillis also seemed to imply that the committee's investigation amounted to political retaliation for her prosecution of Trump. She said she was sorry it annoyed some people \"that everybody gets treated evenly.\"", "source": {"uri": "bostonglobe.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Boston Globe"}, "authors": [],

At appealing the decision to keep Fani Willis in charge of those election interference charges from 2020.\n\nIt's a no brainer!\n\nAnd so now Trump's got a 10-day window to file his notice of appeal. I'm sure its already prepared and ready to go!\n\nThis courtroom showdown just took an interesting twist!\n\nNBC News reports:\n\nGeorgia's state Court of Appeals said Wednesday that it will consider an appeal from former President Donald Trump challenging the decision not to disqualify Fani Willis as the district attorney overseeing the 2020 election interference charges against him.\n\nThe order said that Trump can file a notice of appeal within the next 10 days.\n\nA lawyer for Trump, Steve Sadow, said in a statement that the former president \"looks forward\" to arguing before the appeals court that the case should be dismissed and Willis disqualified \"for her misconduct in this unjustified, unwarranted political persecution.\"\n\nThe DA's office declined to comment.\n\nThe judge presiding over the case, Scott McAfee, ruled in mid-March that Willis shouldn't be disqualified from prosecuting Trump and his co-defendants despite their allegation that she had a conflict of interest in the case. They accused Willis of misconduct, alleging she financially benefited from her relationship with special prosecutor Nathan Wade, which led to days of testimony in court about their romance.\n\nMcAfee ultimately decided found the \"appearance of impropriety\" created by their personal relationship should result in either Willis or Wade leaving the case. Hours later, Willis' office confirmed Wade had resigned and she had accepted his resignation.\n\nABC News dds:\n\nIn a statement, Trump attorney Steve Sadow said, \"President Trump looks forward to presenting interlocutory arguments to the Georgia Court of Appeals as to why the case should be dismissed and Fulton County DA Willis should be disqualified for her misconduct in this unjustified, unwarranted political persecution.\"\n\nThe Fulton County DA's office declined to comment to ABC News.\n\nIn March, Judge McAfee declined to disqualify Willis, the Fulton County DA, based on allegations that she and prosecutor Nathan Wade conspired to bring the election interference case to enrich themselves with public money.\n\nAn attorney for Mike Roman, who first filed the disqualification motion in January, said in a statement to ABC News that they are \"very pleased\" with the decision and \"feel confident\" Willis will be disqualified.\n\n\"We are very pleased that the Georgia Court of Appeals agreed that this was an issue of such great importance that it required to be heard prior to any trial in this case,\" Ashleigh Merchant, Roman's attorney, said in the statement. \"We feel confident that, when it reviews the clear evidence of conflict in this case, the Court of Appeals will agree with us and disqualify Ms. Willis and her entire office from further prosecution of this matter and require that a neutral prosecutor be appointed to review whether these charges are even appropriate.\"\n\nLegal experts tell ABC News that while the appeals court's ruling does not automatically pause the interference case, it is very possible the case will be significantly delayed, further reducing the likelihood that there will be a trial in Georgia before the presidential election.\n\nOnce the appeal is docketed, said an order from the court on the disqualification issue can take up to six months, experts said. Judge McAfee had vowed to keep the case going during this time, but Trump and his codefendants can now ask for a stay while the appeal works its way through the system.\n\nTheir plans are crumbling, indeed.", "source": {"uri": "en-volve.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "enVolve"}, "authors": [{"uri": "a_m_smith@en-volve.com", "name": "A.M.

He does not have that option for the New York or Georgia cases, but legal experts say state prosecutors likely would not move forward while he is president.\n\nAn April Reuters/Ipsos poll found that 60% of registered voters thought it was important that Trump's criminal trials take place before the election. A similar number of registered voters, including one in four Republicans, said they would not vote for Trump if a jury convicted of him of a felony.\n\nCHALLENGE TO WILLIS\n\nTrump and eight of his 14 co-defendants charged in the Georgia case have urged the appeals court to overturn a state judge\u00b4s March ruling allowing Willis to continue supervising the prosecution.\n\nTrump has pleaded not guilty and accused prosecutors of a politically motivated effort to damage his campaign.\n\n\"The case should be dismissed and Fulton County DA Willis should be disqualified for her misconduct in this unjustified, unwarranted political persecution,\" Steve Sadow, Trump's lead lawyer on the Georgia case, said in a statement.\n\nA spokesperson for Willis' office did not immediately respond to a request for comment on Wednesday.\n\nThe appeal must be resolved before the case can move to trial.\n\nThe exact timeline is uncertain, but it will likely take at least a few months for lawyers to file legal briefs and schedule arguments. The case could be assigned to the court's April term, which would require a ruling by Nov. 1, four days before the election.\n\nTrump and the eight co-defendants moved to disqualify Willis after revealing that she had had a romance with Nathan Wade, an outside lawyer she hired to help lead the investigation. Wade booked several vacations with Willis while he was being paid by her office, an arrangement the defense argued posed a conflict of interest.\n\nTrump\u00b4s lawyer has also argued that Willis improperly suggested the defendants and their lawyers had racial motivations. Both Willis and Wade are Black.\n\nWillis and Wade have acknowledged having a relationship, but said it began after Wade was hired to work on the case and ended before charges were filed. Willis' office has denied allegations of misconduct and said the relationship had no impact on the case.\n\nFulton County Judge Scott McAfee ruled the relationship did not pose a conflict of interest but said it created an appearance of wrongdoing. McAfee said Willis\u00b4 office could remain on the case if Wade stepped aside, which he agreed to do.\n\nMcAfee later gave permission for Trump and his co-defendants to appeal his ruling before trial.\n\nTrump and the 14 co-defendants have pleaded not guilty to racketeering and other charges stemming from what prosecutors allege was a scheme to overturn Trump's narrow defeat in Georgia in the 2020 election. Four others who had been co-defendants in the case have pleaded guilty in deals with the prosecutors.\n\nA trial date has not yet been set.

The ruling prolongs the legal battle over a former romance between Fani Willis, the district attorney in Fulton County, and a one-time top deputy, a relationship defense lawyers have used to try to derail the case.\n\nTrump and eight of his co-defendants charged in the Georgia state court have urged the appeals court to overturn a judge's March ruling that allowed Willis to continue supervising the prosecution. The court's decision to hear the appeal before trial could cause further delays in the case, one of four criminal prosecutions facing Trump as he seeks to unseat Democratic President Joe Biden in the Nov. 5 election.\n\nTrump has pleaded not guilty and accused prosecutors of a politically motivated effort to damage his campaign. The court's decision to hear the case follows sensational testimony inside Superior Court Judge Scott McAfee's courtroom, which featured an acknowledgement from Willis and former special prosecutor Nathan Wade that they had a sexual affair.\n\nLawyers for Donald Trump and multiple co-defendants tried to establish that the affair began before Willis brought Wade onto the case and said it posed a conflict of interest. But Willis said the relationship became romantic later. Following a dramatic evidentiary hearing with claims and counter-claims about lavish trips and cash reimbursements, McAfee gave the state two options: either Willis and her entire team step back from the case, or Wade remove himself from it.\n\nHe slammed Willis for a 'tremendous lapse in judgment' and for acting in an 'unprofessional manner', and found that while there was no actual conflict of interest, there was at least the appearance of one. Wade stepped back hours after the judge's decision in March.\n\nHumiliating as it was for prosecutors, McAfee's decision allowed the case to go forward. Had it been reassigned to prosecutors in another county, it could have delayed the case even more, or even resulted in a different indictment. Wade in a stunning new interview told ABC News : 'Workplace romances are as American as apple pie. It happens to everyone. But it happened to the two of us.' It was his first interview since stepping down from his post.\n\nThe state supreme court's decision is nearly certain to cause delays in the criminal trials for Trump and his codefendants, who are charged in a broad racketeering conspiracy for his election overturn in the state. If that happens, it would just be the latest victory on the calendar for Trump, whose lawyers have managed to put off his criminal cases as Election Day nears.\n\nTrump's D.C. January 6 case remains stalled while it awaits a Supreme Court decision on his claims of presidential immunity. On Tuesday Judge Aileen Cannon ruled that his classified documents case in Florida was postponed indefinitely amid a series of clashes over classified documents issues. Even his Stormy Daniels case, which is playing out this week in Manhattan, suffered a delay.\n\nTrump lawyer in the Georgia case Steven Sadow indicated in a statement that he won't relent in the effort to bump Willis from the case. 'President Trump looks forward to presenting interlocutory arguments to the Georgia Court of Appeals as to why the case should be dismissed and Fulton County DA Willis should be disqualified for her misconduct in this unjustified, unwarranted political persecution,' Sadow said in a statement.\n\nWant more stories like this from the Daily Mail?

The appeals court agreed to consider Trump's bid to get the DA removed from the case. Trump scored another legal win Tuesday when a federal judge delayed his classified documents trial indefinitely.\n\nFormer President Donald Trump has scored another legal win that will likely delay one of his criminal trials.\n\nA Georgia appeals court on Wednesday agreed to consider Trump's bid to get Fulton County District Attorney Fani Willis disqualified from the state's 2020 election-interference case against Trump and his allies.\n\nTrump and his codefendants in the Georgia case had asked the appeals court to review a ruling made earlier this year by Fulton County Superior Court Judge Scott McAfee that permitted Willis to continue to oversee the case.\n\nAttorneys for Trump and his codefendants had previously argued in a motion to disqualify Willis that Willis had a conflict of interest in the case because she improperly benefited from a romantic relationship with Nathan Wade, the Atlanta lawyer she hired as a special prosecutor for the case.\n\nFollowing a days-long evidentiary hearing on the matter in which both Willis and Wade testified, McAfee ruled in March that Willis and her office could remain on the case so long as Wade stepped aside. Wade announced his resignation hours later.\n\nMcAfee said in his ruling that though he did not find a real conflict of interest, \"an odor of mendacity remains.\" The judge allowed a request by Trump and his codefendant's to appeal the ruling.\n\nTrump attorney Steve Sadow cheered the Georgia appeals courts' decision to take up the case, writing in a post on X on Wednesday: \"The GA Court of Appeals has GRANTED President Trump's Application for Interlocutory Appeal from the trial court's order refusing to disqualify Fulton County DA Fani Willis!!!\"\n\nThe case was not scheduled for trial. In the months leading up to the filing of the conflict-of-interest motion, Willis had been seeking an August trial date -- but that was before her office lost its lead prosecutor on the case.\n\nThe appeals court's decision to review the ruling just increases the likelihood that the Georgia case against Trump, the presumptive Republican presidential nominee, won't go to trial before the presidential election in November.\n\nTrump -- who has been charged in a total of four criminal cases and is currently standing trial for one of them, in relation to hush money paid to a porn star -- got another legal victory on Tuesday.\n\nThe federal Florida judge overseeing Trump's criminal case over his holding onto secret government documents following his presidency delayed the trial indefinitely, giving him the chance to get rid of the charges if he wins the 2024 election.\n\nThe former president's legal team has been trying to delay Trump's criminal cases -- and the strategy seems to be paying off.\n\nRead the original article on Business Insider", "source": {"uri": "businessinsider.nl", "dataType": "news", "title": "Business Insider Nederland"}, "authors": [{"uri":

review ruling allowing DA to stay on Trump case", "body": "Mr Trump and some other defendants in the case had tried to get Ms Willis and her office removed from the case, saying her romantic relationship with special prosecutor Nathan Wade created a conflict of interest.\n\nSuperior Court Judge Scott McAfee in March found that no conflict of interest existed that should force Ms Willis off the case, but he granted a request from Mr Trump and the other defendants to seek an appeal of his ruling from the Georgia Court of Appeals.\n\nThat intermediate appeals court agreed to take up the case on Wednesday.\n\nOnce it rules, the losing side could ask the Georgia Supreme Court to consider an appeal.\n\nMr Trump's lead lawyer in Georgia, Steve Sadow, said in an email that the former president looks forward to presenting arguments to the appeals court as to why the case should be dismissed and why Ms Willis \"should be disqualified for her misconduct in this unjustified, unwarranted political persecution\".\n\nA spokesperson for Ms Willis declined to comment on the Court of Appeals decision to take up the matter.\n\nThe appeals court's decision to consider the case seems likely to cause a delay and further reduce the possibility that it will get to trial before the November general election, when Mr Trump is expected to be the Republican nominee for president.\n\nIn his order, Judge McAfee said he planned to continue to address other pretrial motions \"regardless of whether the petition is granted... and even if any subsequent appeal is expedited by the appellate court\".\n\nBut Mr Trump and the others could ask the Court of Appeals to stay the case while the appeal is pending.\n\nJudge McAfee wrote in his order in March that the prosecution was \"encumbered by an appearance of impropriety\".\n\nHe said Ms Willis could remain on the case only if Mr Wade left, and the special prosecutor submitted his resignation hours later.\n\nThe allegations that Ms Willis had improperly benefited from her romance with Mr Wade resulted in a tumultuous couple of months in the case as intimate details of Ms Willis and Mr Wade's personal lives were aired in court in mid-February.\n\nThe serious charges in one of four criminal cases against the Republican former president were largely overshadowed by the love lives of the prosecutors.\n\nMr Trump and 18 others were indicted in August, accused of participating in a wide-ranging scheme to illegally try to overturn his narrow 2020 presidential election loss to Democrat Joe Biden in Georgia.\n\nAll of the defendants were charged with violating Georgia's Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organisations, or Rico, law, an expansive anti-racketeering statute.\n\nFour people charged in the case have pleaded guilty after reaching deals with prosecutors.\n\nMr Trump and the others have pleaded not guilty.\n\nMr Trump and other defendants had argued in their appeal application that Judge McAfee was wrong not to remove both Ms Willis and Mr Wade, writing that \"providing DA Willis with the option to simply remove Wade confounds logic and is contrary to Georgia law\".\n\nThe allegations against Ms Willis first surfaced in a motion filed in early January by Ashleigh Merchant, a lawyer for former Trump campaign staffer and onetime White House aide Michael Roman.\n\nThe motion alleged that Ms Willis and Mr Wade were involved in an inappropriate romantic relationship and that Ms Willis paid Mr Wade large sums for his work and then benefitted when he paid for lavish vacations.\n\nMs Willis and Mr Wade acknowledged the relationship but said they didn't begin dating until the spring of 2022, after Mr Wade was hired in November 2021, and their romance ended last summer.\n\nThey also said that they split travel costs roughly evenly, with Ms Willis often paying expenses or reimbursing Mr Wade in cash.", "source": {"uri": "theargus.co.uk", "dataType": "news",

He does not have that option for the New York or Georgia cases, but legal experts say state prosecutors likely would not move forward while he is president.\n\nAn April Reuters/Ipsos poll found that 60% of registered voters thought it was important that Trump's criminal trials take place before the election. A similar number of registered voters, including one in four Republicans, said they would not vote for Trump if a jury convicted of him of a felony.\n\nCHALLENGE TO WILLIS\n\nTrump and eight of his 14 co-defendants charged in the Georgia case have urged the appeals court to overturn a state judge's March ruling allowing Willis to continue supervising the prosecution.\n\nTrump has pleaded not guilty and accused prosecutors of a politically motivated effort to damage his campaign.\n\n\"The case should be dismissed and Fulton County DA Willis should be disqualified for her misconduct in this unjustified, unwarranted political persecution,\" Steve Sadow, Trump's lead lawyer on the Georgia case, said in a statement.\n\nA spokesperson for Willis' office did not immediately respond to a request for comment on Wednesday.\n\nThe appeal must be resolved before the case can move to trial.\n\nThe exact timeline is uncertain, but it will likely take at least a few months for lawyers to file legal briefs and schedule arguments. The case could be assigned to the court's April term, which would require a ruling by Nov. 1, four days before the election.\n\nTrump and the eight co-defendants moved to disqualify Willis after revealing that she had had a romance with Nathan Wade, an outside lawyer she hired to help lead the investigation. Wade booked several vacations with Willis while he was being paid by her office, an arrangement the defense argued posed a conflict of interest.\n\nTrump's lawyer has also argued that Willis improperly suggested the defendants and their lawyers had racial motivations. Both Willis and Wade are Black.\n\nWillis and Wade have acknowledged having a relationship, but said it began after Wade was hired to work on the case and ended before charges were filed. Willis' office has denied allegations of misconduct and said the relationship had no impact on the case.\n\nFulton County Judge Scott McAfee ruled the relationship did not pose a conflict of interest but said it created an appearance of wrongdoing. McAfee said Willis' office could remain on the case if Wade stepped aside, which he agreed to do.\n\nMcAfee later gave permission for Trump and his co-defendants to appeal his ruling before trial.\n\nTrump and the 14 co-defendants have pleaded not guilty to racketeering and other charges stemming from what prosecutors allege was a scheme to overturn Trump's narrow defeat in Georgia in the 2020 election. Four others who had been co-defendants in the case have pleaded guilty in deals with the prosecutors.\n\nA trial date has not yet been set.\n\n(Reporting by Andrew Goudsward; Editing by Scott Malone, Lisa Shumaker, Susan Heavey and Jonathan Oatis)\n\nSign Up for Springs AM Update Your morning rundown of the latest news from Colorado Springs and around the country\n\nSign Up View all of our newsletters.

(Atlanta News First) - Now that the Georgia Court of Appeals has agreed to hear an appeal from former President Donald Trump over Fulton County DA Fani Willis' continuing participation in his historic indictment, what happens next?\n\nThe Georgia Court of Appeals' docket for case number A24I0160, also known as DONALD JOHN TRUMP ET AL V. THE STATE said the appeal, once it's filed, will be heard during the court's August 2024 term. Per the court's website, all cases docketed to this term must be decided by March 14, 2025.\n\nThe August term ends on Nov. 18, 2024. The court's argument calendar for August, September and October does not yet list a date for Trump's appeal.\n\n\"President Trump looks forward to presenting interlocutory arguments to the Georgia Court of Appeals as to why the case should be dismissed and Fulton County DA Willis should be disqualified for her misconduct in this unjustified, unwarranted political persecution,\" Steve Sadow, one of the former president's lead Georgia attorneys, said immediately after the court's announcement on May 8, 2024.\n\nOn April 1, Trump and the remaining defendants in Georgia's historic racketeering indictment formally appealed Fulton County Superior Court Judge Scott McAfee's ruling. That appeal came after McAfee gave the green light to allow such an appeal over his decision. The appeal was signed by all of the attorneys representing the remaining co-defendants who have not already settled the case in Fulton County Superior Court.\n\nHowever, the appeals court denied hearing a similar appeal from Harrison Floyd, one of the remaining co-defendants and the only person indicted who actually spent time in jail after not posting bail.\n\nIn March, McAfee rejected defense efforts to remove Willis and her office over her romantic relationship with special prosecutor Nathan Wade, but he did give the defendants permission to seek a review of his decision from the appeals court. In his ruling, McAfee wrote Willis must remove Wade from the racketeering indictment if she were to remain on the case. Wade resigned just hours after that ruling.\n\n\"While the trial court factually found DA Willis' out-of-court statements were improper and defendants proved an apparent conflict of interest, the trial court erred as a matter of law by not requiring dismissal and DA Willis's disqualification,\" the appeal from Trump's and other defense attorneys said. \"To avoid structural error that would invalidate and require a repeat of the upcoming trials, to establish needed precedent in the area of disqualifying forensic misconduct and to protect and maintain the public's confidence in the integrity of the criminal justice system, (the) court should grant the application.\"\n\n\"President Trump and eight other defendants filed their joint application for interlocutory appeal today. Defendants argued in the trial court that the indictment should have been dismissed and, at a minimum, DA Willis and her office should have been disqualified from prosecuting the case,\" Sadow said in the initial request. \"The Georgia Court of Appeals should grant the application and accept the interlocutory appeal for consideration on the merits.\"\n\nWillis herself has engaged in a continuing war of words with her opponents who say they want to hold her accountable over her prosecution and indictment of the nation's 45th president.\n\nDuring a May 7, 2024, news conference in which she announced the endorsement of several prominent Black faith leaders in Atlanta, Willis said she would not honor any subpoena issued by a state Senate committee investigating her use of public funds in her Trump investigation.\n\n\"First of all, I don't even think they have the authority to subpoena me, but they need to learn the law,\" Willis said Monday. \"I will not appear to anything that is unlawful, and I have not broken the law in any way. I'm sorry folks get pissed off that everybody gets treated evenly.\"\n\nAfter her remarks, Lt. Gov. Burt Jones - a likely candidate for governor in Georgia's wide-open 2026 gubernatorial race - said on X (formerly known as Twitter), \"If subpoenaed by the Committee, she will be required to appear or she will be in violation of Georgia law. This is what treating everybody evenly looks like, even if DA Willis doesn't like being held accountable.\"\n\nLast week, state Sen. Bill Cowsert (R-Athens), who chairs the committee investigating Willis, said he would subpoena the Democratic district attorney if she doesn't agree to appear before his committee.\n\n\"She's a key part of the investigation that her viewpoints are valued by us,\" Cowsert said after the committee's most recent hearing. \"We need to hear what she has to say and her explanation of what she thinks are the appropriate rules ought to be going forward so we don't have this kind of scandal give Georgia a black eye.\"\n\nOn Friday, the committee reconvened after state lawmakers earlier this year charged it to determine if Willis engaged in any financial misconduct in her investigation and subsequent historic indictment of Trump.\n\nAt the heart of the Senate committee's investigation is Willis' hiring of Wade and the timing of when their relationship turned romantic. The committee is also looking into allegations that Willis misused state and federal funds.\n\nThe move to disqualify Willis began in early January after Michael Roman, one of Trump's co-defendants, and Ashleigh Merchant, Roman's attorney, accused Willis and Wade of having an improper relationship. Both Willis and Wade have since acknowledged a romantic relationship.\n\nThe allegations that Willis had improperly benefited from her romance with Wade upended the case for weeks. Intimate details of Willis and Wade's personal lives were aired in court in mid-February. Trump and 18 others were indicted in August, accused of illegally trying to overturn his narrow 2020 presidential election loss to Democrat Joe Biden in Georgia.\n\nTrump himself has already become the first ex-president in American history to stand trial on criminal charges, as witness testimony continues in his hush money trial. Trump is going on trial on 34 felony counts that he falsified his company's business records in an attempt to cover up a hush-money payment to adult film star Stephanie Clifford, aka Stormy Daniels.\n\nTrump has pleaded not guilty to all of the criminal cases that have been filed against him since he left the White House in 2021, including those filed by Willis.\n\nThe Atlanta-based district attorney indicted Trump and 18 others in August 2023 on charges of engaging in a criminal, racketeering-like attempt to overturn Georgia's 2020 election. That election saw Joe Biden become the first Democrat since Bill Clinton in 1992 to carry Georgia or any other deep Southern state.\n\nMcAfee has also rejected arguments from Trump and his attorneys that the actions of the nation's 45th president are protected by the First Amendment.", "source": {"uri": "atlantanewsfirst.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "https://www.atlantanewsfirst.com"},

The attorney claimed Willis paid Wade large sums of money for his work, and then Wade used those earnings to pay for luxurious vacations for himself and Willis.\n\nWillis and Wade claimed the personal relationship began after Wade was hired, that the two never lived together, and that the cost of personal trips they took together was split \"roughly\" equally. But after McAfee ruled that their relationship created the appearance of a conflict of interest, Wade ultimately resigned from the case.\n\nThe appeals court decision Wednesday to take up the ruling is likely to cause even further delay in a case that was already unlikely to go to trial before the November presidential election.

And the Supreme Court has yet to rule on Trump's arguments that he has full immunity for actions while president, an issue that has stopped the federal trial on January 6, 2021-related charges.\n\nWillis' office declined to comment on the order.\n\nTrump attorney Steve Sadow said the former president \"looks forward to presenting interlocutory arguments to the Georgia Court of Appeals as to why the case should be dismissed and Fulton County DA Willis should be disqualified for her misconduct in this unjustified, unwarranted political persecution.\"\n\nIn March, after what amounted to a mini-trial where attorneys for Trump and his co-defendants sought to prove their case against Willis and her prosecutor on the case, Nathan Wade, the Fulton County judge presiding ultimately decided Willis would be allowed to continue to helm the case if Wade stepped down.\n\nMcAfee found there was not enough evidence to firmly prove Willis financially benefited from her relationship with Wade, who defense attorneys say covered several vacations for the pair. Willis testified that she paid Wade back for the expenses in cash.\n\nWeeks after McAfee's ruling, Trump and several co-defendants appealed, arguing that Willis \"has covered herself and her office in scandal and disrepute, as she has squandered her credibility and repeatedly and flagrantly violated the heightened ethical standards demanded of her position.\"\n\nThis story has been updated with additional details.\n\nThe-CNN-Wire\n\n\u2122 & \u00a9 2024 Cable News Network, Inc., a Warner Bros.

That appeal came after Judge Scott McAfee, who is overseeing Trump's election interference racketeering case, said Willis could remain on the case if she removed lead prosecutor Nathan Wade.

But Trump or his co-defendants could ask for a stay of the case.\n\nTrump and 18 others, including lawyer Rudy Giuliani and White House Chief of Staff Mark Meadows, were indicted in August on racketeering charges stemming from what Willis says was a wide-ranging scheme to illegally try to overturn his narrow 2020 presidential election loss to President Biden.\n\nFour people, including three ex-Trump lawyers, have pleaded guilty after reaching deals with prosecutors. Trump and the others have pleaded not guilty.\n\nThe tawdry allegations against the prosecution claimed that Willis hired Wade to oversee the case because he was her boyfriend and then benefitted when he paid for their lavish vacations.\n\nWillis and Wade acknowledged the relationship under pressure from disclosures made by defense lawyers. They say they only started dating after Wade was hired, and that they split vacation costs roughly evenly.\n\nMeanwhile, Trump won a round in an unrelated court fight when U.S. District Court Judge Aileen Cannon indefinitely postponed his trial on charges he mishandled classified documents taken to Mar-a-Lago after leaving office under fire in 2021.\n\nThe judge's ruling means the case, which

The court order further diminishes the chance of the Fulton County District Attorney's office convening a trial this year for racketeering and conspiracy charges against the presumptive Republican presidential nominee and Trump's 14 remaining co-defendants.\n\nTrump's attorney Steve Sadow and other defense lawyers have argued that McAfee should not have allowed special prosecutor Nathan Wade to resign on March 15 while allowing Willis to remain on the case, alleging her hiring of Wade and then taking vacations to Aruba and other places with him amounted to prosecutorial misconduct.\n\nMcAfee wrote in his March 15 court order that there is a need to address a \"significant appearance of impropriety that infects the current structure of the prosecution team,\" referring to Willis and Wade. The two admitted to having become romantically involved several months after Willis hired Wade as special prosecutor in November 2021.\n\nThe GA Court of Appeals has GRANTED President Trump's Application for Interlocutory Appeal from the trial court's order refusing to disqualify Fulton County DA Fani Willis!!!\n\n-- Steve Sadow (@stevesadow) May 8, 2024\n\nMcAfee ruled that the Trump co-defendants failed to sufficiently prove there was conflict of interest related to a relationship that saw Wade get paid more than $700,000 by Fulton County before stepping down in March.\n\nFour co-defendants have received plea agreements on misdemeanor charges that allow them to serve probation if they testify for the state.\n\nEx-Gwinnett County District Attorney Danny Porter said it is uncommon for a case to be granted an \"interlocutory appeal\" which allows an appellate court to review a lower court's ruling before the trial begins.\n\nAdditionally, it is intriguing that the defendants are appealing a decision made by a judge exercising discretionary judgment rather than an appeal solely based on the law, Porter said.\n\nThe next step in the legal process is for the attorneys representing Trump and his co-defendants to file a notice of appeal in order to transfer the case from the Fulton County Superior Court to the Court of Appeals. The defense will have 20 days after filing the notice to file briefs with the court, and the state will have another 20 days to respond.\n\nAlthough the Georgia appellate court discourages oral arguments, Porter said he expects the court to approve a request from the defense or state for an in-person hearing.\n\nIn the end, a panel of judges will either affirm McAfee's decision to keep Willis on the case, schedule an additional hearing to evaluate more evidence, or disqualify Willis, thereby preventing anyone else from taking over the case from the Fulton DA's office.\n\nPorter estimated that the appellate process would take at least five months to complete. The state or defense could also petition the Georgia Supreme Court to review the decision of the appellate court.\n\nPorter said it's possible that one of the factors in the appellate court granting the pre-trial review is due the historic legal significance of a potential racketeering trial that has a former president as the lead defendant.\n\nThe court granted the defendant's \"interlocutory appeal\" in a one-page document without explaining its reasoning.\n\n\"The Court of Appeals could be trying to more or less clear the decks to get the issue resolved so it doesn't hang over the trial one way or the other. That may be the most charitable explanation. It's hard to say why they do what they do, but it's unusual to grant an interlocutory appeal.\"\n\nThe appeal came from Trump and co-defendants including former Trump campaign officer Michael Roman, former Trump attorney Rudy Giuliani and ex-White House Chief of Staff Mark Meadows.\n\nAlthough Willis has come under greater scrutiny since the public learned about her prior romantic relationship with Wade, she is using the criticism against her as a rallying cry for her re-election campaign.\n\nA press conference was held at Atlanta's Big Bethel African Methodist Episcopal Church on Monday, as a group of influential Black religious leaders announced their endorsement of Willis in the May 21 Democratic primary when she faces Christian Wise Smith, who has served as Atlanta city solicitor and as a Fulton County prosecutor.\n\nDuring her Monday public appearance, Willis referred to a witch hunt against her since she is a Black woman who is willing to stand up to Trump and the GOP machine supporting Trump's nomination.\n\n\"Fani Willis has proven herself to be an effective, fearless, and courageous district attorney determined to defend and prioritize the pursuit of justice throughout Fulton County,\" said Bishop Reginald T. Jackson, who represents 500 Georgia churches within the African Methodist Episcopal Church's Sixth Episcopal District. \"I am proud to call her my friend and look forward to bringing the multi-denominations of Georgia's African-American Faith community together to showcase her leadership, passion, and results for Fulton County.\"\n\nEmory University political science professor Andra Gillespie said the dynamics of race have also been used by Trump, who has labeled Black prosecutors like Willis as \"reverse racists\" for daring to prosecute him\n\n\"(Willis) has certainly invoked that type of language and imagery,\" Gillespie said. \"(Trump) also has tried to besmirch Fani Willis's character by making other allegations that seem to be very latent with stereotypes.\"\n\nThe first several months of 2024 have also reaped rewards for Willis' campaign war chest, bringing in $229,333 in campaign donations between January and April, double the amount raised in the last six months of 2023, according to Georgia campaign finance reports.\n\nThe winner of the upcoming Fulton DA Democratic primary will have a significant advantage in the Nov. 5 general election in a matchup against Courtney Kramer, a self-described MAGA attorney who has worked in the Trump White House. Kramer faces an uphill battle in heavily Democratic Fulton.\n\n\"It will be interesting to look at where her vote support comes from, not just in this primary election that's going to happen in two weeks, but also ultimately in November for the general election for DA,\" Gillespie said. \"We forget, because this is a very different context, but that when Willis ran in 2020 for this DA slot, when she was running against Paul Howard, she was the one who garnered a lot of support outside of the African-American community.\"\n\nWhen a grand jury in Fulton County indicted Trump and 18 others on racketeering and conspiracy charges in August, it was the fourth case that Trump faced criminal charges in 2023.\n\nIn March 2023, Trump became the first former US president to face criminal charges when he was indicted by a New York grand jury on 34 counts of falsifying business records. Trump is currently on trial in New York for allegedly trying to hide hush money paid to keep adult film star Stormy Daniels from disclosing details about an alleged extramarital affair with Trump in 2006.\n\nOn Tuesday, a U.S. district court judge indefinitely delayed a federal classified documents trial that had been scheduled to start on May 20. The next pretrial hearing in Florida court is now scheduled for July 22 as Trump stands trial for allegedly illegally retaining classified documents and trying to hide them from federal authorities.\n\nTrump's federal election interference case is on hold until after the U.S. Supreme Court rules on whether presidential immunity protects Trump from those criminal charges connected to his attempt to overturn the 2020 election. The Supreme Court's decision would set a legal precedent on the extent that presidents could be prosecuted for actions taken while they are in office.\n\nReporter Ross Williams contributed to this report.\n\nGeorgia Recorder is part of States Newsroom, a nonprofit news network supported by grants and a coalition of donors as a 501c(3) public charity.

Meanwhile, the federal classified documents case in Florida appears to be further delayed, compliments of some shoddy lawyering by the Department of Justice.\n\nRELATED:\n\nWHOA: Judge Indefinitely Postpones Trump's Classified Docs Case Because DOJ Mishandled Evidence\n\nTrump Manhattan Trial Tuesday Evening Wrap-Up - 'What the Hell Happened?'

But on Tuesday, a court order revealed that Georgia's appeals court has agreed to hear Trump's request to disqualify her from the case.\n\n\"Upon consideration of the Application for Interlocutory Appeal, it is ordered that it be hereby GRANTED,\" the order states.\n\nBack in March, Judge Scott McAfee ruled that Willis must either step down from prosecuting Trump or dismiss special prosecutor Nathan Wade. The ruling came amid revelations of an affair between Willis and Wade, along with allegations of preferential treatment, including higher pay despite Wade's lack of experience in RICO cases compared to his peers.\n\nThe shameful ruling was a tremendous victory for Fani Willis. The evidence presented at Willis's conflict of interest hearing showed that she lied about when her relationship with Wade began. She should have been immediately disqualified and disbarred after that, but instead, her lover Nathan Wade promptly resigned and she remained on the case.\n\nRelated: Nathan Wade Resigns, and Fani Willis Can't Resist Politicizing It\n\nDespite the shameful ruling, McAfee granted the certificate of immediate review Trump and eight of his co-defendants requested, and the court's decision to hear the bid is a tremendous blow to Willis.\n\n\"The ruling prolongs the legal battle over a former romance between Fani Willis, the district attorney in Fulton County, and a one-time top deputy, a relationship defense lawyers have used to try to derail the case,\" reports Reuters. \"Trump and eight of his co-defendants charged in the Georgia state court have urged the appeals court to overturn a judge's March ruling that allowed Willis to continue supervising the prosecution.\"\n\nThe court's decision to hear the appeal before trial could cause further delays in the case, one of four criminal prosecutions facing Trump as he seeks to unseat President Joe Biden in the Nov. 5 election. Trump has pleaded not guilty and accused prosecutors of a politically motivated effort to damage his campaign.\n\nAt the very least, the appeals courts' granting Trump's request will delay proceedings further but could potentially result in Willis being removed from the case.\n\nThe evidence proving she lied about her relationship with Wade is quite extraordinary. Willis claimed under oath that she and Wade were \"professional associates and friends since 2019,\" but had not yet been romantically involved when she appointed him as special prosecutor in the case against Trump in November 2021. Wade similarly testified that their relationship started after his appointment.\n\nBut a former \"good friend\" and employee of Willis testified that there is \"no doubt\" that Willis and Wade were romantically involved from 2019 through at least 2022 when she and Willis last spoke, and cellphone location data also appeared to contradict Willis's and Wade's testimonies. Based on cellphone location data, Wade made at least 35 visits to Willis's neighborhood before Willis had hired Wade, and several of those visits appeared to be overnight visits.", "source": {"uri": "pjmedia.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "PJ Media"}, "authors": [{"uri": "matt_margolis@pjmedia.com", "name": "Matt Margolis", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fani_Willis", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Fani Willis"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/District_attorney", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "District attorney"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fulton_County,_Georgia", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Fulton County, Georgia"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Fulton County, Georgia"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special_counsel", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Special counsel"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Racketeer_Influenced_and_Corrupt_Organizations_Act", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disbarment", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Disbarment"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conflict_of_interest", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Conflict of interest"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Georgia_(U.S._state)", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Georgia (U.S. state)"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Georgia (U.S. state)"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Biden", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acquittal", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Acquittal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reuters", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Reuters"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Law/Legal_Information", "label": "dmoz/Society/Law/Legal Information", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Crime_and_Justice", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Crime and Justice", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Trials", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Trials", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Law/Courts", "label": "dmoz/Society/Law/Courts", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Law", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Law", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 49}], "image": "https://media.townhall.com/cdn/hodl/2024/75/c24d9a14-b516-4d55-952f-d69a50b6c64f.png", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9549791", "eventUri": "eng-9549791", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "date": "-11-05", "textStart": 2024, "textEnd": 2030}], "sentiment": -0.02745098039215688, "wgt": 196, "relevance": 1}

As long as Wade remains on the case, this unnecessary perception will persist,\" he said.\n\nBoth Willis and Wade insisted that their relationship started in 2022, after Wade was hired. But they contradict testimony from Robin Yeartie, a former \"good friend\" of Willis and past employee at the DA's office.\n\nNATHAN WADE SPEAKS OUT ON 'WORKPLACE ROMANCE' WITH FULTON COUNTY DA FANI WILLIS: 'AMERICAN AS APPLE PIE'\n\nYeartie said she had \"no doubt\" that Willis and Wade's relationship started in 2019, after the two met at a conference.\n\nWhen the defense in March submitted a joint motion for a Certificate of Immediate Review, McAfee said that his Order on the Defendants' Motions to Dismiss and Disqualify the Fulton County District Attorney issued March 15 \"is of such importance to the case that immediate review should be had\" and allowed the defendants to ask the Georgia appeals court for an opportunity to appeal -

Trump has pleaded not guilty.\n\nTrump's defense team has argued that Willis must be taken off the case.\n\n\"While the trial court factually found DA Willis's out-of-court statements were improper and Defendants proved an apparent conflict of interest, the trial court erred as a matter of law by not requiring dismissal and DA Willis disqualification,\" attorneys for Trump and eight other defendants wrote in the appeal. \"This legal error requires the Court's immediate review.\"\n\nWillis previously argued she should be allowed to stay on the case.\n\n\"Days of evidence and testimony failed to disclose anything like a calculated pre-trial plan designed to prejudice the defendants or secure their convictions,\" prosecutors wrote in the brief.\n\nThe Georgia case took a turn after Trump co-defendant Michael Roman discovered evidence of a romantic relationship between Willis and Wade. Trump's appeal stemmed from that conduct along with a speech Willis delivered at a local church.\n\nDownload PDF\n\nMore from this section\n\nA look at commencement ceremonies as US campuses are roiled by protests over the Israel-Hamas war Innovating Customer Interactions: VOC AI to Showcase New Technologies at White Label Expo 2024 Top Female Sports Executive, Lisa Pantages of the San Francisco Giants, Named FWSF 2024 Financial Woman of the Year", "source": {"uri": "kulr8.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "KULR-8 Local News"}, "authors": [{"uri": "center_square@kulr8.com", "name": "Center Square", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}, {"uri": "brett_rowland@kulr8.com", "name": "Brett Rowland", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fani_Willis", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Fani Willis"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/District_attorney", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "District attorney"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prosecutor", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Prosecutor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Georgia_(U.S._state)", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Georgia (U.S. state)"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Georgia (U.S. state)"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fulton_County,_Georgia", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Fulton County, Georgia"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Fulton County, Georgia"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Center_Square", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "The Center Square"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Georgia_Court_of_Appeals", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Georgia Court of Appeals"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trial_court", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Trial court"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Attempts_to_overturn_the_2020_United_States_presidential_election", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Attempts to overturn the 2020 United States presidential election"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Racketeering", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Racketeering"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grand_jury", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Grand jury"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acquittal", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Acquittal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conflict_of_interest", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Conflict of interest"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indictment", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Indictment"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electoral_fraud", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Electoral fraud"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Showtime_(TV_network)", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Showtime (TV network)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_Americans", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "White Americans"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time_Person_of_the_Year", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Time Person of the Year"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/San_Francisco_Giants", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "San Francisco Giants"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Professional_wrestling", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Professional wrestling"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Artificial intelligence"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Law/Legal_Information", "label": "dmoz/Society/Law/Legal Information", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Trials", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Trials", "wgt": 21}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Law", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Law", "wgt": 19}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Antiques_and_Collectibles/Supplies", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Antiques and Collectibles/Supplies", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Healthcare/Case_Management", "label": "dmoz/Business/Healthcare/Case Management", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 59}], "image": "https://bloximages.newyork1.vip.townnews.com/kulr8.com/content/tncms/assets/v3/editorial/1/31/131e332c-0536-5de0-bfba-b5c484db035d/663b9b080d56a.preview.jpg?crop=1265%2C664%2C0%2C486&resize=438%2C230&order=crop%2Cresize", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9549791", "eventUri": "eng-9549791", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1137254901960785, "wgt": 195, "relevance": 1}

The district attorney's office had opposed the move.\n\n\"Upon consideration of the Application for Interlocutory Appeal, it is ordered that it be hereby GRANTED,\" read the one-page ruling from the Georgia Court of Appeals.\n\nWillis was allowed to continue prosecuting the case after Judge Scott McAfee, who is overseeing the case in the Superior Court of Fulton County, ruled that she could stay if her lead prosecutor, Nathan Wade - with whom she had a romantic relationship - resigned.\n\nAfter days of dramatic hearings, where both Willis and Wade testified, McAfee only found evidence of an apparent conflict of interest, not an actual conflict of interest.\n\nWillis and Wade said they met in 2019 at a judicial conference but began dating in early 2022 - after Wade had been designated a special prosecutor in the historic case. However, during the blockbuster hearings, two witnesses testified that their romance started in 2019. The prosecutors contended that a mentor-like relationship was established after the conference, not a romantic one.\n\nTrump and his co-defendants contended that McAfee's factual findings made clear the romance amounted to more than just an apparent conflict of interest.\n\n\"If this law means anything, the trial court's actual findings here establish an actual conflict,\" their application for an appeal read.\n\nSteve Sadow, who represents Trump in the case, welcomed the development.\n\n\"President Trump looks forward to presenting interlocutory arguments to the Georgia Court of Appeals as to why the case should be dismissed and Fulton County DA Willis should be disqualified for her misconduct in this unjustified, unwarranted political persecution,\" Trump attorney Steve Sadow said in a statement.\n\nThe disqualification effort was first mounted by 2020 Trump campaign operative Michael Roman, a defendant in the case. Others, including Trump, rapidly joined his efforts which caused the case to take a weeks-long detour.\n\nWillis charged Trump and more than a dozen of his allies last summer with attempting to subvert the state's 2020 presidential election results, accusing them of entering an unlawful conspiracy to overturn President Biden's victory in the state.\n\nTrump pleaded not guilty, and no trial date has been set.", "source": {"uri": "thehill.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Hill"}, "authors": [{"uri": "zach_schonfeld@thehill.com", "name": "Zach Schonfeld", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}, {"uri": "ella_lee@thehill.com", "name": "Ella Lee", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fani_Willis", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Fani Willis"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/District_attorney", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "District attorney"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Georgia_(U.S._state)", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Georgia (U.S. state)"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Georgia (U.S. state)"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Georgia_Court_of_Appeals", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Georgia Court of Appeals"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fulton_County,_Georgia", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Fulton County, Georgia"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Fulton County, Georgia"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conflict_of_interest", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Conflict of interest"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electoral_fraud", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Electoral fraud"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special_counsel", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Special counsel"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Superior_court", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Superior court"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prosecutor", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Prosecutor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump_2020_presidential_campaign", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump 2020 presidential campaign"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2020_United_States_presidential_election", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "2020 United States presidential election"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Political_repression", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Political repression"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Biden", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acquittal", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Acquittal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lawyer", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Lawyer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conspiracy_theory", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Conspiracy theory"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Defendant", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Defendant"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Relationships/Romance", "label": "dmoz/Society/Relationships/Romance", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Trials", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Trials", "wgt": 20}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Law", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Law", "wgt": 19}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Antiques_and_Collectibles/Supplies", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Antiques and Collectibles/Supplies", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Healthcare/Case_Management", "label": "dmoz/Business/Healthcare/Case Management", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 84}], "image": "https://thehill.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/03/AP24061719090266-e1709329364763.jpg?strip=1&w=640", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9549791", "eventUri": "eng-9549791", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.2156862745098038, "wgt": 195, "relevance": 1}

The court order further diminishes the chance of the Fulton County District Attorney's office convening a trial this year for racketeering and conspiracy charges against the presumptive Republican presidential nominee and Trump's 14 remaining co-defendants.\n\nTrump's attorney Steve Sadow and other defense lawyers have argued that McAfee should not have allowed special prosecutor Nathan Wade to resign on March 15 while allowing Willis to remain on the case, alleging her hiring of Wade and then taking vacations to Aruba and other places with him amounted to prosecutorial misconduct.\n\nMcAfee wrote in his March 15 court order that there is a need to address a \"significant appearance of impropriety that infects the current structure of the prosecution team,\" referring to Willis and Wade. The two admitted to having become romantically involved several months after Willis hired Wade as special prosecutor in November 2021.\n\nMcAfee ruled that the Trump co-defendants failed to sufficiently prove there was conflict of interest related to a relationship that saw Wade get paid more than $700,000 by Fulton County before stepping down in March.\n\nFour co-defendants have received plea agreements on misdemeanor charges that allow them to serve probation if they testify for the state.\n\nEx-Gwinnett County District Attorney Danny Porter said it is uncommon for a case to be granted an \"interlocutory appeal\" which allows an appellate court to review a lower court's ruling before the trial begins.\n\nAdditionally, it is intriguing that the defendants are appealing a decision made by a judge exercising discretionary judgment rather than an appeal solely based on the law, Porter said.\n\nThe next step in the legal process is for the attorneys representing Trump and his co-defendants to file a notice of appeal in order to transfer the case from the Fulton County Superior Court to the Court of Appeals. The defense will have 20 days after filing the notice to file briefs with the court, and the state will have another 20 days to respond.\n\nAlthough the Georgia appellate court discourages oral arguments, Porter said he expects the court to approve a request from the defense or state for an in-person hearing.\n\nIn the end, a panel of judges will either affirm McAfee's decision to keep Willis on the case, schedule an additional hearing to evaluate more evidence, or disqualify Willis, thereby preventing anyone else from taking over the case from the Fulton DA's office.\n\nPorter estimated that the appellate process would take at least five months to complete. The state or defense could also petition the Georgia Supreme Court to review the decision of the appellate court.\n\nPorter said it's possible that one of the factors in the appellate court granting the pre-trial review is due the historic legal significance of a potential racketeering trial that has a former president as the lead defendant.\n\nThe court granted the defendant's \"interlocutory appeal\" in a one-page document without explaining its reasoning.\n\n\"The Court of Appeals could be trying to more or less clear the decks to get the issue resolved so it doesn't hang over the trial one way or the other. That may be the most charitable explanation. It's hard to say why they do what they do, but it's unusual to grant an interlocutory appeal.\"\n\nThe appeal came from Trump and co-defendants including former Trump campaign officer Michael Roman, former Trump attorney Rudy Giuliani and ex-White House Chief of Staff Mark Meadows.\n\nAlthough Willis has come under greater scrutiny since the public learned about her prior romantic relationship with Wade, she is using the criticism against her as a rallying cry for her re-election campaign.\n\nA press conference was held at Atlanta's Big Bethel African Methodist Episcopal Church on Monday, as a group of influential Black religious leaders announced their endorsement of Willis in the May 21 Democratic primary when she faces Christian Wise Smith, who has served as Atlanta city solicitor and as a Fulton County prosecutor.\n\nDuring her Monday public appearance, Willis referred to a witch hunt against her since she is a Black woman who is willing to stand up to Trump and the GOP machine supporting Trump's nomination.\n\n\"Fani Willis has proven herself to be an effective, fearless, and courageous district attorney determined to defend and prioritize the pursuit of justice throughout Fulton County,\" said Bishop Reginald T. Jackson, who represents 500 Georgia churches within the African Methodist Episcopal Church's Sixth Episcopal District. \"I am proud to call her my friend and look forward to bringing the multi-denominations of Georgia's African-American Faith community together to showcase her leadership, passion, and results for Fulton County.\"\n\nEmory University political science professor Andra Gillespie said the dynamics of race have also been used by Trump, who has labeled Black prosecutors like Willis as \"reverse racists\" for daring to prosecute him.\n\n\"(Willis) has certainly invoked that type of language and imagery,\" Gillespie said. \"(Trump) also has tried to besmirch Fani Willis's character by making other allegations that seem to be very latent with stereotypes.\"\n\nThe first several months of 2024 have also reaped rewards for Willis' campaign war chest, bringing in $229,333 in campaign donations between January and April, double the amount raised in the last six months of 2023, according to Georgia campaign finance reports.\n\nThe winner of the upcoming Fulton DA Democratic primary will have a significant advantage in the Nov. 5 general election in a matchup against Courtney Kramer, a self-described MAGA attorney who has worked in the Trump White House. Kramer faces an uphill battle in heavily Democratic Fulton.\n\n\"It will be interesting to look at where her vote support comes from, not just in this primary election that's going to happen in two weeks, but also ultimately in November for the general election for DA,\" Gillespie said. \"We forget, because this is a very different context, but that when Willis ran in 2020 for this DA slot, when she was running against Paul Howard, she was the one who garnered a lot of support outside of the African-American community.\"\n\nWhen a grand jury in Fulton County indicted Trump and 18 others on racketeering and conspiracy charges in August, it was the fourth case that Trump faced criminal charges in 2023.\n\nIn March 2023, Trump became the first former US president to face criminal charges when he was indicted by a New York grand jury on 34 counts of falsifying business records. Trump is currently on trial in New York for allegedly trying to hide hush money paid to keep adult film star Stormy Daniels from disclosing details about an alleged extramarital affair with Trump in 2006.\n\nOn Tuesday, a U.S. district court judge indefinitely delayed a federal classified documents trial that had been scheduled to start on May 20. The next pretrial hearing in Florida court is now scheduled for July 22 as Trump stands trial for allegedly illegally retaining classified documents and trying to hide them from federal authorities.\n\nTrump's federal election interference case is on hold until after the U.S. Supreme Court rules on whether presidential immunity protects Trump from those criminal charges connected to his attempt to overturn the 2020 election. The Supreme Court's decision would set a legal precedent on the extent that presidents could be prosecuted for actions taken while they are in office.\n\nReporter Ross Williams contributed to this

It is unclear how long the busy appeals court will take to decide the issue but it could stretch into 2025.\n\n\"There's no way this case gets to trial this year,\" said Atlanta defense attorney Andrew Fleischman, who is closing following the case. \"I would expect the appeals court to issue its opinion some time next year.\"\n\nOn March 29, Superior Court Judge Scott McAfee issued a \"certificate of immediate review,\" which allowed the defendants to appeal his ruling to the Georgia Court of Appeals before a trial begins.\n\nUnder appeals court rules, such a pretrial -- or interlocutory -- appeal is typically assigned to a three-judge screening panel. And all it takes is for one of those judges to decide whether the court accepts the appeal. The court's one-page order did not divulge which judge voted to grant the application. It gave the defense 10 days to file its formal notice of appeal.\n\nIn his order granting the pretrial review, McAfee said he will continue working on the case, resolving pending motions, while the appeals court takes up the removal issue. It is possible Trump or his co-defendants could seek a stay from the appeals court barring McAfee from moving forward with his work on the case until the appeal is resolved.\n\nEight defendants, including Trump, requested permission to appeal a few days after McAfee effectively denied a motion to disqualify Willis due to her romantic relationship with then-special prosecutor Nathan Wade.\n\nWhile McAfee ruled that Willis did not have an actual conflict of interest that warranted her removal, he said there was an appearance of a conflict that required her to make a choice. Willis could either recuse herself and her office from the case or cut ties with Wade, McAfee said. Within hours, Wade had tendered his resignation.\n\nThe Fulton DA's office on Wednesday declined to comment.\n\nTrump's lead Atlanta lawyer, Steve Sadow, applauded the decision.\n\n\"President Trump looks forward to presenting interlocutory arguments to the Georgia Court of Appeals as to why the case should be dismissed and Fulton County DA Willis should be disqualified for her misconduct in this unjustified, unwarranted political persecution,\" Sadow said.\n\nFleischman said he understood why the appellate court agreed to decide the disqualification challenge.\n\n\"This issue is important,\" he said. \"You're prosecuting the former president of the United States. This is obviously an area of the law that needs clarification. ... It's so important to the outcome of the case.\"\n\nAttorneys for Trump and eight co-defendants told the appeals court that McAfee erred in failing to disqualify Willis and that mistake should be resolved before the case goes to trial.\n\nWade's resignation, they argued, did not cure the appearance of impropriety, which McAfee said in his ruling existed.\n\nAs a result, \"neither the public nor the accused can have the required confidence in the impartiality and fairness of the criminal process,\" they said.\n\nThe defense attorneys also contended Willis should have been removed for suggesting during a Jan. 14 speech at Big Bethel AME Church that the initial defense motion that criticized Willis' relationship with Wade was racially motivated.\n\nIn response, the DA's office said there was no basis for the appeals court to decide the issue. Prosecutors noted McAfee concluded the church speech did not \"cross the line\" and that the case is \"too far removed from jury selection for any actual prejudice or improper effect on the jury pool to actualize.\"\n\nAs for the relationship between Willis and Wade, the DA's office noted Wade withdrew as special prosecutor shortly after McAfee issued his order. \"Accordingly, the trial court properly exercised its discretion and inherent authority in denying the motion to disqualify based on an appearance of impropriety,\" the DA said.\n\nThe exact timeline for when the court would take up the disqualification appeal is unclear.\n\nFulton Superior Court must first prepare the record from the first round of the removal fight and send it to the appeals court. Only then can the case be docketed and a panel of three judges randomly assigned via the court's computer system, according to Christina Cooley Smith, deputy court administrator for the Court of Appeals.\n\nIt is then up to the judges to decide when they would like to hear oral argument, said Smith, but the matter must be decided within two terms of court. That means that if it's docketed before July, it would need to be heard and decided before mid-March 2025.\n\nThe Fulton case is not the only criminal proceeding against Trump that is delayed.\n\nU.S. District Court Judge Aileen Cannon on Tuesday canceled the May 20 trial date that had been set for Trump's classified documents trial in Florida. Her move indefinitely postponed the federal case, brought by Justice Department special counsel Jack Smith, and substantially raised the likelihood that it wouldn't be tried before Election Day.\n\nSmith's other case against Trump, which focuses on the Republican's attempts to cling to power in the aftermath of the 2020 election, has also been paused as the U.S. Supreme Court decides whether presidents should be immune for their actions while in office. Justices aren't expected to announce their decision on the matter until late June, and based on their comments during last month's oral arguments could instruct a lower court to take other action before Smith could move forward.\n\nA third criminal trial, involving alleged hush money payments, is underway in Manhattan.\n\nSeparately on Wednesday, the Court of Appeals rejected an appeal from Harrison Floyd, one of Trump's co-defendants in the Fulton election interference case.\n\nFloyd has argued the case should be dismissed because the State Election Board - not Willis' office - has exclusive authority to initiate and refer criminal investigations concerning elections. Superior Court Judge Scott McAfee rejected that argument in January and again in March.", "source": {"uri": "unionleader.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "UnionLeader.com"}, "authors": [],

to review ruling allowing DA to stay on Trump case", "body": "Mr Trump and some other defendants in the case had tried to get Ms Willis and her office removed from the case, saying her romantic relationship with special prosecutor Nathan Wade created a conflict of interest.\n\nSuperior Court Judge Scott McAfee in March found that no conflict of interest existed that should force Ms Willis off the case, but he granted a request from Mr Trump and the other defendants to seek an appeal of his ruling from the Georgia Court of Appeals.\n\nThat intermediate appeals court agreed to take up the case on Wednesday.\n\nOnce it rules, the losing side could ask the Georgia Supreme Court to consider an appeal.\n\nThe appeals court's decision to consider the case seems likely to cause a delay and further reduce the possibility that it will get to trial before the November general election, when Mr Trump is expected to be the Republican nominee for president.\n\nIn his order, Judge McAfee said he planned to continue to address other pretrial motions \"regardless of whether the petition is granted... and even if any subsequent appeal is expedited by the appellate court\".\n\nBut Trump and the others could ask the Court of Appeals to stay the case while the appeal is pending.\n\nJudge McAfee wrote in his order in March that the prosecution was \"encumbered by an appearance of impropriety\".\n\nHe said Ms Willis could remain on the case only if Mr Wade left, and the special prosecutor submitted his resignation hours later.\n\nThe allegations that Ms Willis had improperly benefited from her romance with Mr Wade resulted in a tumultuous couple of months in the case as intimate details of Ms Willis and Mr Wade's personal lives were aired in court in mid-February.\n\nThe serious charges in one of four criminal cases against the Republican former president were largely overshadowed by the love lives of the prosecutors.\n\nMr Trump and 18 others were indicted in August, accused of participating in a wide-ranging scheme to illegally try to overturn his narrow 2020 presidential election loss to Democrat Joe Biden in Georgia.\n\nAll of the defendants were charged with violating Georgia's Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organisations, or Rico, law, an expansive anti-racketeering statute.\n\nFour people charged in the case have pleaded guilty after reaching deals with prosecutors.\n\nMr Trump and the others have pleaded not guilty.\n\nMr Trump and other defendants had argued in their appeal application that Judge McAfee was wrong not to remove both Ms Willis and Mr Wade, writing that \"providing DA Willis with the option to simply remove Wade confounds logic and is contrary to Georgia law\".\n\nThe allegations against Ms Willis first surfaced in a motion filed in early January by Ashleigh Merchant, a lawyer for former Trump campaign staffer and onetime White House aide Michael Roman.\n\nThe motion alleged that Ms Willis and Mr Wade were involved in an inappropriate romantic relationship and that Ms Willis paid Mr Wade large sums for his work and then benefitted when he paid for lavish vacations.\n\nMs Willis and Mr Wade acknowledged the relationship but said they didn't begin dating until the spring of 2022, after Mr Wade was hired in November 2021, and their romance ended last summer.\n\nThey also said that they split travel costs roughly evenly, with Ms Willis often paying expenses or reimbursing Mr Wade in cash.", "source": {"uri": "irvinetimes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Irvine Times"}, "authors": [], "concepts":

They argue Willis had an \"improper\" affair with a subordinate lawyer on her team and should be disqualified.\n\nJudge Scott McAfee ruled in March that Willlis' affair gave her team an \"appearance of impropriety\" and said special prosector Nathan Wade needed to be removed or Willis should step down. Wade resigned shortly following that ruling.\n\nTimeline: Fulton County DA Fani Willis, Nathan Wade controversy\n\nBut Trump and his co-defendants appealed that decision, which will now go before the Court of Appeals. John Malcolm, a former assistant U.S. Attorney in Atlanta, said there's \"not a chance\" Trump's Georgia election interference case will go to trial before November.\n\n\"Although the odds of the Georgia case coming to trial quickly were never very good, now that the Georgia Court of Appeals has agreed to consider the recusal issue, there is not a chance the Georgia case is going to go to trial before the November election,\" Malcolm told Fox News Digital.\n\n\"There are still lots of pending motions that Judge McAfee will have to consider once (or if) the case is returned to him for further proceedings,\" Malcolm noted. He added that the U.S. Supreme Court's pending decision in the Trump immunity case may have an impact on some of the charges that Willis' office has brought against the former president.\n\nMalcolm added that \"by dramatically overcharging this case and by engaging in an interoffice romance with a prosecutor whom she appointed, Fani Willis has no one but herself to blame for the predicament she is in.\"\n\nMORE: Nathan Wade opens up about Fani Willis workplace romance: 'As American as apple pie'\n\nGeorgia State University law professor Anthony Kreis told Fox News in an interview that, according to the court's rules, the appeals court has to hear and decide a case within two terms.\n\n\"Now that's a long period of time. We're basically looking into early 2025 potentially if the court puts it at the end of its docket,\" Kreis said. \"The Court of Appeals is a pretty busy court. And so, you know, maybe they want to take the [case] sooner, maybe they don't.\"\n\nKreis explained that it's not guaranteed the appeals court will hold oral arguments in the case and could just decide it based on briefings by both parties.\n\nThe earliest the appeals court could hear the case is August of this year.\n\n\"This mess definitely is of DA Willis' own making,\" Shu added.\n\nWillis did not immediately respond to Fox News Digital's request for comment.", "source": {"uri": "fox5atlanta.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "FOX 5 Atlanta"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fani_Willis", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Fani Willis"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Georgia_(U.S._state)", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Georgia (U.S. state)"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Georgia (U.S. state)"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fulton_County,_Georgia", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Fulton County, Georgia"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Fulton County, Georgia"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/District_attorney", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "District attorney"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Racketeering", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Racketeering"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2020_United_States_presidential_election", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "2020 United States presidential election"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lawyer", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Lawyer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assistant_United_States_Attorney", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Assistant United States Attorney"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fox_News", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Fox News"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Georgia_Court_of_Appeals", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Georgia Court of Appeals"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Judicial_disqualification", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Judicial disqualification"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electoral_fraud", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Electoral fraud"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atlanta", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Atlanta, Georgia"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Atlanta, Georgia"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oral_argument", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Oral argument"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Georgia_State_University", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Georgia State University"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Legal_immunity", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Legal immunity"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jurist", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Jurist"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supreme_Court_of_the_United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Supreme Court of the United States"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prosecutor", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Prosecutor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Law", "label": "dmoz/Society/Law", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Law/Legal_Information", "label": "dmoz/Society/Law/Legal Information", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Law/Courts", "label": "dmoz/Society/Law/Courts", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Law", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Law", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Laws", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Laws", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 92}], "image": "https://images.foxtv.com/static.fox5atlanta.com/www.fox5atlanta.com/content/uploads/2024/05/1280/720/GettyImages-2148857973.jpg?ve=1&tl=1", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9549791", "eventUri": "eng-9549791", "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Fulton County, Georgia"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.1215686274509804, "wgt": 194, "relevance": 1}

There is no set trial date, and proceedings were derailed in recent months over allegations that the lead prosecutor, Fulton County District Attorney Fani Willis, had committed ethical lapses stemming from a romantic relationship with a special prosecutor she hired.\n\nAfter the trial judge, Scott McAfee, rejected a bid to kick Willis off the case, Trump and his co-defendants sought permission to appeal that ruling. In a terse order on Wednesday, a Georgia appeals court granted the request to hear the appeal.\n\nEven if the appeals court ultimately allows Willis to remain on the case, the decision to hear the appeal will likely delay the proceedings for months.\n\nTrump and his co-defendants have alleged that Willis had a financial conflict of interest because she was dating special prosecutor Nathan Wade and taking lavish vacations with him at the same time that her office was paying him on a contract basis to run the Trump case. Wade resigned from the case in March after McAfee ruled that the relationship created the \"appearance of conflict\" but that Willis could remain on the case if Wade stepped down.\n\nTrump is currently on trial in Manhattan on charges that he orchestrated a scheme to cover up an affair with a porn star to influence the 2016 election. But the Georgia decision ensures that Trump's other three criminal cases remain in limbo and are increasingly unlikely to reach a verdict before voters cast ballots this fall.\n\nIn addition to the Florida case, Trump's other federal criminal case -- on charges that he criminally conspired to subvert the 2020 election -- is also teetering as the Supreme Court considers whether to declare him immune from the charges altogether. A trial this year is still possible if the justices do not grant Trump the sweeping presidential immunity he says should block the prosecution.\n\nBut the legal snags have raised the odds that Trump might never face a jury in either of the two federal cases, both of which were brought by special counsel Jack Smith. If Trump wins the election later this year and the two federal cases remain pending, he is all but certain to order the Justice Department to unravel them. And his lawyers have foreshadowed efforts to postpone the Georgia trial during a potential presidency, even if it is allowed to proceed by the state courts.\n\nMcAfee has said that for practical reasons at least two trials would be required in the case to deal with the sprawling roster of 15 defendants. Trump and 18 others were charged in the indictment Willis obtained last August, but four of the defendants pleaded guilty and agreed to cooperate with prosecutors.\n\nProsecutors have asked that Trump be tried alongside all other defendants, but McAfee hasn't ruled on that request.", "source": {"uri": "politico.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "POLITICO"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

Ms Willis's office has denied allegations of misconduct and said the relationship had no impact on the case.\n\nFulton County judge Scott McAfee ruled the relationship did not pose a conflict of interest but said it created an appearance of wrongdoing. Judge McAfee said Ms Willis's office could remain on the case if Mr Wade stepped aside, which he agreed to do.\n\nJudge McAfee later gave permission for Mr Trump and his co-defendants to appeal his ruling before trial.\n\nTrump and the 14 co-defendants have pleaded not guilty to racketeering and other charges stemming from what prosecutors allege was a scheme to overturn Mr Trump's narrow defeat in Georgia in the 2020 election. Four others who had been co-defendants in the case have pleaded guilty in deals with the prosecutors. - Reuters", "source": {"uri": "irishtimes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Irish Times"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fani_Willis", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Fani Willis"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/District_attorney", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "District attorney"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Georgia_(U.S._state)", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Georgia (U.S. state)"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Georgia (U.S. state)"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/.mr", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": ".mr"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fulton_County,_Georgia", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Fulton County, Georgia"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Fulton County, Georgia"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_federal_judge", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States federal judge"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lawyer", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Lawyer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Florida", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Florida"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Florida"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Biden", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acquittal", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Acquittal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_House", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "White House"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republican_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Republican Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Racketeering", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Racketeering"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2020_United_States_presidential_election", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "2020 United States presidential election"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conflict_of_interest", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Conflict of interest"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reuters", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Reuters"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Law/Legal_Information", "label": "dmoz/Society/Law/Legal Information", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Crime_and_Justice", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Crime and Justice", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Trials", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Trials", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Law", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Law", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 87}], "image": "https://www.irishtimes.com/resizer/0GKokoTQkBFY2AqZ1IFPix9FgVk=/1200x630/filters:format(jpg):quality(70)/cloudfront-eu-central-1.images.arcpublishing.com/irishtimes/DKHPWZYMLVVOUG4ADU2LKB5ZNI.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9549791", "eventUri": "eng-9549791", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "date": "-11-05", "textStart": 1285, "textEnd": 1297}], "sentiment": -0.1137254901960785, "wgt": 190, "relevance": 1}

Wade resigned a few hours after the judge issued his ruling.\n\nThe victory on Trump's appeal could be a major blow to the entire case and push it back through the November presidential election.\n\nSponsored: Wall Street investors are selling their shares at a record pace\n\nSteven H.

Speaking to The New York Times, former Justice Department official Anthony Coley condemned the Georgia appeals court findings and said, \"Trump & his allies will always find something, anything to delay their day in Court.

That means the appellate court will hear the case before the trial gets underway rather than afterward if Trump or any of the other 14 co-defendants were convicted.\n\n\"President Trump looks forward to presenting interlocutory arguments to the Georgia Court of Appeals as to why the case should be dismissed and Fulton County DA Willis should be disqualified for her misconduct in this unjustified, unwarranted political persecution,\" said Steve Sadow, lead defense counsel for Trump in the case.\n\nTrump and the others face charges of conspiring to commit election fraud in an effort to overturn the results of the 2020 election in Georgia that Trump lost to President Joe Biden.\n\nThe presiding judge in the case, Scott McAfee, ruled in March that Willis could stay on the case despite admitting to having an affair with a private lawyer she hired to oversee the investigation, Nathan Wade, as long as she forced him off of the prosecution team.

(Atlanta News First) - The U.S. House Judiciary Committee is asking Nathan Wade, the former special prosecutor in Fulton County DA Fani Willis' investigation and subsequent indictment of the nation's 45th president, to testify behind closed doors in Washington, D.C.\n\nIn a letter dating May 9, 2024, U.S. Rep. Jim Jordan (R-Ohio) - who has engaged in a fierce war of words with Willis - wrote Wade, with whom Willis had an acknowledged personal relationship.\n\nJordan's committee had already asked Wade for information regarding his employment as a special prosecutor in the investigation, a position he was forced to relinquish by Fulton County Superior Court Judge Scott McAfee if Willis were to remain on the case.\n\nWillis is the locally elected Fulton County, Georgia, district attorney who is overseeing the massive organized crime case against former President Donald Trump and others. Jordan, who chairs the powerful House Judiciary Committee, has been a strong critic of Willis' investigation into Trump and her indictments.\n\nWillis has also been threatened with contempt of Congress by Jordan.\n\nEarlier this week, the Georgia Court of Appeals agreed to hear an appeal from Trump over a judge's decision allowing Willis to remain on the case, despite her admitted romantic relationship with Wade.\n\nOn April 1, Trump and the remaining defendants in Georgia's historic racketeering indictment formally appealed McAfee's ruling allowing Willis to remain on the case. That appeal came after McAfee gave the green light to allow such an appeal over his decision. The appeal was signed by all of the attorneys representing the remaining co-defendants who have not already settled the case in Fulton County Superior Court.\n\nIn March, McAfee rejected defense efforts to remove Willis and her office over her romantic relationship with Wade, but he did give the defendants permission to seek a review of his decision from the appeals court. In his ruling, McAfee wrote Willis must remove Wade from the racketeering indictment if she were to remain on the case. Wade resigned just hours after that ruling.\n\nThe Georgia Court of Appeals' docket for case number A24I0160, also known as DONALD JOHN TRUMP ET AL V. THE STATE, said the appeal will be heard during the court's August 2024 term. Per the court's website, all cases docketed to this term must be decided by March 14, 2025.\n\nThe August term ends on Nov. 18, 2024. The court's argument calendar for August, September and October does not yet list a date for Trump's appeal.\n\nWillis also is at war with a state Senate committee investigating her use of public funds in Wade's hiring, a committee the DA - who is up for reelection in only a few days - alleges has no authority over her.\n\nDuring a news conference in which she announced the endorsement of several prominent Atlanta African-American faith leaders, Willis said she would not honor any subpoena issued by the committee .\n\n\"First of all, I don't even think they have the authority to subpoena me, but they need to learn the law,\" Willis said Monday. \"I will not appear to anything that is unlawful, and I have not broken the law in any way. I'm sorry folks get pissed off that everybody gets treated evenly.\"\n\nAfter her remarks, Lt. Gov. Burt Jones - a likely candidate for governor in Georgia's wide-open 2026 gubernatorial race - said on X (formerly known as Twitter), \"If subpoenaed by the Committee, she will be required to appear or she will be in violation of Georgia law. This is what treating everybody evenly looks like, even if DA Willis doesn't like being held accountable.\"\n\nLast week, state Sen. Bill Cowsert (R-Athens), who chairs the committee investigating Willis, said he would subpoena the Democratic district attorney if she doesn't agree to appear before his committee.\n\n\"She's a key part of the investigation and [her] viewpoints are valued by us,\" Cowsert said after the committee's most recent hearing. \"We need to hear what she has to say and her explanation of what she thinks are the appropriate rules ought to be going forward so we don't have this kind of scandal give Georgia a black eye.\"\n\nLast week, the committee reconvened after state lawmakers earlier this year charged it to determine if Willis engaged in any financial misconduct in her investigation and subsequent historic indictment of Trump.\n\nAppearing at a Friday community event with Fulton County Superior Court Clerk Ch\u00e9 Alexander at K&K Soul Food, Willis condemned the committee.", "source": {"uri": "wrdw.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "https://www.wrdw.com"}, "authors": [],

I hate that my personal life has begun to overshadow the true issues in the case.\"\n\nThe prosecutors' past relationship still threatens to upend the criminal case against Trump and 14 co-defendants (all of whom have pleaded not guilty; four others have taken plea deals). Attorneys for the defendants have sought to boot Willis from the case, alleging that the relationship constituted a conflict of interest, or at least gave the appearance of one.\n\nIn acrimonious testimony in February, Willis said her relationship with Wade began in 2022, but that physical intimacy between them ended in 2023, before Trump and his co-defendants were criminally indicted. (The timeline of their relationship was contradicted by a former friend of Willis' who also testified.) Judge Scott McAfee ultimately ruled that Willis could stay on the case as long as Wade resigned, which he quickly did.\n\nWade told ABC News that he was not speaking publicly on behalf of Willis' office. \"As a matter of fact, I'm certain that they would rather me not be having this exchange with you,\" he said. \"With that, I want to continually protect the integrity of this prosecution. I don't want to say or do anything that would jeopardize this case.\"\n\nIt might be too late for that. On Wednesday, a Georgia appeals court agreed to consider Trump's request to disqualify Willis from the case. A trial date still has not been set, but the appeals court ruling, when it comes, could unravel the whole case.\n\nIn his interview, Wade conceded that the relationship \"did not happen in ideal timing,\" but he and Willis had not planned to develop feelings for each other. He also appeared to brush off the potential impact of the relationship on the case.\n\n\"Workplace romances are as American as apple pie,\" he said. \"It happens to everyone.\"", "source": {"uri": "msnbc.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "MSNBC.com"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electoral_fraud", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Electoral fraud"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special_counsel", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Special counsel"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fani_Willis", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Fani Willis"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ABC_News", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "ABC News"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/District_attorney", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "District attorney"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Romanticism", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Romanticism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Georgia_(U.S._state)", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Georgia (U.S. state)"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Georgia (U.S. state)"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fulton_County,_Georgia", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Fulton County, Georgia"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Fulton County, Georgia"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plea_bargain", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Plea bargain"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Criminal_procedure", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Criminal procedure"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acquittal", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Acquittal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conflict_of_interest", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Conflict of interest"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scott_McAfee", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Scott McAfee"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_pie", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Apple pie"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indictment", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Indictment"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/End-of-Life", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/End-of-Life", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Crime_and_Justice", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Crime and Justice", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Job-Related", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Job-Related", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Death/Suicide", "label": "dmoz/Society/Death/Suicide", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 63}], "image": "https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_nbcnews-fp-1024-512,f_auto,q_auto:best/rockcms/2024-03/240316-Nathan-Wade-ch-1532-ae1cf2.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9549791", "eventUri": "eng-9549791", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.1137254901960785, "wgt": 188, "relevance": 1}

McAfee's decision came with the caveat that Willis's ex-lover and special prosecutor, Nathan Wade, had to step aside due to the \"odor of mendacity\" the judge said their romantic relationship left on the prosecution.\n\n\"President Trump looks forward to presenting interlocutory arguments to the Georgia Court of Appeals as to why the case should be dismissed and Fulton County DA Willis should be disqualified for her misconduct in this unjustified, unwarranted political persecution,\" Trump attorney Steve Sadow told the Washington Examiner in a statement.\n\nTrump is charged alongside 13 others over an alleged conspiracy to subvert the 2020 election results in the Peach State. The former president has pleaded not guilty to the charges.\n\nThe defendants would like to see the appeals court find that Willis's relationship amounted to a conflict of interest and have her completely removed from the case. It is not clear when the appeals court will weigh arguments in the dispute, according to a copy of the order.\n\nIn March, McAfee determined that pretrial work in his court would not be automatically stalled if the appeals court agreed to consider his decision to keep Willis on the case. But Trump and his co-defendants could seek a stay from the appeals court, which would pause the case during the appeal.\n\nEfforts to disqualify Willis were first spurred by Mike Roman, a Republican operative who is one of Trump's allies charged in the sweeping racketeering indictment. Roman's lawyer, Ashleigh Merchant, first revealed allegations of a previous long-term relationship between Willis and Wade in a Jan. 8 complaint filed to McAfee.\n\nFeatured Local Savings\n\nThe ensuing months marred the prosecution with extensive hearings that dredged much of Willis's and Wade's personal lives into the case. Throughout weeks of hearings, the point of contention became not the relationship itself but whether Willis benefited from appointing Wade to a lucrative special prosecutor position.\n\nWillis claimed she split vacation expenses roughly evenly by reimbursing Wade with cash when the pair went on trips together throughout the course of his employment by the county. However, because she and Wade lacked evidence to verify or contradict that claim, McAfee said the defense had not met its burden to disprove her testimony.\n\nMcAfee noted at one point that there were \"reasonable questions\" about Willis's and Wade's truthfulness when they testified about their romantic relationship under penalty of perjury.\n\nThe appeals court decision comes just days after Wade made his first public appearance since his resignation as special prosecutor in an ABC interview.\n\nCLICK HERE TO READ MORE FROM THE WASHINGTON EXAMINER\n\n\"Workplace romances are as American as apple pie,\" Wade said in that recent interview in an effort to downplay their office relationship. \"It happens to everyone. But it happened to the two of us.\"\n\nAn agreement to consider the appeal from Trump and his co-defendants also comes as the former president continues to sit in the courtroom for the trial he faces in Manhattan, the only one of four against him that has made it to a trial.\n\nSign Up for Springs AM Update Your morning rundown of the latest news from Colorado Springs and around the country\n\nSign Up View all of our newsletters.

It is unclear how long the busy appeals court will take to decide the issue but it could stretch into 2025.\n\n\"There's no way this case gets to trial this year,\" said Atlanta defense attorney Andrew Fleischman, who is closing following the case. \"I would expect the appeals court to issue its opinion some time next year.\"\n\nOn March 29, Superior Court Judge Scott McAfee issued a \"certificate of immediate review,\" which allowed the defendants to appeal his ruling to the Georgia Court of Appeals before a trial begins.\n\nUnder appeals court rules, such a pretrial -- or interlocutory -- appeal is typically assigned to a three-judge screening panel. And all it takes is for one of those judges to decide whether the court accepts the appeal. The court's one-page order did not divulge which judge voted to grant the application. It gave the defense 10 days to file its formal notice of appeal.\n\nIn his order granting the pretrial review, McAfee said he will continue working on the case, resolving pending motions, while the appeals court takes up the removal issue. It is possible Trump or his co-defendants could seek a stay from the appeals court barring McAfee from moving forward with his work on the case until the appeal is resolved.\n\nEight defendants, including Trump, requested permission to appeal a few days after McAfee effectively denied a motion to disqualify Willis due to her romantic relationship with then-special prosecutor Nathan Wade.\n\nWhile McAfee ruled that Willis did not have an actual conflict of interest that warranted her removal, he said there was an appearance of a conflict that required her to make a choice. Willis could either recuse herself and her office from the case or cut ties with Wade, McAfee said. Within hours, Wade had tendered his resignation.\n\nThe Fulton DA's office on Wednesday declined to comment.\n\nTrump's lead Atlanta lawyer, Steve Sadow, applauded the decision.\n\n...continued", "source": {"uri": "arcamax.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "ArcaMax"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Georgia_Court_of_Appeals", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Georgia Court of Appeals"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/McAfee", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "McAfee"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atlanta", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Atlanta, Georgia"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Atlanta, Georgia"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fani_Willis", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Fani Willis"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/District_attorney", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "District attorney"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electoral_fraud", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Electoral fraud"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fulton_County,_Georgia", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Fulton County, Georgia"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Fulton County, Georgia"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Superior_court", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Superior court"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lawyer", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Lawyer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Appeal", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Appeal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conflict_of_interest", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Conflict of interest"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prosecutor", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Prosecutor"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Law", "label": "dmoz/Society/Law", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Law/Legal_Information", "label": "dmoz/Society/Law/Legal Information", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Law/Courts", "label": "dmoz/Society/Law/Courts", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Law", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Law", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Laws", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Laws", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 59}], "image": "https://resources.arcamax.com/newspics/288/28851/2885181.gif", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9549791", "eventUri": "eng-9549791", "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Atlanta, Georgia"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-03-29", "textStart": 816, "textEnd": 824}], "sentiment": 0.06666666666666665, "wgt": 187, "relevance": 1}

However, the judge raised concerns about the \"appearance of impropriety\" and only allowed Willis to press forward after Wade resigned. Her other option was to step down.\n\nTrump and some of his co-defendants argued that Willis should be disqualified and that the case be dismissed, claiming the office romance flush with gifts and trips \"created an appearance of impropriety in this case that cast a pall over these entire proceedings.\" Willis then filed a motion insisting there was \"no basis\" to grant a review of the lower-court order.\n\nThe Washington Post reported that Trump and his co-defendants are expected to ask the appeals to stay the proceedings while the appeal plays out after McAfee said he would not pause the process. A trial date has not yet been set, but CNN reported Willis hoped to have it before the 2024 election.\n\nTrump and 18 co-defendants pleaded not guilty to a bevy of charges in the Georgia election case, but four of them have since taken plea deals. As Trump seeks a second White House term, the former president has broadly denied wrongdoing across multiple cases. One election-related \"hush money\" case in New York has gone to trial while a judge delayed a federal classified documents case trial indefinitely.

There is no set trial date, and proceedings were derailed in recent months over allegations that the lead prosecutor, Fulton County District Attorney Fani Willis, had committed ethical lapses stemming from a romantic relationship with a special prosecutor she hired.\n\nAfter the trial judge, Scott McAfee, rejected a bid to kick Willis off the case, Trump and his co-defendants sought permission to appeal that ruling. In a terse order on Wednesday, a Georgia appeals court granted the request to hear the appeal.\n\nEven if the appeals court ultimately allows Willis to remain on the case, the decision to hear the appeal will likely delay the proceedings for months.\n\nTrump and his co-defendants have alleged that Willis had a financial conflict of interest because she was dating special prosecutor Nathan Wade and taking lavish vacations with him at the same time that her office was paying him on a contract basis to run the Trump case. Wade resigned from the case in March after McAfee ruled that the relationship created the \"appearance of conflict\" but that Willis could remain on the case if Wade stepped down.\n\nTrump is currently on trial in Manhattan on charges that he orchestrated a scheme to cover up an affair with a porn star to influence the 2016 election. But the Georgia decision ensures that Trump's other three criminal cases remain in limbo and are increasingly unlikely to reach a verdict before voters cast ballots this fall.\n\nIn addition to the Florida case, Trump's other federal criminal case -- on charges that he criminally conspired to subvert the 2020 election -- is also teetering as the Supreme Court considers whether to declare him immune from the charges altogether. A trial this year is still possible if the justices do not grant Trump the sweeping presidential immunity he says should block the prosecution.\n\nBut the legal snags have raised the odds that Trump might never face a jury in either of the two federal cases, both of which were brought by special counsel Jack Smith. If Trump wins the election later this year and the two federal cases remain pending, he is all but certain to order the Justice Department to unravel them. And his lawyers have foreshadowed efforts to postpone the Georgia trial during a potential presidency, even if it is allowed to proceed by the state courts.\n\nMcAfee has said that for practical reasons at least two trials would be required in the case to deal with the sprawling roster of 15 defendants. Trump and 18 others were charged in the indictment Willis obtained last August, but four of the defendants pleaded guilty and agreed to cooperate with prosecutors.\n\nProsecutors have asked that Trump be tried alongside all other defendants, but McAfee hasn't ruled on that request.", "source": {"uri": "yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

Willis said she reimbursed Wade for her share of the trips in cash.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nIn his March order, McAfee said while Willis' \"reimbursement practice\" was \"unusual and the lack of any documentary corroboration understandably concerning,\" he ultimately decided that the defendants did not present \"sufficient evidence\" that expenses weren't \"roughly divided evenly.\"\n\nFox News' Brianna Herlihy contributed to this report.", "source": {"uri": "foxnews.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Fox News"}, "authors": [{"uri": "anders_hagstrom@foxnews.com", "name": "Anders Hagstrom", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electoral_fraud", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Electoral fraud"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fani_Willis", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Fani Willis"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lawyer", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Lawyer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fulton_County,_Georgia", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Fulton County, Georgia"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Fulton County, Georgia"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Independent_politician", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Independent politician"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_House_Committee_on_the_Judiciary", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States House Committee on the Judiciary"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jim_Jordan_(American_politician)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Jim Jordan (American politician)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Biden", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MSNBC", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "MSNBC"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/District_attorney", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "District attorney"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democracy", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Democracy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republican_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Republican Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fox_News", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Fox News"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Georgia_State_Senate", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Georgia State Senate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Georgia_Court_of_Appeals", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Georgia Court of Appeals"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Georgia_(U.S._state)", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Georgia (U.S. state)"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Georgia (U.S. state)"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special_counsel", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Special counsel"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mar-a-Lago", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Mar-a-Lago"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Classified_information", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Classified information"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Bureau_of_Investigation", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Federal Bureau of Investigation"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Law/Legal_Information", "label": "dmoz/Society/Law/Legal Information", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/End-of-Life", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/End-of-Life", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Crime_and_Justice", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Crime and Justice", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Intellectual_Property", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Intellectual Property", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Trials", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Trials", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 95}], "image": "https://a57.foxnews.com/static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2024/02/1024/512/Fani-Willis-Nathan-Wade.jpg?ve=1&tl=1", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9549791", "eventUri": "eng-9549791", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-05-16", "textStart": 1342, "textEnd": 1348}], "sentiment": -0.1372549019607843, "wgt": 185, "relevance": 1}

It is unclear how long the appeals court will take to decide the issue but they are not known for moving swiftly.\n\n\"There's no way this case gets to trial this year,\" said Atlanta defense attorney Andrew Fleischman, who is closing following the case. \"I would expect the appeals court to issue its opinion some time next year.\"\n\nOn March 29, Superior Court Judge Scott McAfee issued a \"certificate of immediate review,\" which allowed the defendants to appeal his ruling to the Georgia Court of Appeals before a trial begins.\n\nUnder Appeals Court rules, such a pretrial -- or interlocutory -- appeal is typically assigned to a three-judge screening panel. And all it takes is for one of those judges to decide whether the court accepts the appeal. The court's order one-page order did not divulge which judge voted to grant the application.\n\nIn his order granting the pre-trial review, McAfee said he will continue working on the case, resolving pending motions, while the appeals court takes up the removal issue.\n\nEight defendants, including Trump, requested permission to appeal a few days after McAfee mostly denied a motion to disqualify Willis due to her romantic relationship with then-special prosecutor Nathan Wade.\n\nWhile McAfee ruled that Willis did not have an actual conflict of interest that warranted her removal, he said there was an appearance of a conflict that required her to make a choice. Willis could either recuse herself and her office from the case or cut ties with Wade, McAfee said. Within hours, Wade had tendered his resignation.\n\nThe Fulton DA's office declined to comment.\n\nTrump's lead Atlanta lawyer, Steve Sadow, applauded the decision.\n\n\"President Trump looks forward to presenting interlocutory arguments to the Georgia Court of Appeals as to why the case should be dismissed and Fulton County DA Willis should be disqualified for her misconduct in this unjustified, unwarranted political persecution,\" Sadow said.\n\nFleischman said he understood why the appellate court agreed to decide the disqualification challenge.\n\n\"This issue is important,\" he said. \"You're prosecuting the former president of the United States. This is obviously an area of the law that needs clarification. ... It's so important to the outcome of the case.\"\n\nThe Fulton case is not the only criminal proceeding against Trump that is delayed.\n\nU.S. District Court Judge Aileen Cannon on Tuesday canceled the May 20 trial date that had been set for Trump's classified documents trial in Florida. Her move indefinitely postponed the federal case, brought by Justice Department special counsel Jack Smith, and substantially raised the likelihood that it wouldn't be tried before Election Day.\n\nSmith's other case against Trump, which focuses on the Republican's attempts to cling to power in the aftermath of the 2020 election, has also been paused as the U.S. Supreme Court decides whether presidents should be immune for their actions while in office. Justices aren't expected to announce their decision on the matter until late June, and based on their comments during last month's oral arguments could instruct a lower court to take other action before Smith could move forward.\n\nA third criminal trial, involving alleged hush money payments, is underway in Manhattan.\n\nSeparately on Wednesday, the Court of Appeals rejected an appeal from Harrison Floyd, one of Trump's co-defendants in the Fulton election interference case.\n\nFloyd has argued the case should be dismissed because the State Election Board - not Willis' office - has exclusive authority to initiate and refer criminal investigations concerning elections. Superior Court Judge Scott McAfee rejected that argument in January and again in March.\n\nThe exact timeline for when the court would take up the disqualification appeal is unclear.\n\nFulton Superior Court must first prepare the record from the first round of the removal fight and send it to the appeals court. Only then can the case be docketed and a panel of three judges be assigned via the court's computer system, according to Christina Cooley Smith, deputy court administrator for the Court of Appeals.\n\nIt is then up to the judges to decide when they would like to hear oral argument, said Smith, but the matter must be decided within two terms of court. That means that if it's docketed before July, it would need to be heard and decided before mid-March 2025.", "source": {"uri": "ajc.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Atlanta

They filed multiple lawsuits seeking to challenge the election results and overturn the outcome.\n\nUltimately, the legal challenges filed by Trump and his team in Georgia, along with other states, were largely unsuccessful, and the election results in Georgia were certified, confirming Joe Biden as the winner.\n\nThis latest decision by the appeals court unfolds as Trump deals with an ongoing trial in a separate criminal case in New York, which stands as the sole trial among the four criminal cases he is facing.\n\nDespite the unfolding legal maneuvers, a trial date for the election interference case in Georgia is yet to be scheduled.", "source": {"uri": "hollywoodunlocked.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Hollywood Unlocked"}, "authors": [{"uri": "kecia_gayle@hollywoodunlocked.com", "name": "Kecia Gayle", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Georgia_(U.S._state)", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Georgia (U.S. state)"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Georgia (U.S. state)"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fani_Willis", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Fani Willis"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/District_attorney", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "District attorney"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conflict_of_interest", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Conflict of interest"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electoral_fraud", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Electoral fraud"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Biden", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prosecutor", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Prosecutor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Attempts_to_overturn_the_2020_United_States_presidential_election", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Attempts to overturn the 2020 United States presidential election"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2020_United_States_presidential_election", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "2020 United States presidential election"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_(state)", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "New York (state)"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lawsuit", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Lawsuit"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Law", "label": "dmoz/Society/Law", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Law/Legal_Information", "label": "dmoz/Society/Law/Legal Information", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Crime_and_Justice", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Crime and Justice", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Law", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Law", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 77}], "image": "https://hollywoodunlocked.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/IMG_6240.jpeg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9549791", "eventUri": "eng-9549791", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1607843137254903, "wgt": 183, "relevance": 1}

The move likely signals additional delays in the long-delayed trial process and could even portend the removal of the district attorney and her office from the case itself.\n\nIn the terse, one-page order, the Peach State's second-highest court granted the application for interlocutory appeal filed on March 29. The appeals court had 45 days, until May 13, to issue an order granting or denying consideration of the defense appeal from the trial court order that halfheartedly and narrowly allowed Willis to remain on the case.\n\nThe defense has been angling to have Willis and her office removed from the case since early January -- initially over allegations that her romantic relationship with now-former lead prosecutor Nathan Wade created a conflict of interest due to pecuniary motives.\n\nThe motion that brought the once-secretive, then-admitted, affair into the light of day was filed by attorney Ashleigh Merchant on behalf of Michael Roman, a senior staff member for Trump's 2020 reelection campaign. Prosecutors in the Peach State claim he played a relevant, criminal, role in the fake or \"contingent\" electors scheme. Once those allegations were lodged in court, they slowly but surely blew up the timeline Willis and her lieutenants had for quick justice.\n\nOn March 15, Fulton Superior Court Judge Scott McAfee partially granted the defense motion to disqualify but gave the prosecution the choice of which prosecutor had to go. The court's order was based on a finding that the one-time romance between Willis and Wade resulted in \"a significant appearance of impropriety that infects the current structure of the prosecution team.\" Wade resigned hours later.\n\nThe original crux of the defense's basic argument for removing Willis was that the district attorney hired her then-boyfriend for the job, overpaid him, and then reaped something akin to a financial windfall in the form of vacations, travel, lodging, and other such gifts. Those alleged gifts, the defense argued, were paid for with public funds.\n\nIn the end, McAfee said the defense had not met its burden to show Willis obtained \"a material financial benefit as a result of her decision to hire\" Wade -- or that the \"financial gain flowing from her relationship\" motivated Willis to prosecute and prolong the case.\n\nOn March 20, McAfee granted a certificate of immediate review allowing the defendants to appeal his decision allowing Willis to stay while the case is still in the pretrial phase -- but cautioning the defense that the pretrial process would still play out in the meantime.\n\nNow that the appeals court has decided to take up the case against Willis, the defendants will be allowed to -- and almost certainly will -- file for a stay pending the results of the overall appeal.\n\nThe defense has 10 days from May 8 to file a formal notice of appeal.\n\nThe earlier appeal application was premised on \"forensic misconduct\" allegations against Willis over her Martin Luther King Jr. Day speech at Big Bethel A.M.E. Church in Atlanta -- a speech that, the defense argued, was a direct public response to the nepotism allegations.\n\n\"While the trial court factually found DA Willis' out-of-court statements were improper and Defendants proved an apparent conflict of interest, the trial court erred as a matter of law by not requiring dismissal and DA Willis' disqualification,\" the appeal reads. \"This legal error requires the Court's immediate review.\"\n\nThe defense has accused the district attorney of using the nationally-televised speech to make \"inflammatory extrajudicial racial comments\" about the defendants and of improperly stoking \"racial animus\" to influence would-be jurors in retaliation for, and in order to deflect from, the allegations raised in the motion to disqualify.\n\nMcAfee was withering in his prior estimation of this speech.\n\n\"The effect of this speech was to cast racial aspersions at an indicted defendant's decision to file this pretrial motion,\" the judge wrote.\n\nThe defense argued the trial court's decision not to toss Willis and her office from the case was \"legal error\" that needs immediate review.\n\nThe appeals court agreed that the matter necessitated review.\n\nNotably, however, the appellate court will not be cabined by the primary forensic focus of the defense's appeal. Rather, the judges chosen to consider the allegations against Willis will have extremely broad latitude to review \"all judgments, rulings, or orders rendered in the case\" under long-standing statutory authority in Georgia. In other words, the parties will more or less be able to raise all of the prior issues in the case -- even an issue previously considered moot.\n\nThe decision to take up the allegations against Willis lodged by Trump and his co-defendants in the sprawling case surprised many legal experts and practitioners in Georgia who prognosticated the chances of such an intervention ranged from thin to slightly not thin.\n\nGeorgia State University College of Law Professor Anthony Michael Kreis wagered the odds were 4-1 against appellate intervention. In a series of tweets on X (formerly Twitter), he provided the upshot of the current hindsight consensus among Peach State lawyers.\n\n\"Fani Willis messed up badly,\" Kreis said. \"There will be no Georgia trial before 2025. Period. Full stop.\"", "source": {"uri": "lawandcrime.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Law & Crime"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/District_attorney", "type": "wiki",

If the last several days have provided any indication, then Willis may be headed for a stumble.\n\n\"This is really messing up my business,\" said Willis.\n\nThe Georgia Senate Special Committee that was approved in January to investigate allegations of misconduct on Willis' part began drilling deeper Friday into the Democrat's use of taxpayer funds. The Washington Examiner indicated that there were various signs in the over four-hour hearing that lawmakers are determined to fully understand the Fulton County District Attorney Office's expenditures and prosecution of Trump.\n\nThis penetrating scrutiny appears to have struck a nerve with Willis, who told local news, \"Isn't it interesting when we got a bunch of African American DAs, now we need a daddy to tell us what to do?\"\n\n\"This is really messing up my business,\" continued Willis. \"They can look all they want.\"\n\nThe committee appears keen to shift from looking to listening.\n\nRepublican state Sen. Bill Cowswet told WSB-TV that the special committee will subpoena the Democratic DA should she fail to appear voluntarily and explain herself.\n\nOn Monday, Willis indicated that -- just as she didn't bother to show up to debate her political opponent last month -- she may similarly attempt to ghost the state Senate committee.\n\n\"First of all, I don't even think they have the authority to subpoena me,\" said Willis. \"But they need to learn the law.\"\n\nWillis added, \"I will not appear to anything that is unlawful, and I have not broken the law in any way. I've said it, you know, I'll say it amongst these leaders, I'm sorry folks get pissed off that everybody gets treated equally.\"\n\nOn Wednesday, the Court of Appeals for the State of Georgia put the possibility of Willis' disqualification from former President Donald Trump's election interference case back on the table.\n\nWillis, who has described herself as the \"face of the feminist movement,\" has been scrutinized for months over accusations of \"systematic misconduct\" and various other improprieties.\n\nBlaze News previously reported that Ashleigh Merchant, an attorney for Trump co-defendant Michael Roman, filed a Jan. 8 motion to disqualify, claiming Willis was ethically compromised by her \"improper, clandestine personal relationship\" with Nathan Wade.\n\nWillis hired Wade the day after he filed for divorce from his wife. Contrary to the DA's suggestion in court, their romantic relationship allegedly preceded the appointment by at least several months.\n\nIn the months that followed, Willis was targeted with additional disqualification motions accusing her of prejudicing potential jurors with racially charged commentary, conflict of interest, misusing public monies, coordinating with the Biden White House, giving Wade preferential treatment, and of possibly running afoul of the federal racketeering statute.\n\nThe effort to oust Willis from the case came to a head on March 15 when Superior Court Judge Scott McAfee, also running for re-election, ruled that the Democrat could continue overseeing the case so long as Wade resigned his post as special prosecutor.\n\nWade bowed out, but the defense was not satisfied -- particularly since the judge acknowledged Willis' \"unprofessional manner\" during the evidentiary hearing, her \"bad choices,\" her \"tremendous lapse in judgment,\" her \"legally improper\" remarks, and the prosecutions encumbrance \"by an appearance of impropriety.\"\n\nMcAfee permitted Trump and several of his co-defendants to appeal his ruling, which they did in late March.\n\nThe appeals court granted Trump's application for interlocutory appeal this week, meaning it will take up McAfee's ruling -- a move the Associated Press suggested will likely delay Trump's case beyond the November election. After all, whoever loses the case could ask the Georgia Supreme Court to decide Willis' fate.\n\nProfessor Ryan Goodman, former special counsel to the general counsel of the Pentagon, alternatively suggested that the revitalized disqualification battle \"might not delay matters,\" citing McAfee's suggestion in his order granting the petition that the \"Court intends to continue addressing the many other unrelated pending pretrial motions, regardless of whether the petition is granted.\"\n\nThe U.S. House Judiciary Committee appears to also be closing in on Willis. Committee Chairman Jim Jordan (R-Ohio) and Rep. Barry Loudermilk (R-Ga.) launched an inquiry into the alleged collusion between Willis and the Jan. 6 Committee in December 2023.\n\nOn Thursday, Jordan asked Nathan Wade to appear for an interview and to produce various documents pertaining to his former employment with the Fulton County District Attorney's Office.\n\n\"There are serious concerns about your role in the politically motivated prosecution initiated by Ms. Willis against President Donald J. Trump. You have reportedly 'profit[ed] significantly' from M. Willis's prosecution, with unsealed court filings alleging that you have been paid 'almost seven hundred thousand dollars ($700,000) [from the FCDAO] since May of 2022 alone,'\" Jordan noted in his letter to Wade.\n\n\"The committee understands that Ms. Willis reportedly compensated you and financed her politically motivated prosecution using a mixture of taxpayer funds, possibly including part of the $14.6 million in federal grant funds that her office received from the Department of Justice between 2020 and 2023,\" added Jordan.\n\nThe Atlanta Journal Constitution indicated that Wade's attorney could not be reached for comment but that he previously claimed he had done nothing wrong.", "source": {"uri": "theblaze.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "TheBlaze"}, "authors": [],

He does not have that option for the New York or Georgia cases, but legal experts say state prosecutors likely would not move forward while he is president.\n\nAn April Reuters/Ipsos poll found that 60 per cent of registered voters thought it was important that Trump\u2019s criminal trials take place before the election. A similar number of registered voters, including one in four Republicans, said they would not vote for Trump if a jury convicted of him of a felony.\n\nTrump and eight of his 14 co-defendants charged in the Georgia case have urged the appeal court to overturn a state judge\u2019s March ruling allowing Willis to continue supervising the prosecution.\n\nTrump has pleaded not guilty and accused prosecutors of a politically motivated effort to damage his campaign.\n\n\u201cThe case should be dismissed and Fulton County DA Willis should be disqualified for her misconduct in this unjustified, unwarranted political persecution,\u201d Steve Sadow, Trump\u2019s lead lawyer on the Georgia case, said in a statement.\n\nA spokesperson for Willis\u2019 office did not immediately respond to a request for comment on Wednesday.\n\nThe appeal must be resolved before the case can move to trial.\n\nThe exact timeline is uncertain, but it is likely to take at least a few months for lawyers to file legal briefs and schedule arguments. The case could be assigned to the court\u2019s April term, which would require a ruling by November 1, four days before the election.\n\nTrump and the eight co-defendants moved to disqualify Willis after revealing that she had had a romance with Nathan Wade, an outside lawyer she hired to help lead the investigation. Wade booked several holidays with Willis while he was being paid by her office, an arrangement the defence argued posed a conflict of interest.\n\nTrump\u2019s lawyer has also argued that Willis improperly suggested the defendants and their lawyers had racial motivations. Both Willis and Wade are black.\n\nWillis and Wade have acknowledged having a relationship, but said it began after Wade was hired to work on the case and ended before charges were filed. Willis\u2019 office has denied allegations of misconduct and said the relationship had no impact on the case.\n\nFulton County Judge Scott McAfee ruled the relationship did not pose a conflict of interest but said it created an appearance of wrongdoing. McAfee said Willis\u2019 office could remain on the case if Wade stepped aside, which he agreed to do.\n\nMcAfee later gave permission for Trump and his co-defendants to appeal his ruling before trial.\n\nTrump and the 14 co-defendants have pleaded not guilty to racketeering and other charges stemming from what prosecutors allege was a scheme to overturn Trump\u2019s narrow defeat in Georgia in the 2020 election. Four others who had been co-defendants in the case have pleaded guilty in deals with the prosecutors.\n\nA trial date has not yet been set.", "source": {"uri": "scmp.com", "dataType": "news", "title":

That criminal trial charges Trump and more than a dozen of his associates with trying to steal Georgia's 2020 election from the candidate that actually won the majority of votes, Joe Biden. Now, with Tuesday's decision from the appeals court, it's not clear when the case will actually go to trial.\n\nThis is a huge win for Trump, who had appealed a lower court ruling to allow Willis to continue overseeing the case. The appeal court's order says Trump can file a notice of appeal within the next 10 days.\n\nWillis was allowed to remain on the Georgia RICO case after she was accused of hiring special prosecutor Nathan Wade -- a man she had a relationship with and who billed her office (and taxpayers) more than $728,000 in legal fees -- for personal financial gain.

Jim Jordan, the Republican chairman of the House Judiciary Committee, asked Wade to appear for an interview and to produce numerous documents related to his work on the Georgia election interference case.\n\nJordan cited allegations that Wade and Willis profited from what he called the \"politically motivated prosecution\" against former President Donald Trump and 14 other defendants.\n\n\"The committee understands that Ms. Willis reportedly compensated you and financed her politically motivated prosecution using a mixture of taxpayer funds, possibly including part of the $14.6 million in federal grant funds that her office received from the Department of Justice between 2020 and 2023,\" Jordan wrote.\n\nWade's attorney could not immediately be reached for comment but he and Wills have testified previously that they did nothing wrong.\n\nWillis has said the DA's office complies with all federal grant requirements.\n\n\"Any examination of the records of our grant programs will find that they are highly effective and conducted in cooperation with the Department of Justice and in compliance with all Department of Justice requirements,\" the office said in February.\n\nThe request for an interview is the latest escalation of the House committee's investigation of Willis, which began shortly after Willis indicted Trump last summer. Jordan has repeatedly accused Willis of conducting a politically motivated prosecution, while the DA has accused the House committee of interfering in a criminal investigation.\n\nIn January House investigators began focusing on Wade after defendants in the election case revealed Willis and Wade had been romantically involved. They said Willis paid Wade's law firm more than $728,000 for his work and benefited financially when Wade used the money to pay for trips they took together. They sought to disqualify Willis from the case.\n\nWillis and Wade said their romance began after she hired him and ended last summer. They say testified they split the cost of their travel roughly equally and their relationship did not pose a conflict.\n\nEarlier this week, Wade told ABC News that while the timing of his relationship with Willis \"could have been better,\" it had nothing to do with the merits of the election case.\n\nIn March Superior Court Judge Scott McAfee ruled Willis could continue to prosecute the case if Wade resigned, which he did that same day. The defendants have appealed McAfee's decision, and this week the Georgia Court of Appeals accepted the appeal - a decision that likely puts the case on hold until next year.\n\nJordan isn't the only Republican scrutinizing Willis' actions. A Georgia Senate committee is conducting its own investigation of Willis' handling of the election case.\n\n-------\n\n\u00a92024 The Atlanta Journal-Constitution. Visit at ajc.com.

Things came to a head earlier this year when one of the co-defendants revealed in a court filing that Willis was in a romantic relationship with Nathan Wade, one of her special prosecutors.\n\nArguing that their relationship presented a conflict of interest, the defendants in the case were granted a hearing on their efforts to disqualify Willis, but the motion was denied by Judge Scott McAfee. Nonetheless, Trump and his allies moved to appeal McAfee's ruling, and on Wednesday, the Georgia Court of Appeals agreed to reconsider the disqualification decision -- a development that will likely present obstacles for the case to go to trial before November.\n\n\"The Georgia trial will not happen before the November election,\" Rahmani said. \"It was already a stretch when Willis was the last to file and charged 19 co-defendants. But when she botched the case by hiring her boyfriend and creating an unnecessary sideshow, it became a near impossibility.\"\n\n\"Between briefs, oral arguments, a decision, and potential appeal to the Georgia Supreme Court, there is no way the Fulton County case will be ready for trial before November,\" Rahmani said.\n\nLegal analyst and Georgia State University law professor Anthony Michael Kreis agreed that Willis \"messed up badly.\"\n\n\"There will be no trial in Georgia until 2025 at the earliest. The entire process has been derailed considerably for the time being,\" Kreis told Newsweek.\n\nThe relationship between Willis and Wade was publicized after an attorney for Trump co-defendant Michael Roman argued that the district attorney should be disqualified in a January 8 filing.\n\nLess than two weeks after the filing, Willis gave a speech defending Wade as a \"great friend\" and a \"legal superstar,\" while avoiding addressing the allegations that the two were in a romantic relationship. She also accused critics of targeting Wade, who is Black, and not the other two special prosecutors on the case, who are white.\n\nIt wasn't until February that the couple acknowledged their \"personal\" relationship, which they argue isn't grounds for disqualification.\n\nFormer federal prosecutor and elected state attorney Michael McAuliffe told Newsweek that the Georgia appeal will likely take months before a decision is reached.\n\n\"Trump's defense strategy of grinding the clock down with trial filings and appeals is working in that the Georgia case has slowed to a crawl, the federal documents case in South Florida is in a state of suspended animation, and the federal January 6th case in DC is waiting on the Supreme Court to rule as to the immunity issue,\" McAuliffe said.\n\nAnd if Trump is successful in getting WIllis removed, \"the case would be further delayed with a reassignment.\n\n\"The criminal justice system is being taxed by a well-funded, extremely

During a recent appearance on MSNBC, Atlanta Journal-Constitution political reporter Greg Bluestein laid out the next steps for both the prosecution and the defense, along with a projected timeline that extends into next year.\n\n\"What happens next is the case gets docketed in the state appeals court, and it gets assigned to a randomly picked three-judge panel. Then there are oral arguments,\" Bluestein told guest host Alex Witt. \"And then if it gets docketed before July, which it should, that means there is essentially a March 2025 deadline for the court to rule. That's why most attorneys involved in this case and watching this case very closely don't think that it will get to trial until at least 2025.\"\n\nREAD MORE: 'Scratch off the Georgia trial': Experts say second Trump case likely delayed past election\n\nMSNBC reporter Blayne Alexander said during the segment that the delay was \"certainly good news for Trump and his team,\" but that Fulton County Superior Judge Scott McAfee can still conduct proceedings in the case while the appeal is being considered. Witt sounded incredulous at Bluestein's suggested timeline and asked him to clarify.\n\n\"Hang on -- you're saying that this case is going to be presented, that each side gets 15 minutes according to Blayne Alexander's reporting, and that that will happen by July, and it will not get ruled upon until March?\" Witt asked.\n\n\"I don't know when the oral arguments will be scheduled, but if they docket it by July, that means they'll have a March 2025 deadline to rule,\" he responded. \"The appeals court could schedule the arguments later this year, they could schedule them early next year, but what we're looking at right now is the likelihood of a ruling not coming anytime before March 2025.\"\n\nWith the Georgia case being tied up in appeals, that means Trump may effectively be able to avoid having to stand trial altogether if he's elected president. His attorneys have argued that if Trump wins a second term, he would be too busy in his duties as president to have to sit in a Georgia courtroom for a criminal trial, and that the proceedings should be pushed off until 2029, when Trump would be into his eighties.\n\nREAD MORE: Trump's Georgia attorney argues he shouldn't be tried until 2029 if he wins election\n\nEarlier this year, Willis successfully fought off the defense's challenge to her standing as lead prosecutor in the case after attorney Ashleigh Merchant tried to get her disqualified from the case. The disqualification bid stemmed from Willis' hiring of special prosecutor Nathan Wade, whom she admitted having a brief romantic relationship with prior to him joining the case.\n\nDefense attorneys unsuccessfully argued that Willis and Wade's prior relationship constituted a conflict of interest that necessitated their removal from the case. Judge McAfee ruled that either Willis or Wade could stay on, but not both, prompting Wade to resign and for Willis to accept his resignation the day of McAfee's ruling.\n\nWatch the video of Bluestein's comments below, or by clicking this link.", "source": {"uri": "alternet.org", "dataType": "news", "title": "Alternet.org"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Georgia_(U.S._state)", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Georgia (U.S. state)"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Georgia (U.S. state)"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fulton_County,_Georgia", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Fulton County, Georgia"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Fulton County, Georgia"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MSNBC", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "MSNBC"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turning_Point_Action", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Turning Point Action"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fani_Willis", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Fani Willis"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dream_City_Church", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Dream City Church"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Students_for_Trump", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Students for Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Georgia_Court_of_Appeals", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Georgia Court of Appeals"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Atlanta_Journal-Constitution", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "The Atlanta Journal-Constitution"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Racketeer_Influenced_and_Corrupt_Organizations_Act", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indictment", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Indictment"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/District_attorney", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "District attorney"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electoral_fraud", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Electoral fraud"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phoenix,_Arizona", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Phoenix, Arizona"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Phoenix, Arizona"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special_counsel", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Special counsel"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Criminal_procedure", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Criminal procedure"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Professional_wrestling", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Professional wrestling"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conflict_of_interest", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Conflict of interest"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lawyer", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Lawyer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prosecutor", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Prosecutor"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Law/Legal_Information", "label": "dmoz/Society/Law/Legal Information", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Crime_and_Justice", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Crime and Justice", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Trials", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Trials", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Law", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Law", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://www.alternet.org/media-library/image.jpg?id=27407150&width=1200&height=600&coordinates=0%2C106%2C0%2C107", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9549791", "eventUri": "eng-9549791", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "date": "2020-06-", "textStart": 132, "textEnd": 141}], "sentiment": 0.02745098039215677, "wgt": 177, "relevance": 1}

It is not known at this time if the committee will subpoena Wade if he does not comply with their new request.\n\nTrump co-defendant Michael Roman filed the initial motion in January, accusing Willis and Wade of having an improper relationship and questioning whether the couple benefited from the investigation.\n\nTimeline: Fulton County DA Fani Willis, Nathan Wade controversy\n\nAfter months of drama and hearings, Fulton County Superior Court Judge Scott McAfee ruled in March that the relationship between Willis and Wade gave the \"appearance of impropriety,\" and that either Willis or Wade would need to step aside if the case were to continue to be prosecuted in Fulton County. A few hours later, Wade submitted his resignation.\n\nTrump and his co-defendants filed an appeal with the Georgia appeals court, asking it to review McAfee's decision.\n\nThe appeals court agreed on Wednesday to review the lower court's ruling. Once it rules, the losing side could ask the Georgia Supreme Court to consider an appeal.\n\nOTHER RECENT STORIES\n\nAt this point, some legal experts say there is little to no chance that the Georgia election interference case will go to trial before the November election, as Willis had hoped.", "source": {"uri": "fox5atlanta.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "FOX 5 Atlanta"}, "authors": [{"uri": "joyce_lupiani@fox5atlanta.com", "name": "Joyce Lupiani", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_House_Committee_on_the_Judiciary", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "United States House Committee on the Judiciary"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fulton_County,_Georgia", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Fulton County, Georgia"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Fulton County, Georgia"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/District_attorney", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "District attorney"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fani_Willis", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Fani Willis"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2020_United_States_presidential_election", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "2020 United States presidential election"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jim_Jordan_(American_politician)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Jim Jordan (American politician)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Department_of_Justice", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States Department of Justice"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/County_(United_States)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "County (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prosecutor", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Prosecutor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_House_Select_Committee_on_the_January_6_Attack", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United States House Select Committee on the January 6 Attack"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_House_Counsel", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "White House Counsel"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Biden", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jurisdiction", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Jurisdiction"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Georgia_(U.S._state)", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Georgia (U.S. state)"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Georgia (U.S. state)"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jordan", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Jordan"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Jordan"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supreme_Court_of_Georgia_(U.S._state)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Supreme Court of Georgia (U.S. state)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subpoena", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Subpoena"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fox_Broadcasting_Company", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Fox Broadcasting Company"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electoral_fraud", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Electoral fraud"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Law/Legal_Information", "label": "dmoz/Society/Law/Legal Information", "wgt": 9}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Law/Law_Enforcement", "label": "dmoz/Society/Law/Law Enforcement", "wgt": 9}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Law/Organizations", "label": "dmoz/Society/Law/Organizations", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Law", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Law", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Organizations/Committees", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Organizations/Committees", "wgt": 19}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 92}], "image": "https://images.foxtv.com/static.fox5atlanta.com/www.fox5atlanta.com/content/uploads/2024/02/1280/720/GettyImages-2005790762.jpg?ve=1&tl=1", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9549791", "eventUri": "eng-9549791", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "date": "-01-12", "textStart": 372, "textEnd": 379}, {"amb": false, "date": "-01-06", "textStart": 1344, "textEnd": 1353}, {"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-05-16", "textStart": 1507, "textEnd": 1513}], "sentiment": 0.2941176470588236, "wgt": 177, "relevance": 1}

Judge Scott McAfee, who is overseeing the case, ruled not to disqualify Willis after a contentious hearing, arguing defendants did not prove \"an actual conflict of interest\" due to Willis' relationship with prosecutor Nathan Wade, though McAfee ordered either Willis or Wade to step down over the \"appearance of impropriety.\" While Wade and Willis both admitted to engaging in a relationship, they denied defendants' claims their relationship began before Willis hired Wade to prosecute the case. Following McAfee's ruling, Wade resigned from the case, while Trump and his co-defendants appealed McAfee's decision.\n\nTrump and his 18 co-defendants in Georgia were indicted on 41 felony counts last August over their alleged attempt to overturn the results of the 2020 election. Trump was named in 13 of those felony charges, though three of them were dismissed earlier this year, including solicitation of the violation of oath, after McAfee argued prosecutors \"fail[ed] to allege sufficient detail regarding the nature of their commission.\" Trump still faces charges of violating Georgia's Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations (RICO) law, conspiracy to impersonate a public officer, conspiracy to commit forgery in the first degree, filing false documents and making false statements. He has pleaded not guilty.\n\nTrump's fourth criminal case, a federal election interference case in D.C., is pending a Supreme Court ruling on Trump's bid for presidential immunity.

Adam Schiff Has a Meltdown as Another Donald Trump Trial Faces a Delay", "body": "We're gonna pour one out for Rob Reiner whose only wish in life is to see Donald Trump in an orange jumpsuit before the election. There are a lot of people rushing around like rats trying to get Trump in prison somehow before November. Judge Juan Merchan, who is overseeing Donald Trump's \"hush money\" case in New York, has said Trump's next stop is jail if he violates his unconstitutional gag order for an 11th time.\n\nBut things keep getting in their way. The Supreme Court agreed to hear Trump's claim of presidential immunity in late April, with a decision likely in late June. \"Yet another signal that they do not care about the urgency,\" tweeted MSNBC's Chris Hayes.\n\nAs Twitchy reported yesterday, Judge Aileen Cannon postponed \"indefinitely\" Trump's classified documents case.\n\nAnd now the Fanni Willis clown show in Fulton County, Georgia, looks like it won't get underway until after the election.\n\nYep ... The same Fanni Willis who hired her boyfriend as special prosecutor, paid him in a million in cash, and went on cruises and other vacation trips with him.\n\nThe AP reports:\n\nA Georgia appeals court on Wednesday agreed to review a lower court ruling allowing Fulton County District Attorney Fani Willis to continue to prosecute the election interference case she brought against former President Donald Trump.\n\nThe move seems likely to delay the case and is the second time in as many days that the former president has gotten a favorable ruling that could push any future trials beyond the November election, when he is expected to be the Republican nominee for president. A day earlier, the judge in his Florida classified documents case indefinitely postponed that trial date.\n\nTrump and some other defendants in Georgia had tried to get Willis and her office removed the case, saying her romantic relationship with special prosecutor Nathan Wade created a conflict of interest. Superior Court Judge Scott McAfee in March found that no conflict of interest existed that should force Willis off the case, but he granted a request from Trump and the other defendants to seek an appeal of his ruling from the Georgia Court of Appeals.\n\nWhat's the rush? Are we trying to seek justice or put Joe Biden's rival behind bars before the vote?\n\nYes, we all know the courts are on Trump's side. That's why they're deliberately delaying justice by affording the former president his due process rights.\n\nThat's just it. Trump is being given due process.

The following day, a Georgia Court of Appeals announced it would consider an effort by the former president to remove Fulton County District Attorney Fani Willis from the state's sprawling election interference case over claims Willis had an improper relationship with a special prosecutor she hired to work on the case. Trump has pleaded not guilty in both cases.\n\nThe decisions mean that the \"hush money\" trial underway in New York could be the only one the former president is involved in before the 2024 election. Trump's federal trial related to the events that resulted in the January 6 attack on the Capitol is also facing significant delays amid a Supreme Court decision on an immunity-defense appeal.\n\nThe delay to the federal classified documents case is arguably the most beneficial to Trump. The former president has long faced accusations that he was seeking to use appeals and other tactics to postpone the trial until after November's election. If Trump wins the race, he could order the Department of Justice to dismiss the case once he takes office in January 2025.\n\nCannon, whom Trump nominated to the bench, has been highly criticized for her decision to delay the classified documents case.\n\n\"I'm not surprised, but I am disgusted,\" Norm Eisen, who served as a special counsel to the House Judiciary Committee during Trump's first impeachment, told Newsweek. \"Whether she's doing it out of partiality for the former president or is just a lousy jurist, this latest blunder by Judge Cannon takes the cake.\"\n\n\"This case should have been tried to a verdict already and would have been if any normal judge had gotten it,\" he added.\n\nNewsweek has contacted Trump's legal team for comment via email.\n\nSince the Georgia case is under state jurisdiction, rather than federal, even if he is reelected, Trump cannot order prosecutors to drop it or pardon himself if convicted of any of the charges.\n\nIf Trump wins the 2024 election and the Georgia case is not resolved, the state may find itself in the uncharted territory of trying to arrange a trial for a president-elect or sitting president.\n\nWednesday, the Georgia Court of Appeals said it would consider an appeal to have Willis disqualified from overseeing the election interference case over her relationship with special prosecutor Nathan Wade.\n\nThe former president argued that the pair's relationship amounted to a conflict and that Willis should be removed\n\nFulton County Judge Scott McAfee previously ruled that Willis could remain the lead prosecutor despite her relationship with Wade having an \"appearance of impropriety.\" McAfee said Willis could remain on the case if Wade removed himself, which he soon did.\n\nNo official date has been set for the Georgia trial, which also involves former New York Mayor Rudy Giuliani and Mark Meadows, Trump's former White House chief of staff. However, the appeal ruling is expected to delay the start of proceedings.\n\nIn New York, Trump is on trial after pleading not guilty to 34 counts of falsifying business records in relation to a $130,000 payment prosecutors say he arranged for his then-lawyer Michael Cohen to pay adult film star Stormy Daniels to keep an alleged affair she had with Trump a secret in the run-up to the 2016 election.\n\nThe payment was listed in Trump's company records as Cohen's \"legal fees,\" which prosecutors argue was a part of an illegal scheme to influence the election's results.", "source":

Now, with the question of Willis' removal tied up in appeals court, legal observers are predicting that any major action on the underlying Trump election case will be postponed until well into 2025. That means voters heading to the polls this fall almost certainly will not know if the expected GOP nominee for president will be found guilty or not by a jury for his efforts to overturn the results of the 2020 election.\n\nAs to why analysts are so confident nothing will happen before the new year? The busy Court of Appeals isn't known for moving particularly fast. Once three judges are assigned to the case they must schedule oral arguments and make a decision within two terms of court. If judges are assigned before July, that means a decision would need to be made by mid-March 2025. After that, whichever side loses is expected to appeal to the Supreme Court of Georgia. That's before jury selection for the underlying case could begin.\n\nPossible nightmare scenarios for Willis\n\nFor the first three months of the year, the DA faced a barrage of negative headlines and court filings that delved into the most intimate details of her personal life. It all culminated in a dramatic evidentiary hearing in February in which Willis and Nathan Wade, her ex-boyfriend who at the time was the lead prosecutor on the election case, both took the witness stand to defend their actions - all under the glare of the national media.\n\nEven with Wade off the case, many of those matters will be re-litigated before the appeals court. The panel won't be collecting new evidence, but it will determine whether Fulton Superior Court Judge Scott McAfee arrived at the correct legal conclusions when he gave Willis a path to stay on the case. It's possible the court overturns McAfee's ruling and issues what would be a nightmare decision for Willis and her office: mandating that she be removed from the biggest case of her career and that her staff, with expertise generated over more than three years of work, also be disqualified. Trump and his co-defendants alsowant the charges against them dropped, which if granted would be a catastrophic result for prosecutors.\n\nThe court's pace also means that the fight will continue to loom over Willis as she runs for reelection. She faces a primary challenger in Christian Wise Smith on May 21, and the winner of the Democratic contest will move on to face Republican Courtney Kramer in November. Willis is seen as the overwhelming favorite in both contests, but the revival of the disqualification fight certainly isn't what the DA wants to be talking about on the campaign trail. Her GOP critics will make hay of the appeals' court's consideration and continue to slam her for it in public.\n\nA revival of other pretrial fights?\n\nThe Court of Appeals' decision to take up the disqualification issue also could open the doorto revisit other pretrial issues Judge McAfee previously has decided, said Atlanta defense attorney and appellate lawyer Andrew Fleischman. In other words, now that the appeals court has agreed to hear the disqualification issue, defendants may be able to challengeother rulings they've lost in the election case since August, when McAfee was assigned. Among the items that could be considered: McAfee's recent refusal to drop some of the charges against Trump and others on First Amendment grounds.\n\nMcAfee can keep working - for now\n\nMcAfee previously said he intends to keep moving forward on some of the case's other outstanding procedural issues as the appeals court proceeds. Among them are pretrial motions challenging the soundness of multiple counts in the indictment, including the racketeering and false statements charges. Defendants have also challenged the indictment based on theU.S.Constitution's Supremacy Clause, double jeopardy and the idea that former federal officers should be immune from state-level prosecutions. They have asked for him to change the venue of the trial out of Fulton County and to split up the 15 remaining defendants. The judge recently asked the two sides to brief him about several counts in the indictment that have to do with materials presented to Georgia's federal court in late 2020. Some legal experts have argued that thosealleged criminal acts could fall under federal, not state jurisdictions.\n\nHowever, it's possiblethat Trump or his co-defendants could seek a stay from the appeals court, which would bar McAfee from moving forward until the appeal is resolved. That would further delay matters.\n\n-------\n\n(Staff writer Bill Rankin contributed to this article.)", "source": {"uri": "islandpacket.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Island Packet"},

I hate that my personal life has begun to overshadow the true issues in the case.\"\n\nThe prosecutors' past relationship still threatens to upend the criminal case against Trump and 14 co-defendants (all of whom have pleaded not guilty; four others have taken plea deals). Attorneys for the defendants have sought to boot Willis from the case, alleging that the relationship constituted a conflict of interest, or at least gave the appearance of one.\n\nIn acrimonious testimony in February, Willis said her relationship with Wade began in 2022, but that physical intimacy between them ended in 2023, before Trump and his co-defendants were criminally indicted. (The timeline of their relationship was contradicted by a former friend of Willis' who also testified.) Judge Scott McAfee ultimately ruled that Willis could stay on the case as long as Wade resigned, which he quickly did.\n\nWade told ABC News that he was not speaking publicly on behalf of Willis' office. \"As a matter of fact, I'm certain that they would rather me not be having this exchange with you,\" he said. \"With that, I want to continually protect the integrity of this prosecution. I don't want to say or do anything that would jeopardize this case.\"\n\nIt might be too late for that.

A trial date still has not been set, but the appeals court ruling, when it comes, could unravel the whole case.\n\nIn his interview, Wade conceded that the relationship \"did not happen in ideal timing,\" but he and Willis had not planned to develop feelings for each other. He also appeared to brush off the potential impact of the relationship on the case.\n\n\"Workplace romances are as American as apple pie,\" he said. \"It happens to everyone.\"", "source": {"uri": "yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ABC_News", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "ABC News"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special_counsel", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Special counsel"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Criminal_procedure", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Criminal procedure"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scott_McAfee", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Scott McAfee"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plea_bargain", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Plea bargain"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acquittal", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Acquittal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conflict_of_interest", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Conflict of interest"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indictment", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Indictment"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_pie", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Apple pie"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Georgia_(U.S._state)", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Georgia (U.S. state)"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Georgia (U.S. state)"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Crime_and_Justice", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Crime and Justice", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Advice", "label": "dmoz/Society/Advice", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Job-Related", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Job-Related", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Death/Suicide", "label": "dmoz/Society/Death/Suicide", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 59}], "image": "https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/D.4MmGRtFAIO2Apd45zdtg--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyMDA7aD04MDA7Y2Y9d2VicA--/https://media.zenfs.com/en/msnbc_articles_593/9f909447b480abf782ac5d3ae2288198", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9549791", "eventUri": "eng-9549791", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.1137254901960785, "wgt": 174, "relevance": 1}

The district attorney became a national figure after she initiated her case against former President Donald Trump, accusing him and more than a dozen others of participating in a scheme to illegally overturn the election results in the county.\n\n\"First of all, I don't think they even have the authority to subpoena me, but they need to learn the law,\" Ms. Willis said.\n\nWhen asked a separate question about whether she would testify, Ms. Willis suggested that she would not comply. She then criticized the Republican-led panel as being \"unlawful.\"\n\n\"I will not appear to anything that is unlawful, and I have not broken the law,\" she said. \"I've said it amongst these leaders, I'm sorry folks get [angry] that everybody gets treated equally.\"\n\nThe district attorney, a Democrat, also did not comment on a recent ABC News interview that featured former special prosecutor Nathan Wade, who resigned amid allegations that he was involved in a relationship with Ms. Willis. However, she was critical of the Senate's investigation into whether there was misconduct in her relationship with Mr. Wade, who was also involved in the Trump case before he stepped down in March under a judge's order.\n\nThe Senate committee chairman, Republican state Sen. Bill Cowsert, told a local Fox station in an interview that his committee has the power to make her testify, adding that she could be held in contempt if she doesn't cooperate.\n\nIn a news release issued by the Senate special committee, they are looking to \"thoroughly investigate\" allegations of misconduct against Ms. Willis that relate \"to potential conflicts of interest and misuse of public funds\" and if they should \"enact new or amend existing laws and/or change state appropriations to restore public confidence in the criminal justice system.\"\n\nIt comes as Georgia's appeals court on Wednesday agreed to take up an appeal filed by President Trump's lawyers, who are seeking to disqualify Ms. Willis over allegations surrounding her relationship with Mr. Wade. In March, Judge Scott McAfee ruled that Ms. Willis can stay on the Trump case if Mr. Wade leaves, although he wrote that an \"odor of mendacity\" remains.\n\nThe appeal seems likely to delay the case and is the second time in as many days that the former president has gotten a favorable ruling that could push any future trials beyond the November election when he is expected to be the Republican nominee for president. A day earlier, the judge in his Florida classified documents case indefinitely postponed that trial date.\n\nPresident Trump's lead attorney in Georgia, Steve Sadow, said that the former president looks forward to presenting arguments to the appeals court as to why the case should be dismissed and why Ms. Willis \"should be disqualified for her misconduct in this unjustified, unwarranted political persecution.\"\n\nThe allegations against Ms. Willis first surfaced in a motion filed in early January by Ashleigh Merchant, a lawyer for former Trump campaign staffer and onetime White House aide Michael Roman. The motion alleged that Ms. Willis and Mr. Wade were involved in an inappropriate romantic relationship and that she paid him large sums for his work and then benefitted when he paid for lavish vacations.\n\nThey confirmed the relationship but denied that they financially benefitted from the arrangement. Both also denied claims that they were in a relationship earlier than what at least one witness claimed during a televised February court hearing on her disqualification.\n\nThe two said that their relationship did not start until spring 2022, or several months after was after he was hired in the Trump case. Their romance, they claimed, ended in the summer of 2023.\n\nThe pair testified that they split travel costs roughly evenly, with Ms. Willis often paying expenses or reimbursing Mr. Wade in cash. However, neither provided any financial records or statement to back up that claim.\n\nThe Epoch Times contacted Ms. Willis's office for comment.", "source": {"uri": "theepochtimes.com", "dataType":

Trump's legal team has 10 days to file a notice to appeal.\n\nThe case, concerning Trump's effort to get Georgia officials to change the results of the state's 2020 election, has faced a tumultuous path since the DA's office launched an investigation more than three years ago.\n\nWillis has faced significant scrutiny for her relationship with prosecutor Nathan Wade, which Trump lawyers argued created a conflict of interest. Earlier this year, experts also warned that her continued comments on the case, even after a judge ruled she shouldn't be tossed, posed a threat to the continued prosecution of the case. For example, Willis' remarks on cable news -- that \"the train is coming\" - -- could be construed as violating the requirement that public comments on a case be limited to those that serve a \"legitimate law enforcement purpose,\" per Georgia attorney Andrew Fleischman,\n\nThe Georgia appeals court made it clear that questions on Willis's potential misconduct remain unanswered.\n\nUniversity of Georgia Constitutional Law professor Anthony Michael Kreis put it bluntly in a post to X: \"Fani Willis messed up badly.\"\n\nAccording to Kreis, delays have pushed the case on Donald Trump's 2020 efforts to interfere in the Georgia presidential race to beyond the upcoming election, allowing him to stand for re-election despite criminal allegations in his conduct in the last race.\n\n\"There will be no Georgia trial before 2025. Period. Full stop,\" Kreis added.\n\n\"It is entirely possible that the Manhattan case is the only one that makes it to verdict before the election,\" Attorney Bradley P. Moss wrote on X, referencing ongoing proceedings on the 2015 incident, where Trump allegedly tried to interfere in that election by making hush money payments to bury a damaging story.\n\nAs legal analyst Anna Bower noted, the legal challenge opens questions broader than Willis's disqualification, which Fulton County Judge Scott McAfee ruled against in March.\n\n\"One major consequence of this decision: The defendants can now use their disqualification appeal as a hook to add a bunch of other issues to the appeal (i.e., Judge McAfee's denial of the defendants' challenge to the RICO charge),\" Bower wrote on X.\n\nJudge McAfee, who ruled Willis did not have a clear conflict of interest, said that the \"appearance of impropriety\" could be remedied by removing Wade from the case. Some legal experts said this remedy didn't go far enough, including Federalist Society attorney Will Chamberlain.\n\n\"Judge McAfee's ruling was logically incoherent,\" Chamberlain said on X. \"I strongly suspect that the Georgia Court of Appeals will reverse Judge McAfee and throw Willis and her office off the case.\"\n\nTrump's broad strategy of delaying efforts to hold him accountable until after the 2024 election has paid off in numerous jurisdictions, with the Supreme Court currently holding up a federal inquiry into Trump's actions on January 6 via arguments on presidential immunity.\n\nThe Georgia case is the second Trump trial to face similar delays this week, with federal Judge Aileen Cannon indefinitely postponing a Florida case involving Trump's mishandling of classified documents.\n\nBut some don't think all hope is lost, such as attorney Jefferey Evan Gold, who argues that the appeal won't necessarily stop proceedings from taking place.\n\n\"Judge McAfee said he was moving on with case 'regardless of whether the petition is granted ... and even if any subsequent appeal is expedited by the appellate court,'\" Gold wrote on X, adding that the appeals court would actually need to stay the case to stop McAfee from moving forward.", "source": {"uri": "salon.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Salon.com"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

It takes the agreement of only one of those judges to decide whether the court accepts the appeal. The court's one-page order did not indicate which judge or judges voted to grant the application.\n\nThe trial judge, Fulton County Superior Court Judge Scott McAfee, said he would continue addressing other pending pretrial motions while the appeals court takes up the challenge.\n\nOn March 29, McAfee issued a \"certificate of immediate review,\" allowing Trump and seven other defendants to appeal his ruling permitting Willis to continue prosecuting the case.\n\nThe judge ruled that the defendants failed to meet their burden to prove that Willis' relationship with the special prosecutor on the case, Nathan Wade, was enough of a conflict of interest to merit her disqualification from the case. He did, however, find an \"appearance of impropriety\" that led to Wade's withdrawal from the case.\n\nAlso on Wednesday, the Court of Appeals rejected a separate appeal from Harrison Floyd, one of Trump's 14 co-defendants accused of joining a conspiracy to overturn his 2020 presidential defeat to Biden in Georgia and other swing states.\n\nFloyd, the onetime head of Black Voices for Trump, argued that Willis' office did not have jurisdiction to indict him because the investigation had not been referred by the state election board. McAfee rejected Floyd's argument in January and again in March.\n\nWhile Trump is currently on trial in New York on charges related to hush-money payments, it remains unclear when the Fulton County case, as well as the two federal criminal cases against him, will go to trial.\n\nOn Tuesday, U.S. District Court Judge Aileen Cannon canceled the May 20 trial date that had been set for Trump's mishandling of classified documents case in Florida due to unresolved motions. The move indefinitely postponed the federal case brought by Justice Department special counsel Jack Smith, shoring up the chances that trial won't begin before Election Day.\n\nSmith's other case against Trump, which mirrors the Georgia case and focuses on the Republican's attempts to cling to power following the 2020 election, is also on pause as the U.S. Supreme Court decides whether his actions were shielded by presidential immunity.\n\nThe justices aren't expected to announce their decision on the matter until late June, but based on their comments during last month's oral arguments, a ruling sending it back for litigation by the lower courts seemed likely, further delaying the trial that was scheduled to begin in March.", "source": {"uri": "courthousenews.com",

Campaign finance data from Georgia shows that Willis' campaign received $105,104 in the last six months of 2023. The district attorney also raised more than $176,000 between January and June of 2023.\n\nWillis' national profile has risen steadily in recent years. Her office is leading a sweeping racketeering case against former President Donald Trump and 18 of his allies. In August, the district attorney indicted Trump with 13 felony counts related to his alleged efforts to overturn the results of Georgia's 2020 election. Three of those counts have since been dismissed by Judge Scott McAfee, so Trump now faces 10 charges.\n\nThere have been several efforts to disqualify Willis from the case.\n\nEarlier this year, one of Trump's co-defendants filed a motion seeking Willis' removal based on her relationship with attorney Nathan Wade, whom she had appointed to the prosecution. In March, McAfee said Willis could remain on the case if Wade resigned -- which he did hours after the judge's decision. On May 8, the Georgia Court of Appeals agreed to reconsider McAfee's disqualification ruling.\n\nGeorgia Republicans in the state Senate have also launched a probe into Willis to determine whether she and Wade used taxpayer dollars during their relationship. Willis said Monday that she would not testify before the panel.\n\nWillis', who is up for reelection amid the high-profile case, is set to face Democrat Christian Wise Smith in Georgia's May 21 primary. If successful, she would then face Republican Courtney Kramer in the general election. Both Wise Smith and Kramer filed their candidacy paperwork in March.\n\nSince announcing their bids for Fulton County district attorney, Wise Smith has raised more than $77,7000 in campaign contributions, while Kramer has raised about $26,000 in donations.\n\nDespite the public backlash Willis has received, polling shows her leading over Wise Smith. An April survey conducted by Fred Hicks, a Georgia-based political consultant, found that 79 percent of likely Democratic voters would back Willis in the primary, while 9 percent indicated they would vote for Wise Smith.\n\nGeorgia's judicial races are nonpartisan, but Democrats outnumber Republicans three to one in Fulton County. President Joe Biden won the county in 2020 with more than 75 percent of the vote, and Hillary Clinton carried it in 2016 with more than 67 percent of the vote. Fulton County, which contains most of Atlanta, has not elected a Republican presidential candidate since Richard Nixon in 1972.\n\nWillis is the first woman to serve as Fulton County's district attorney, an office she has held since January 2021.", "source": {"uri": "newsweek.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Newsweek"}, "authors": [{"uri": "katherine_fung@newsweek.com", "name": "Katherine Fung", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fani_Willis", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Fani Willis"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/District_attorney", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "District attorney"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Georgia_(U.S._state)", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Georgia (U.S. state)"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Georgia (U.S. state)"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Racketeering", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Racketeering"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump_2020_presidential_campaign", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump 2020 presidential campaign"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Campaign_finance", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Campaign finance"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Felony", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Felony"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fulton_County,_Georgia", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Fulton County, Georgia"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Fulton County, Georgia"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2020_United_States_presidential_election", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "2020 United States presidential election"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Georgia_Court_of_Appeals", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Georgia Court of Appeals"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/California_State_Senate", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "California State Senate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lawyer", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Lawyer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Democratic Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republican_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Republican Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hillary_Clinton", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Hillary Clinton"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_election", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "General election"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_Nixon", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Richard Nixon"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nonpartisanism", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Nonpartisanism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Biden", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/County_(United_States)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "County (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atlanta", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Atlanta, Georgia"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Atlanta, Georgia"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Law/Law_Enforcement", "label": "dmoz/Society/Law/Law Enforcement", "wgt": 9}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics", "wgt": 8}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Campaigns_and_Elections", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Campaigns and Elections", "wgt": 17}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Activism/Strategies", "label": "dmoz/Society/Activism/Strategies", "wgt": 8}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Gay,_Lesbian,_and_Bisexual/Politics", "label": "dmoz/Society/Gay, Lesbian, and Bisexual/Politics", "wgt": 9}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 97}], "image": "https://d.newsweek.com/en/full/2389899/fani-willis-donations-double.webp", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9549791", "eventUri": "eng-9549791", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-05-08", "textStart": 1255, "textEnd": 1260}, {"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-05-21", "textStart": 1694, "textEnd": 1700}], "sentiment": -0.08235294117647063, "wgt": 172, "relevance": 1}

Could Jack Smith, though, step into the breach?\n\nThe decision by the Georgia Court of Appeals to grant President Trump's request that it consider whether to disqualify the Fulton County district attorney, Fani Willis, from her sprawling racketeering case over her romance with her married prosecutor is a significant setback for the polarizing attorney.\n\nBy electing to hear arguments as to whether Ms. Willis should be disqualified, the appellate tribunal signals that her romantic relationship with the special prosecutor she hired, Nathan Wade, could be grounds for removal. Mr. Trump also contends that her extramural statements -- say, accusing her critics of \"playing the race card\" -- amount to \"forensic misconduct\" and a second case for disqualification.\n\nMr. Trump will now have 10 days to file a formal \"notice of appeal\" asking the state riders to overrule Judge Scott McAfee's finding that he and his co-defendants \"failed to meet their burden\" to show that Ms. Willis, who is running for reelection, should be removed from the case. Judge McAfee, though, did find a \"significant appearance of impropriety\" in the amorous affair between the prosecutors.\n\nThe trial judge -- who himself is running for reelection -- also detected an \"odor of mendacity\" with respect to how Ms. Willis and Mr. Wade described their romance to the court. They allege that they only started dating after Ms. Willis hired Mr. Wade, who this week told \"Good Morning America\" that workplace romances are \"American as apple pie.\" The district attorney's office paid Mr. Wade more than $650,000 despite him never having prosecuted a felony case.\n\nJudge McAfee did not find what he called an \"actual conflict of interest\" in the arrangement between Mr. Wade and Ms. Willis, but the Court of Appeals could direct more scrutiny at, say, the trips the two took together to locales like Napa Valley, Aruba, and Belize while Mr. Wade was being paid by Ms. Willis' office. The district attorney maintains she reimbursed her lover with cash she kept at home. Her father in court called that a \"Black thing.\"\n\nMr. Trump and his co-defendants argue that Ms. Willis' behavior has \"cast a pall over these entire proceedings\" and that Judge McAfee's decision to keep her on the trial is a \"structural error that would not just cause substantial error at trial\" but could be grounds for appeal if a verdict of \"guilty\" is brought in. Ms. Willis has struck a defiant note, insisting that \"the train is coming\" to convict Mr. Trump and the other 18 people she has charged.\n\nThe Sun corresponded with an attorney for one of Mr. Trump's co-defendants, the lawyer John Eastman. He writes \"Consider this: Would we tolerate it if, in any important, unprecedented and difficult prosecution, the district attorney hired his or her spouse, or child, to handle the case? Would we have confidence in the sagacity of the judgments being made?\"\n\nThe decision by the Court of Appeals, though, means that the train will be further delayed as Ms. Willis will once again be forced to defend her behavior. Judge McAfee decided that Mr. Wade's resignation cured the conflict, but that remedy could now be judged insufficient. Just yesterday, in another one of Mr. Trump's criminal cases, Judge Aileen Cannon indefinitely delayed the 45th president's Mar-a-Lago trial.\n\nIf Ms. Willis is disqualified, a law passed in 2022 mandates that the executive director of the Prosecuting Attorneys' Council of Georgia pick a replacement. That could take months, and push a trial far beyond November's presidential election. The executive director, Pete Skandalakis, tells NBC News that a district attorney \"cannot refuse an appointment.\"\n\nIn the event that the Georgia case is crippled by Ms. Willis' disqualification, Special Counsel Jack Smith could consider whether to bring federal charges against some of her defendants who appear in his indictment as unindicted co-conspirators. These include the attorney Mr. Eastman, Mayor Giuliani and the lawyer Jeffrey Clark. Two more, the attorneys Sidney Powell and Kenneth Chesebro, have already pleaded guilty at Fulton County. Mr. Eastman and Mr. Giuliani were also recently indicted in Arizona.\n\nIn a statement sent to the Sun, Mr. Trump's attorney, Steven Sadow, shared that his client \"looks forward to presenting interlocutory arguments to the Georgia Court of Appeals as to why the case should be dismissed and Fulton County DA Willis should be disqualified for her misconduct.\"", "source": {"uri": "nysun.com",

Former President Donald Trump (R) and his lawyer Susan Necheles in Manhattan Criminal Court for his secret trial on May 7. Trump won legal victories this week that effectively delayed two other criminal trials against him. More from Win McNamee/Getty Images\n\nIt is also a major victory for the former president, whose preferred legal strategy has been to delay proceedings in the cases against him.\n\nTrump faces 34 criminal charges for falsifying business records in Manhattan, 40 criminal charges related to his mishandling of confidential documents in Florida and 10 criminal charges for allegedly interfering with the 2020 Georgia election in Fulton County. Trump has pleaded not guilty to all charges.\n\n\"Trump secured a victory in Florida yesterday when Judge Cannon indefinitely postponed the classified documents trial, and today's delay in Georgia is another victory for the former president,\" the former federal prosecutor said Neama Rahmani at Newsweek.\n\nEfforts to disqualify Willis unfolded during a dramatic hearing in February. McAfee ultimately ruled on March 15 that the prosecutor could remain in office.\n\n\"Georgia law does not permit a finding of the existence of a true conflict simply by making poor choices, even repeatedly,\" he wrote in his ruling.\n\nHowever, days later, the judge granted Trump's request to appeal his decision to the Georgia Court of Appeals.\n\nOther GOP-led efforts to remove Willis from the case are also underway.\n\nRepublicans in the Georgia state Senate are investigating whether the prosecutor and Wade used taxpayer money during their relationship. On Monday, Willis said she would not testify before the panel, arguing that \"I don't even think they had the authority to subpoena me, but they need to learn the law.\"\n\nUpdated 5/8/24, 10:31 a.m.

And possibly ever.\n\nThat was already true heading into this week. But we received the latest indication of that possibility on Wednesday, when Georgia's appeals court signaled that it will consider Trump and his co-defendants' request to disqualify Fulton County District Attorney Fani Willis.\n\nAs a reminder, Judge Scott McAfee said in March that Willis could stay on the case if special prosecutor Nathan Wade, with whom she had a romantic relationship, stepped down. Wade did so -- but that didn't end the matter. Trump and his co-defendants are still seeking Willis' disqualification and the wholesale dismissal of the state election interference case itself.\n\nMcAfee previously said that the case can move forward despite the defense appeal. And he has been ruling on pretrial issues in the meantime. But regardless of whether the case gets formally paused (as Trump's federal election interference case did), this Georgia appeal puts the state prosecution further in doubt. The appeals court could, for example, say that McAfee didn't go far enough in the defendants' favor and kick Willis and her office off of the case. Such a decision would require reassigning the case to another office, which would unlikely be simple or speedy, to say nothing of what another prosecutor would do with the case.\n\nThe Georgia news follows U.S. District Judge Aileen Cannon's recent move in the classified documents case to postpone a trial indefinitely in Florida. Meanwhile, the Supreme Court's pending decision on Trump's immunity claim has been holding up a trial in the federal election interference case. If Trump wins the November presidential election, he'll almost certainly rid himself of these two federal cases.\n\nPresidents can't dismiss or pardon state charges, but if Trump wins a second term, that would complicate any state cases moving forward while he's in office.

That special prosecutor, Nathan Wade, resigned.\n\nTrump and other defendants who first raised allegations of a conflict of interest appealed McAfee's decision.\n\nThe appeals court must now hear and rule on the question within two terms, or about six months. According to the court, cases docketed in the current term must be decided by Nov. 1 and motions to reconsider must be adjudicated by Nov. 18.\n\nMcAfee is unlikely to set a trial date before that time, meaning the case almost certainly remains unresolved before the November election, though pretrial hearings are expected to continue.\n\n\"I think it effectively ends the ability of this case to get to trial before Election Day,\" says Atlanta attorney Jen Jordan, a former Democratic candidate for Georgia attorney general.\n\nJordan says she does not believe the appeals court is signaling they think McAfee's decision was wrong, but acknowledging the stakes of making sure it's right sooner rather than later.\n\n\"This is one of the most significant cases in the history of this country and definitely in this state,\" Jordan says. \"Let's say Judge McAfee's decision not to disqualify the district attorney is wrong and you get all the way to the verdict [in the trial], and it goes up to the Court of Appeals to be reviewed and they say, 'Wait a second, there was a mistake in this very first step and you have to redo everything.' That is not in the interest of justice, due process and making sure people believe the system is working fairly.\"\n\nSteve Sadow, Trump's lead counsel in Georgia, wrote in a statement, \"President Trump looks forward to presenting interlocutory arguments to the Georgia Court of Appeals as to why the case should be dismissed and Fulton County DA Willis should be disqualified for her misconduct in this unjustified, unwarranted political persecution.\"\n\nA spokesperson for the district attorney's office declined to comment.\n\nProsecutors can ask for the court to hear the appeal on an expedited basis, but the likelihood of that request being granted depends on which three judges comprise the panel assigned to the case.\n\n\"With a case of this importance, you could see that happen,\" Jordan says. \"But more likely than not, there is no way this thing gets tried before the election. Of course, I would like for it to happen more quickly, but at the end of the day, I understand this is how the process works. It's not like how it is on TV. It takes time and consideration.\"\n\nTrump's also facing federal charges for attempting to overturn his 2020 election loss and for mishandling classified documents. Both of those cases have also been delayed.\n\nOn Tuesday, the Florida federal judge overseeing the classified documents case -- whom Trump appointed -- delayed the case indefinitely.\n\nAnd the federal election interference case remains on hold as the U.S. Supreme Court weighs Trump's claims of presidential immunity. Justices held oral arguments late last month.\n\nThe delays mean that the ongoing New York hush money trial is increasingly likely to be the only trial Trump faces before voters cast ballots on his White House bid this fall.", "source": {"uri": "kpbs.org", "dataType": "news", "title": "KPBS"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/District_attorney", "type": "wiki",

The news comes less than one day after U.S. District Judge Aileen Cannon, a Trump appointee, announced she was postponing the Espionage Act/classified documents trial indefinitely.\n\nProfessor of law, MSNBC/NBC News legal analyst Joyce Vance posted the Georgia court's order and her initial response.\n\n\"You can scratch off the Georgia trial too now. That's not happening before the election either,\" declared national security attorney Brad Moss.\n\n\"It is entirely possible that the Manhattan case is the only one that makes it to verdict before the election,\" Moss added, pointing to the current falsification of business records, hush money, and election interference case prosecuted by Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg.\n\n\"Georgia and the MAL docs cases are almost certainly delayed at this point,\" he continued, referring to the Mar-a-Lago Espionage Act/classified documents case. \"The DC election fraud case hinges on how and when SCOTUS rules. It is possible but by no means certain that the Fall campaign could see that trial take place. Or it could remain bogged down in legal fights too.\"\n\nGeorgia State University College of Law constitutional law professor Anthony Michael Kreis put it bluntly: \"There will be no Georgia trial before 2025. Period. Full stop.\"\n\nBut he also offered more insight.\n\n\"It'll be a summer of Willis and Wade,\" wrote Kreis, referring to Willis' special prosecutor Nathan Wade, who had a romantic relationship with Willis and resigned after a judge ruled Willis could remain on the case if she corrected certain issues. \"Whether the appeals court is more interested in the relationship and the underlying conflict claim or the issue of forensic misconduct over the church speech Willis made in response to the disqualification motion -- or both -- remains to be seen.\"\n\nBut Kreis also attempted to tamp down negative reaction to the Georgia Appeals Court's decision.\n\n\"For everyone complaining about the Fulton County case appeal, let me just say that our Georgia Court of Appeals has incredibly smart, hard-working, and serious judges. They are good and decent folks by and large. So cool it on your hot takes and conspiracy theories there.\"\n\nMeanwhile, former federal prosecutor of 30 years, Glenn Kirschner offers some small hope to those wanting to see the trial move forward.\n\n\"Judge McAfee said the case will keep moving forward EVEN IF the appeals court grants review,\" Kirschner wrote.\n\nJudge McAfee vowed to \"continue addressing the many other unrelated pending pretrial motions, regardless of whether the petition is granted within 45 days of filing, and even if any subsequent appeal is expedited by the appellate court.\"", "source": {"uri":

That special prosecutor, Nathan Wade, resigned.\n\nTrump and other defendants who first raised allegations of a conflict of interest appealed McAfee's decision.\n\nThe appeals court must now hear and rule on the question within two terms, or about six months. According to the court, cases docketed in the current term must be decided by Nov. 1 and motions to reconsider must be adjudicated by Nov. 18.\n\nMcAfee is unlikely to set a trial date before that time, meaning the case almost certainly remains unresolved before the November election, though pretrial hearings are expected to continue.\n\n\"I think it effectively ends the ability of this case to get to trial this year,\" says Atlanta attorney Jen Jordan, a former Democratic candidate for Georgia attorney general.\n\nJordan says she does not believe the appeals court is signaling they think McAfee's decision was wrong, but acknowledging the stakes of making sure it's right sooner rather than later.\n\n\"This is one of the most significant cases in the history of this country and definitely in this state,\" Jordan says. \"Let's say Judge McAfee's decision not to disqualify the district attorney is wrong and you get all the way to the verdict [in the trial], and it goes up to the Court of Appeals to be reviewed and they say, 'Wait a second, there was a mistake in this very first step and you have to redo everything.' That is not in the interest of justice, due process and making sure people believe the system is working fairly.\"\n\nSteve Sadow, Trump's lead counsel in Georgia, wrote in a statement, \"President Trump looks forward to presenting interlocutory arguments to the Georgia Court of Appeals as to why the case should be dismissed and Fulton County DA Willis should be disqualified for her misconduct in this unjustified, unwarranted political persecution.\"\n\nA spokesperson for the district attorney's office declined to comment.\n\nProsecutors can ask for the court to hear the appeal on an expedited basis, but the likelihood of that request being granted depends on which three judges comprise the panel assigned to the case.\n\n\"With a case of this importance, you could see that happen,\" Jordan says. \"But more likely than not, there is no way this thing gets tried before the election. Of course, I would like for it to happen more quickly, but at the end of the day, I understand this is how the process works. It's not like how it is on TV. It takes time and consideration.\"\n\nTrump's also facing federal charges for attempting to overturn his 2020 election loss and for mishandling classified documents. Both of those cases have also been delayed.\n\nOn Tuesday, the Florida federal judge overseeing the classified documents case -- whom Trump appointed -- delayed the case indefinitely.\n\nAnd the federal election interference case remains on hold as the U.S. Supreme Court weighs Trump's claims of presidential immunity.

However, Trump's legal team appealed this ruling and on Wednesday the Georgia Court of Appeal agreed to hear the case, sparking widespread speculation the trial itself would be delayed.\n\nTrump, the presumptive 2024 Republican presidential candidate, has been charged with crimes in four separate cases, complicating his bid for a second White House term. The GOP firebrand is accused of falsifying business records to conceal the payment of hush money to a pornographic actress, mishandling classified documents and attempting to overturn the 2020 presidential election both nationwide and in the state of Georgia specifically. He has pleaded not guilty to all charges and claims the cases against him are politically motivated.\n\nHowever, of these cases a trial is only underway for the first, with Florida Judge Aileen Cannon indefinitely postponing the classified documents trial earlier on Tuesday due to legal disputes around classified evidence.\n\nPosting on X, formerly Twitter, Professor Ryan Goodman, formerly special counsel to the general counsel of the Department of Defense, said the Georgia Court of Appeal's decision might not delay the trial itself as it could run alongside a number of pretrial motions.\n\nHe wrote: \"Unless Trump requests and gets a stay, the Georgia appeals court considering his effort to disqualify DA Fani Willis might not delay matters.\"\n\nGoodman then quoted a filing from Judge McAfee in March in which he granted Trump's team the right to appeal his ruling on Willis and said the court would continue examining pretrial motions regardless of whether this was approved.\n\nMcAfee said: \"The Court intends to continue addressing the many other unrelated pending pretrial motions, regardless of whether the petition is granted within 45 days of filing, and even if any subsequent appeal is expedited by the appellate court.\"\n\nNewsweek has contacted Donald Trump's attorney and representatives of his 2024 presidential election campaign for comment by email.\n\nThe news that the Georgia Court of Appeals would hear Trump's case against Willis, and that Judge Cannon had postponed his election interference case, sparked jubilation among supporters of his MAGA [Make America Great Again] movement earlier this week.\n\nGreg Price, communications director for the conservative leaning State Freedom Caucus Network, commented: \"The Florida sham Trump trial is postponed indefinitely, the DC sham trial hangs on the SCOTUS immunity ruling, the Georgia sham trial is heading to appeal for Fani Willis' disqualification, and even liberals are admitting the New York sham trial is a clown show.\"\n\nLast month, the Supreme Court heard arguments over whether Trump has immunity from prosecution over his federal election interference trial, meaning the case is unlikely to be resolved anytime soon.\n\nOn Tuesday, Stormy Daniels, who prosecutors claim was paid $130,000 in hush money ahead of the 2016 presidential election, provided details of a sexual encounter she claimed to have had with Trump in 2006. The former president strongly denies having a sexual relationship with Daniels or falsifying business records to cover up a hush money payment.", "source": {"uri": "newsweek.com", "dataType": "news",

She was allowed to stay on the case if a special prosecutor she hired resigned.\n\nAlex Slitz/Pool/AFP via Getty Images\n\nATLANTA The Georgia Court of Appeals granted oral arguments after former President Donald Trump appealed a decision allowing Fulton County Prosecutor Fani Willis to stay on the criminal case involving Trump and others.\n\nThe court's decision likely further diminishes the chances that the Georgia election interference case will go to trial this year.\n\nIn March, Fulton Judge Scott McAfee allowed Willis to stay on the case if the special prosecutor she was romantically involved with resigned. This special prosecutor, Nathan Wade, resigned.\n\nTrump and other defendants who were the first to raise conflict of interest allegations appealed McAfee's decision.\n\nThe appeals court must now hear and rule on the issue within two terms, or about six months. According to the court, cases on the docket during the current legislature must be decided by November 1, and motions for reconsideration must be decided by November 18.\n\nMcAfee is unlikely to set a trial date before then, meaning the case will almost certainly remain unresolved before the November election, although preliminary hearings are expected to continue.\n\n\"I think this effectively ends the possibility of this case going to trial before Election Day,\" said Atlanta attorney Jen Jordan, a former Democratic candidate for Georgia attorney general.\n\nJordan said she doesn't believe the appeals court is indicating that she thinks McAfee's decision was wrong, but recognizes the challenge of making sure it's right as soon as possible.\n\n\"This is one of the most significant cases in the history of this country and certainly this state,\" Jordan said. \"Let's say Judge McAfee's decision not to disqualify the prosecutor is wrong and you get to the verdict. [in the trial], and it goes to the Court of Appeal to be reviewed and they say, 'Wait a second, there was a mistake in this very first step and you have to redo it all.' This is not in the interest of justice, nor in the interest of due process, nor in the interest of ensuring that people believe the system is working fairly. \"\n\nSteve Sadow, Trump's lead lawyer in Georgia, wrote in a statement: \"President Trump looks forward to making interlocutory arguments to the Georgia Court of Appeals to explain why the case should be dismissed and why the prosecutor of Fulton County Willis should be disqualified for his misconduct in this matter. unjustified and unjustified political persecution.\n\nA spokesperson for the prosecutor's office declined to comment.\n\nProsecutors can ask the court to hear the appeal on an expedited basis, but the likelihood of that request being granted depends on the three judges who make up the panel overseeing the case.\n\n\"With a case of this importance, it could happen,\" Jordan says. \"But more than likely, it's not possible that this case will come to trial before the election. Of course, I would like to see it happen more quickly, but at the end of the day, I understand that it's This is how the process works. It takes time and thought.\n\nTrump also faces federal charges for trying to overturn his 2020 election defeat and for mishandling classified documents. These two cases were also delayed.\n\nOn Tuesday, the federal judge in Florida overseeing the classified documents case, appointed by Trump, delayed the case indefinitely.\n\nAnd the federal election interference case remains unresolved as the U.S. Supreme Court weighs Trump's presidential immunity claims. The justices held oral arguments late last month.\n\nThese delays mean the ongoing secret trial in New York will increasingly likely be the only trial Trump faces before voters vote on his White House bid this fall.\n\nWhat Are The Main Benefits Of Comparing Car Insurance Quotes Online", "source": {"uri": "exbulletin.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "ExBulletin"}, "authors": [], "concepts":

The Appellant may file a Notice of Appeal within 10 days of the date of this order.\"\n\n\"President Trump looks forward to presenting interlocutory arguments to the Georgia Court of Appeals as to why the case should be dismissed and Fulton County DA Willis should be disqualified for her misconduct in this unjustified, unwarranted political persecution,\" Trump's lead defense counsel Steve Sadow said in a press statement shared with Townhall.\n\nJudge Scott McAfee, who ruled on March 15 that Willis can stay on the Trump case, so long as her lover and special prosecutor Nathan Wade steps aside, previously decided that all lower-court proceedings would not be put on pause while Trump's team litigates the appeal. That means McAfee intends to address pre-trial matters, such as outstanding motions, in the meantime.\n\nHowever, the appellants could seek a stay from the appellate court, Lawfare's Anna Bower explains.\n\nSo, McAfee may be directed to pause proceedings pending the appeals court's ruling.\n\nAnother consequence of Wednesday's decision, Bower says, the Trump co-defendants can use the disqualification appeal \"as a hook\" to add a slew of other issues to the appeal, like McAfee's denial of the defense's challenge to the state RICO charge.\n\n\"There will be no Georgia trial before 2025. Period. Full stop,\" Georgia State University constitutional law professor Anthony Michael Kreis remarked on X's platform, formerly Twitter. \"Fani Willis messed up badly,\" the Atlanta-based professor assessed.\n\nAccording to Townhall columnist Phil Holloway, briefings by both parties will be followed by oral arguments sometime this summer. The matter will be heard by a three-judge panel, so two votes will be needed to reverse the trial court's ruling.\n\nTrump's Georgia case is \"effective[ly] dead in the water for a while,\" Holloway commented.", "source": {"uri": "townhall.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Townhall"}, "authors": [{"uri": "mia_cathell@townhall.com", "name": "Mia Cathell", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Georgia_Court_of_Appeals", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Georgia Court of Appeals"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/District_attorney", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "District attorney"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fulton_County,_Georgia", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Fulton County, Georgia"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Fulton County, Georgia"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fani_Willis", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Fani Willis"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Appeal", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Appeal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Election_Day_(United_States)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Election Day (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Georgia_(U.S._state)", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Georgia (U.S. state)"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Georgia (U.S. state)"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special_counsel", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Special counsel"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Townhall", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Townhall"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lawsuit", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Lawsuit"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oral_argument", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Oral argument"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phil_Holloway", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Phil Holloway"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lawfare_(blog)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Lawfare (blog)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Georgia_State_University", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Georgia State University"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constitutional_law", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Constitutional law"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Appellate_court", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Appellate court"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Racketeer_Influenced_and_Corrupt_Organizations_Act", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twitter", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Twitter"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Law", "label": "dmoz/Society/Law", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Law/Legal_Information", "label": "dmoz/Society/Law/Legal Information", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Law/Courts", "label": "dmoz/Society/Law/Courts", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Laws", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Laws", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://media.townhall.com/cdn/hodl/2024/75/c24d9a14-b516-4d55-952f-d69a50b6c64f.png", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9549791", "eventUri": "eng-9549791", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-03-15", "textStart": 898, "textEnd": 906}], "sentiment": 0.2, "wgt": 161, "relevance": 1}

Trump,\" committee Chairman Jim Jordan (R-OH) wrote.\n\nWillis hired Wade, a private attorney with no experience working on the racketeering crimes alleged in Trump's case, at the end of 2021. Her office proceeded to pay Wade more than $600,000 in less than two years for his work on the case while Willis carried on an undisclosed romantic relationship with him.\n\nTrump and several co-defendants called for Willis to be disqualified after they learned of the relationship, and after two drama-filled months of the court scrutinizing her potential conflict of interest, a judge decided that Willis could rectify the matter by removing Wade from the case. Wade resigned immediately, but now Trump is in the process of appealing the judge's decision to allow Willis to continue with the former president's prosecution.\n\nDespite ruling in Willis's favor, the Fulton County judge heavily criticized Willis's actions and said an \"odor of mendacity\" remained on the case. Wade and Willis, the judge said, left open questions about whether they lied during sworn testimony about aspects of their relationship, such as when their relationship started.\n\nFeatured Local Savings\n\nIn his letter, Jordan asserted that the committee had grounds to investigate Wade because some of Willis's payments to him originated from federal grant money.\n\n\"The Committee understands that Ms. Willis reportedly compensated you and financed her politically motivated prosecution using a mixture of taxpayer funds, possibly including part of the $14.6 million in federal grant funds that her office received from the Department of Justice between 2020 and 2023,\" Jordan said.\n\nCLICK HERE TO READ MORE FROM THE WASHINGTON EXAMINER\n\nJordan said he initially asked Wade for records related to Willis in January but that instead of Wade responding, Willis responded with an \"unsolicited\" letter to the committee and did not comply with the committee's requests.\n\nThe request to Wade is the latest instance of the pair of prosecutors continuing to experience fallout from the scandal. The case is now wrapped up in appellate court proceedings that legal experts say could push the trial until after the 2024 election. Additionally, a special Georgia Senate committee is investigating Willis's handling of public funds, primarily because of her hiring of Wade.\n\nSign Up for Springs AM Update Your morning rundown of the latest news from Colorado Springs and around the country\n\nSign Up View all of our newsletters.

Apparently, the sound of the gears and wheels of his mind failing has become audible as Judge Juan Merchan smacked him for swearing out loud and otherwise acting out at the defense table while Stormy Daniels unspooled the story of the Worst First Date In History from the witness stand. The gaskets are just inches from blowing.\n\nHowever, elsewhere, his cause goes marching on. Down in Florida, his dashboard statue of a judge, Aileen Cannon, pretty much took any trial on the pool shed papers off the schedule for the foreseeable future as what may (inshallah) be her final act as the judge in that case. From The Washington Post:\n\nThe judge had originally set the Florida trial date for late May, but that has seemed unlikely for months, with Cannon still needing to make decisions on a number of key legal issues before a jury can hear the case. In her ruling Tuesday, Cannon said there are many complicated legal rules and deadlines surrounding the use of classified evidence in public criminal trials that need to be considered before she picks a new court date. The order was a blow to special counsel Jack Smith and his team, who have argued that Trump's team have had ample time to prepare for a summer trial and accused Trump's lawyers of wrongly trying to use the three other criminal cases against him as a way to obfuscate and delay the legal proceedings in Florida.\n\nQuite frankly, she's not even bothering to hide it any more. She's acting like she's in this to keep from having to preside over this case, either out of loyalty to her patron, or because she doesn't have the faintest idea how to preside over a trial, or both. (These are hardly mutually exclusive motives.) Among her other shortcomings, she obviously flunked Strategic Obfuscation in law school.\n\n\"The Court also determines that finalization of a trial date at this juncture -- before resolution of the myriad and interconnected pre-trial and CIPA issues remaining and forthcoming -- would be imprudent and inconsistent with the Court's duty to fully and fairly consider the various pending pre-trial motions before the Court, critical CIPA issues, and additional pretrial and trial preparations necessary to present this case to a jury,\" Cannon wrote.\n\nNow who can argue with that?\n\nMeanwhile, on Wednesday up in Georgia, an appeals court revived the outright ratfcking of Fulton County DA Fani Willis, which appeared to be not merely dead, but really most sincerely dead, after a week of comic opera courtroom drama at the end of March. From the Atlanta Journal-Constitution:\n\nThe Georgia Court of Appeals on Wednesday decided to hear an appeal of a judge's ruling allowing District Attorney Fani Willis to remain at the helm of Fulton County's election interference case against former President Donald Trump. The court's decision almost certainly means a significant delay of a trial here for Trump and his 14 co-defendants and signals that Willis' leadership role isn't guaranteed. It is unclear how long the appeals court will take to decide the issue but they are not known for moving swiftly.\n\n(Let us pause here and consider the irony of reviving nudge-nudge-wink-wink charges about Willis' love life at the same time we're learning about the former president*s predilections for satin pajamas and magazine S&M. Life is strange.)\n\nEight defendants, including Trump, requested permission to appeal a few days after McAfee mostly denied a motion to disqualify Willis due to her romantic relationship with then-special prosecutor Nathan Wade. While McAfee ruled that Willis did not have an actual conflict of interest that warranted her removal, he said there was an appearance of a conflict that required her to make a choice. Willis could either recuse herself and her office from the case or cut ties with Wade, McAfee said. Within hours, Wade had tendered his resignation.\n\nSo now we have another couple of months where this nothingburger gets served up cold while Georgia appeals court judges play Tetris on their telephones and catch up on their sleep during their \"deliberations.\" The law may be an ass, but it looks right now like a dead horse.", "source": {"uri": "esquire.com", "dataType": "news", "title":

However, Trump's legal team appealed this ruling and on Wednesday the Georgia Court of Appeal agreed to hear the case, sparking widespread speculation the trial itself would be delayed.\n\nTrump, the presumptive 2024 Republican presidential candidate, has been charged with crimes in four separate cases, complicating his bid for a second White House term. The GOP firebrand is accused of falsifying business records to conceal the payment of hush money to a pornographic actress, mishandling classified documents and attempting to overturn the 2020 presidential election both nationwide and in the state of Georgia specifically. He has pleaded not guilty to all charges and claims the cases against him are politically motivated.\n\nHowever, of these cases a trial is only underway for the first, with Florida Judge Aileen Cannonindefinitely postponing the classified documents trial earlier on Tuesday due to legal disputes around classified evidence.\n\nPosting on X, formerly Twitter, Professor Ryan Goodman, formerly special counsel to the general counsel of the Department of Defense, said the Georgia Court of Appeal's decision might not delay the trial itself as it could run alongside a number of pretrial motions.\n\nHe wrote: \"Unless Trump requests and gets a stay, the Georgia appeals court considering his effort to disqualify DA Fani Willis might not delay matters.\"\n\nGoodman then quoted a filing from Judge McAfee in March in which he granted Trump's team the right to appeal his ruling on Willis and said the court would continue examining pretrial motions regardless of whether this was approved.\n\nMcAfee said: \"The Court intends to continue addressing the many other unrelated pending pretrial motions, regardless of whether the petition is granted within 45 days of filing, and even if any subsequent appeal is expedited by the appellate court.\"\n\nNewsweek has contacted Donald Trump's attorney and representatives of his 2024 presidential election campaign for comment by email.\n\nThe news that the Georgia Court of Appeals would hear Trump's case against Willis, and that Judge Cannon had postponed his election interference case, sparked jubilation among supporters of his MAGA [Make America Great Again] movement earlier this week.\n\nGreg Price, communications director for the conservative leaning State Freedom Caucus Network, commented: \"The Florida sham Trump trial is postponed indefinitely, the DC sham trial hangs on the SCOTUS immunity ruling, the Georgia sham trial is heading to appeal for Fani Willis' disqualification, and even liberals are admitting the New York sham trial is a clown show.\"\n\nLast month, the Supreme Court heard arguments over whether Trump has immunity from prosecution over his federal election interference trial, meaning the case is unlikely to be resolved anytime soon.\n\nOn Tuesday, Stormy Daniels, who prosecutors claim was paid $130,000 in hush money ahead of the 2016 presidential election, provided details of a sexual encounter she claimed to have had with Trump in 2006. The former president strongly denies having a sexual relationship with Daniels or falsifying business records to cover up a hush money payment.", "source": {"uri": "heraldonline.com", "dataType":

(Elijah Nouvelage/Pool via Getty Images)\n\nHouse Judiciary Committee Chairman Jim Jordan (R-Ohio) has called on Nathan Wade -- an attorney until recently involved in prosecuting former President Donald Trump -- to provide records and testimony to the House committee regarding his role in the case.\n\nFulton County, Georgia District Attorney Fani Willis had hired Mr. Wade to assist her in prosecuting President Trump on charges he engaged in a conspiracy to unlawfully challenge the 2020 election results. Mr. Wade's involvement in the case became the subject of controversy after one of President Trump's co-defendants -- Michael Roman -- raised allegations Mr. Wade and Ms. Willis were romantically involved and that he unduly profited from the case.\n\nFulton County Superior Court Scott McAfee concluded Ms. Willis and Mr. Wade's relationship did not necessarily create a conflict of interest but did create a \"significant appearance of impropriety\" surrounding their prosecution of President Trump and his co-defendants. Judge McAfee concluded either Ms. Willis or Mr. Wade would cure this appearance of impropriety, and Mr. Wade subsequently resigned from the case.\n\nNow Mr. Jordan and the Republican-controlled House Judiciary Committee are calling on Mr. Wade to provide more details about his work with Ms. Willis and the Fulton County District Attorney's Office's (FCDAO). Mr. Jordan first reached out to Mr. Wade in January, requesting his insights into the case.\n\n\"To date, you have failed to comply with, or even respond to, the Committee's request. We write to reiterate our requests and ask again for your voluntary cooperation with our oversight,\" Mr. Jordan's latest letter to Mr. Wade reads.\n\nIn his new letter, Mr. Jordan refers to the FCDAO's ongoing case against the former president as \"politically motivated.\" The Republican lawmaker raises further allegations that Mr. Wade, Ms. Willis, and the FCDAO coordinated with President Trump's political opponents as they advanced the case.\n\nMr. Jordan specifically alleged the team prosecuting President Trump in Georgia met in secret with members of the now-defunct Democrat-controlled House Jan. 6 investigative committee to review information the congressional panel had gathered, and that he or other members of the FCDAO team attended two separate White House meetings with members of President Joe Biden's administration.\n\nMr. Jordan's new letter also alleges the FCDAO's prosecution against President Trump has played out while they've received about $14.6 million in federal grants.\n\nThe Republican committee chairman said the Judiciary Committee is considering legislative reforms regarding the uses of federal grant funds by local prosecutors and penalties when those funds are misused.\n\n\"Additionally, the Committee has considered legislation broadening the existing statutory right of removal of certain criminal cases from state court to federal court as a remedy against politicized prosecutions by popularly elected state or local prosecutors,\" Mr. Jordan added.\n\nMr. Jordan called on Mr. Wade to provide records of his work with the FCDAO as soon as possible but not later than May 16, and to make himself available to provide related testimony.\n\nNTD News reached out to Mr. Wade's law office for comment about Mr. Jordan's new requests. Mr. Wade's office did not respond by press time.\n\nMr. Jordan's letter to Mr. Wade comes a day after the Georgia Court of Appeals granted a request by President Trump and eight of his Georgia co-defendants, to review Judge McAfee's decision to let Mr. Wade resign from the FCDAO prosecution team. President Trump and his co-defendants have argued Judge McAfee's decision didn't go far enough and that the judge should have also forced Ms. Willis to resign.\n\nShould the appeals court side with President Trump and his allies, a state board would need to appoint a new prosecutor to lead the FCDAO office handling the case.\n\nEven if the appeals court doesn't ultimately side with President Trump and his allies, the appeals process could push back the start date of any potential criminal trial in the case.\n\nPresident Trump's legal team is also arguing that allowing a trial that overlaps with the November 2024 general election would create a clear case of \"election interference.\"\n\nAlong with the Georgia case, President Trump is also facing an ongoing state-level criminal prosecution in New York, and is dealing with other pretrial procedures stemming from two more federal criminal indictments brought by special counsel Jack Smith.\n\nOne of Mr. Smith's cases against the former president was tentatively set to go to trial on May 20, but U.S. District Judge Aileen Cannon issued an order on Wednesday canceling that trial start date. In place of the trial, Judge Cannon set a schedule for handling a series of pretrial motions and evidentiary disputes through at least July 22, and said the trial date will \"be reset by separate

Mr. Wade's involvement in the case became the subject of controversy after one of President Trump's co-defendants -- Michael Roman -- raised allegations Mr. Wade and Ms. Willis were romantically involved and that he unduly profited from the case.\n\nFulton County Superior Court Scott McAfee concluded Ms. Willis and Mr. Wade's relationship did not necessarily create a conflict of interest but did create a \"significant appearance of impropriety\" surrounding their prosecution of President Trump and his co-defendants. Judge McAfee concluded either Ms. Willis or Mr. Wade would cure this appearance of impropriety, and Mr. Wade subsequently resigned from the case.\n\n\"To date, you have failed to comply with, or even respond to, the Committee's request. We write to reiterate our requests and ask again for your voluntary cooperation with our oversight,\" Mr. Jordan's latest letter to Mr. Wade reads.\n\nIn his new letter, Mr. Jordan refers to the FCDAO's ongoing case against the former president as \"politically motivated.\" The Republican lawmaker raises further allegations that Mr. Wade, Ms. Willis, and the FCDAO coordinated with President Trump's political opponents as they advanced the case.\n\nMr. Jordan specifically alleged the team prosecuting President Trump in Georgia met in secret with members of the now-defunct Democrat-controlled House Jan. 6 investigative committee to review information the congressional panel had gathered, and that he or other members of the FCDAO team attended two separate White House meetings with members of President Joe Biden's administration.\n\nMr. Jordan's new letter also alleges the FCDAO's prosecution against President Trump has played out while they've received about $14.6 million in federal grants.\n\nThe Republican committee chairman said the Judiciary Committee is considering legislative reforms regarding the uses of federal grant funds by local prosecutors and penalties when those funds are misused.\n\n\"Additionally, the Committee has considered legislation broadening the existing statutory right of removal of certain criminal cases from state court to federal court as a remedy against politicized prosecutions by popularly elected state or local prosecutors,\" Mr. Jordan added.\n\nMr. Jordan called on Mr. Wade to provide records of his work with the FCDAO as soon as possible but not later than May 16, and to make himself available to provide related testimony.\n\nShould the appeals court side with President Trump and his allies, a state board would need to appoint a new prosecutor to lead the FCDAO office handling the case.\n\nEven if the appeals court doesn't ultimately side with President Trump and his allies, the appeals process could push back the start date of any potential criminal trial in the case.\n\nPresident Trump's legal team is also arguing that allowing a trial that overlaps with the November 2024 general election would create a clear case of \"election interference.\"\n\nAlong with the Georgia case, President Trump is also facing an ongoing state-level criminal prosecution in New York, and is dealing with other pretrial procedures stemming from two more federal criminal indictments brought by special counsel Jack Smith.", "source": {"uri": "theepochtimes.com", "dataType": "news", "title":

Cannon citing a mountain of 'outstanding' pre-trial matters that would make a May 20 trial 'imprudent'), another Trump case appears to have no chance of going to trial before the 2024 election.\n\nOn Wednesday, a Georgia appeals court agreed to review a lower court ruling which allowed Fulton County District Attorney Fani Willis to remain on the Trump RICO prosecution despite being highly conflicted.\n\nTo review, Atlanta Judge Scott McAfee of Fulton Superior Court, who donated to Fani Willis when she was running for office, ruled in March that the Fani simply had to kick her lover, Nathan Wade, off the case after she paid him more than $600,000. The two notoriously took several lavish vacations together on Wade's dime (which Fani swears she repaid in cash).\n\nAccording to McAfee, while he found the \"appearance of impropriety,\" no \"disqualification of a constitutional officer necessary when a less drastic and sufficiently remedial option is available,\" adding \"that the prosecution of this case cannot proceed until the State selects one of two options.\"\n\nAnd now, the Atlanta Court of Appeals has agreed to hear an appeal from the defendants over whether McAfee erred in his decision.\n\nWillis indicted Trump and 18 other defendants last August, accusing them of a wide-ranging scheme to attempt to overturn the results of the 2020 presidential election in the state.

And so is the judge.\n\n\"It's this unprecedented and bizarre confluence of the prosecutor, the judge and one of the defendants all on the ballot,\" says veteran Fulton Superior Judge Robert McBurney, who supervised the special grand jury requested by Willis to investigate Trump and his future co-defendants. \"It highlights the tension between wanting to have apolitical judges and yet putting them on ballots.\"\n\nElsewhere in Fulton County, Republican state Sen. Shawn Still, a Trump co-defendant who signed onto a false slate of electors for Trump and has also pleaded not guilty, is up for reelection this year as well.\n\nRepublican Gov. Brian Kemp appointed McAfee, then 33, to fill a vacant seat in 2022. Seven months later, the court randomly assigned him the Trump case. Now, McAfee is running for a full term, facing an opponent this month in a nonpartisan race. But he says campaigning has not been such a bad thing.\n\n\"I've still got 400 other cases that no one's really paying as much attention to,\" McAfee says. \"And those folks come in, they put their lives on the line and ask me to understand where they're coming from. And I don't think I can do that without staying accessible.\"\n\nMcAfee's opponent, Robert Patillo, is an attorney and radio host who highlights his background as a civil rights and defense attorney. In other words, he has not been a prosecutor, like McAfee.\n\n\"When you're a hammer, everything looks like a nail,\" Patillo says. \"The system is broken, fundamentally.\"\n\nPatillo points to the case backlog in Fulton County, where defendants awaiting trial can languish in the jail for months or longer. McAfee says he is proud of the progress he has made chipping away at the docket he inherited.\n\nPatillo has also noted McAfee's involvement in the Federalist Society during law school, saying the conservative legal organization does not match the values of heavily Democratic Fulton County. McAfee says he is no longer involved with the group.\n\n\"In terms of my judicial philosophy, I think that's been on display and folks can take account of it as they will,\" he says. \"When someone's going to appear in front of me, it's not about a party platform or a set of ironclad ideals.\"\n\nPatillo has also criticized McAfee's handling of the Trump case, albeit gently.\n\nIn Georgia v. Trump, McAfee's first big decision -- on defendants' claims that Willis' romantic relationship with a special prosecutor tainted the case with a conflict of interest -- drew praise and pushback, for going too far or not far enough.\n\nAfter days of sometimes-unwieldy hearings, McAfee ultimately allowed Willis to remain on the case if the special prosecutor resigned. But in the ruling, he also rebuked Willis' conduct. \"An odor of mendacity remains,\" he wrote.\n\nThe Georgia Court of Appeals agreed Wednesday to hear oral arguments from Trump and other defendants appealing McAfee's decision. That ruling diminishes chances of a trial date being set before the presidential election.\n\n\"We can zoom in on one particular decision, and people can say, 'I don't think he got that one right.' But if you look back and maybe look at the whole year's work, it's undeniable I'm just trying to do the right thing and follow the law,\" McAfee says.\n\nAs McAfee shuttles between campaign stops like the local Republican club in tony Buckhead or the predominantly Black congregation at a Baptist church, voters of all stripes want to tell McAfee what they think about the case. McAfee is limited in what he can say.\n\n\"You look a little young to be a judge,\" Atlanta resident Dione Martin teases, as McAfee pauses to chat along the parade route. \"Age is just a number,\" he tells her, along with a reminder of where to find nonpartisan races on the ballot. \"It's way down at the bottom,\" he says.\n\nMartin is a little taken aback when she learns who she just poked fun at. She has been keeping up with the Trump case, including the recent claims against Willis and McAfee's ruling.\n\n\"I felt like she knew how buttoned up she had to be,\" Martin says, of the DA. \"Dot all your i's, cross all your t's. And then for this to come out, how could you let that happen? I still think it didn't have much to do with the actual merits of the case, so I'm glad she was able to stay on, but it was really a bang-your-head-against-the-wall moment.\"\n\nWillis is also campaigning for election, also in the parade. A few blocks ahead, she pokes her head from the sunroof of a black SUV, an armed guard riding shotgun. Willis receives death threats regularly -- especially since she asked a grand jury in August to indict Trump and 18 others for attempting to interfere with the 2020 election result in Georgia. Four have pleaded guilty so far.\n\nA few people boo, but in progressive Inman Park, most cheer and applaud.\n\n\"We love you!\" one reveler screams. \"Keep it up!\" Another shouts, \"Lock him up!\" referring to Trump.\n\nWillis waves, but the security detail overrules her prodding to finish the route on foot.\n\nAcross town, K & K Soul Food is a quieter venue, where bleary-eyed movers, security guards and plumbers stream in and out for grits, eggs and catfish on the way to work.\n\nA table by the front door is draped with the judicial circuit's seal. The table is jammed with pamphlets for youth mentorship, a pretrial diversion program and domestic violence resources. Willis is on hand for an outreach event, but a gaggle of TV producers press for details on the Trump case.\n\n\"If you came here for that today, I'm sorry you're here,\" Willis says. The DA has recently been chided for saying too much about the case.\n\n\"I'm a sister, I can do all of it. I can prosecute high-profile cases and I can prosecute everyday cases,\" Willis redirects. \"But I can also start the first ever Fulton County pre-indictment diversion plan, where we are giving citizens a second chance.\"\n\nWillis, the first Black woman elected district attorney in Fulton County, took office just days after the infamous Trump call to Georgia Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger asking to \"find\" him votes.\n\nI ask Willis what she would say to voters who may question her judgment in light of the conflict of interest allegations in the Trump case.\n\n\"If you look at the work that we've done and the positive impact it's had on your community, you will know where the truth lies,\" she says.\n\nWillis' opponent in the Democratic primary this month, Christian Wise Smith, has slipped in digs at his opponent's handling of the Trump case, but it has not been the central focus of his campaign. Instead, he pitches himself as a more progressive prosecutor. He often highlights how his own experiences with the criminal justice system as a kid in Cincinnati would inform his approach to the job.\n\n\"I've actually lived the life of most people going through the system, so I can talk about it differently,\" Wise Smith says.\n\nWillis eschews labels to describe her approach to criminal justice.\n\n\"You have these people that think you should lock everyone up and that is foolish,\" Willis says. \"It does not work. But you also have these people who think we should not have any prisons or jail cells, and you have a district attorney who was a murder prosecutor for eight years.\"\n\nIf Willis wins the primary, she will then face a Republican challenger in November.\n\n\"I'm happy to live in a democracy where we get to choose the people that represent us,\" Willis says. \"What I hope people do is research the background of the DA and see who she really is and make an informed decision.\"\n\nTwo miles away sits the imposing Fulton County Courthouse. It's where years ago Willis once supervised McAfee in the major case division and where two grand juries met leading up to Trump's indictment.\n\nMcBurney, the veteran judge who supervised one of those grand juries, understands what it is like to helm a case so closely scrutinized.\n\n\"As a human, you're sort of consumed by that big, shiny case that you got stuck on and it's very natural to say, 'I'd love to talk about it and let me tell you, it's stressful, it's fascinating,' but you can't,\" he says.\n\nVoter Martin says her remote coworkers outside Georgia regularly ask her about the Trump case. She can practically see the courthouse from her home.\n\nShe says it feels like this year, she has a front row seat to history -- and she might help shape it.\n\nShe can vote for or against the judge, the prosecutor and the defendant in one of the most unusual and high-stakes criminal cases the country has ever seen.\n\n\"That's why I'm voting,\" Martin says. \"I definitely think we have a voice in this.\"", "source": {"uri": "npr.org", "dataType": "news", "title": "NPR"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/McAfee", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng":

The delay was almost entirely attributable to Cannon, a Trump appointee, who admitted outlandish legal arguments in the case and let preliminary legal questions pile up on his role to the point that a May trial was unheard of. no longer a possibility.\n\nOn Thursday, the Georgia Court of Appeals announced that it would hear a request from Trump to determine whether Fani Willis, the Fulton County prosecutor, should be removed from the election interference case against him because of his relations with another prosecutor. The move means both that Trump will continue to undermine Willis' credibility and drag out the case. There will be no trial until 2025, tweeted Anthony Michael Kreis, a law professor at Georgia State University who is closely following the case.\n\nIt also appears unlikely that the third case pending against Trump, a federal election interference case in Washington, will go to trial before the election. The U.S. Supreme Court last month heard oral arguments on whether Trump had immunity from lawsuits and appeared unlikely to resolve the issue quickly enough to allow the case to move forward before the election .\n\nThe decisions mean voters won't get a chance to see Trump held accountable for possible criminal conduct during his final term before deciding whether to grant him another term. (Trump is currently in the middle of a criminal trial in Manhattan over allegations that he falsified business records to conceal secret payments to Stormy Daniels, but that happened before his presidency, during the 2016 campaign .)\n\nThese developments justify a pillar of Trump's legal strategy. Facing four separate criminal cases, his lawyers have sought to use every possible opportunity to delay the cases, hoping he wins the election in November. If he returned to the White House, he would drop the two federal cases against him (he has said he would appoint an attorney general who would fire Jack Smith, the Justice Department's special prosecutor). It is unclear whether Fani Willis, the Fulton County prosecutor, could pursue criminal charges against a sitting president.\n\nIn all likelihood, Trump's election would end the prosecution of him in Georgia. There is broad consensus among legal scholars that a sitting president cannot be tried for crimes. This, however, is an untested constitutional theory, which Fani Willis will likely challenge, Kreis said. If I had to bet, if Trump won in November, his Fulton County co-defendants would be tried in mid-2025 and Trump would be tried alone after his second term ends.\n\nEven though Trump managed to secure delays in three of the cases against him, Manhattan prosecutors this week continued to move forward by presenting evidence as to why he should be convicted of 34 counts of falsifying business records. Testimony from key accounting employees at the Trump Organization helped link Trump to the amounts paid to Michael Cohen. Stormy Daniels, the adult film star who claims to have had an affair with Trump in 2006, also testified in detail about the incident, angering Trump and bringing one of the most embarrassing episodes back to the center of public discourse.\n\nTrump's lawyers objected to the testimony and called for a mistrial, saying the lurid details disclosed by Daniels had prejudiced jurors against the defendants. Judge Juan Merchan denied that request, but still acknowledged that jurors heard information they should not have.\n\nAlthough Trump was likely to use the episode as part of a possible appeal, experts doubted he would succeed.\n\nSkirmishes like this happen all the time, and defense attorneys seek a mistrial in many, if not most, criminal trials. \"I don't think it's close to causing a mistrial and I don't think it would end up being a major issue on appeal,\" said Rebecca Roiphe, a former prosecutor in the Manhattan District Attorneys' Office. who now teaches at New York Law School.\n\nThe details of the sexual relationship are relevant because they explain why Trump would want to suppress his story. The judge attempted to limit any prejudicial effects by asking the witness to be less colorful in his description. She did not comply with this until she was repeatedly warned, but this hardly appears to be a cause for concern on appeal.\n\nWhat Are The Main Benefits Of Comparing Car Insurance Quotes Online",

The delay was almost entirely the doing of Cannon, a Trump appointee, who allowed far-fetched legal arguments into the case and let preliminary legal matters pile up on her docket to the point where a May trial was not a possibility.\n\nOn Thursday, the Georgia court of appeals announced it would hear a request from Trump to consider whether Fani Willis, the Fulton county district attorney, should be removed from the election interference case against him because of a relationship with another prosecutor. The decision means both that Trump will continue to undermine Willis's credibility and draw out the case. \"There will be no trial until 2025,\" tweeted Anthony Michael Kreis, a law professor at Georgia State University who has been closely following the case.\n\nThe third pending case against Trump, a federal election interference case in Washington, also appears unlikely to go to trial before the election. The US supreme court heard oral arguments on whether Trump has immunity from prosecution last month and seemed unlikely to resolve it quickly enough to allow the case to move forward ahead of the election.\n\nThe decisions mean that voters will not get a chance to see Trump held accountable for possible criminal conduct during his last term in office before they decide whether to give him another term in office. (Trump is currently in the middle of a criminal trial in Manhattan that centers around allegations he falsified business records to cover up hush-money payments to Stormy Daniels, but it happened prior to his presidency, during the 2016 campaign.)\n\nThe developments vindicate a pillar of Trump's legal strategy. Facing four separate criminal cases, his lawyers have sought to use every opportunity they can to delay the cases, hoping that if he wins the election in November. Were he to return to the White House, he would make the two federal cases against him go away (he has said he would appoint an attorney general who would fire Jack Smith, the justice department's special prosecutor). It's unclear if Fani Willis, the Fulton county DA, could proceed with a criminal case against a sitting president.\n\n\"In all likelihood, Trump's election would pause the proceedings against him in Georgia. There is a large consensus among legal academics that a sitting president cannot be tried for crimes. That, however, is an untested constitutional theory, which Fani Willis will probably challenge,\" Kreis said. \"If I had to hedge a bet, should Trump win in November, his Fulton county co-defendants will be tried mid-2025 and Trump would stand trial alone after his second term ends.\"\n\nWhile Trump may have successfully secured delays in three of the cases against him, prosecutors in Manhattan continued to move ahead this week in laying out evidence for why he should be found guilty on 34 counts of falsifying business records. Testimony from key accounting employees at the Trump organization helped connect Trump to the monies that were paid out to Michael Cohen. Stormy Daniels, the adult film star who alleges she had an affair with Trump in 2006, also testified in detail about the incident, irritating Trump, and bringing one of the most embarrassing episodes back to the center of the public discourse.\n\nTrump's lawyers objected to the testimony and requested a mistrial, saying the lurid details Daniels disclosed had prejudiced jurors against defendants. Judge Juan Merchan rejected that request, but still conceded jurors had heard information they should not have.\n\nWhile Trump is likely to use the episode in any potential appeal, experts doubted whether he would succeed.\n\n\"Skirmishes like this happen all the time, and defense attorneys call for mistrials in many, if not most, criminal trials. I don't think this was even close to cause for a mistrial and don't think it would end up being a major issue on appeal,\" said Rebecca Roiphe, a former prosecutor in the Manhattan district attorney's office who now teaches at New York Law School.\n\n\"The details of the sexual encounter are relevant because they go to why Trump would want to suppress her story. The judge tried to limit any prejudicial effect by asking the witness to be less colorful in her description. She didn't abide by this until warned a few times, but this hardly seems like a cause for concern on appeal.\"", "source": {"uri": "aol.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Aol"}, "authors": [],

First Judge Cannon made it official in the Florida stolen documents case, setting a trial date of never, does never work for you? And now the Georgia Court of Appeals has granted Trump's interlocutory appeal of the decision to let prosecutors in Atlanta stay on the election interference case.\n\nIn March, Judge Scott McAfee castigated Fulton County District Attorney Fani Willis for her \"tremendous lapse in judgment\" in entering into a romantic relationship with Nathan Wade, the outside prosecutor she hired to shepherd the prosecution of Donald Trump and his co-conspirators in their effort to steal the state's 16 electoral votes for Donald Trump. Trump also argued that DA Willis's speech on MLK weekend at a historically black church in which she likened the plaintiffs' recusal motion to playing the race card amounted to \"forensic misconduct.\"\n\nThe trial judge ruled that her office could stay on the case as long as Wade resigned. Which he did, post haste, although he emerged this week to say that \"workplace romances are as American as apple pie.\"\n\n\"It happens to everyone. But it happened to the two of us,\" he gabbled to ABC News.\n\nOn March 29, Judge McAfee gave Trump a window to appeal by granting his petition for a certificate of review, allowing him and his co-defendants to make their case immediately to the Georgia Court of Appeals that the case should be dismissed, or at least that the FCDA Office should be tossed off the case entirely.\n\nThis morning the appellate court granted the former president's petition for interlocutory appeal, dooming the prospect that this case will get underway in 2024. Worse still, under O.C.G.A. 5-6-34(d), \"all judgments, rulings, or orders rendered in the case which are raised on appeal and which may affect the proceedings below shall be reviewed and determined by the appellate court, without regard to the appealability of the judgment, ruling, or order standing alone[.]\" So Trump and his minions can now lard up the appeal with dozens of issues already ruled on below, dragging this thing out even longer, and crossing their fingers that the appeals panel will overrule the trial court and bollix this case for good.\n\nIn the normal course of events, a grant of interlocutory appeal would stay the proceedings below. But here, Judge McAfee noted that he \"intends to continue addressing the many other unrelated pending pretrial motions, regardless of whether the petition is granted within 45 days of filing, and even if any subsequent appeal is expedited by the appellate court.\"\n\nThe appeals panel should be named within the next two weeks, after which we'll find out whether the trial judge will be allowed to continue his work. But clearly this case is going to be delayed for months because of the DA's decision to enter into a romantic relationship with her direct report.\n\n\"This was the foreseeable result of a cascade of bad decisions,\" Georgia defense attorney Andrew Fleischman told ATL, calling it \"an enduring testament to Atlanta's ability to blow a huge lead in the second half.\"", "source": {"uri":

Fulton Superior Court must prepare the record from the first round of the removal fight earlier this year and send it to the appeals court. The case is then docketed and a panel of three judges is randomly assigned via the court's computer system, according to Christina Cooley Smith, deputy court administrator for the Court of Appeals.\n\nThose judges will schedule oral arguments. The matter must be decided within two terms of court. If it's docketed before July, that means it would need to be heard and decided before mid-March 2025. The appeals court decision to hear the case virtually guarantees the Fulton County case will not go to trial before Election Day.\n\nWhat happens in Fulton County?: When he gave defense lawyers permission to appeal his decision, Fulton Superior Court Judge Scott McAfee said he would continue working on the case, doing things like resolving pending motions. But Trump or his co-defendants could seek a stay barring McAfee from moving forward with his work on the case until the appeal is resolved.\n\nWhat about other issues creating delay?: In addition to the removal appeal, there are also questions about whether Trump has presidential immunity that could shield him from facing criminal charges. The U.S. Supreme Court heard arguments on the issue in April and is expected to deliver an opinion by the end of June. Trump's legal team has raised the question of immunity in the Georgia case and the high court's decision will have implications about how the case moves forward.\n\n_____", "source": {"uri": "arcamax.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "ArcaMax"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electoral_fraud", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Electoral fraud"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fulton_County,_Georgia", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Fulton County, Georgia"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Fulton County, Georgia"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fani_Willis", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Fani Willis"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Georgia_Court_of_Appeals", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Georgia Court of Appeals"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Superior_court", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Superior court"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/District_attorney", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "District attorney"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atlanta", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Atlanta, Georgia"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Atlanta, Georgia"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oral_argument", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Oral argument"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Absolute_immunity", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Absolute immunity"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sovereign_immunity", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Sovereign immunity"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Election_Day_(United_States)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Election Day (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supreme_Court_of_the_United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Supreme Court of the United States"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Georgia_(U.S._state)", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Georgia (U.S. state)"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Georgia (U.S. state)"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Trials", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Trials", "wgt": 22}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Law", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Law", "wgt": 31}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Tennis/Real", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Tennis/Real", "wgt": 16}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Racquetball/Courts", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Racquetball/Courts", "wgt": 18}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Bocce", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Bocce", "wgt": 18}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 83}], "image": "https://resources.arcamax.com/newspics/288/28851/2885175.gif", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9549791", "eventUri": "eng-9549791", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.1294117647058823, "wgt": 131, "relevance": 1}

The decision was legally questionable and nothing more than a scheme to punt the decision-making to a higher court.\n\nThat decision appears to have been a smart move on McAfee's part, preserving his chances of getting reelected. His decision surely wasn't based on the applicable law, given that Willis' credibility was utterly destroyed.\n\nThe Washington Post's story laid out the arguments for the decision:\n\nThe Appeals Court won't hear the arguments until August according to the trial docket (via the Washington Post), almost guaranteeing that Willis' witchhunt will be delayed until well after the election.\n\nThis is, needless to say, huge. The whole point of the exercise was to tie Donald Trump up in court for months during the height of the presidential campaign.\n\nWillis has likely poured gasoline on her career and lit a match. She likely committed perjury, clearly violated legal ethics, and is looking like a fool. Were she not a female minority her career would be over.\n\nWillis' defense of her and Wade's actions were largely predicated on playing the race card, as you recall.\n\nThe Stormy Daniels antics in court yesterday signify a modest shift in lawfare strategy: since there is no legal basis to convict Trump successfully without reversal, the goal is now to humiliate him.", "source": {"uri": "hotair.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "HotAir"}, "authors": [{"uri": "david_strom@hotair.com", "name": "David Strom", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stormy_Daniels", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Stormy Daniels"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reversible_error", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Reversible error"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alan_Dershowitz", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Alan Dershowitz"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_(state)", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "New York (state)"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Washington_Post", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "The Washington Post"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump_2016_presidential_campaign", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump 2016 presidential campaign"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lawfare", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Lawfare"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perjury", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Perjury"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Witch-hunt", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Witch-hunt"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gasoline", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Gasoline"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ethics", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Ethics"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Law", "label": "dmoz/Society/Law", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Law/Legal_Information", "label": "dmoz/Society/Law/Legal Information", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Law/Courts", "label": "dmoz/Society/Law/Courts", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Law", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Law", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Laws", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Laws", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 53}], "image": "https://media.townhall.com/cdn/hodl/ha/images/2024/129/5953518d-0376-447d-b22d-a5d9d462eee6-650x0.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9549791", "eventUri": "eng-9549791", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.2235294117647059, "wgt": 130, "relevance": 1}

Her latest comments could grant her critics further ballast.\n\nThe message of prospective noncompliance was broadcast at a press conference with Black faith leaders -- she is running for re-election -- held by the district attorney on the steps of Big Bethel AME Church. That is where, on Martin Luther King Jr. Day, she delivered an oration in which she accused her foes of \"playing the race card.\"\n\nIn that homily, she also defended her former boyfriend, Nathan Wade, whom she hired as special prosecutor. \"God wasn't it them\" -- meaning her critics -- \"that attacked this lawyer of impeccable credentials? The Black man I chose has been a judge more than 10 years. Been in private practice more than 20. Some will never see a Black man as qualified, no matter his achievements.\" Mr. Wade has never prosecuted a felony case, but was paid more than $650,000 by Ms. Willis's office.\n\nThat rhetoric, Mr. Trump will argue to the Georgia Court of Appeals, is, along with her secret romance with the special prosecutor she picked to try the case, Nathan Wade, grounds for disqualification. On Wednesday, the review tribunal granted the 45th president's request to consider whether the trial judge, Scott McAfee, erred in allowing Ms. Willis to stay on the case.\n\nPlus, too, Ms. Willis faces scrutiny from the Georgia senate's special committee on investigations over her office's use of taxpayer funds in the prosecution of Mr. Trump. She is also being investigated for misuse of federal funds by Congressman Jim Jordan. The chairman of the Georgia committee, Bill Coswert, told WSB-TV at Atlanta: \"If she's not willing to come and explain her conduct, then we will subpoena her and ask her to come and require her to come.\"\n\nMs. Willis's response did not mince words. \"First of all,\" she declared, \"I don't even think they have the authority to subpoena me, but they need to learn the law. I will not appear to do anything that is unlawful, and I have not broken the law in any way. I'm sorry folks get pissed off that everybody gets treated evenly.\"\n\nThat last line could find its way into Mr. Trump's appellate case against Ms. Willis, whom he accuses of \"forensic misconduct\" on account of her comments suggesting that the defendants in the case are racist. Judge McAfee found those remarks \"legally improper\" but demurred from holding that her speech at Big Bethel \"crossed the line to the point where the Defendants have been denied the opportunity for a fundamentally fair trial.\"\n\nJudge McAfee also reckoned that \"providing this type of public comment creates dangerous waters for the District Attorney to wade further into.\" He even suggested that the defendants could move for a gag order to be imposed on Ms. Willis. He reasons that the \"time may well have arrived for an order preventing the State from mentioning the case in any public forum.\"\n\nMs. Willis has also reportedly employed racial language in private settings. WAGA-TV reports that in January, in an email exchange with Mr. Trump's attorney, Steven Sadow, over timely delivery of documents, the district attorney wrote, \"In the legal community (and the world at large), some people will never be able to respect African Americans and/or women as their equal and counterpart. That is a burden you do not experience.\"\n\nMr. Sadow replied to that observation by declaring, \"No defense counsel has treated you or your prosecutors in a disrespectful or condescending manner ... the relationship among counsel in our case has nothing to do with race or gender, nor should it.\" He alleges, though, that Ms. Willis has engaged in racially charged rhetoric to poison the Fulton County jury pool. The last Census found that Fulton County, which includes downtown Atlanta, is a majority-minority county, with 60 percent of its population being people of color.\n\nJudge McAfee notes that no prosecutor at Fulton County has ever been disqualified for forensic misconduct. He lamented that he was \"unmoored from precedent,\" but found the relevant inquiry to be \"whether such remarks were part of a calculated plan evincing a design to prejudice the defendant in the minds of the jurors, or whether such remarks were inadvertent utterances.\"\n\nThe judge, though, acknowledges that his holding was \"limited,\" and marbled it with caveats about the \"unexplored\" nature of this body of law and critiques of Ms. Willis's conduct. The Court of Appeals could yet find him too credulous of the district attorney's intentions. Ms. Willis's office did not respond by press time to a request for comment.", "source": {"uri": "nysun.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The New York Sun"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

Cannon, a Trump appointee, indefinitely postponed the trial date in a Tuesday ruling, saying that setting a date would be \"imprudent\" before a number of pre-trial motions were addressed. Jarrett said that by \"tampering\" with the evidence in the case, Smith left the door open for the case to be dismissed for \"prosecutorial or government misconduct,\" in addition to \"selective prosecution\" and Smith being unlawfully appointed as special counsel.\n\n\"What you just described is planting evidence by government officials to falsely incriminate a target defendant and you know, Jack Smith is to blame for a lot of this. He got caught himself tampering with evidence, Larry,\" Jarrett told Fox Business host Larry Kudlow. \"The digital scan of the records doesn't match the physical order of the boxes that were seized by the FBI. So, Smith was forced to admit to the court that evidence was altered, it was manipulated he also admitted he misled the court, he deceived the judge. I don't see a trial happening anytime soon if at all.\"\n\n\"This case could be dismissed over what we've just described, prosecutorial and government misconduct,\" Jarrett said. \"It could be dismissed for selective prosecution, that's a pending motion or it could be unlawful appointment of Smith himself, because Larry, he was never Senate-approved which the special counsel statute requires.\"\n\nJarrett also took aim at Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg and Fulton County District Attorney Fani Willis during the appearance.\n\n\"These Democrat prosecutors threw a grenade on their own cases,\" Jarrett told Kudlow before he commented on Smith. \"The Alvin Bragg case yesterday in New York, it was so foolish for the prosecutors to call Stormy Daniels to the witness stand. Nothing she said is remotely relevant to the charges against Donald Trump. You know, she was just called there to slime Trump, to humiliate him with salacious stories. Her testimony was probative of nothing, it was highly prejudicial, which means under the rules of evidence, it's inadmissible but you have got a biased judge who deliberately allowed it which creates reversible error.\"\n\nAfter the discussion of the peril the classified documents case was in, Jarrett turned to discuss Willis. Attorneys for former Trump campaign aide Michael Roman filed a motion for Willis's disqualification on Jan. 8, alleging that Willis was in a romantic relationship with Nathan Wade who she hired as a special prosecutor to help probe and prosecute the former president.\n\nA Georgia appellate court on Wednesday agreed to hear an appeal of Fulton County Judge Scott McAfee's March 15 ruling that Willis must either step aside or remove Wade from the case against Trump. Wade stepped down from the special prosecutor position after McAfee's decision.\n\n\"She's not qualified to oversee a hot dog stand,\" Jarrett said. \"She campaigned on the promise to nail Trump which is deeply unethical for a prosecutor then she compound the unethical behavior having a affair with [Wade], who said the other day cheating on your wife, having affair in the work place, that is as American as apple pie. That underscores this contorted, twisted mentality of these arrogant people, and she's in trouble now. The fact that the appellate court has taken the case suggests they think that the motion by the defendants to dismiss the case or remove her has merit and it absolutely does.\"", "source": {"uri":

Log in now to continue reading.\n\nThe Intermediate Court of Appeals filed an opinion April 30 vacating the verdict of a Circuit Court jury that found Erik Willis, 21, guilty in the July 8, 2020, stabbing of a 17-year-old girl at Kahala Beach.\n\nIt remanded the case back to the lower court for a new trial based on prosecutorial misconduct for introducing new blood evidence in closing arguments.\n\nThe appeals court denied defense lawyer Eric Seitz's argument that the Circuit Court erred when it denied a motion to dismiss the indictment against Willis for lack of probable cause and to suppress the complaining witness's identification of Willis as her assailant.\n\nThe Prosecutor's Office said in a statement: \"We are reviewing the opinion issued by the Intermediate Court of Appeals and we will review the ICA's judgment once it is filed. Then we will consider our options.\n\n\"Those options include asking the Hawaii Supreme Court to review the ICA opinion and uphold the conviction, or taking the case back to Circuit Court for another trial.\"\n\nWillis was convicted April 7, 2022, of second-degree attempted murder in the stabbing of the teenager, who was sunbathing on Kahala Beach. He was sentenced to life in prison with the possibility of parole, and ordered to pay $83,689 in restitution.\n\nThe 17-year-old, who was stabbed 15 times including in the neck, testified in court she recognized Willis, who wore a mask over his nose and mouth, from his eyes, eyebrows and complexion.\n\nShe said that she had seen him a few times before on the beach, and noticed him because he wore long pants and a white T-shirt on the beach, had \"poufy,\" curly hair, bushy eyebrows, and a pale complexion.\n\nShe said he jumped on her back, covered her mouth and stabbed her five times in the neck, and stabbed her in the right shoulder and hands.\n\nAlthough she could not identify him in a photo lineup, she said she did recognize him from a video her father showed her on social media.\n\nThe ICA ruled that the lower court erred when it denied Willis' motion for a new trial trial because new blood evidence was introduced in closing argument that was not in the court record.\n\nThe ICA ruling says that deputy prosecutor Lawrence Sousie's statements about blood on Willis and his T-shirt were not presented as evidence, and were not harmless beyond a reasonable doubt, so the conviction must be vacated despite the fact that Willis' attorney never objected to the statements during trial.\n\nICA judges found the deputy prosecutor committed prosecutorial misconduct when he told jurors a surveillance video depicted Willis after the attack leaving a work sink near the scene of the attack, and \"we know from (witness) Edward Leal that (Willis) washed his hands and his face because he had blood on them.\" Leal testified the man was \"washing his arms, here, and also washed his face a little.\"\n\nThey also concluded that by the deputy prosecutor saying that \"after he stabbed (the victim), (Willis) got blood on his (T-shirt)\" also amounted to misconduct.\n\nCourt records show that the DNA from bloodstains on Willis' right shoe found at his home matched the victim's DNA. Police also recovered a white shirt from the washer along with the black Adidas shoes, but because police did not obtain a warrant before the search and seizure, the actions were found to be unreasonable, invalid and unconstitutional.\n\nProsecutors could not use the blood evidence because it had been suppressed by Judge Kevin Souza, the trial judge, in 2021.\n\nThe ICA opinion was rendered by Acting Chief Judge Katherine Leonard and associate judges Keith Hiraoka and Clyde Wadsworth.", "source": {"uri": "staradvertiser.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Honolulu Star Advertiser"}, "authors": [{"uri": "leila_fujimori@staradvertiser.com", "name": "Leila Fujimori", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Institute_of_Contemporary_Arts", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Institute of Contemporary Arts"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Circuit_court", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Circuit court"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/K\u0101hala,_Hawaii", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "K\u0101hala, Hawaii"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "K\u0101hala, Hawaii"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Motion_(legal)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Motion (legal)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prosecutorial_misconduct", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Prosecutorial misconduct"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Closing_argument", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Closing argument"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Honolulu_Star-Advertiser", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Honolulu Star-Advertiser"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Remand_(court_procedure)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Remand (court procedure)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indictment", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Indictment"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lawyer", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Lawyer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Probable_cause", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Probable cause"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supreme_Court_of_Hawaii", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Supreme Court of Hawaii"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Police_lineup", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Police lineup"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Attempted_murder", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Attempted murder"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Life_imprisonment", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Life imprisonment"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prosecutor", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Prosecutor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parole", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Parole"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_media", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Social media"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reasonable_doubt", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Reasonable doubt"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Search_and_seizure", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Search and seizure"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constitutionality", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Constitutionality"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Closed-circuit_television", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Closed-circuit television"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adidas", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Adidas"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Crime_and_Justice", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Crime and Justice", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Murder", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Murder", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Trials", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Trials", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Law/Courts", "label": "dmoz/Society/Law/Courts", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Law", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Law", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://www.staradvertiser.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/web1_20220714_brk_ewi01.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9549791", "eventUri": "eng-9549791", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-04-30", "textStart": 131, "textEnd": 139}, {"amb": false, "date": "2020-07-08", "textStart": 227, "textEnd": 239}], "sentiment": -0.2470588235294118, "wgt": 107, "relevance": 1}

And now that the dust has settled a bit, it turns out the trial is not off the table before the election. Is this development good news? No. Good news would have been if the appeals court had declined to hear the appeal at all. But as former prosecutor Glenn Kirschner explains, the trial judge has already made clear that he'll keep the pretrial proceedings going during any appeal.\n\nSo if the Georgia Court of Appeals hears Trump's request and rules against him in fairly swift fashion, the trial can begin at that point.

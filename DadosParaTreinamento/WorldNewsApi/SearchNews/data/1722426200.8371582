In April, Walsall's former council leader Cllr Mike Bird slammed Pleck for the huge amount of rubbish that gets 'dumped' there. Cllr Bird, who stepped down as Walsall Council leader earlier this month, was speaking in response to fly-tipping concerns alongside crime worries in the nearby estates of Caldmore and Palfrey amid claims they had been 'forgotten' by authorities. Cllr Bird said: \"(These areas) haven't been forgotten by the authorities, they've been forgotten by the people who live there, who seem to want to live in that kind of environment which many people don't enjoy. But it is the minority of people that make it difficult for the majority. \"Pleck is one of the worst areas for rubbish that I have ever seen. And that now is closely followed by Caldmore and Palfrey. They haven't been forgotten, they're on the top of our list every day for fly-tipping.\" READ MORE: I visited 'dirty estate' where people are 'forgotten' but told they cause the problems BlackCountryLive paid a visit to Pleck In June to see what residents made of the issue. During a drive around the estate on a weekday lunchtime, we found no visible signs of fly-tipping save for a mattress near a pub and a number of bin bags dumped by a lamppost next to Pleck Library. A man who wished to remain anonymous said: \"It's really bad, rubbish gets tipped everywhere. You've come on a day when it's good. The problem has been going on for over a year now.\" A woman called Asia said: \"It's not too bad around here but near the lake, near Pepe's, it's quite bad. Also the town centre itself.\" The woman said people who use a traveller transit camp in Pleck sometimes \"let off fireworks in the night\". A 34-year-old dad, who was a father of two, said: \"Sometimes people throw drinks on the floor but I live next to a main road so I can't stop it - what can I do? When it's windy, the plastic blows into my front door. I also have to clean the car park outside regularly.\" He added that a neighbour \"causes trouble\" regularly and he has had to get the authorities involved. However, a 72-year-old resident called Mr Allen said: \"I wouldn't say rubbish gets dumped here. It gets dumped in certain places but the council are very good. \"They started dumping outside the library but they took the bin away and it doesn't happen now. It's just disgusting. \"Pleck is not as bad as people make out, I have lived here for 40 years. People say 'I wouldn't go down the Pleck at night' - but I have been down to fetch food. \"I get on with everybody. The only people who upset people are bad people like drug dealers, but I don't give a f*** what they do. If they want to do that, I just let them get on with it. \"The problem is people can be nosey, then they get their windows put through, it's always going to happen. On the whole though, if you look around, I can't see any rubbish. \"Don't get me wrong, I can take you to three of four places where it's a lot worse than this.\"", "summary": "A council leader said Pleck was the 'worst area for rubbish' he'd ever seen but some residents have leapt to its defence", "url": "https://www.birminghammail.co.uk/black-country/life-inside-towns-worst-area-29341500", "image": "https://i2-prod.birminghammail.co.uk/incoming/article29349093.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_JS336305416.jpg", "video": null, "publish_date": "2024-06-29 04:30:00", "author": "Jamie Brassington", "authors": ["Jamie Brassington"], "language": "en", "source_country": "gb", "sentiment": -0.621}

They have always tried to end the board and their properties, decried AIMIM chief and Hyderabad MP Asaduddin Owaisi. He was speaking ahead of the Centre's plans to introduce a bill in the Parliament that is aimed at curbing the powers of Wakf Board.\n\nAddressing a press conference here on Sunday, Owaisi took exception to the fact that such reports were coming to the media first and not Parliament, whose session is currently on. In doing so, the Centre is going against parliament's supremacy, he said.\n\nReferring to media reports about the proposed amendments, establishment and composition of the Wakf Board Act, Owaisi said that the Union government wants to take away the autonomy of the board, which is detrimental to freedom of religion.\n\n\"When any land becomes Wakf property, it should always remain Wakf land. The state's survey commissioner first fixes Wakf lands and then the state gives a Gazette notification. If it remains unchallenged for a year, it becomes Wakf property\", he explained and said that the government wants to make changes to this.\n\nIt may be noted the Centre is contemplating to bring a bill by making around 40 amendments to Wakf Act amid reports of massive increase in Wakf lands. Incidentally, Wakf boards are the third largest owners of land after the armed forces and railways and their share of land has doubled since 2009.\n\nAsaduddin said that Wakf tribunals, which deal with encroachments, will lose their identity once the amendments are introduced.\n\nThere are many dargahs in the country that the BJP-RSS combine claims are not dargahs and mosques. The executive wants to take powers of the judiciary, he added.\n\nIt may be noted that the Central government decided to make amendments after it got notices from the Delhi High Court last year about 123 properties in the national capital that are being unlawfully claimed as Wakf properties.", "source": {"uri": "deccanchronicle.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Deccan Chronicle"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asaduddin_Owaisi", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Asaduddin Owaisi"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Waqf", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Waqf"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyderabad", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Hyderabad"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Hyderabad"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parliament_of_India", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Parliament of India"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Member_of_parliament", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Member of parliament"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/All_India_Majlis-e-Ittehadul_Muslimeen", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "All India Majlis-e-Ittehadul Muslimeen"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rashtriya_Swayamsevak_Sangh", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hindutva", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Hindutva"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bharatiya_Janata_Party", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Bharatiya Janata Party"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autonomy", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Autonomy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Freedom_of_religion", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Freedom of religion"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Government_of_India", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Government of India"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dargah", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Dargah"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Delhi_High_Court", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Delhi High Court"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mosque", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Mosque"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Judiciary", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Judiciary"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Intellectual_Property", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Intellectual Property", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Government_Operations", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Government Operations", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Property_Rights", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Property Rights", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Work/Whistleblowing", "label": "dmoz/Society/Work/Whistleblowing", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 99}], "image": "https://www.deccanchronicle.com/h-upload/2024/08/04/1828835-screenshot2024-08-05at00-30-057asaduddinowaisiasadowaisix.webp", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9790736", "eventUri": "eng-9790736", "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Hyderabad"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.0980392156862746, "wgt": 232, "relevance": 1}

There are 30 Wakf boards in the country.\n\nBill to provide STs representation in Goa Assembly introduced in Lok Sabha\n\nThe sources on August 4 pointed out that the revenue generated by all Wakf properties is estimated at \u20b9 200 crore per annum. \"This is not in sync with the number of properties such bodies have,\" they said.\n\n\"The government is all set to bring a bill in Parliament to amend the 1995 law governing the Wakf boards to ensure more accountability and transparency in their functioning and mandatory inclusion of women in these bodies,\" sources said on August 4. They claimed that the move comes in the backdrop of demands from within the Muslim community.\n\nSamajwadi Party (SP) chief Akhilesh Yadav said his party will oppose the Centre's move to bring a bill in Parliament to amend the 1995 law governing Wakf boards, and accused the BJP of trying to snatch the rights of Muslims.\n\n\"We will be against it (Wakf Act amendment bill),\" Mr. Yadav told reporters when asked about the proposed amendment \"BJP's only work is to divide Hindus and Muslims, snatch the rights of Muslim brothers and work on the manner in which to snatch the rights given to them in the Constitution,\" he said after paying tributes to late MP and party leader Janeshwar Mishra on his birth anniversary in Lucknow.\n\nAny change in Wakf Act will not be tolerated, says Muslim Personal Law Board\n\nIndian Union Muslim League's (IUML) E.T. Mohammed Basheer said the move on the part of the government is ill-intentioned.\n\nA committee was appointed under K Rahman Khan and the BJP wanted to have a grip on the Wakf properties. They want to take custody of the Wakf properties.\n\n\"If such a legislation comes, we will very strongly oppose it. We will also speak with like-minded parties,\" he told reporters outside Parliament. \"If the government goes ahead with the bill, it must be prepared for strong opposition,\" Mr. Basheer added.\n\nShiv Sena (UBT) MP Priyanka Chaturvedi alleged that the BJP-led government wants to run away from the discussion on the Budget and, therefore, they have come up with the Wakf issue. \"Until it is tabled in Parliament, I would not like to comment,\" she added.\n\nProposed amendments to Waqf Act are intended to rob Muslims of Waqf Properties, violation of freedom of religion: Owaisi BJP believes in \"divisive politics\", says Amra Ram\n\nCPI(M) MP Amra Ram said the BJP believes in \"divisive politics\" and instead of strengthening Wakf boards, they are trying to interfere with them. \"Instead of providing education and employment to the minorities, they have always attacked their rights. We condemn this. If they continue with this divisive rhetoric, we showed them a trailer in 2024 and will now show them the full movie,\" he said.\n\nCPI(ML) MP Sudama Prasad said the BJP-led government's only intention is to promote a divisive agenda. \"Bring a bill to deal with unemployment. But they are 24X7 only looking at divisive agenda like mandir-masjid and Hindustan-Pakistan,\" he said.\n\nAsked about the talk of the bill on the Wakf Act, JMM's Mahua Maji said a one-sided view should not be taken and if any amendments are to be made, the government should listen to all sides. Asked about the issue, BJP MP Trivendra Singh Rawat said: \"it is a good thing if shortcomings in the Wakf Act are being removed.\"\n\n\"I have experienced it myself that there are intense internal conflicts in the Wakf boards and their properties are being misused. Those who are powerful in the Muslim community are misusing the properties,\" he told reporters outside Parliament.\n\nSpeaking on the issue, BJP MP Sanjay Jaiswal said the Modi government runs on transparency and only those \"who are scamsters\" can object to transparency.\n\nSamajwadi Party MP from Faizabad, Awadhesh Prasad, said: \"the party will analyse with what intentions the bill is being brought and what its contents are, and will then comment on it accordingly.\" SP MP Zia ur Rahman Barq said: \"whenever the NDA government brings a bill, it gives the reason that it is for the benefit of the community.\"\n\nSpend more on health infrastructure: Union Health Minister to States\n\n\"I want to ask them, was the farm bills in the interests of farmers? If their intention was clear, they should have spoken to the intellectuals of the community. But their intentions are not right and they want to take control of the Wakf boards and suppress the Muslim community,\" he said.\n\nAIMIM president Asaduddin Owaisi on August 4 had alleged that the NDA government wants to take away the autonomy of the Wakf Board. The BJP has been against the Wakf boards and Wakf properties \"from the beginning\" and it has made attempts to finish Wakf properties and Wakf Board according to its \"Hindutva agenda\", he had claimed.\n\nThe All India Muslim Personal Law Board (AIMPLB) on August 4 said any interference with the legal status and the powers of the Wakf boards will not be tolerated. AIMPLB urged allies of the NDA and opposition parties to \"completely reject any such move\" and not allow such amendments to be passed in Parliament.\n\nAIMPLB spokesperson S.Q.R. Ilyas said the board appeals to all Muslims and their religious and Milli organisations to unite against this \"malicious act of the government\".\"The board will take all kinds of legal and

There have been allegations too of the Wakf properties being rented out or even sold for non-Wakf purposes.\n\nThe Wakf properties are protected by the Constitution of India and Shariat Application Act, 1937.\n\n\"The government cannot make any amendment that would alter the nature and status of these properties,\" Mr. Ilyas said. \"In all the decisions taken by the Modi government regarding Muslims, something has been taken away from them and nothing has been given, whether it is the closure of Maulana Azad Foundation or restricting minority scholarship or triple talaq.\"\n\nHe said this issue would not be restricted to Muslims only. \"After wielding the axe on Wakf properties, it is feared that the next number may be the endowments of Sikhs and Christians and then on the Maths and other religious properties of Hindus,\" Mr. Ilyas feared. He said Muslims would never accept any amendment to the Wakf Act.\n\nHe appealed to the allies of the NDA and Opposition parties to reject any proposed changes and make sure the Bill is not passed by Parliament. He asked the Muslim community too \"to unite against this malicious act of the government\".\n\nRead Comments", "source": {"uri": "thehindu.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Hindu"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Waqf", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Waqf"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muslims", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Muslims"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/All_India_Muslim_Personal_Law_Board", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "All India Muslim Personal Law Board"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Government_of_India", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Government of India"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dargah", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Dargah"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Freedom_of_religion", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Freedom of religion"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parliament_of_the_United_Kingdom", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Parliament of the United Kingdom"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mosque", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Mosque"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Democratic_Alliance", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "National Democratic Alliance"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sikhs", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Sikhs"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christians", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Christians"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hindus", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Hindus"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parliamentary_opposition", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Parliamentary opposition"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Divorce_in_Islam", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Divorce in Islam"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constitution_of_India", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Constitution of India"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ummah", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Ummah"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sharia", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Sharia"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Religion_and_Spirituality/Islam", "label": "dmoz/Society/Religion and Spirituality/Islam", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Intellectual_Property", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Intellectual Property", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Relationships/Alternative_Lifestyles", "label": "dmoz/Society/Relationships/Alternative Lifestyles", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Property_Rights", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Property Rights", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Church-State_Relations", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Church-State Relations", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 90}], "image": "https://th-i.thgim.com/public/incoming/rtjvk2/article67047031.ece/alternates/LANDSCAPE_1200/SQRIlyas.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9790736", "eventUri": "eng-9790736", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.2156862745098038, "wgt": 210, "relevance": 1}

While the Charity Commissioner has jurisdiction over public trusts registered under the Bombay Public Trust Act, the 1995 Wakf Act transferred all Muslim religious endowments to the Wakf Board. Many Muslim trusts have contested the transfer, claiming they are still under the jurisdiction of the Charity Commissioner.\n\nThe Haji Ismail Haji Habib Musafirkhana building, with a mosque on the ground floor, is part of the 16.5-acre Bhendi Bazaar redevelopment project being undertaken by the SBUT set up by the Dawoodi Bohra community. Many buildings in the development, like the Musafirkhana, were owned by other Muslim sects. The project involves redeveloping around 250 buildings with 3200 tenements and 1250 shops and converting the area into a cluster of 11 multi-storeyed buildings with open spaces and facilities like renewable electricity. SBUT said that 'vested interests' were raising the issue. \"The dispute over the Musafirkhana Trust Building's status as a Waqf property was never raised before 2009 when the project was launched. It was for the first time raised by a few tenants in 2019,\" said the SBUT spokesperson.\n\nThe complaint by Shuiab Khatib, a trustee of Jama Masjid, one of the most important mosques in the city, has said that the Haji Ismail Haji Habib Musafirkhana building is certified as a Wakf property by the Chief Executive Officer of Maharashtra State Board of Wakfs. The complaint says that in 2021, a suit was filed by the Wakf Board in the Wakf Tribunal for setting aside the sale deed between SBUT and the Musafirkhana trust. Khatib's application says that SBUT has been denying the status, instead claiming it is a public trust governed by the Bombay Public Trust Act.\n\nKhatib said that the mosque features a placard that shows that the property was dedicated in the 1280 Islamic year as a Musafirkhana for Hajis traveling on pilgrimage, thus making the property 166 years old. It is contended that the property was listed as a Wakf endowment in a 1944 Gazette and documents suggest that the trustees endorsed this inclusion. Later properties like the Musafirkhana that were registered under the old Musalman Waqf Act, of 1923 were registered under the Bombay Public Trust Act, with the Charity Commissioner getting the jurisdiction over the trusts. After the Wakf Act was passed, Muslim trusts were transferred to the Wakf Board. The facts make it clear that the subject Trust is a Wakf and an attempt to deprive the beneficiaries of its benefits by powerful and influential organisations such as SBUT.\n\nSBUT said that the matter was escalated to the Supreme Court and on May 17, 2024, the court directed all parties to present their case to the Wakf Board which will determine whether the building is indeed a Waqf property. The decision is to be made within 12 weeks from the date of the court's order.\n\n\"The Waqf Board has already begun the hearings, with the first session held on July 24, 2024, and we are confident that the Board will carry out its responsibilities fairly and impartially as directed by the Hon'ble Supreme Court,\" the SBUT spokesperson added.\n\nA complaint filed with the Wakf Board has called for an inquiry into the transfer of the Musafirkhana building and an attached mosque to India's largest urban renewal scheme in Bhendi Bazar.\n\nThe complaint has asked for an investigation into the permission granted by the Charity Commissioner to allow the Haji Ismail Haji Habib Musafirkhana Trust to transfer the property to the Saifee Burhani Upliftment Trust (SBUT), which is building the 16.5-acre Bhendi Bazaar redevelopment project.\n\nThe complaint says that the building is a Wakf property or a Muslim religious endowment, making the approval granted by the Charity Commissioner 'null and void'.

The decision is to be made within 12 weeks from the date of the court's order.\n\n\"The Waqf Board has already begun the hearings, with the first session held on July 24, 2024, and we are confident that the Board will carry out its responsibilities fairly and impartially as directed by the Hon'ble Supreme Court,\" the SBUT spokesperson added.", "source": {"uri": "freepressjournal.in", "dataType": "news", "title": "Free Press Journal"}, "authors": [{"uri": "complaint_filed@freepressjournal.in", "name": "Complaint Filed", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muslims", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Muslims"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bhendi_Bazaar", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Bhendi Bazaar"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charity_Commission_for_England_and_Wales", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Charity Commission for England and Wales"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Khatib", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Khatib"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Waqf", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Waqf"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hajj", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Hajj"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jurisdiction", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Jurisdiction"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mosque", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Mosque"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trust_law", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Trust law"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mumbai", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Mumbai"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Mumbai"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Musafirkhana", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Musafirkhana"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Musafirkhana"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saifee_Burhani_Upliftment_Trust", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Saifee Burhani Upliftment Trust"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Financial_endowment", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Financial endowment"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Urban_renewal", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Urban renewal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/India", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "India"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jama_Masjid,_Delhi", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Jama Masjid, Delhi"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sect", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Sect"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dawoodi_Bohra", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Dawoodi Bohra"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trustee", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Trustee"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Renewable_energy", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Renewable energy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hijri_year", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Hijri year"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supreme_Court_of_India", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Supreme Court of India"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chief_executive_officer", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Chief executive officer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maharashtra", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Maharashtra"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Maharashtra"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Court_order", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Court order"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Science/Environment/Organizations", "label": "dmoz/Science/Environment/Organizations", "wgt": 16}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Construction_and_Maintenance/Building_Types", "label": "dmoz/Business/Construction and Maintenance/Building Types", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Real_Estate", "label": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Real Estate", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Architecture/Preservation", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Architecture/Preservation", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Software/Build_Management", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Software/Build Management", "wgt": 18}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 47}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 50}], "image": "https://media.assettype.com/freepressjournal/2024-08/b7d90394-e4ff-41df-8791-7e4c1cf6863d/Untitled design -

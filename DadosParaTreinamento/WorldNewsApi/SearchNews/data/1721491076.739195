{"id": 237083954, "title": "CNN Wants to Mute Trump at Its Debate. Good Luck With That", "text": "There are a few events in every presidential campaign that matter. The upcoming presidential debate between Joe Biden and Donald Trump\u2014just over a week from now\u2014will likely be one such moment. But who is likely to benefit from the clash? To a certain degree, victory is contingent on the rules of the debate (CNN has announced their rules, which have been agreed on by both campaigns). Based on what I\u2019m seeing, the deck is stacked in Biden\u2019s favor. Let\u2019s start with what might be the most important change: \u201cMicrophones will be muted throughout the debate except for the candidate whose turn it is to speak.\u201d It\u2019s easy to imagine that constant interruptions could cause Biden to lose his train of thought amid the chaos, thereby creating a \u201csenior moment\u201d that would reinforce the narrative that says he\u2019s too old for a second term. On the other hand, during the first presidential debate in 2020, Trump\u2019s attempt to exasperate Biden backfired, resulting in Biden\u2019s best line of the night: \u201cWill you shut up, man?\u201d A muted mic would have deprived Biden of that zinger. Still, the first rule of this debate probably has to be \u201cdo no harm.\u201d And the muted mic decree seems very likely to reduce the risk for Biden. Couple that with Trump and his minions unwisely downplaying Biden\u2019s cognitive ability, and Biden could win the expectations game merely by showing up and not drooling on himself. The other important CNN debate rule is that there will be no studio audience. Even if Trump were not permitted to stack the audience with supporters (as he did during last year\u2019s controversial CNN town hall), Trump disproportionately benefits from a live audience. \u201cTrump feeds off the crowd, they give him life,\u201d one Biden adviser told Politico. \u201cWe wanted to take that away.\u201d They did. Again, this rule seems almost guaranteed to aid Biden. This is not to say that the rule change is unfair or that studio audiences should be allowed. One could argue that modern political debates have become \u201cTV shows\u201d that are too focused on entertaining us as consumers, rather than feeding us as citizens. Regardless, genuinely restoring the intellectual grandeur of presidential debates would require much broader reforms than those instituted by CNN. Instead, CNN\u2019s rules simply seem narrowly tailored to squash a repeat of Donald Trump\u2019s behavior during the first 2020 debate. Which is why it\u2019s so curious that Trump has allowed Biden and CNN to set these particular parameters. (Note: Fox News\u2019 Sean Hannity might be ahead of the curve on recognizing this; Hannity recently floated the idea that Trump should \u201cpass on the debate\u201d until he\u2019s the official nominee.) Having been disadvantaged by the rules, the two most pertinent remaining questions may be: Will CNN enforce the rules\u2014and what happens if Trump tries to break them? If CNN fails to enforce the rules, it will be a major blow to Team Biden. After all, Biden decided to forgo having the Commission on Presidential Debates sponsor the debate precisely because it \u201cwas unable or unwilling to enforce the rules in the 2020 debates,\u201d resulting in \u201cnoisy spectacles of approval or jeering.\u201d The good news is that CNN\u2019s rules seem both simple and easy to implement. Microphones can easily be muted when it\u2019s the other candidate\u2019s turn, and there won\u2019t be an audience to break any \u201cno applause\u201d rules that CNN might otherwise have requested of a live audience. Now, it\u2019s possible that Trump will still attempt to interrupt Biden, even after his microphone has been cut. But the risk-reward ratio for Trump doing so is not great. To be sure, Trump is Harry Houdini, but it\u2019s hard to imagine how he will escape these debate rules. At this point, you might wonder why Trump\u2019s team agreed to these rules. To be honest, I\u2019m not sure. We may look back and say that Trump lost the debate (and thus, the election) back in May, when the contours of the rules were established. That was the moment that Joe Biden used Donald Trump\u2019s debate taunts (\u201canywhere, any time, any place\u201d) as an opportunity to set some key parameters and box Trump into an unfavorable position. Biden seized the initiative and picked the timing (much earlier than most General Election debates). Biden picked the number of debates (just two, plus a vice presidential debate). And Biden was first to accept CNN\u2019s invitation to host the debate, and CNN set the rules. Debates are complex and dynamic, and it is impossible to predict which side will actually benefit most from the rules (you can\u2019t stop Trump, you can only hope to contain him). But if most battles are won before they are fought, Team Biden got everything they could have wanted. Forgive me for re-setting the expectations, but this is now Joe Biden\u2019s debate to lose.", "summary": "<figure><img src=\"https://img.thedailybeast.com/image/upload/c_crop,d_placeholder_euli9k,h_1688,w_3000,x_0,y_0/dpr_2.0/c_limit,w_585/fl_lossy,q_auto/240617-CNN-trump-mute-tease_pyxtwu\"/><figcaption>Animated GIF by Thomas Levinson/The Daily Beast/Getty</figcaption></figure><p>There are a few events in every presidential campaign that matter.

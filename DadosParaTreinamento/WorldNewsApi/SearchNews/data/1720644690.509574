The public hearing drew stakeholders from various sectors of the economy, including agriculture and education.

The Deputy spokesman of the House of Representatives stated that the bill was a significant step towards transforming the country's agricultural sector and unlocking its full potential. According to the lawmaker, \"Benue State is indeed the food basket of the nation but what many don't know is that my federal constituency produces a bulk of that food. \"Most of the research institutes in the country have travelled to Agila, in particular for their fieldwork. With this institution, I believe the Federal Government would sustain what we have been doing for this nation. We will continue to feed the nation and in turn, my people will benefit\". The Chairman of the Technical Committee for the institution, Professor Hyacinth Aboh, also noted that the bill was timely, stressing that the Agila community is peaceful. According to him, about 90 per cent of people residing in the community are farmers, stressing that they \"engage in agriculture because the land is very fertile\".

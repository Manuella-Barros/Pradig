A senior PSNI officer said information from the public is vital in helping officers tackle drugs issues. Detective Chief Inspector Mullan said: \u201cAs a service we are continually working hard to prevent and detect as much drug-related activity as possible and yesterday's seizure is an example of effective community-based policing at its best. \"These efforts are in keeping with Operation Dealbreaker, our organisational commitment to tackle every aspect of drug misuse across Northern Ireland, and that includes its harrowing impact on the lives and relationships of local people. There is no such thing as a \u2018safe\u2019 drug. \"Information from the public is key in helping us to identify the people and places involved in the drugs trade and I would appeal to anyone with any information about suspected drug production or dealing in their area to call the non-emergency number 101 or submit information online via www.psni.police.uk/makeareport.\u201d", "summary": "Police have uncovered what they have described as \u2018a sophisticated cannabis factory\u2019 in north Belfast.", "url": "https://www.northernirelandworld.com/news/crime/north-belfast-sophisticated-cannabis-factory-discovered-and-drugs-worth-ps600000-seized-4658415", "image": "https://www.northernirelandworld.com/webimg/b25lY21zOmE5MmFmODFjLWI4ZGYtNGM3ZS04Nzc0LTk5MTZlN2Q5ODgyNDowYmYxMTYzYy0yOTg0LTRiZTktYjZlNy0zNGY1MDliNzRlYjE=.jpg?width=1200&enable=upscale", "video": null, "publish_date": "2024-06-08 14:51:56", "author": "Valerie Martin", "authors": ["Valerie Martin"], "language": "en", "source_country": "gb", "sentiment": 0.23}

Long, but worthwhile promising review: \"Features to love: The cotton fabric is sturdy and breathable. I never feel stuck to it the way I do in a nylon hammock. The setup/take down is super easy, and the frame is very sturdy \u2014 we have definitely put 300-plus pounds in it. The ability to raise and lower the hammock with the different hook positions might be the best feature. I have bad knees and like to get into the hammock from a higher position...no problem. My kids like it lower so they can reach the ground to swing it...no problem. It works great as a traditional hammock to lie in. It works as a 'swing' to sit on. It has enough fabric that you can cover up if you're cold or want to block out light or bugs. We have accidentally left it out in the rain several times, and it dries great, hasn't faded from the sun, hasn't had any mold, and hasn't developed any weird smell. Things not to love: Nothing! This is a great hammock. It may not be as portable as those little nylon hammocks, but if this is for your yard and not for camping, this is hard to beat.\" \u2014Mary Get it from Amazon for $63.99+ (available in a variety of colors/patterns).", "summary": "<h1>These graduated with a 4.0.</h1><p><img src=\"https://img.buzzfeed.com/buzzfeed-static/static/2024-06/18/16/campaign_images/56322ae4c789/these-29-products-are-totally-genius-so-prepare-t-5-497-1718728247-0_dblbig.jpg\" /></p><hr /><p><a href=\"https://www.buzzfeed.com/jonathanmazzei/these-products-are-totally-genius-so-prepare-to-be\">View Entire Post &rsaquo;</a></p>", "url": "https://www.buzzfeed.com/jonathanmazzei/these-products-are-totally-genius-so-prepare-to-be", "image": "https://img.buzzfeed.com/buzzfeed-static/static/2024-06/18/16/campaign_images/56322ae4c789/these-29-products-are-totally-genius-so-prepare-t-5-497-1718728247-0_dblbig.jpg?resize=1200:*", "video": null, "publish_date": "2024-06-29 00:01:02", "author": "https://www.buzzfeed.com/about,Jonathan Mazzei", "authors": ["https://www.buzzfeed.com/about", "Jonathan Mazzei"], "language": "en", "catgory": "politics", "source_country": "US", "sentiment": 0.266}

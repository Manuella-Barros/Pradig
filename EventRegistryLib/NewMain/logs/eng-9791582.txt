The aircraft will be parked near the Indian Air Force's C-17 and C-130J Super Hercules aircraft hangars, as per ANI.\n\nShe has reportedly sought asylum from the UK government.\n\nIt is not immediately clear whether the same military transport aircraft will take her beyond India or she will travel to London in a different plane.\n\nIndia decided to provide a safe passage through the Indian airspace to Hasina's aircraft following a request from Dhaka, the sources cited above told PTI. New Delhi's security agencies were monitoring the aircraft since it was 10 kilometres from the Indian border with Bangladesh and was heading towards Delhi.\n\nBBC Bangla initially reported that the embattled prime minister's helicopter was heading to Tripura's capital, Agartala.\n\nFlight AJAX1431 is a Lockheed C-130J Hercules military transport aircraft flown by the Bangladesh Air Force, according to India Today.\n\nThe military aircraft, with four engines, is a turboprop known for its reliability and efficiency.\n\nSearch and rescue, special operations, and tactical airlift are just a few of the many tasks for which it is frequently employed.\n\nRecently, the Bangladesh Air Force modernised its C-130J Super Hercules fleet by acquiring the aircraft from the UK Defence Ministry, the report said.\n\nThe modernised version has new engines, a contemporary flight deck, and cutting-edge systems, making it a reliable option for important missions.\n\nWhy did Hasina resign?\n\nBangladesh has been engulfed by protests and violence after student protests last month against reservation quotas in government jobs escalated into a campaign for the ouster of Hasina, who won a fourth straight term in January in an election boycotted by the opposition.\n\nAbout 300 people have been killed so far and thousands injured in the violence.\n\nThe role of the country's army in tackling the violence had come into focus with a group of retired military officers urging Hasina to withdraw troops from the streets and undertake \"political initiatives\" to resolve the crisis. Critics of Hasina, along with human rights groups, have accused her government of using excessive force against protesters, a charge she and her ministers deny.\n\nHasina had said that \"those who are carrying out violence are not students but terrorists who are out to destabilise the nation.\"\n\nHowever, soon after her resignation, television visuals showed thousands of people pouring into the streets of the capital Dhaka in jubilation and shouting slogans.\n\nAs she fled, people stormed her residence, taking furniture and pulling food from the refrigerators.\n\nCrowds thronged the drawing rooms of the residence, and some people could be seen carrying away televisions, chairs and tables from what was one of the most protected buildings in the country.\n\n\"She has fled the country, fled the country,\" some shouted.\n\nWhat's next?\n\nArmy chief General Waker-Uz-Zaman announced Hasina's resignation in a televised address to the nation and said an interim government would be formed.\n\nPrime Minister Sheikh Hasina's departure threatens to create even more instability in the nation on India's border already dealing with a series of crises, from high unemployment and corruption to climate change.\n\nArmy chief Zaman said he had held \"fruitful\" talks with leaders of all major political parties he had \"invited\" and would soon meet President Mohammed Shahabuddin to discuss the way ahead.\n\n\"The country is going through a revolutionary period,\" said Zaman, 58, who took over as army chief only on June 23.\n\n\"I promise you all, we will bring justice to all the murders and injustice.

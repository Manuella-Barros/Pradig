Once the adrenaline wore off, he started to feel a lot of pain.\n\n\"I said, 'Hey man, like, I really don't want to die right now,'\" he said he told his captain. \"Like, this ain't it.\"\n\nHe went to a nearby clinic for \"damage control\" -- where they stitched up the wound to stop the bleeding -- before traveling to St. Mary's Medical Center for surgery, according to Dr. Robert Borrego, a trauma surgeon at the hospital.\n\nJudging by the circumference of the bite wound, Borrego estimated that the shark that bit Wakeman was at least 7 feet. The shark punctured the kneecap and just missed a nearby artery, Borrego said.\n\nThe team worked to clear out the wound due to the risk of infection and repaired the joint injury, Borrego said. Wakeman is expected to make a full recovery, he said.\n\n\"The fact that there's 20 sharks in there and you were able to get out of there and still have a leg is amazing,\" Borrego, who said he treats several shark bite victims a year, told reporters. \"I think that is it almost to say how quickly he reacted and that he didn't panic.\"\n\nWakeman's parents said they knew there was always a risk their son could get bitten by a shark since he works on the water, but they were still shocked to get the news when it happened.\n\n\"I know what they're capable of,\" his father, Rufus Wakeman, a boat captain, told reporters. \"I have several friends who have been bitten and it's a shocking revelation when you see some of the wounds these people have had to endure and now it's my son.

There wasn't a second of doubt in my mind.\"\n\nWakeman said there wasn't time for his life to flash before his eyes.\n\n\"So it wasn't like I was really scared at that moment,\" he said. \"I was just, I knew what was happening. So in my head I just I knew how to get out as quick as possible.\"\n\nWakeman said the first shark pulled him under before letting go.\n\n\"I got really lucky he didn't head shake or hold on for a while,\" he said. \"And then that's when I was able to get back up to the surface.\"\n\nThat was when the second shark moved in and bit him on the shoulder.\n\nWakeman said he did not feel pain at first, put he did feel \"a lot of pressure.\"\n\n\"The one on my shoulder felt like a punch,\" he said. \"You really don't feel the teeth going in.\"\n\nDespite his injuries, Wakeman was able to drag himself back into the boat.\n\n\"I had so much adrenaline going through my body that it was like a fight or flight kind of thing,\" he said. \"I got back into the boat and kind of assessed what happened and looked at my leg. It wasn't really bleeding yet. It was kind of, you know, all mangled. \"\n\nAnd right about then, Wakeman said, he started screaming for help. He said his captain ran over, applied a tourniquet, and elevated his leg.\n\nThe pain, he said, didn't kick in until they started rolling him in a wheelbarrow to the van to get him to a clinic.\n\n\"It was bleeding a lot at that point and adrenaline sort of wearing off a little bit and then we got into the van,\" he said. \"And when I was in the van, they took gauze. And I remember my captain, he looked at me and he was like, 'Hey, man, this is gonna hurt really bad.' And I was like, 'You know, whatever.'\"\n\nThat, Wakeman said, was when he blacked out from the pain.\n\nWakeman was flown to Florida after the medics in the Bahamas \"sewed him up, you know, damage-control style,\" said Dr. Robert Borrego, who is the trauma medical director at St. Mary's.\n\nJudging by the size of the leg wound, Borrego said the young man was bitten by \"at least a seven-footer or an eight-foot shark.\"\n\n\"I've been dealing with this a lot and I've seen some people that have not done as well,\" said Borrego, who said he has treated numerous shark bite victims over the past three decades. \"And from hearing the story It shocks me that he was able to get out of that water.\"\n\nThe fact that Wakeman didn't lose a leg is \"amazing,\" Borrego added.\n\nWakeman is still on crutches and will need to do some rehab but should make a complete recovery, the doctor said.\n\nHis father, Rufus Wakeman, said he is especially grateful to the captain who applied the tourniquet and the fast work of the Bahamian medics who prevented his son from bleeding to death and saved his life.\n\n\"I have several friends who have been bitten and it's a shocking revelation when you see that,\" he said. \"Some of the wounds these people have had to endure. And now it's my son. It's our son.

He was attacked by one shark that grabbed and chomped on his leg.\n\n\"He grabbed my leg, the first shark did, and he pulled me underwater,\" he said.\n\nWakeman was able to grab part of the boat and lifted himself out of the water.\n\n\"Kinda scrambled for a second, got my surroundings in check and really realized what was going on,\" he said, \"and I got my left hand on the boat, and at that time, the other shark came and hit me on my right side of my right solder.\"\n\nHe was then attended by authorities in the Bahamas who tied a tourniquet on his wound to stop the bleeding and was flown to St. Mary's Medical Center in West Palm Beach.\n\nDoctors at the hospital were able to perform surgery, clean his wound and made sure that there was no damage to his kneecap.\n\nWakeman is currently on crutches and, doctors said, he is expected to make a full recover.\n\nDoctors also said he was very lucky he fell into the shark-infested water and was able to make it out alive.\n\nCopyright 2024 Sunbeam Television Corp.

(CBS12) -- A Treasure Coast family suddenly found themselves in a life or death situation after their 24-year-old son was attacked by sharks in the Bahamas.\n\nOn April 26th, 24-year-old Marlin Wakeman fell into the water at Flying Fish Marina in Long Island, Bahamas, and was immediately attacked.\n\nAs the Stuart native tried to climb back onto the boat, two seven-foot Caribbean Reef Sharks went after him.\n\nHe says the pain was so bad that he passed out.\n\n\"I was holding onto the covering board and he grabbed me, pulled my head underwater and then let go of me,\" he recalled. \"I got really lucky he didn't head shake or hold on for awhile and then, that's when I was able to get back up to the surface, get my hand back on the boat, that's when the other one tried to bite me.\"\n\nOthers on the boat finally dragged him on board. His parents found out what had happened as their son was being rushed to a local clinic.\n\n\"The call was, you can't really describe it. You go into shock mode but I just felt like a million little pieces all of the sudden,\" said Melynda Wakeman, Marlin's mom. \"Fortunately, he kept his cool, he didn't panic,\" added Rufus Wakeman, Marlin's dad. \"He realized he had to complete the task at hand, which is survival.\"\n\nAfter some quick work in the Bahamas, Marlin was flown to St. Mary's Medical Center, where Dr. Robert Borrego got him into an operating room.\n\nThere was a good amount of work to be done, but the patient came through just fine.\n\n\"From hearing the story, it shocks me that he was able to get out of that water\", remarked Dr. Robert Borrego, the Trauma Medical Director at St. Mary's. \"There were a lot of stitches. We took them out, the wounds are healing nicely. I would say in another two weeks, those scars will be all healedhis injuries should heal 100%.\"\n\nAs for Marlin, he's grateful to be in one piece, and is looking forward to getting back on the water as soon as he can.\n\n\"I just thought it was kind of funny how with all that, the one time I get bit by a shark was when I slip off a dock and fall in the water,\" he joked. \"Thankful I'm here to tell the story, but a pretty crazy experience.", "source": {"uri": "cbs12.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "WPEC"}, "authors": [{"uri": "dylan_huberman@cbs12.com", "name": "Dylan Huberman", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marlin", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Marlin"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shark", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Shark"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Treasure_Coast", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Treasure Coast"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caribbean", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Caribbean"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/West_Palm_Beach,_Florida", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "West Palm Beach, Florida"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "West Palm Beach, Florida"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Long_Island,_Bahamas", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Long Island, Bahamas"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Long Island, Bahamas"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "The Bahamas"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Bahamas", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "The Bahamas"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "The Bahamas"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/St._Mary's_Medical_Center_(Huntington)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "St. Mary's Medical Center (Huntington)"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Death/In_Memoriam", "label": "dmoz/Society/Death/In Memoriam", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Advice", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Advice", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://cbs12.com/resources/media/4e8c45bf-8cd4-4a74-bc39-03c7ed6e316d-large16x9_image0000012.jpeg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9554955", "eventUri": "eng-9554955", "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "West Palm Beach, Florida"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.09019607843137256, "wgt": 202, "relevance": 1}

The trauma surgeon estimated the shark to be about 7 feet (2 meters) long, based on the size of the bite mark.\n\nBorrego said he expects Wakeman to make a full recovery.", "source": {"uri": "ca.news.yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/West_Palm_Beach,_Florida", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "West Palm Beach, Florida"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "West Palm Beach, Florida"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shark", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Shark"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marina", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Marina"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Bahamas", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "The Bahamas"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "The Bahamas"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marlin", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Marlin"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fishing_vessel", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Fishing vessel"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Florida", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Florida"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Florida"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flying_fish", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Flying fish"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carrion", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Carrion"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Long_Island", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Long Island"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Long Island"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fish", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Fish"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caribbean_reef_shark", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Caribbean reef shark"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sea_captain", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Sea captain"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tourniquet", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Tourniquet"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patella", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Patella"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgeon", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Surgeon"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Injury", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Injury"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Associated_Press", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Associated Press"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artery", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Artery"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Surgery"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Outdoors/Fishing", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Outdoors/Fishing", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Pets/Fish_and_Aquaria", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Pets/Fish and Aquaria", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Pets/Fish", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Pets/Fish", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Science/Agriculture/Fisheries", "label": "dmoz/Science/Agriculture/Fisheries", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://s.yimg.com/cv/apiv2/social/images/yahoo_default_logo-1200x1200.png", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9554955", "eventUri": "eng-9554955", "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "West Palm Beach, Florida"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-04-26", "textStart": 484, "textEnd": 492}], "sentiment": -0.06666666666666665, "wgt": 452991258, "relevance": 2}], "totalResults": 7, "page": 1, "count": 1, "pages": 7}}}

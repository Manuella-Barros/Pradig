The Bolton-born boxing champion's multi-million pound project has been in the making for more than a decade but has faced severe delays as costs have spiralled. Mr Khan received planning permission for the wedding venue, which has been given the name of The Balmayna, in the Deane area of Bolton in 2013. But in the years that followed, it was repeatedly rocked by setbacks as costs rose to more than \u00a311m. Initial construction on the site was completed in 2015 but it has since been hit by delays and even damaged by a fire. Earlier this year, it was revealed that the lavish wedding venue was preparing for a 'grand opening' and was said to be taking bookings.

The audio clip using Eiswert's voice went viral and was swiftly condemned by the Baltimore County community.\n\nThe school was inundated with outraged calls and needed an increased police presence and additional counselors.\n\nMaryland Transportation Authority Police arrested Darien as he was boarding a plane to Houston. Law enforcement officers flagged Darien's bag for the way he packaged a gun in his checked luggage and discovered he had an active arrest warrant.\n\nBaltimore County Police Chief Robert McCullough said police intended to serve the warrant Thursday. He didn't know if Darien was trying to flee or had travel plans.\n\nDarien is also charged with theft, retaliating against a witness and stalking. He is being held with bond at the Baltimore County Detention Center. He doesn't have an attorney listed in online court records.\n\nScott Shellenberger, Baltimore County's state's attorney, said this is the first time his office has prosecuted a case related to artificial intelligence, and it's likely the first criminal case in the country. State lawmakers will need to update criminal statutes to include the new technology next legislative session, he said.\n\n\"In this particular case, we obviously had some statutes that were right on point, but we do in fact, need to take a look at some others,\" Shellenberger said at a Thursday news conference. \"[We] also need to take a broader look at how this technology can be used and abused to harm other people.\" He added that the charge of disrupting school activities only carries six months in jail.\n\nThe recording included offensive statements made about Black teachers, Black students' test scores and Jewish parents. Eiswert was removed from the school and required a police presence at his house due to online threats. He maintained his innocence through a union spokesperson, who did not respond to a request for comment.\n\nEiswert remains employed by Baltimore County Public Schools but will not return to Pikesville High this school year, Superintendent Myriam Rogers said at the news conference.\n\nBaltimore County Police wrote in a 17-page charging document that Eiswert initially believed Darien created the fake recording in retaliation for Eiswert investigating him for theft. Eiswert also believed Darien had a grievance over his contract not being renewed and Eiswert reprimanding him for firing a long-term coach without approval, he told police.\n\nIn the recording, a man's voice sounds like he's talking to someone named Kathy, whom many listeners interpreted to be Vice Principal Kathy Albert. She told police she never had the conversation in the clip.\n\nThe man's voice in the recording says he has to \"put up\" with \"ungrateful Black kids who can't test their way out of a paper bag\" and Black teachers who \"should have never been hired.\" The recording continues with the man saying he's \"sick of the inadequacies of these people\" and if he \"has to get one more complaint from one more Jew in this community, I'm going to join the other side.\"\n\nThree Pikesville High employees -- Darien and two physical education teachers who police said were friends with him -- received an email from an unfamiliar email address with the MP3 recording around 10 p.m. Jan. 16, about a half-hour before the clip went viral on social media, according to police.\n\nThe recording named one of the P.E. teachers as someone who shouldn't have been hired. When she received the email with the audio clip, she sent it to a student and emailed it to several media outlets, she told police. The student then \"rapidly spread the message around various social media outlets and throughout the school,\" police wrote.\n\nThe teacher told detectives she was having professional issues with Eiswert and was not renewing her contract to work at Pikesville High.\n\nDarien denied involvement in the recording or its release in an interview with detectives. He said he was unfamiliar with the email that sent the recording to him. Over two months, detectives subpoenaed documents from Google, AT&T and T-Mobile that led to an internet provider address registered to Darien's grandmother, police wrote in charging documents.\n\nThe recovery cell phone number associated with the Google account was registered to Darien, police wrote. The number has since been disabled. Detectives also consulted an FBI contractor and forensic analyst, who said the recording \"contained traces of AI-generated content with human editing after the fact,\" such as background noise for realism.\n\nA BCPS information technology employee searched Darien's access to the system's network and found that he used language tools and accessed OpenAI tools and Microsoft Bing Chat services that are similar to OpenAI three times between December and January 15, a day before the audio clip was released.\n\nA second expert opinion from a forensic analyst said the recording was manipulated with multiple recordings placed together, police wrote.\n\nRogers said the school system filed a recommendation to terminate Darien. School officials are investigating the two P.E. teachers, who are currently on leave. County Police Chief Robert McCulloh said the criminal investigation is ongoing.\n\nThe theft accusation entails Darien allegedly paying his roommate and a junior varsity coach $1,910 to assistant coach the girl's soccer team, but the roommate never did. An internal BCPS auditor confirmed that an unauthorized payment was made, in addition to a $4,420 unauthorized payment made for the roommate's boys basketball stipend.\n\nCindy Sexton, president of the Teacher's Association of Baltimore County, which represents athletic directors, said Darien is \"not in front of students\" as of Thursday and the union is waiting for the criminal investigation to unfold. TABCO and the National Education Association are troubled by AI being manipulated and used against educators, she said.\n\n\"As a society, we need to get in front of and get a handle on AI because of, unfortunately, situations like this are going to continue to happen,\" Sexton said. \"Our students are tech-savvy; lots of people are. It opens up a whole new world of concern for all of us. We all have our voices out there.\"", "source": {"uri": "delcotimes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Delaware County Daily Times"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

(Dilara Irem Sancar/Anadolu via Getty Images)\n\n(JTA) - A former athletic director of a Baltimore-area high school was arrested Thursday morning and charged with using artificial intelligence to fake antisemitic and racist comments supposedly made by the school's principal.\n\nThe case was part of a growing body of AI-generated impersonation incidents, which experts say is a newfound worry in a growing, barely regulated field of technology. This was an unusual instance of faking antisemitic comments in order to damage a public figure's reputation.\n\nBaltimore County police charged Dazhon Darien, formerly of Pikesville High School, with disrupting school activities. Authorities said he had used the school's network to access OpenAI software allowing him to fake a recording attributed to principal Eric Eiswert, according to the Baltimore Banner, a local nonprofit newsroom.\n\nIn the recording, a voice sounding like Eiswert says, \"If I have to get one more complaint from one more Jew in this community, I'm going to join the other side.\" The voice also made racist remarks about Black students. Pikesville is in the center of greater Baltimore's Jewish community.\n\nThe recording spread on social media in January and was also sent to at least three district teachers, including one who told police she forwarded it to a student knowing they would quickly spread it online. An email address linked to Darien sent the audio to various sources.\n\nSome in the community were quick to attribute the comments to Eiswert, who is white, alluding to a history of tension with minority communities. \"I am in no way surprised by his comments in this recording,\" Deray Mckesson, a prominent racial-justice activist from the Baltimore area who said he had had Eiswert as a high school teacher, wrote on the social network X in January. He called for Eiswert to \"be fired immediately\" and for his teaching license to \"be permanently revoked.\"\n\nSuperintendent Myriam Rogers said the comments were \"highly offensive and inappropriate statements about African American students, Pikesville High School staff, and Pikesville's Jewish community.\"\n\nBut Eiswert denied making the comments, and questions were soon raised about the voice's authenticity. Both the local authorities and the school district soon mounted investigations. Eiswert has not worked at the school since they began, although the district would not say if he was removed from his position.\n\nIn March, AI experts told local news the audio was most likely faked, citing its flat quality and lack of consistent breathing sounds.\n\n\"From the beginning of this incident, the recording seemed odd and suspicious,\" Howard Libit, executive director of the Baltimore Jewish Council, told the Jewish Telegraphic Agency Thursday.

Lloyd Fox / Baltimore Sun via Getty Images\n\nA Maryland high school teacher was arrested after he allegedly used artificial intelligence to create phony audio, planting racist and antisemitic words into the voice of his boss, officials said Thursday.\n\nDazhon Darien, a physical education teacher and athletic director at Pikesville High School, was accused of falsifying the voice of principal Eric Eiswert in January, authorities said.\n\nHe's been charged with disrupting school activities. An arrest warrant for Darien was signed by a judge Wednesday afternoon and a Baltimore County state's attorney spokesperson on Thursday confirmed the educator's arrest.\n\nEiswert was widely admonished when the viral audio seemed to capture him spewing hateful rhetoric, mocking Black and Jewish people.\n\nDarien and Eiswert had been at odds over \"work performance challenges\" with the suspect's contract possibly \"not being renewed next semester,\" according to the arrest warrant.\n\nThe voice initially believed to have been Eiswert's said Black students were unable to \"test their way out of a paper bag,\" according to the court document.\n\n\"The recording went on to make disparaging comments about Jewish individuals and two teachers ... who 'should have never been hired' at the school,\" the warrant said.\n\nEiswert has always insisted that recording, which had been sent to Darien and two other teachers the night of Jan. 16, was fake.\n\nThe audio spread quickly on social media and \"had profound repercussions,\" causing \"significant disruptions for the PHS staff and students,\" according to the arrest warrant.\n\nEiswert has been on paid administrative leave since the recording went viral.\n\nInvestigators linked the email TJFOUST9@gmail.com, used to send that audio, to an internet service provider registered to Darien's grandmother, according to the warrant.\n\nThe recovery phone number for that Google account was a 213 area code, registered to Darien, a Southern California native, police said.\n\nA forensic analyst, contracted by the FBI, also found that the recording \"contained traces of AI-generated content with human editing after the fact,\" the arrest warrant said.\n\nDarien was shown to have used the Baltimore County Public Schools' network to access OpenAI tools and Microsoft Bing Chat services on Dec. 18 and 19 and Jan. 15, a day before the audio clip was sent out, police said.\n\nDarien and family members of the suspect could not be immediately reached for comment Thursday.", "source": {"uri": "nbcnews.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "NBC News"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

The speaker goes on to gripe about \"ungrateful black kids who can't test their way out of a paper bag\" and how hard it is to make sure that these students meet their grade-level academic expectations.\n\n\"And if I have to get one more complaint from one more Jew in this community, I'm going to join the other side,\" the voice adds.\n\nAt one point, the speaker mentions Darien by his nickname, DJ, as an example of staff who \"should never have been hired.\"\n\n\"And don't let me get started on DJ! I'm going to drag his black ass out of here one way or another,\" the voice shouts.\n\nIn January, the clip was posted to a popular Instagram account covering crime in the community, prompting a Baltimore County Public Schools and Baltimore County Police investigation. Eiswert has not been working in the school since the probe's launch.\n\nThree teachers reportedly received the clip the night before it went viral. One of them said she had received an anonymous email containing the MP3 file around 10 p.m. on January 16, about half an hour prior to the video's posting, as well as a call from Darien and Shaena \"Shae\" Ravenell telling her to check her inbox. Ravenell told police she subsequently forwarded the email to members of the media, the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP), and a student's cell phone \"who she knew would rapidly spread the message around various social media outlets and throughout the school.\"\n\nRavenell, a health sciences teacher, who was also named in the audio, did not immediately mention receiving it from Darien, the school's former athletic director, until being confronted about his apparent involvement. Ravenell has not been criminally charged.\n\nDarien had allegedly accessed the school's network on multiple occasions to search for OpenAI tools and use Large Language Models, which are AI systems capable of generating human language that pull vast amounts of data from various sources on the Internet and produce \"conversational\" results. Darien was also connected to an email account that distributed the audio file.\n\nDetectives had subpoenaed documents from Google, AT&T, and T-Mobile, leading to an IP address registered to Darien's grandmother and a recovery cellphone number associated with Darien's Google account. An FBI forensic analyst was also consulted, who found \"traces of AI-generated content with human editing after the fact,\" such as background noise for realism.\n\nExperts in detecting deepfakes and simulations told The Baltimore Banner that there was overwhelming evidence pointing towards the clip being an AI creation: e.g. its flat tone, clean background sounds, and lack of consistent breaths or pauses.\n\nEiswert initially suspected Darien was responsible for the recording's creation and release because of a grievance over Darien's contract not being renewed. Darien was under fire for theft as the subject of an internal investigation initiated by Eiswert. Darien had authorized a nearly $2,000 payment to the school's junior varsity basketball coach, who also happened to be his roommate, under the pretense that he was an assistant girls' soccer coach, though he was not, the school administration said. Eiswert determined that Darien had illicitly submitted the payment to the school payroll system, thereby bypassing proper procedures.\n\nDarien was arrested Thursday and charged with disrupting school activities. Per prosecutors, Darien additionally faces charges of stalking, theft, and retaliating against a witness related to the illicit payments he allegedly sent to the school's athletics coach.\n\n\"The audio clip [...] had profound repercussions,\" reads the 17-page charging documents, according to The Baltimore Banner. The recording's circulation led to Eiswert's temporary removal from the school, triggered \"a wave of hate-filled messages,\" sparked numerous calls to the school, and caused \"significant disruption\" for PHS operations. The school's front desk staff was \"inundated\" with phone calls from concerned parents and \"disparaging\" remarks toward school staff and administrators.\n\nStaff did not feel safe, school leadership said, and officers had to be stationed at the school to address the safety concerns.\n\nThe flood of calls also prevented staff from fielding phone calls and interrupted other school-related functions.\n\nQuestions about the audio's authenticity quickly arose. Some believed that Eiswert was caught on an undercover recording making racist remarks behind closed doors and said he \"should be fired immediately\" with his Maryland teaching license \"permanently revoked\" while others, suspecting that the audio was manufactured, came to the defense of Eiswert's character.\n\nEiswert denied that he said those statements, saying the clip was created to damage his career and reputation. \"[T]hese thoughts are not what I believe in as both an educator and a person,\" Eiswert said in a statement shared with The Baltimore Banner.\n\nBilly Burke, head of the Council of Administrative & Supervisory Employee (CASE), which is the union representing Eiswert, was the only official to suggest the audio was fake. At a January school board meeting, the union leader said Eiswert needed police presence at his home because he and his family have been harassed and threatened as a result of the hate crime hoax.\n\nMeanwhile, in a message to the community, BCPS superintendent Myriam Rogers had called the comments in question \"deeply disturbing,\" \"highly offensive,\" and \"inappropriate,\" declaring that they \"do not reflect the core values of our school system.\"\n\nDarien and Ravenell have submitted their resignations, dated June 30, according to an April 16 school board document.", "source":

Darien's nickname, DJ, was among the names mentioned in the audio clips he allegedly faked.\n\nEiswert's voice, which police and AI experts believe was simulated, made disparaging comments toward Black students and the surrounding Jewish community, was widely circulated on social media.\n\nQuestions about the audio's authenticity quickly followed. Police wrote in charging documents that Darien had accessed the school's network on multiple occasions in December and January searching for OpenAI tools, and used \"Large Language Models\" that practice \"deep learning, which involves pulling in vast amounts of data from various sources on the internet, can recognize text inputted by the user, and produce conversational results.\" They also connected Darien to an email account that had distributed the recording.\n\nMany current and former students believed Eiswert was responsible for the offensive remarks, while former colleagues denounced the audio and defended Eiswert's character. Eiswert himself has denied making those comments and said the comments do not align with his views.\n\nThe audio, posted to the popular Instagram account murder_ink_bmore, prompted a Baltimore County Public Schools and Baltimore County Police investigation. Eiswert has not been working in the school since the investigation began.\n\nThe voice refers to \"ungrateful Black kids who can't test their way out of a paper bag\" and questions how hard it is to get those students to meet grade-level expectations. The speaker uses names of people who appear to be staff members and says they should not have been hired, and that he should get rid of another person \"one way or another.\"\n\n\"And if I have to get one more complaint from one more Jew in this community, I'm going to join the other side,\" the voice said.\n\nPolice say the clip was received by three teachers the night before it went viral. The first was Darien; a third said she received the email and then got a call from Darien and teacher Shaena Ravenell telling her to check her email. Ravenell told police that she had forwarded the email to a student's cell phone, \"who she knew would rapidly spread the message around various social media outlets and throughout the school,\" and also sent it to the media and the NAACP, police said.\n\nShe did not mention receiving it from Darien until confronted about his involvement. Ravenell has not been charged with a crime.\n\nSuperintendent Myriam Rogers at the time called the comments \"disturbing\" and \"highly offensive and inappropriate statements about African American students, Pikesville High School staff, and Pikesville's Jewish community.\"\n\nBilly Burke, head of the Council of Administrative & Supervisory Employee, the union that represents Eiswert, was the only official to suggest the audio was AI-generated.\n\nBurke said he was disappointed in the public's assumption of Eiswert's guilt. At a January school board meeting, he said the principal needed police presence at his home because he and his family have been harassed and threatened. Burke had also received harassing emails, he said at the time.\n\nExperts in detecting audio and video fakes told The Banner in March that there was overwhelming evidence the voice is AI-generated. They noted its flat tone, unusually clean background sounds and lack of consistent breathing sounds or pauses as hallmarks of AI. They also ran the audio through several different AI-detection techniques, which consistently concluded it was a fake, though they could not be 100% sure.\n\nAI voice-generation tools are now widely available online, a single minute's recording of someone's voice can be enough to simulate it with a $5-a-month AI tool, the Nieman Journalism Lab reported in February.\n\nThere are few regulations to prevent AI imitations, called deepfakes, and few perpetrators are prosecuted.", "source": {"uri": "cbsnews.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "CBS News"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

The audio clip using Eiswert's voice went viral and was met with condemnation from the Baltimore County community. The school called for an increased police presence and additional counselors.\n\nDarien's charges are not yet listed in online court records. He could not immediately be reached for comment.\n\nThe recording included offensive statements made about Black students' test scores and Jewish parents. Eiswert was removed from the school and required a security detail at his house while maintaining his innocence through a union spokesperson.\n\nBaltimore County Police wrote in a 17-page charging document that Eiswert initially believed Darien, Pikesville High's athletic director, created the fake recording because of a grievance Darien had over his contract not being renewed. Darien also fired a long-term coach without approval, Eiswert told police.\n\nIn the recording, a man's voice sounds like he's talking to someone named \"Kathy,\" whom listeners interpreted to be Vice Principal Kathy Albert. She told police she never had the conversation in the clip.\n\nThree Pikesville High employees -- Darien and two physical education teachers who police said were friends with him -- received an email with the MP3 recording around 10 p.m. Jan. 16, about a half hour before the clip went viral on social media.\n\nOne of the two P.E. teachers told detectives she was having professional issues with Eiswert and was not renewing her contract to work at Pikesville High. When she received the anonymous email with the audio clip, she sent it to a student and emailed it to a media outlet, she told police. The student then shared it on social media.\n\nDarien denied involvement in the recording or its release in an interview with detectives. He told detectives he was unfamiliar with the email that sent the recording to him. Over two months, detectives subpoenaed documents from Google, AT&T and T-Mobile that led to an internet provider address registered to Darien's grandmother, police wrote in charging documents.\n\nThe recovery cell phone number associated with the Google account was registered to Darien, police wrote. Detectives also consulted an FBI contractor and forensic analyst, who said the recording \"contained traces of AI-generated content with human editing after the fact,\" such as background noise for realism.\n\nA Baltimore County Public Schools information technology employee searched Darien's access to the BCPS network and found that he accessed OpenAI tools and Microsoft Bing Chat services that are similar to OpenAI three times between December and January 15, a day before the audio clip was released.\n\nA second expert opinion from a forensic analyst said the recording was manipulated with multiple recordings placed together, police wrote.\n\nEiswert had also initiated a theft investigation of Darien in 2023, police wrote. Darien allegedly paid his roommate and a junior varsity coach $1,910 dollars to assistant coach the girl's soccer team, but the roommate never did. An internal BCPS auditor confirmed that an unauthorized payment was made, in addition to a $4,420 unauthorized payment made for the roommate's boys basketball stipend.\n\nA BCPS spokesperson declined

Police say Darien used AI voice synthesis software to simulate Eiswert's voice, leading the public to believe the principal made racist and antisemitic comments.\n\nFurther Reading\n\nThe audio clip, posted on a popular Instagram account, contained offensive remarks about \"ungrateful Black kids\" and their academic performance, as well as a threat to \"join the other side\" if the speaker received one more complaint from \"one more Jew in this community.\" The recording also mentioned names of staff members, including Darien's nickname \"DJ,\" suggesting they should not have been hired or should be removed \"one way or another.\"\n\nThe comments led to significant uproar from students, faculty, and the wider community, many of whom initially believed the principal had actually made the comments. A Pikesville High School teacher named Shaena Ravenell reportedly played a large role in disseminating the audio. While she has not been charged, police indicated that she forwarded the controversial email to a student known for their ability to quickly spread information through social media. This student then escalated the audio's reach, which included sharing it with the media and the NAACP.\n\nBaltimore County Police say that Darien had accessed school networks to search for and utilize AI tools capable of voice imitation. Police also linked Darien to an email account used to distribute the fake recordings.\n\nVoice-cloning technology, which we have covered in the past, can generate realistic speech after being trained on millions of human voices, then tuned to match a specific voice in a provided sample. In March, Baltimore Banner reporters spoke with Siwei Lyu, the director of a media forensics lab at the University at Buffalo. Lyu told the newspaper that he believed the falsified clip of Eiswert speaking was created using a voice synthesis service such as ElevenLabs. ElevenLabs allows users to upload voice samples of people for cloning using text-to-speech synthesis, although its terms of service prohibit cloning a voice without the person's permission.\n\nThe incident has led to Eiswert being absent from the school since the investigation began, and he has denied making the comments, stating that they do not align with his views. \"I did not make this statement, and these thoughts are not what I believe in as both an educator and a person,\" Eiswert said in a written statement.\n\nFurther Reading\n\nWhen the audio clip emerged in January, Superintendent Myriam Rogers called the comments \"disturbing\" and \"highly offensive and inappropriate.\" The Baltimore Banner notes that Billy Burke, head of the union representing Eiswert, was the only official to publicly suggest the audio was AI-generated.

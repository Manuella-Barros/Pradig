Diarmuid O Boyle is donning his overalls to take on the challenge on his motorcyle, to raise funds for two good causes. He will set off from the Diamond in Donegal Town this afternoon at 4pm, with an over 1,000 kilometre ride ahead of him. The money raised will go towards St Peter\u2019s National School in Mountcharles, and the charity As Darragh Did. As Darragh Did is a charity set up in the memory of the late Darragh Mc Ginley and his siblings Conor and Carla set up by their father to continue their memories through funding \u201ccommunity clubs, groups, societies and projects which promote integration and inclusion.\u201d All funds raised will be split 50/50 between the two causes, with Diarmuid covering all travel costs for the journey himself. His fundraiser has already seen great support, with over \u20ac5,000 raised through GoFundMe before he has even set off.

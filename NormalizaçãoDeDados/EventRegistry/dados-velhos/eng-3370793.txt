Basque nationalists have sought an independent Basque state since the late 19th century.\n\nETA was formed in Spanish Basque territory 1959, and over the next four decades, it pursued a campaign of violence and assassination that fueled the development of far-right opposition groups that added to the bloodshed.\n\nIn 1973, ETA militants set off a bomb near a church where Spanish Prime Minister Luis Carrero Blanco was attending Mass. Blanco -- who was widely seen as the heir-apparent to Spain's longtime right-wing dictator, Francisco Franco -- was killed.\n\nSpain made the transition to democracy after Franco died in 1975, but ETA pushed on with its campaign.\n\nIts assaults included other assassinations, as well as scores of mass bombings, among them explosions that killed 12 civil guards in Madrid in June 1986, 21 people in Barcelona in June 1987 and 11 people at a barracks in Zaragoza in December 1987.\n\nIn 1995, ETA again targeted the top of the government, detonating a bomb in April near the car carrying Prime Minister Jose Maria Anzar, who was saved by its protective armor, and hatching a plot to assassinate King Juan Carlos, which police said they broke up in August.\n\nThursday's van attack occurred in Catalonia, a large separate autonomous region on the northeast tip of Spain that was oppressed during Franco's 36 years in power.\n\nCatalonia, Spain's most prosperous region, is also the center of a vigorous independence movement, but it historically used political and cultural tools, not violence.\n\nEighty percent of voters supported independence in a non-binding referendum in 2014.

Spain has long been featured in jihadist propaganda, which refers to the country as \"Al-Andalus,\" the historic Muslim territory that once included parts of Spain and Portugal.\n\nBarcelona became the latest European city to suffer an attack at the hands of a terrorist seemingly inspired by the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria, which claimed responsibility mere hours after the incident.\n\nThe attack occurred when a large van barrelled through Las Ramblas, an area popular with tourists in the centre of the city. So far, the toll stands at 14 people killed, with another 130 injured, although numbers are expected to rise in the coming days. The van attack in Barcelona was just one part of the terror plot, as a house explosion in Alcanar on Wednesday evening and a car attack in Cambrils on Friday morning, where seven people were run over, resulting in one fatality. Five suspected terrorists involved in the Cambrils attack were shot dead by police.\n\nAccording to a 2016 report, at least 100 Spanish citizens () are thought to be fighting with terror groups in the Middle East. Spain has also been used as a hub for material support for terrorism. In early 2015, it was discovered that at least 250 phone call-centres, butcher shops and neighbourhood grocery stores had been used to transfer money to terrorists fighting in Iraq and Syria.\n\nThe increasing use of vehicles to conduct terrorist attacks is a policy maker's nightmare. These kinds of attacks are nearly impossible to prevent, and almost anyone with access to a truck or car can drive to a crowded area and target civilians.\n\nThis was the most devastating terrorist attack to hit Spain since the Madrid train bombings in 2004, when al-Qaeda-linked terrorists bombed Spanish commuter trains, killing 191 people and injuring more than 2,000. Just last week, al-Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula published a feature story in its propaganda magazine, Inspire, that calls upon supporters to strike trains in the United States and Europe.\n\nSpain is known to have well-trained and robustly resourced counter-terrorism forces. Prior to the Madrid attacks, Spain had endured a decades-long terrorist campaign waged by the Euskadi Ta Askatasuna (ETA), or Basque Homeland and Liberty, a secessionist group fighting for an independent homeland for the Basque peoples. While ETA sometimes targeted civilians and journalists, it mostly focused on attacking symbols of the Spanish state -- politicians and members of Spain's security services, and infrastructure, including Madrid's Picasso Tower skyscraper. Over the past several years, IS-linked attacks in Europe have primarily targeted civilians, although not exclusively.\n\nThursday's attack in Barcelona was in keeping with a recent trend of terrorists using vehicles to attack by plowing into a crowd. Similar attacks have occurred in several other European cities since 2016, including Nice, Berlin, Stockholm and London. These type of terrorist attacks are relatively simple to carry out and opportunistic, since attackers can plan the attacks in advance and wait for a particularly crowded day to strike. The proliferation of vehicle attacks could represent an overall change in terrorist tactics away from the use of suicide bombs, which are harder to construct and do not always result in the high casualty counts terrorist groups seek.\n\nAs the Islamic State continues to lose territory in Iraq and Syria, many terrorism experts, myself included, believe the group will attempt to continue striking the West. IS prefers spectacular attacks similar to Paris in November 2015, but the group will settle for smaller one-off attacks from individuals who are inspired by IS, that serve to terrify Western civilians.\n\nSoft targets, so-called because they are more vulnerable to terrorism due to lower levels of security, are notoriously difficult to protect, and the latest shift to using vehicles to conduct ramming attacks only compounds the problem for authorities. It is entirely possible to restrict the sale of firearms or precursor chemicals used to make explosives, but banning vehicles from numerous parts of a city would fundamentally alter its social fabric and pose new challenges for transportation officials and urban planners.\n\nYet even when local and national authorities move to prevent open areas from becoming targets in pedestrian-friendly cities by erecting barriers and stanchions, they serve as an all-too-visible reminder of this: Even if terrorists can be successfully prevented from going on a murderous vehicular rampage, the terrorists will believe they have already won by forcing Westerners to change their way of life.", "dateTime": "2017-08-18T11:27:00Z", "extractedDates": [{"textEnd": 3914, "textStart": 3901, "date": "2015-11-",

ETA had a political goal and it was part of a political strategy. That had to be addressed with not only police measures but also political measures,\" Dr. Carlos Flores Juberias, a constitutional law professor and political analyst from the University of Valencia, told Sputnik.\n\n\"Islamic terrorism does not have a specific political agenda apart from creating terror and insecurity. No concessions can be made to them. They have the potential to strike in the most sensitive places in Spanish society, as happened with the Madrid attacks (in 2004) prior to the elections which saw the Socialists elected,\" he said.\n\n\"I would not put them in the same basket with ETA, although both are 100 percent rejectable,\" added Dr. Flores Juberias.\n\n\u00a9 AP Photo/ Oriol DuranInjured people are treated in Barcelona, Spain, Thursday, Aug. 17, 2017 after a white van jumped the sidewalk in the historic Las Ramblas district, crashing into a summer crowd of residents and tourists and injuring several people, police said.\n\nDr. Flores Juberias said the attack in Las Ramblas was very different to anything Spain had experienced before.\n\n\"That is what makes Islamic terrorists extremely unpredictable and difficult to contain. It can strike anywhere and anytime. While ETA needed weapons and explosives these people need only a van or a car or even less to kill a dozen people and that makes them much more unpredictable. We know Catalonia has been a main objective for Islamic terrorists for some time. A number of radicalized Muslims have been living or traveling through Catalonia. It is an ethnically diverse region and there are thousands of Algerians, Egyptians and other Muslims, which makes it quite easy for them to hide there and settle there.\"\n\n\"Despite what happened yesterday in Barcelona there was a similar attack in Cambrils which was stopped and we have to congratulate the police for that,\" he said.\n\nFourteen people were killed on Thursday (August 17) when a man drove a van into crowds of people in the center of Barcelona.

Those attacks, blamed on al-Qaeda, remain the deadliest ever to have been carried out on European soil. They prompted Spanish authorities to reassess their internal-security posture -- a process that involved hiring thousands of people whose job it was to stop another attack.\n\nOver the next 13 years, as Islamist terrorists targeted cities across Europe -- London, Paris, Brussels, Nice, and Manchester to name a few -- some of them multiple times, Spain arrested 700 people, convicted dozens, imprisoned 120 people for terrorism-related offenses, and foiled many plots. Spain's strategy seemed to work -- until Thursday. That's when a Morocco-born man struck pedestrians in Barcelona with a van, killing 14 people and injuring dozens of others. Separately, police killed five suspects in Cambrils, a seaside resort near Barcelona, who struck seven people with a car. Authorities said the attacks were connected and the perpetrators had been planning larger-scale attacks, but were thwarted when their suspected bomb factory in the town of Alcanar exploded. ISIS claimed responsibility for Thursday's attacks. But the key question is perhaps not so much why Spanish authorities couldn't prevent them, but how Spain managed to avoid being a target for so long.\n\nEl Pais, the Spanish newspaper, reported in June that more than 1,000 people were on the radar of Spanish police, 259 people were being investigated, and 500 telephones were being tapped in dozens of anti-terrorism investigations across the country. The newspaper reported that a silent \"army\" of more than 3,000 officers were working to prevent another attack. They sifted through social-media accounts, investigated mosques, and worked with informers to gain information and knowledge about terrorist networks. Their conclusion: a new attack was inevitable. In fact, El Pais noted that Madrid, Barcelona, Ceuta, and Melilla were considered particularly vulnerable, and reported that intelligence agencies had warned about \"busy areas in Madrid and Barcelona\" being attacked. Las Ramblas, the target of Thursday's Barcelona attack, is perhaps the busiest pedestrian thoroughfare in the city, popular with tourists and locals alike.\n\nBefore the 2004 Madrid attacks, there were few hints of a potential problem with Islamist terrorism. As I reported yesterday, Spain has had a long history with terrorism, but much of the violence was carried out by ETA, the Basque separatist group, which declared a truce in 2011. Before the 2004 al-Qaeda attack, authorities had their eye on smaller Islamist groups that were operating in North Africa, as well as Salafist groups (which are not necessarily violent) that were slowly gaining followers -- and which are influential in rural and coastal Catalonia.\n\n\"There are different currents\" of Salafism, Lorenzo Vidino, the director of the Program on Extremism at George Washington University, told the Guardian. \"There are currents there that are very conservative but not necessarily supporting violence. Having said that, it's undeniable that that environment has created a milieu that is fertile for further radicalization. It explains why there is more radicalization than any other part of mainland Spain.\"\n\nMany Spaniards from this part of the country ended up fighting in the jihadist battles of the age. As El Pais pointed out:\n\nImad Eddin Barakat, known as Abu Dahdah, and one of the founders of Al Qaeda in Spain, would see off fighters from Madrid's Barajas airport, sending them to join the jihad in Bosnia, Chechnya or Afghanistan. And he would welcome back the wounded, and send them off to be treated in state-funded hospitals in Spain. The Syrian-Spaniard was shepherding his flock with total immunity. No one foresaw that those bearded fighters who came back from combat zones had been trained in weapons and explosives, and could be a danger to our safety.\n\nIn recent years, the attention of Western security organizations has moved from watching for militants returning from Afghanistan, Bosnia, and Chechnya to the fighters coming back from Syria and Iraq. Spain hasn't had the same numbers of citizens going to fight in those countries on the side of ISIS -- and none of the suspects arrested in Spain are said to have known ties to terrorism. It's not clear if authorities knew of those militants who were killed. Which points to several possible conclusions: Security officials may thwart dozens of terrorist plots, but they need fail just once; it's virtually impossible to stop someone truly intent on attacking civilians, especially if (s)he is using a low-tech weapon such as a van; and the best responses to terrorist attacks are only good until the next attack.", "dateTime": "2017-08-19T08:50:00Z",

How many more warnings will the West require?\n\nSpain is no stranger to terrorism. Between 1968 and 2011, the Basque separatist group Euskadi Ta Askatasuna (ETA) killed more than 820 people. In 2004, Al Qaeda claimed credit for coordinating bombings in the Madrid rail system that killed 192 and injured over two thousand people. Thursday's attacks in Barcelona and Cambrils appear to be something new. The ETA has had a clear, realizable political objective behind its violence all along. The Madrid bombings were widely understood as retaliation for the support that the center-right government of Jos\u00e9 Mar\u00eda Aznar had shown for the U.S. war in Iraq. The timing of the attacks suggested their political objective: general elections were to be held just three days after the attack. They were held, and Aznar's party lost.\n\nInvestigations into the Barcelona and Cambrils attacks are still ongoing, but to all appearances so far, these incidents do not involve simple political goals. Early indications are that the attacks were inspired by the Islamic State's call for terror in Europe. There are obvious parallels to other recent ISIS-connected attacks, such as the November 2015 killing spree by Islamists in Paris that took the lives of 130 people, the March 2016 suicide bombings in Brussels, and the spate of recent vehicle attacks in London, Nice and Berlin. Fourteen people have died so far from the van attacks in Barcelona and Cambrils. The terrorists had greater ambitions, however, which became evident on Wednesday night when a house in the small town of Alcanar exploded. Investigators believe that the terror cell responsible for Thursday's improvised attacks had been planning to carry out bombings.\n\nThe driver of the van used in Barcelona is still on the loose; police have named the suspect as seventeen-year-old Moussa Oukabir. The five attackers involved in the Cambrils incident were all shot dead by police. Several arrests have been made, which include two Moroccans and one suspect who was \"born in Melilla, the autonomous Spanish city on the north coast of Africa,\" according to the BBC News. The suspects, the modus operandi and the Islamic State's claim of culpability all fit together, though with terrorism investigations it is never safe to take anything for granted. Provisionally, however, a few things might be said.\n\nFirst, a danger that could not be ignored after the Madrid attacks in 2004, and the further Islamist bombings in London a year later, is still present in Europe. This is an extraordinary failure on the part of the continent's elected leaders. While far-right political activity is a source of great anxiety for Europe's governing class, a much more violent force has gone unchecked. The far Right has tried, and largely failed, to capitalize on this fact. Too many mainstream parties rest content with this, defending European liberalism in the short term at the almost certain price of undermining it in the long run. The attitude of too many of Europe's leaders seems to be that modest police measures are adequate to control the Islamist threat, while systematic moral firmness is necessary in the face of right-wing electoral appeals. The resurgence of Islamist terror in the past decade proves this to be wrong. Islamism has to be even more culturally unacceptable than right-wing ethno-nationalism if European liberalism is to survive. Additionally, more than just counterintelligence and law-enforcement operations are necessary to strike Islamist terror at its root. Immigration control, for one, is not an issue that should be left to an unelectable and incompetent far Right. But also, liberalism cannot continue to be complacently multicultural. Europe need not face a choice between suicidal cosmopolitanism and blood-and-soil chauvinism. Liberalism, broadly defined, can once again recognize its Western character and act accordingly when setting immigration and cultural policies.\n\nSecond, for all the contempt that America's own liberals show toward Donald Trump's moves to restrict travel and immigration from certain Muslim countries -- as well as toward the populist right's largely chimerical fears of sharia law in the United States -- they ignore the civilizational truth behind such things at their own peril. President Trump and his supporters feel in their bones that this country is threatened by a loss of confidence in its historic character and a great naivet\u00e9 toward long-term threats from outside. Europe's continuing vulnerability to Islamist terror confirms what many on the American right know but can hardly articulate. Both America and Europe have become so thoroughly indoctrinated by an antinational form of liberalism that any defense of the nation or of Western civilization begins to sound like bigotry. Words, arguments, and even the emotional and psychological underpinnings of an affirmation of country and culture have been lost -- only to be replaced by anger and caricatures. American liberals need to be tougher. They must learn to look beyond the crude superficial manifestations of right-wing sentiment in America to recognize the deeper truths behind them.\n\nThe Islamic State will not long survive; it is not a political or military threat to the West. But the West's own anomie -- and the steadily erosive force of Islamic civilization's disorders upon a West that has, in effect, lost its capacity to rebuild -- will lead to continuing mass-casualty attacks and ultimately to political upheavals.

Another person was killed in a second attack at a nearby seaside resort that ended when the police shot dead five suspects.\n\nNow, authorities are rushing to answer how a group that included teenagers was able to carry out a well-planned and coordinated attack in a country that has parried danger for so long, despite being such a tempting and symbolic target for Islamic militants.\n\nGet The Straits Times\n\nnewsletters in your inboxSign Up\n\n\"For the jihadis, Spain is still very much a front-line country,\" said Bruce Hoffman, a Georgetown University professor who has advised the U.S. government on terrorism.\n\nSince 2004, when a series of bombs ripped through commuter trains in Madrid, killing 192 people, Spain has foiled a long list of plots by Islamic militants - not least in the coastal area around Barcelona where Thursday's attacks took place.\n\nOver 700 suspected extremists have been arrested since 2004, according to the Interior Ministry. They include Pakistanis plotting suicide attacks on the Barcelona subway in 2008; a terrorist cell in Melilla, Spain's territory in North Africa; and nine, mostly Moroccan, men arrested in April in connection with the March 2016 attacks in Brussels that targeted the city's airport and a subway station.\n\nLast year, the Spanish authorities quashed a possible plot to drive a truck through crowds, similar to earlier attacks in Berlin and in the French city of Nice, and they intercepted a shipment by sea of 20,000 uniforms being smuggled to militants in Syria and Iraq.\n\n\"The Spanish authorities are at the top of the game in Europe,\" said Matthew G. Olsen, a former director of the National Counter-terrorism Center. \"My sense is they have been extremely successful in identifying and disrupting attacks.\" Galvanized by the 2004 Madrid attacks in the same way the Sept. 11, 2001, terrorist attacks served as a wake-up call for Americans, the Spaniards built on their decades of experience in fighting ETA, the Basque separatist movement, and introduced a raft of laws that helped to disrupt radical cells.\n\nBut counter-terrorism is partly a matter of luck, and on Thursday, Spain's ran out with a plot whose size and complexity offered a sobering reality check.\n\nSome of the young men involved in the attacks in Barcelona and Cambrils were teenagers, and investigators believe they had lived double lives as they planned the attacks for a year at a house in Alcanar, a sleepy town 120 miles down the coast from Barcelona.\n\nIt offered a stark reminder of the challenge in Catalonia, a region with a reputation as a burgeoning hub of Islamic extremism.\n\nThe economic boom in Catalonia, home to just over a quarter of Spain's almost 2 million Muslim residents, attracted large numbers of Muslim migrants from Morocco, Algeria and South Asia. But many struggled to integrate and were drawn to clusters of radical Salafi mosques that sprang up around a handful of smaller towns.\n\nIn a diplomatic cable in 2007, State Department officials warned that the area, with its large population of disaffected, male and unmarried Muslim immigrants, had become \"a magnet for terrorist recruiters.\" As far back as the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks, investigators found themselves scrutinising the area.\n\n\"There is a history there,\" said Lorenzo Vidino, the director of the George Washington University Program on Extremism. \"If you look at Google maps, the next town over from Cambrils is Salou. You can literally walk it. And Salou is the town where Mohamed Atta had his last meeting in Europe before 9/11,\" he said, referring to the pilot of the first plane to fly into the World Trade Center, who is believed to have met with a Qaeda figure in Salou before the 2001 attack.\n\nBut Spain does not loom as a primary focus for Islamic militants. Although a staunch NATO ally, the country has been a marginal player in the United States' wars in Iraq and Afghanistan. Even as they aggressively intercepted terrorist cells, Spain's leaders have prided themselves on their efforts to integrate Muslims into mainstream society.\n\nDespite an economic crash and high unemployment since the 2008 financial crisis, Spain has not seen the emergence of hard-line, anti-Muslim political movements as elsewhere in Europe.\n\nAround 200 Spanish residents are believed to have travelled to Syria and Iraq to join the fighting there - a fraction of the hundreds who have gone from countries like Britain and France.\n\nYet Spain cannot escape its symbolic attraction for Islamic militants that is rooted deep in its history. Between the eighth and 15th centuries a large part of the Iberian Peninsula was ruled by Muslim caliphs, and extremist websites often speak fancifully about a return to the era of Al-Andalus, as medieval Spain was known.\n\nAnd despite its efforts at integration, Spain has struggled with extremist currents inside its Moroccan communities, in much the same way as British officials deal with Pakistani communities and the French with residents of Tunisian or Algerian descent.\n\nThat problem is linked to Spain's close, if sometimes testy, historical relationship with Morocco, which accounts for much of the country's Muslim migration.\n\nAlmost all of the dozen suspects in Thursday's attacks have been identified as Moroccans or of Moroccan origin. That is the same background as the ringleader and the foot soldiers of the Paris attacks on Nov. 13, 2015, as well as of the men who rolled suitcase bombs into the Brussels airport on March 22, 2016.\n\nIn August 2015, Ayoub El-Khazzani, a Moroccan-born man who lived in the south of Spain, was overpowered by passengers on a high-speed train travelling between Amsterdam and Paris after he opened fire with a Kalashnikov rifle. Khazzani was said to have been radicalized in a mosque in Algeciras, Spain.\n\nOver 1,600 Moroccans have joined the Islamic State in Syria and Libya, according to Morocco's Interior Ministry, and security experts believe there are hundreds of sympathizers inside the country.\n\n\"What's astounding is that an attack like this hasn't taken place inside Morocco,\" said Issandr El Amrani, an analyst with the International Crisis Group, which recently published a study of Islamic State activities in North Africa.\n\nSpanish counterterrorism relies heavily on cooperation with the Moroccan security forces, who have successfully penetrated migrant communities across Europe through a strong network of informants, despite concerns from human rights groups about their methods, Amrani said.\n\nBut that assistance also depends on the political relationship between the countries, which has been dogged by tensions over Ceuta and Melilla, Spain's enclaves in North Africa, and a simmering dispute over the Western Sahara region.\n\nWhile it has cut costs in other areas, the Spanish government raised both the staff numbers and the budget this year for its intelligence services. Toughened anti-terrorism legislation has allowed authorities to arrest suspects at an earlier stage of attack planning than in Britain and elsewhere.\n\nUntil this week's attacks, 54 people had been arrested this year on suspicion of terrorist activity in Spain, where the threat of returnees from Syria is deemed relatively small.\n\nBut like so many intelligence agencies in Europe, the Spanish are overwhelmed by the volume of potential terrorism plots they are trying to monitor, said Seth G. Jones, a terrorism specialist at the RAND Corp.\n\n\"They're totally swamped with leads,\" he said. \"There is no way they can cover all their current open cases.\"", "dateTime":

Someone needs to.\n\nAs noted, the wire service report authored by three reporters with the help of two others has for the moment abandoned its reluctance to use the T-word (terrorism) and even the I-word (Islamic). One could argue that it's because the terrorist conspiracy is so obvious, but that hasn't stopped the AP and others from holding back in the past (bolds are mine throughout this post):\n\nPOLICE: ATTACKS IN SPAIN ARE LINKED, TOOK LONG TIME TO PLAN\n\nThe back-to-back vehicle attacks in Barcelona and a nearby resort had been planned for a long time by an Islamic terrorist cell - and could have been far deadlier had its base not been destroyed by an apparently accidental explosion this week, Spanish officials said Friday.\n\nPolice intensified their manhunt for an unknown number of suspects still on the loose Friday. They shot and killed five people early Friday who were wearing fake bomb belts as they attacked the seaside resort of Cambrils with a speeding car. Police also arrested four others believed linked to the Cambrils attack and the carnage Thursday on a famous Barcelona promenade.\n\nThe number of victims stood at 13 dead and 120 wounded in Barcelona, and one dead and five wounded in Cambrils. Sixty-one people wounded by the van in Barcelona remained hospitalized on Friday, with 17 of them in critical condition.\n\nAuthorities said the two attacks were related and the work of a large terrorist cell that had been plotting attacks for a long time from a house in Alcanar, 200 kilometers (124 miles) down the coast from Barcelona. The house was destroyed by an explosion of butane gas on Wednesday night that killed one person.\n\nSenior police official Josep Lluis Trapero said police were working on the theory that the suspects were preparing a different type of attack, using explosives or gas, and that the apparently accidental explosion prevented them from carrying out a far more deadly rampage.\n\nThe Islamic State group quickly claimed responsibility for Europe's latest bout of extremist violence ...\n\nWell, using the word \"extremist\" was pretty weak. But we'll accept it, given the rest of the opening paragraphs' contents.\n\nSo the AP's reporting was fine, up to a point. But a very important omission came later. Perhaps the reporters involved are too young to remember, but the AP's senior editors, who surely watched over the wire service's story preparation in this instance, should have known better:\n\n... the dual attacks unnerved a country that hasn't seen an Islamic extremist attack since 2004, when al-Qaida-inspired bombers killed 192 people in coordinated assaults on Madrid's commuter trains. Unlike France, Britain, Sweden and Germany, Spain has largely been spared, thanks in part to a crackdown that has netted some 200 suspected jihadis in recent years.\n\nYes, Spain has indeed been largely spared until now. But why?\n\nHere's why: The 2004 Madrid attacks intimidated the country's voters into bending to Al-Qaida's will in elections several days later, as James Phillips at the Heritage Foundation noted on March 16 of that year, five days after those March 11 attacks.\n\nThe attacks were designed to influence that election result -- and they succeeded:\n\nSpain's Retreat After The Madrid Bombings Rewards Terrorism\n\n... it is clear that the bombings contributed greatly to the Socialist Party's surprise victory at the polls three days later and the election of a new Prime Minister, Socialist Jose Luis Rodriguez Zapatero. Already, Zapatero has promised to withdraw Spanish troops from duty in Iraq. This is, unfortunately, a political triumph for radical Islamic terrorism and may well embolden Al Qaeda and other terrorist groups to strike similarly in the future.\n\n... The Politics of Capitulation\n\nThe bombings have had a major political impact, propelling the opposition Socialist Party to an upset victory over the conservative government of Prime Minister Jose Maria Aznar, a staunch U.S. ally, in the general elections held three days later. As a result of the bombings, Aznar's government, which initially sought to lay the blame on Basque separatists who have conducted a terrorist campaign against the Spanish government for more than 20 years, was swept out of office by a voter backlash.\n\nThe newly elected Spanish Prime Minister, Jose Luis Rodriguez Zapatero, already has pledged to withdraw Spain's 1,300 troops from Iraq. Such a withdrawal would weaken the coalition's effort to build a stable democracy in Iraq and make Iraq a safer place for Al Qaeda terrorists to operate. This decision has made the Iraqi people the biggest losers in the Spanish elections and Osama bin Laden the biggest winner.\n\nThis Spanish retreat will be perceived as a huge political triumph for Al Qaeda and like-minded Islamic radicals -- probably their most important achievement since September 11, 2001. Zapatero's act of appeasement has handed Osama bin Laden a major victory. This will only encourage further attacks, from Al Qaeda or from other terrorist groups emboldened by the successful operation in Spain, targeting other members of the coalition involved in liberating Iraq from Saddam's brutal regime. Spain's cave-in on Iraq after the bombing will particularly heighten the threat of copycat attacks on other countries ...\n\nThus, after the Madrid attacks, Spanish voters bought temporary peace through appeasement, and hoped against hope that they'd be left alone.\n\nMeanwhile, terrorist attacks and Islamist uprisings occurred elsewhere in Europe. For example, Spain managed to dodge the particularly ugly riots of late 2005 which occurred in France and other European countries. Rioters, predominantly Muslim immigrants, torched hundreds if not thousands of vehicles and caused widespread property damage.\n\nOther European terror attacks followed during the next 13 years. The litany is too long to fully recite here, but among the major ones there was London 2005, Charlie Hebdo in France in early 2015, the Bataclan attacks in Paris later that year, the Brussels bombings in March 2016.\n\nBut, as the AP reporters noted, the reprieve didn't last forever. The terrorists are back with a vengeance, and they're clearly quite organized. Effective police work in \"recent years\" has prevented catastrophe -- until now.\n\n<<< Please support MRC's NewsBusters team with a tax-deductible contribution today. >>>\n\nSo for all the welcome accuracy of the on the ground reporting AP provided, it missed the opportunity to demonstrate that appeasing terrorists doesn't buy indefinite peace. Spanish voters in 2004 and the government they elected were absolutely wrong to think that it would.", "dateTime": "2017-08-19T05:26:00Z", "extractedDates": [{"textEnd": 3435, "textStart": 3427,

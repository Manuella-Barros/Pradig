{"id": 224999544, "title": "Jets returning strong defensive core from stout 2023 unit", "text": "The cast of the musical \u201cRent\u201d sang that a year is measured in 525,600 minutes. The next time Aaron Rodgers brings his Jets teammates to Broadway, maybe they can sing about how chemistry can be measured in 7,342 defensive snaps. As teams around the league start from scratch introducing new players and new schemes on both sides of the ball, the Jets defense should be ahead of the curve in OTAs because eight of the nine players who logged at least 650 snaps last season (7,342 total) remain together under fourth-year coordinator Jeff Ulbrich. Four \u2014 safety Tony Adams and cornerbacks Sauce Gardner, D.J. Reed and Michael Carter II \u2014 start in one of the NFL\u2019s best secondaries. \u201cContinuity, especially on the back end, is so critical,\u201d Ulbrich said during the first week of spring practices. \u201cThese guys have to know each other\u2019s strengths, their weaknesses, their shortcomings, their superpowers, their kryptonites, all that. They also have to know how to communicate at the highest level \u2014 and some of that communication over time becomes just a wink, a little hand signal.\u201d The Jets are one of six teams returning eight of their top-nine defensive workhorses. Retaining Ulbrich \u2014 who was blocked from interviewing for the 49ers defensive coordinator vacancy \u2014 also was key to continuity. \u201cWhen you get to that [subtle communication] level, that\u2019s where the really special stuff lives,\u201d Ulbrich said. \u201cSo the fact that we have guys that have been here in the system for multiple years now, it\u2019s exciting to think where they could take it.\u201d Only the Colts and Saints have eight- or nine-man cores that played more snaps than the cumulative total of the Jets\u2019 four defensive backs plus defensive linemen Quinnen Williams and Jermaine Johnson as well as linebackers C.J. Mosley and Quincy Williams. But neither team ranked nearly as high as the Jets (No. 3) in total defense (292.3 yards allowed per game). \u201cNo one is happy with the results as of yet,\u201d Ulbrich said. \u201cYeah, statistically, we\u2019ve ended in the top five, but ultimately winning is how we create a legacy in this league. So until that happens and we win \u2014 substantial wins and we hold that [Super Bowl] trophy together \u2014 we\u2019re not going to be done. So it\u2019s a really cool group in that way \u2014 just so driven, so self-motivated. Takes very little nudging by me.\u201d Seven of the eight snaps leaders (not Adams) also were key pieces under Ulbrich when the Jets ranked No. 4 in both total defense and scoring defense in 2022. Gardner, Mosley and both Williams brothers have been first- or second-team All-Pros over the past two seasons \u2014 more than any other AFC defense boasts in that time frame. \u201cAnything that\u2019s my strengths, I just keep going over it,\u201d Gardner said. \u201cStuff that\u2019s my weakness, I pride myself on getting better on that. Trying not to get complacent \u2014 it\u2019s easy to get complacent \u2026 when you are going through life and having people say you are their favorite player.\u201d The Jets\u2019 offseason changes included swapping in Haason Reddick and Javon Kinlaw for John Franklin-Myers and Bryce Huff \u2014 neither of whom carried a 650-snap workload \u2014 along the defensive line. Acquiring Reddick, who has 50.5 sacks over the past four seasons, was a case of leaning into strengths \u2014 the Jets ranked No. 4 last season in pressure percentage (26.5 percent of opponents\u2019 dropbacks) \u2014 and believing that better complementary football will lead to correcting a weakness. The vaunted defense ranked No. 25 in rushing yards allowed per game (124) last season but No. 11 in yards per carry (4.07). Rodgers\u2019 return from missing virtually the full season should mean playing from ahead more frequently thus forcing more passes-rush opportunities. The bigger disruption to defensive chemistry could be whether the combination of former Ravens starter Chuck Clark \u2014 who missed all of last season with a torn ACL \u2014 converted cornerback Isaiah Oliver, special-teamer Ashytn Davis and rookie Jaden Key can aptly fill the shoes of departed 1,078-snap safety Jordan Whitehead. \u201cI know that might be the outside narrative,\u201d Ulbrich said. \u201cThat\u2019s not the narrative within this building.\u201d It wouldn\u2019t have all the makings of a Broadway hit that way.", "summary": "The Jets defense bring an experience edge to OTAs because eight of the nine players who logged at least 650 snaps last season (7,342 total) return.", "url": "https://nypost.com/2024/05/29/sports/jets-returning-strong-defensive-core-from-stout-2023-unit/", "image": "https://nypost.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/05/newspress-collage-cjd7nq0ak-1716944709992.jpg?quality=75&strip=all&1716930404&w=1200", "video": null, "publish_date": "2024-05-29 12:00:00", "author": "Ryan Dunleavy", "authors": ["Ryan Dunleavy"], "language": "en", "source_country": "us", "sentiment": 0.157}

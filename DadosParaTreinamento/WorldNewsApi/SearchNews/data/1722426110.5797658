Someone tore down the Israeli flag outside the Holy Bagels and Pizzeria, located on Northwest First Avenue and First Street, Thursday night, according to Josh Nodel, the shop\u2019s owner. Nodel said someone else took off with the flag later that night. The same shop was hit by a vandal just two weeks ago after they spray-painted the windows with \u201cFree Palestine\u201d and \u201cStop Genocide,\u201d then tore down a U.S.-Israeli flag and tied it around the front door handles. This marked the fourth time in nearly eight months that one of Josh Nodel\u2019s businesses has been defaced. The business owner\u2019s other bagel shop in Miami Beach has also been hit by vandals several times over the past few months. Copyright 2024 Sunbeam Television Corp. All rights reserved.

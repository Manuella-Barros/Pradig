{"id": 231940528, "title": "What a Team of Remaining 2024 NFL Free Agents Would Look Like", "text": "Age and a lack of depth certainly affect the construction of this defense. A three-man front became necessary based on the lack of depth found among the defensive line, with three older veterans holding down the front. Calais Campbell may turn 38 before the start of the 2024 season, but the 6'8\", 282-pound defender is still a handful for offensive linemen. The biggest question remains whether he'll actually play a 17th season. \"I feel like I was still able to affect the ballgames, and that's important,\" Campbell said a little over a year ago. \"I don't want to be a guy out here that's not affecting the ballgames, just being a guy. So, that matters to me to decide if I'm going to continue playing or not because I want to make sure that I'm going to be confident that I can go out there and be a difference maker and not just being a guy.\"Ultimately, Campbell signed with the Atlanta Falcons and tied for the team lead with 6.5 sacks. Mike Purcell, 33, is a powerful nose tackle through and through. A team knows exactly what it's getting in the 6'3\", 328-pound defender. He's going to hold the point of attack, do the dirty work in the middle and let others go make plays. Two years ago, Emmanuel Ogbah was coming off back-to-back nine-sack campaigns. The 30-year-old then suffered a season-ending triceps injury before making a comeback last year. He's never been a pure edge, with the athleticism to blow past offensive tackles. Instead, Ogbah is much better working head up or from an inside alignment. He can line up as a 5-technique or 4i to fit this particular lineup.", "summary": "Capable free-agents are still available.

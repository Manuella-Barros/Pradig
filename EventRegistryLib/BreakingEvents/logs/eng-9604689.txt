I don't want to open Pandora's Box.\"\n\nOn Tuesday, Djokovic will take on French wildcard Pierre-Hugues Herbert, the world number 142 who hasn't won a match on the main tour this year.\n\nRuud, who won clay-court titles in Barcelona and Geneva in the build-up to Roland Garros, cruised to a 6-3, 6-4, 6-3 victory over Brazilian qualifier Felipe Meligeni Alves.\n\n\"It's great to be back here at Roland Garros,\" he said. \"Hopefully I can make it another good year here.\"\n\nRuud was beaten in straight sets by Novak Djokovic in last year's final following a one-sided loss to Rafael Nadal in the 2022 showpiece.\n\nHe also lost the 2022 US Open final to Carlos Alcaraz.\n\nFrenchwoman Alize Cornet's career ended with a straight-sets defeat by Zheng Qinwen in her record-extending 69th consecutive Grand Slam appearance.\n\nCornet was no match for China's Australian Open runner-up Zheng, losing 6-2, 6-1.\n\nShe made her debut at Roland Garros as a 15-year-old in 2005 and has not missed a Grand Slam tournament since the 2006 US Open.\n\n- 'Cried watching Rafa' -\n\nCornet reached a career-high ranking of 11th in 2009 and enjoyed a surprise run to the 2022 Australian Open quarter-finals.\n\n\"I already cried yesterday watching Rafa,\" said a tearful Cornet after seeing Nadal lose what was likely his last match at the French Open on Monday.\n\nOver on Court Suzanne Lenglen, Rybakina powered into the second round with a 6-2, 6-3 victory over Belgian Greet Minnen and could face three-time Grand Slam champion Angelique Kerber for a place in the last 32.\n\nKazakh world number four Rybakina is the only player to defeat tournament favourite Iga Swiatek on clay this season, in the Stuttgart semi-finals in April.\n\nElsewhere on Tuesday, two-time Australian Open champion Aryna Sabalenka gets her bid to reach a first Roland Garros final underway.\n\nThe world number two has reached at least the semi-finals in each of the past six Grand Slam events.\n\nSabalenka is also the only woman to beat world number one and three-time French Open winner Swiatek in a final on clay -- in Madrid last year -- since the Pole lost her first WTA title decider as a teenager in 2019 at a low-key event in Switzerland.\n\nThe 26-year-old Sabalenka had never even reached the second week at Roland Garros until last year, when she was knocked out by Karolina Muchova in the semi-finals.\n\nShe starts her Paris campaign against Russia's Erika Andreeva.\n\nAlso on court in the men's singles is Argentine qualifier Roman Andres Burruchaga who has sporting success in the blood.\n\nHis father Jorge famously scored the winning goal for Diego Maradona's Argentina in the 1986 World Cup final against West Germany.\n\nRanked at 144, the 22-year-old is making his Grand Slam debut and takes on Germany's Jan-Lennard Struff.\n\ndj/jc\n\nMore from this section\n\nClosing arguments, jury instructions and maybe a verdict?

While 2022 Wimbledon champion Rybakina swept past Belgium's Greet Minnen 6-2, 6-3, two-time Australian Open champion Sabalenka was too powerful for Erika Andreeva in a 6-1, 6-2 victory.\n\nKazakh world No.4 Rybakina, who is the only player to defeat Swiatek on clay this season, has won WTA 500 titles in Brisbane, Abu Dhabi and Stuttgart this year. She said she was happy to be back competing at full fitness, having withdrawn from Roland Garros before her third round match last year due to a respiratory illness.\n\nSabalenka, who defended her title at Melbourne Park in January, reached the finals in Madrid and Rome but lost on both occasions to Swiatek. The world No.2 reached the French Open semi-finals in 2021 and 2023 and will be determined to go further this time. She was broken by 19-year-old Andreeva early in the second set but remained dominant for the most part. The 26-year-old fired 27 winners past her 100th-ranked opponent and broke serve five times.\n\n\"I'm trying to do well on clay, it is tough conditions here but I enjoy playing here and I'm just trying to bring my best tennis every time whatever the surface,\" said Sabalenka.\n\nMeanwhile, Frenchwoman Alize Cornet's career ended after her record-extending 69th consecutive Grand Slam appearance at the French Open, the tournament where she made her debut aged 15 and was once a ball girl.\n\nCornet lost 6-2, 6-1 to China's Australian Open runner-up Zheng Qinwen on Court Philippe Chatrier in the first round. The 34-year-old had made her debut at Roland Garros in 2005 and not missed a Major since the 2006 US Open.\n\n\"Emotionally, it was not easy,\" said Cornet on her decision to retire. \"Some days I was really excited about retirement and some other days I was very scared and very uncertain. So overall, I feel in peace today about it, and so I'm very happy about that decision.\"\n\nCornet reached a career-high ranking of 11 in 2009 and enjoyed a surprise run to the 2022 Australian Open quarter-finals, beating Simona Halep along the way. Her career will also be remembered for a string of three successive victories against 23-time Grand Slam Serena Williams in 2014, which included a third-round win at Wimbledon.\n\nElsewhere in the women's section, 10th seed Daria Kasatkina defeated Poland's Magdalena Frech 7-5, 6-1 to move into the second round.\n\nHeavy rain caused play on the outside, uncovered courts to be delayed by five hours and by 6 pm local time only nine of the scheduled 40 matches had been completed.\n\nTwo-time runner-up Casper Ruud, who won clay-court titles in Barcelona and Geneva in the build-up to the French Open, cruised to a 6-3, 6-4, 6-3 victory over Brazilian qualifier Felipe Meligeni Alves. \"It's great to be back here at Roland Garros,\" said Ruud, seeded seventh. \"Hopefully I can make it another good year here.\"\n\nAustralia's Alex De Minaur, seeded 11th, also booked his spot in the second round with a 6-1, 6-0, 6-2 victory against Alex Michelsen.\n\nTop seed and defending champion Novak Djokovic was scheduled to begin his campaign with a night session match against French wildcard Pierre-Hugues Herbert.", "source": {"uri": "hindustantimes.com", "dataType": "news", "title":

I don't want to open Pandora's Box.\"\n\nOn Tuesday, Djokovic will take on French wildcard Pierre-Hugues Herbert, the world number 142 who hasn't won a match on the main tour this year.\n\nRuud, who won clay-court titles in Barcelona and Geneva in the build-up to Roland Garros, cruised to a 6-3, 6-4, 6-3 victory over Brazilian qualifier Felipe Meligeni Alves.\n\n\"It's great to be back here at Roland Garros,\" he said. \"Hopefully I can make it another good year here.\"\n\nRuud was beaten in straight sets by Novak Djokovic in last year's final following a one-sided loss to Rafael Nadal in the 2022 showpiece.\n\nHe also lost the 2022 US Open final to Carlos Alcaraz.\n\nFrenchwoman Alize Cornet's career ended with a straight-sets defeat by Zheng Qinwen in her record-extending 69th consecutive Grand Slam appearance.\n\nCornet was no match for China's Australian Open runner-up Zheng, losing 6-2, 6-1.\n\nShe made her debut at Roland Garros as a 15-year-old in 2005 and has not missed a Grand Slam tournament since the 2006 US Open.\n\nCornet reached a career-high ranking of 11th in 2009 and enjoyed a surprise run to the 2022 Australian Open quarter-finals.\n\n\"I already cried yesterday watching Rafa,\" said a tearful Cornet after seeing Nadal lose what was likely his last match at the French Open on Monday.\n\nOver on Court Suzanne Lenglen, Rybakina powered into the second round with a 6-2, 6-3 victory over Belgian Greet Minnen and could face three-time Grand Slam champion Angelique Kerber for a place in the last 32.\n\nKazakh world number four Rybakina is the only player to defeat tournament favorite Iga Swiatek on clay this season, in the Stuttgart semifinals in April.\n\nElsewhere on Tuesday, two-time Australian Open champion Aryna Sabalenka gets her bid to reach a first Roland Garros final underway.\n\nThe world number two has reached at least the semifinals in each of the past six Grand Slam events.\n\nSabalenka is also the only woman to beat world number one and three-time French Open winner Swiatek in a final on clay -- in Madrid last year -- since the Pole lost her first WTA title decider as a teenager in 2019 at a low-key event in Switzerland.\n\nThe 26-year-old Sabalenka had never even reached the second week at Roland Garros until last year, when she was knocked out by Karolina Muchova in the semifinals.\n\nShe starts her Paris campaign against Russia's Erika Andreeva.\n\nAlso on court in the men's singles is Argentine qualifier Roman Andres Burruchaga who has sporting success in the blood.\n\nHis father Jorge famously scored the winning goal for Diego Maradona's Argentina in the 1986 World Cup final against West Germany.\n\nRanked at 144, the 22-year-old is making his Grand Slam debut and takes on Germany's Jan-Lennard Struff.", "source": {"uri": "arabnews.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Arab News"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Novak_Djokovic", "type": "person",

I don't want to open Pandora's Box.\"\n\nOn Tuesday, Djokovic will take on French wildcard Pierre-Hugues Herbert, the world number 142 who hasn't won a match on the main tour this year.\n\nRuud, who won clay-court titles in Barcelona and Geneva in the build-up to Roland Garros, cruised to a 6-3, 6-4, 6-3 victory over Brazilian qualifier Felipe Meligeni Alves.\n\n\"It's great to be back here at Roland Garros,\" he said. \"Hopefully I can make it another good year here.\"\n\nRuud was beaten in straight sets by Novak Djokovic in last year's final following a one-sided loss to Rafael Nadal in the 2022 showpiece.\n\nHe also lost the 2022 US Open final to Carlos Alcaraz.\n\nFrenchwoman Alize Cornet's career ended with a straight-sets defeat by Zheng Qinwen in her record-extending 69th consecutive Grand Slam appearance.\n\nMore from this section Chaotic Memorial Day weekend at the Jersey Shore leads to stabbing, curfew Grayson Murray dies aged 30 just 24 hours after withdrawing from Charles Schwab Challenge Bronx Historical Society offers Mott Haven walking tour, screening of 'Up Jump The Boogie'\n\nCornet was no match for China's Australian Open runner-up Zheng, losing 6-2, 6-1.\n\nShe made her debut at Roland Garros as a 15-year-old in 2005 and has not missed a Grand Slam tournament since the 2006 US Open.\n\n- 'Cried watching Rafa' -\n\nCornet reached a career-high ranking of 11th in 2009 and enjoyed a surprise run to the 2022 Australian Open quarter-finals.\n\n\"I already cried yesterday watching Rafa,\" said a tearful Cornet after seeing Nadal lose what was likely his last match at the French Open on Monday.\n\nOver on Court Suzanne Lenglen, Rybakina powered into the second round with a 6-2, 6-3 victory over Belgian Greet Minnen and could face three-time Grand Slam champion Angelique Kerber for a place in the last 32.\n\nKazakh world number four Rybakina is the only player to defeat tournament favourite Iga Swiatek on clay this season, in the Stuttgart semi-finals in April.\n\nElsewhere on Tuesday, two-time Australian Open champion Aryna Sabalenka gets her bid to reach a first Roland Garros final underway.\n\nThe world number two has reached at least the semi-finals in each of the past six Grand Slam events.\n\nSabalenka is also the only woman to beat world number one and three-time French Open winner Swiatek in a final on clay -- in Madrid last year -- since the Pole lost her first WTA title decider as a teenager in 2019 at a low-key event in Switzerland.\n\nThe 26-year-old Sabalenka had never even reached the second week at Roland Garros until last year, when she was knocked out by Karolina Muchova in the semi-finals.\n\nShe starts her Paris campaign against Russia's Erika Andreeva.\n\nAlso on court in the men's singles is Argentine qualifier Roman Andres Burruchaga who has sporting success in the blood.\n\nHis father Jorge famously scored the winning goal for Diego Maradona's Argentina in the 1986 World Cup final against West Germany.\n\nRanked at 144, the 22-year-old is making his Grand Slam debut and takes on Germany's Jan-Lennard Struff.\n\ndj/jc", "source": {"uri": "reformer.com", "dataType": "news",

It's a 20-year page that I'm turning and I'm going to a new chapter in my life.\n\n\"I wish I could have played better, but I gave everything I could to this sport.\"\n\nIn the run-up to the third Grand Slam of 2024 - Wimbledon - you can watch all of the biggest tennis stars in action live on Sky Sports as they compete across the grass-court season.", "source": {"uri": "skysports.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "SkySports"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aryna_Sabalenka", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Aryna Sabalenka"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/French_Open", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "French Open"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elena_Rybakina", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Elena Rybakina"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aliz\u00e9_Cornet", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Aliz\u00e9 Cornet"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Erika_Andreeva", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Erika Andreeva"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Women's_Stuttgart_Open", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Women's Stuttgart Open"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stade_Roland_Garros", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Stade Roland Garros"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clay_court", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Clay court"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Open", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Australian Open"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andy_Murray", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Andy Murray"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grand_Slam_(tennis)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Grand Slam (tennis)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greet_Minnen", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Greet Minnen"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Forehand", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Forehand"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drop_shot", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Drop shot"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sky_Sports", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Sky Sports"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tennis", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Tennis"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kazakhstan", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Kazakhstan"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Kazakhstan"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wimbledon_Championships", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Wimbledon Championships"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zheng_Qinwen", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Zheng Qinwen"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wild_card_(sports)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Wild card (sports)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rafael_Nadal", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Rafael Nadal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paris", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Open_Source", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Open Source", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Tennis/Tournaments", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Tennis/Tournaments", "wgt": 17}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Clans_and_Guilds", "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Clans and Guilds", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Open_Source/Advocacy", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Open Source/Advocacy", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Hardware/Open_Source", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Hardware/Open Source", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://e0.365dm.com/24/05/1600x900/skysports-aryna-sabalenka-sabalenka_6568119.jpg?20240528170545", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9604689", "eventUri": "eng-9604689", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-06-10", "dateEnd": "2024-06-16", "textStart": 205, "textEnd": 215}], "sentiment": 0.1215686274509804, "wgt": 184, "relevance": 1}

One of my highlights. I'm always looking forward to it. The last two years have given me so much here,\" Ruud said.\n\n\"I hope I can make it another good year.\"\n\nSabalenka was equally quick as last year's semifinalist, who is eyeing a second major of the season after her successful Australian Open defence in January, mowed down Russian teenager Erika Andreeva in 68 minutes 6-1 6-2.\n\n\"I'm super happy to be back on this special court. Super to see all of you today supporting us. It was a great atmosphere,\" Sabalenka said.\n\n\"I know you guys didn't have a choice, it's raining outside so you had to be on this court but anyway, thank you so much.\"\n\nFourth seed Elena Rybakina overcame an early wobble to glide past Belgian Greet Minnen 6-2 6-3 earlier in the day, showing no signs of the illness that had hampered her preparations for the year's second major.\n\nThe third straight rain-hit day of the tournament began with a big outpouring of love for Frenchwoman Alize Cornet, as one of the ever-present players at Grand Slams in the last two decades bid adieu after her opening loss to seventh seed Zheng Qinwen.\n\nThe holder of the Open era women's record for consecutive Grand Slam main draw appearances with 69, Cornet had previously said she would retire after the tournament.\n\nAustralian Alex De Minaur thumped Alex Michelsen, Petra Martic overcame Kristina Mladenovic and Arantxa Rus stunned three-times Grand Slam champion Angelique Kerber in the few matches that were completed on the outside courts.\n\nWith typically British weather descending on Roland Garros, the nation's last two hopes in the singles draws -- Dan Evans and Katie Boulter -- will hope to extend their stays but face tough tests against Holger Rune and Paula Badosa.\n\nTop seed Novak Djokovic begins his title defence and quest for a 25th Grand Slam crown against Pierre-Hugues Herbert in the evening but the Serbian's top priority could well be to arrest a worrying run of form that has denied him any rhythm.", "source": {"uri": "timeslive.co.za", "dataType":

Sabalenka needed only an hour and 8 minutes at the Philippe-Chatrier to cruise through her first-round match on Tuesday, May 28.\n\nAryna Sabalenka dominated from start to finish, giving Erika Andreeva no chance of finding a way to fight back after going 1-4 down in the first set. World No. 100 Erika broke Sabalenka's serve in the second set, but she was broken back en route to a crushing defeat.\n\nAryna Sabalenka is one of the pre-tournament favourites. The Belarusian defended her Australian Open title at the start of the year and headed to Roland Garros with some impressive results on the red dirt. Sabalenka reached the final of the Madrid Open and Italian Open WTA 1000 tournaments, only to lose to World No. 1 Iga Swiatek in both finals. Sabalenka will face her toughest test against Swiatek in Paris too with the Polish star bidding to win her third successive French Open title.\n\n\"I don't know. I am trying to do well in clay. It's tough conditions here. I am really enjoying. I am really trying to play my best tennis, regardless of clay court or grass court,\" Sabalenka said when she was asked if she was becoming a clay court specialist. Notably, Sabalenka's best result in Roland Garros is a run to the semi-final in 2023.\n\nSabalenka will take on the winner of another first-round match between two qualifiers Burillo Escorihuela and Uchijima.\n\nMeanwhile, 11th seed Alex De Minaur opened his campaign in the men's singles with a ruthless display of tennis. The Australian defeated World No. 60 Alex Michaelsen of the United States 6-1, 6-0, 6-2 in just an hour and 48 minutes at Court Simonne-Mathieu to reach the second round.\n\nDe Minaur will be hoping to better his best result at the French Open -- a second-round finish, having headed to the Roland Garros in good form -- quarter-final in Madrid, pre-quarterfinal in Rome.\n\n28th seed Tomas Etcheverry needed 3 hours and 26 minutes to beat local hope Arthur Cazaux 3-6, 6-2, 6-1, 6-4 and progress to the second round.", "source": {"uri": "indiatoday.in", "dataType": "news", "title": "India Today"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clay_court", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Clay court"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/French_Open", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "French Open"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Erika_Andreeva", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Erika Andreeva"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aryna_Sabalenka", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Aryna Sabalenka"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alex_de_Minaur", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Alex de Minaur"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grand_Slam_(tennis)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Grand Slam (tennis)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_WTA_number_1_ranked_singles_tennis_players", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "List of WTA number 1 ranked singles tennis players"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WTA_1000_tournaments", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "WTA 1000 tournaments"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iga_\u015awi\u0105tek", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Iga \u015awi\u0105tek"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Madrid_Open_(tennis)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Madrid Open (tennis)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Italian_Open_(tennis)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Italian Open (tennis)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Open", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Australian Open"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tennis", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Tennis"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paris", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Belarus", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Belarus"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Belarus"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arthur_Cazaux", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Arthur Cazaux"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grass_court", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Grass court"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Madrid", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Madrid"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Madrid"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Spain"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Business/Agriculture_and_Forestry/Field_Crops", "label": "dmoz/Business/Agriculture and Forestry/Field Crops", "wgt": 16}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Tennis/Tournaments", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Tennis/Tournaments", "wgt": 20}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Open_Source/Advocacy", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Open Source/Advocacy", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Open_Source/Conferences", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Open Source/Conferences", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Hardware/Open_Source", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Hardware/Open Source", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 99}], "image": "https://akm-img-a-in.tosshub.com/indiatoday/images/story/202405/aryna-sabalenka-281415841-16x9_0.jpg?VersionId=MG9qZ5M4nskf51xbUsd7tDOxmQJLHXEE", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9604689", "eventUri": "eng-9604689", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-05-28", "textStart": 382, "textEnd": 388}], "sentiment": 0.003921568627450966, "wgt": 176, "relevance": 1}

I don't want to open Pandora's Box.\"\n\nOn Tuesday, Djokovic will take on French wildcard Pierre-Hugues Herbert, the world number 142 who hasn't won a match on the main tour this year.\n\nRuud, who won clay-court titles in Barcelona and Geneva in the build-up to Roland Garros, cruised to a 6-3, 6-4, 6-3 victory over Brazilian qualifier Felipe Meligeni Alves.\n\n\"It's great to be back here at Roland Garros,\" he said. \"Hopefully I can make it another good year here.\"\n\nRuud was beaten in straight sets by Novak Djokovic in last year's final following a one-sided loss to Rafael Nadal in the 2022 showpiece.\n\nHe also lost the 2022 US Open final to Carlos Alcaraz.\n\nFrenchwoman Alize Cornet's career ended with a straight-sets defeat by Zheng Qinwen in her record-extending 69th consecutive Grand Slam appearance.\n\nCornet was no match for China's Australian Open runner-up Zheng, losing 6-2, 6-1.\n\nShe made her debut at Roland Garros as a 15-year-old in 2005 and has not missed a Grand Slam tournament since the 2006 US Open.\n\n- 'Cried watching Rafa' -\n\nCornet reached a career-high ranking of 11th in 2009 and enjoyed a surprise run to the 2022 Australian Open quarter-finals.\n\n\"I already cried yesterday watching Rafa,\" said a tearful Cornet after seeing Nadal lose what was likely his last match at the French Open on Monday.\n\nOver on Court Suzanne Lenglen, Rybakina powered into the second round with a 6-2, 6-3 victory over Belgian Greet Minnen and could face three-time Grand Slam champion Angelique Kerber for a place in the last 32.\n\nKazakh world number four Rybakina is the only player to defeat tournament favourite Iga Swiatek on clay this season, in the Stuttgart semi-finals in April.\n\nElsewhere on Tuesday, two-time Australian Open champion Aryna Sabalenka gets her bid to reach a first Roland Garros final underway.\n\nThe world number two has reached at least the semi-finals in each of the past six Grand Slam events.\n\nSabalenka is also the only woman to beat world number one and three-time French Open winner Swiatek in a final on clay -- in Madrid last year -- since the Pole lost her first WTA title decider as a teenager in 2019 at a low-key event in Switzerland.\n\nThe 26-year-old Sabalenka had never even reached the second week at Roland Garros until last year, when she was knocked out by Karolina Muchova in the semi-finals.\n\nShe starts her Paris campaign against Russia's Erika Andreeva.\n\nAlso on court in the men's singles is Argentine qualifier Roman Andres Burruchaga who has sporting success in the blood.\n\nHis father Jorge famously scored the winning goal for Diego Maradona's Argentina in the 1986 World Cup final against West Germany.\n\nRanked at 144, the 22-year-old is making his Grand Slam debut and takes on Germany's Jan-Lennard Struff.", "source": {"uri": "zawya.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Zawya.com"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

Ruud triumphed over Felipe Alves in straight sets while Sabalenka swiftly defeated Erika Andreeva. The conditions limited action to the main courts, but the players' spirits remained high.\n\nCasper Ruud and Aryna Sabalenka shone brightly on a cold, rainy day at the French Open on Tuesday as they moved into the second round with dominant victories but spectators at Roland Garros were largely starved of action with a long evening looming.\n\nWith the weather preventing any chance of play on the outer courts before 4 p.m. local time, the proceedings were limited to the two main showcourts - Philippe Chatrier and Suzanne Lenglen - both of which have retractable roofs. Twice runner-up Ruud swept aside Brazilian qualifier Felipe Alves 6-3 6-4 6-3 in a renewed bid for a maiden Grand Slam title in Paris after disappointments in the previous two years.\n\nHigh on confidence following his Geneva triumph, the world number seven produced a masterclass in serving as he raced past his unheralded opponent in under two hours. \"This is one of the biggest tournaments for me and everyone every year. One of my highlights. I'm always looking forward to it. The last two years have given me so much here,\" Ruud said.\n\n\"I hope I can make it another good year.\" Sabalenka was equally quick as last year's semi-finalist, who is eyeing a second major of the season after her successful Australian Open defence in January, mowed down Russian teenager Erika Andreeva in 68 minutes 6-1 6-2.\n\n\"I'm super happy to be back on this special court. Super to see all of you today supporting us. It was a great atmosphere,\" Sabalenka said. \"I know you guys didn't have a choice, it's raining outside so you had to be on this court but anyway, thank you so much.\"\n\nFourth seed Elena Rybakina overcame an early wobble to glide past Belgian Greet Minnen 6-2 6-3 earlier in the day, showing no signs of the illness that had hampered her preparations for the year's second major. The third straight rain-hit day of the tournament began with a big outpouring of love for Frenchwoman Alize Cornet, as one of the ever-present players at Grand Slams in the last two decades bid adieu after her opening loss to seventh seed Zheng Qinwen.\n\nThe holder of the Open era women's record for consecutive Grand Slam main draw appearances with 69, Cornet had previously said she would retire after the tournament. Australian Alex De Minaur thumped Alex Michelsen, Petra Martic overcame Kristina Mladenovic and Arantxa Rus stunned three-times Grand Slam champion Angelique Kerber in the few matches that were completed on the outside courts.\n\nWith typically British weather descending on Roland Garros, the nation's last two hopes in the singles draws - Dan Evans and Katie Boulter - will hope to extend their stays but face tough tests against Holger Rune and Paula Badosa. Top seed Novak Djokovic begins his title defence and quest for a 25th Grand Slam crown against Pierre-Hugues Herbert in the evening but the Serbian's top priority could well be to arrest a worrying run of form that has denied him any rhythm.\n\n(This story has not been edited by Devdiscourse staff and is auto-generated from a syndicated feed.)", "source": {"uri": "devdiscourse.com", "dataType":

losing only to Iga Swiatek and Marketa Vondrousova - and wasted little time to get going on Court Philippe Chatrier.\n\nAfter breaking in the fourth game when 19-year-old Andreeva hit a double fault, Sabalenka fired up her forehand to quickly build up a 5-1 lead and closed out the opening set when her opponent sent a shot wide.\n\nSabalenka pounced on world number 100 Andreeva's serve again to grab the lead in the second set before handing the break back while attempting a chip from deep, but last year's semifinalist promptly surged ahead 4-2 after saving more breakpoints.\n\nHaving neutralised the increased threat from Andreeva, she wrapped up the contest on serve in 68 minutes, finishing it off on her third matchpoint with a sublime drop shot at the net to huge cheers from the crowd.", "source": {"uri": "khaleejtimes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Khaleej times"}, "authors": [{"uri": "reuters@khaleejtimes.com", "name": "Reuters", "type": "author", "isAgency": true}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aryna_Sabalenka", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Aryna Sabalenka"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/French_Open", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "French Open"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Erika_Andreeva", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Erika Andreeva"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russia", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Russia"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Russia"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philippe_Chatrier", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Philippe Chatrier"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Suzanne_Lenglen", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Suzanne Lenglen"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Retractable_roof", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Retractable roof"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Casper_Ruud", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Casper Ruud"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paris", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Belarus", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Belarus"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Belarus"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Open", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Australian Open"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serena_Williams", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Serena Williams"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grand_Slam_(tennis)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Grand Slam (tennis)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Melbourne", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Melbourne"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Melbourne"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Australia"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geneva", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Geneva"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Geneva"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Switzerland"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iga_\u015awi\u0105tek", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Iga \u015awi\u0105tek"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mark\u00e9ta_Vondrou\u0161ov\u00e1", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Mark\u00e9ta Vondrou\u0161ov\u00e1"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stade_Roland_Garros", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Stade Roland Garros"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Forehand", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Forehand"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drop_shot", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Drop shot"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reuters", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Reuters"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Games", "label": "dmoz/Games", "wgt": 9}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Future/Millennialism", "label": "dmoz/Society/Future/Millennialism", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Software/Year_2000", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Software/Year 2000", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Tennis/Tournaments", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Tennis/Tournaments", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Real_Estate/Legal", "label": "dmoz/Business/Real Estate/Legal", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 98}], "image": "https://image.khaleejtimes.com?uuid=64482f00-ca74-5b6e-a3b4-4fbd7460dc9c&function=cropresize&type=preview&source=false&q=75&crop_w=0.99999&crop_h=0.80357&width=1200&height=675&x=1.0E-5&y=0.02857.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9604689", "eventUri": "eng-9604689", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.07450980392156858, "wgt": 169, "relevance": 1}

Casper Ruud's strong performance and Zheng Qinwen's victory add further excitement.\n\nFollowing is a summary of current sports news briefs.\n\nTennis-Sabalenka mows down teenager Andreeva in French Open first round\n\nSecond seed Aryna Sabalenka launched her bid for a maiden French Open title and second Grand Slam crown of the year with a breezy 6-1 6-2 first-round win over Russian teenager Erika Andreeva on Tuesday that will serve as a warning to her main rivals. The 26-year-old, who successfully defended her Australian Open title earlier this year, arrived at Roland Garros as a top contender after strong results in the European clay swing and wasted little time to get going on Court Philippe Chatrier.\n\nTennis-Paris darling Nadal exits French Open in farewell-like defeat\n\nRafael Nadal exited what could be his last French Open to an outpouring of love and support with a first-round defeat by Alexander Zverev, wishing to be back at Roland Garros for the Paris 2024 Olympics. \"I hope to see you again, but I don't know,\" Nadal told an ecstatic crowd after his straight-sets loss on Monday.\n\nTennis-Rybakina eases past Minnen into French Open second round\n\nWorld number four Elena Rybakina recovered from a rocky start to comfortably beat Belgian Greet Minnen 6-2 6-3 in the French Open first round on Tuesday, showing a full recovery from her recent illness. Rybakina was unable to defend her Italian Open title and after losing serve in the opening game at Roland Garros and going 2-0 down, it looked like the Kazakh could be in trouble.\n\nGolf-Thompson to retire after 2024 LPGA season\n\nAmerican Lexi Thompson, a former major champion and two-time Olympian, will retire from full-time competitive golf following the 2024 season, the LPGA announced on Tuesday. The 29-year-old Thompson is an 11-time winner on the LPGA Tour and will be making her 18th consecutive start in a U.S. Women's Open when she tees off at Lancaster Country Club in Pennsylvania on Thursday.\n\nBill Walton, NBA Hall of Famer and free spirit, dead at 71\n\nBill Walton, a two-time NBA champion and member of the basketball Hall of Fame, whose brilliant but injury-riddled career led to a second act as a free-spirited broadcaster who waxed philosophical on the air, died on Monday at the age of 71, the National Basketball Association announced. Walton, who had a prolonged battle with cancer, was surrounded by his family when he died, the National Basketball Association said.\n\nCeltics complete sweep of Pacers, punch ticket to Finals\n\nDerrick White had missed 7 of 8 3-point attempts when he found himself open in the right corner of the floor in the final minute of a tie game with an NBA Finals berth at stake. He watched Jaylen Brown handle the ball and was just waiting for his Boston Celtics teammate to deliver a pass. Once Brown did just that, it was White's turn to make a play.\n\nTennis-Two-time finalist Ruud makes winning start in quest for French Open title\n\nTwo-time French Open finalist Casper Ruud eased past Brazilian qualifier Felipe Alves in straight sets on Tuesday as he launched a renewed bid for a maiden title in Paris. Fresh from his win in Geneva last week the world number seven and three-time Grand Slam finalist looked confident on the Paris clay, serving close to 90% first serves as he sped past the Brazilian in under two hours.\n\nTennis-Nadal would have beat most players with level against Zverev, says Wilander\n\nRafa Nadal's level of tennis during his French Open defeat by Alexander Zverev on Monday would have earned him victory against the vast majority of players in the draw, according to former Roland Garros champion Mats Wilander. The 37-year-old Spaniard, who missed almost all of 2023 with injuries, went down in straight sets to the fourth-seed German as Zverev became only the third player to beat the 14-time champion on the Parisian clay.\n\nTennis-Zheng sends Cornet into retirement with French Open thumping\n\nSeventh seed Zheng Qinwen powered past Alize Cornet 6-2 6-1 and into the second round of the French Open on Tuesday, sending the Frenchwoman into retirement with a heavy defeat at her home Grand Slam, where she has featured for 20 straight years. The 34-year-old Cornet, holder of the Open era women's record for consecutive major main draw appearances, had previously announced that she would bring the curtain down on her career after the tournament.\n\nMLB roundup: Rockies break Guardians' 9-game win streak\n\nCharlie Blackmon homered, doubled twice and drove in four runs and the Colorado Rockies used a six-run fourth inning to beat the red-hot Cleveland Guardians 8-6 in Denver on Monday. Cleveland had its nine-game winning streak snapped, the team's longest run since it won an American League-record 22 games in a row from Aug. 24 to Sept. 14, 2017.\n\n(This story has not been edited

"Second seed Aryna Sabalenka launched her bid for a maiden French Open title and second Grand Slam crown of the year with a breezy 6-1 6-2 first-round win over Russian teenager Erika Andreeva that will serve as a warning to her main rivals.\n\nThe 26-year-old, who successfully defended her Australian Open title earlier this year, arrived at Roland Garros as a top contender after strong results in the European clay swing and wasted little time to get going on Court Philippe Chatrier.\n\nAfter breaking in the fourth game when 19-year-old Andreeva hit a double fault, Sabalenka fired up her forehand to quickly build up a 5-1 lead and closed out the opening set when her opponent sent a shot wide.\n\nSabalenka pounced on world number 100 Andreeva's serve again to grab the lead in the second set before handing the break back while attempting a chip from deep, but last year's semi-finalist promptly surged ahead 4-2 after saving more breakpoints.\n\nHaving neutralised the increased threat from Andreeva, she wrapped up the contest on serve in 68 minutes, finishing it off on her third matchpoint with a sublime drop shot at the net to huge cheers from the crowd.\n\nElsewhere, seventh seed Zheng Qinwen powered past Alize Cornet 6-2 6-1 and into the second round, sending the Frenchwoman into retirement with a heavy defeat at her home Grand Slam, where she has featured for 20 straight years.\n\nThe 34-year-old Cornet, holder of the Open era women's record for consecutive major main draw appearances, had previously announced that she would bring the curtain down on her career after the tournament.\n\nCornet will still compete in the women's doubles and mixed doubles events before she walks away from the sport after almost 20 years as a professional.\n\nIn the men's competition, two-time finalist Casper Ruud eased past Brazilian qualifier Felipe Alves in straight sets as he launched a renewed bid for a maiden title in Paris.\n\nFresh from his win in Geneva last week, the world number seven and three-time Grand Slam finalist looked confident on the Paris clay, serving close to 90 per cent first serves as he sped past the Brazilian 6-3 6-4 6-3 in under two hours.\n\nHe will face either Monaco's Valentin Vacherot or Spaniard Alejandro Davidovich Fokina in the second round.", "source": {"uri": "dubaieye1038.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Dubai Eye

One of my highlights. I'm always looking forward to it. The last two years have given me so much here,\" Ruud said.\n\n\"I hope I can make it another good year.\"\n\nSabalenka was equally quick as last year's semi-finalist, who is eyeing a second major of the season after her successful Australian Open defence in January, mowed down Russian teenager Erika Andreeva in 68 minutes 6-1 6-2.\n\n\"I'm super happy to be back on this special court. Super to see all of you today supporting us. It was a great atmosphere,\" Sabalenka said.\n\n\"I know you guys didn't have a choice, it's raining outside so you had to be on this court but anyway, thank you so much.\"\n\nFourth seed Elena Rybakina overcame an early wobble to glide past Belgian Greet Minnen 6-2 6-3 earlier in the day, showing no signs of the illness that had hampered her preparations for the year's second major.\n\nThe third straight rain-hit day of the tournament began with a big outpouring of love for Frenchwoman Alize Cornet, as one of the ever-present players at Grand Slams in the last two decades bid adieu after her opening loss to seventh seed Zheng Qinwen.\n\nThe holder of the Open era women's record for consecutive Grand Slam main draw appearances with 69, Cornet had previously said she would retire after the tournament.\n\nAustralian Alex De Minaur thumped Alex Michelsen, Petra Martic overcame Kristina Mladenovic and Arantxa Rus stunned three-times Grand Slam champion Angelique Kerber in the few matches that were completed on the outside courts.\n\nWith typically British weather descending on Roland Garros, the nation's last two hopes in the singles draws - Dan Evans and Katie Boulter - will hope to extend their stays but face tough tests against Holger Rune and Paula Badosa.\n\nTop seed Novak Djokovic begins his title defence and quest for a 25th Grand Slam crown against Pierre-Hugues Herbert in the evening but the Serbian's top priority could well be to arrest a worrying run of form that has denied him any rhythm.", "source": {"uri": "channelnewsasia.com", "dataType": "news",

Having neutralised the increased threat from Andreeva, she wrapped up the contest on serve in 68 minutes, finishing it off on her third matchpoint with a sublime drop shot at the net to huge cheers from the crowd.\n\n(This story has not been edited by Devdiscourse staff and is auto-generated from a syndicated feed.)", "source": {"uri": "devdiscourse.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Devdiscourse"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aryna_Sabalenka", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Aryna Sabalenka"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/French_Open", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "French Open"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Erika_Andreeva", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Erika Andreeva"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Open", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Australian Open"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grand_Slam_(tennis)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Grand Slam (tennis)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Double_fault_(tennis)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Double fault (tennis)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stade_Roland_Garros", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Stade Roland Garros"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clay_court", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Clay court"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Forehand", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Forehand"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drop_shot", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Drop shot"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Open_Source", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Open Source", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Open_Source/Articles", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Open Source/Articles", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Open_Source/Advocacy", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Open Source/Advocacy", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Hardware/Open_Source", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Hardware/Open Source", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Real_Estate/Legal", "label": "dmoz/Business/Real Estate/Legal", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 99}], "image": "https://www.devdiscourse.com/remote.axd?https://devdiscourse.blob.core.windows.net/devnews/17_05_2024_09_57_20_9862037.jpg?width=920&format=jpeg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9604689", "eventUri": "eng-9604689", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1607843137254903, "wgt": 155, "relevance": 1}

Sabalenka hit 27 winners to just 16 unforced errors in the 15 games that the two played.\n\nRead on for more top takeaways from Sabalenka's victory, from her continued success at the first hurdle of Grand Slams, to her finishing power in what's been a successful clay-court campaign thus far.\n\nSabalenka is almost a sure thing in Grand Slam first rounds: Sabalenka is now 20-5 all-time in first rounds at Grand Slams, but since becoming one of the game's top players, she's becoming nearly immune to an opening upset. Three of those losses came in her first four career Grand Slam main draws, and her last, at the 2020 Australian Open, came at the hands of a former Top 10 player in Carla Su\u00e1rez Navarro.\n\nSabalenka, in fact, hasn't lost a set in a first-round match at a Grand Slam in two years.\n\n\"It was great match, great start for me. I think I was focusing on myself the whole game. I think that's why I was able to bring such good tennis,\" Sabalenka said afterward, noting that she adjusted well to humid conditions with the roof closed.\n\n\"In these conditions I just prepare myself for long rallies and I'm not trying to hit bigger, because if you hit bigger it brings more unforced errors, which is not really something I'm looking to. I'm just preparing myself mentally that it's going to be longer points and it's going to take more shots to finish the point.\"\n\nClay is also continuing to treat her well in 2024: Sabalenka is now 12-3 on clay this season with all three losses coming to Grand Slam champions in Iga Swiatek (Madrid, Rome) and Marketa Vondrousova (Stuttgart).\n\nA second-week guarantee? Roland Garros was long Sabalenka's least successful major: She fell in the first week five times before she reached the semifinals last year, but the story is much different for her 12 months later.\n\nShe'll next face the winner of a match between two qualifiers, and her third-round seed, No.26 Katie Boulter, did not play a clay-court match at WTA level until this year. Though there are several unseeded players in her second that have the pedigree to derail her path to the last 16 -- including former World No.2 Paula Badosa, 2018 Roland Garros finalist Sloane Stephens, and two-time Paris quarterfinalist Yulia Putintseva -- the in-form second seed is a heavy favorite to feature in the second week.\n\n\"There [are] lots of things I improved,\" Sabalenka said. \"I would say my serve is much better right now. Also my, like, drop shots, slice game is way better. I would say that mentally I'm more stronger than I was last year.\"", "source": {"uri": "wtatennis.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Women's Tennis Association"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grand_Slam_(tennis)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Grand Slam (tennis)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Open", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Australian Open"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Erika_Andreeva", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Erika Andreeva"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aryna_Sabalenka", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Aryna Sabalenka"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clay_court", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Clay court"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/French_Open", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "French Open"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carla_Su\u00e1rez_Navarro", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Carla Su\u00e1rez Navarro"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tennis", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Tennis"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paula_Badosa", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Paula Badosa"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iga_\u015awi\u0105tek", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Iga \u015awi\u0105tek"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mark\u00e9ta_Vondrou\u0161ov\u00e1", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Mark\u00e9ta Vondrou\u0161ov\u00e1"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Katie_Boulter", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Katie Boulter"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drop_shot", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Drop shot"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yulia_Putintseva", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Yulia Putintseva"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sloane_Stephens", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Sloane Stephens"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Women's_Tennis_Association", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Women's Tennis Association"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Madrid", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Madrid"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Madrid"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Spain"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stuttgart", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Stuttgart"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Stuttgart"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Germany"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Games", "label": "dmoz/Games", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Recreation", "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Recreation", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Crafts/Modeling_Compounds", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Crafts/Modeling Compounds", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Dice/Golo_Golf", "label": "dmoz/Games/Dice/Golo Golf", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Tennis/Tournaments", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Tennis/Tournaments", "wgt": 18}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 98}], "image": "https://photoresources.wtatennis.com/photo-resources/2024/05/28/efb48014-081c-4175-ad00-55609d01fa96/Aryna_Sabalenka_-_Roland_Garros_2024_-_Day_3-DSC_1699.jpg?width=1200&height=630", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9604689", "eventUri": "eng-9604689", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.3960784313725489, "wgt": 155, "relevance": 1}

The popular Frenchwoman Cornet announced last month that she would be retiring after this year's home tournament.\n\nThe 34-year-old former world number 11, who twice made the fourth round, was granted a wild card and a spot on Court Philippe Chatrier for what she described as \"the last dance\". She bowed out of her 20th Roland Garros, and her 72nd appearance at a grand slam, with a 6-2, 6-1 loss to the seventh seed, Qinwen Zheng.\n\nCornet, who played her first French Open aged 15, said: \"It's been a difficult day with a lot of emotion. It's a 20-year page that I'm turning and I'm going to a new chapter in my life. I wish I could have played better, but I gave everything I could to this sport.\"\n\nElsewhere, Casper Ruud and Aryna Sabalenka shone brightly on a cold, rainy day as they moved into the second round with dominant victories but spectators at Roland Garros were largely starved of action beyond the show courts with a long evening looming.\n\nWith the weather preventing any chance of play on the outer courts before 4pm local time, the proceedings were limited to the two main show courts - Philippe Chatrier and Suzanne Lenglen - both of which have retractable roofs.\n\nThe two-time runner-up Ruud swept aside the Brazilian qualifier Felipe Alves 6-3, 6-4, 6-3, in a renewed bid for a maiden grand slam title in Paris after disappointments in the previous two years.\n\nHigh on confidence after his Geneva triumph, the world No 7 produced a masterclass in serving as he raced past his unheralded opponent in under two hours. \"This is one of the biggest tournaments for me and everyone every year,\" Ruud said. \"One of my highlights. I'm always looking forward to it. The last two years have given me so much here. I hope I can make it another good year.\"\n\nSabalenka was equally quick as last year's semi-finalist, who is eyeing a second major of the season after her successful Australian Open defence in January, mowed down the Russian teenager Erika Andreeva in 68 minutes 6-1, 6-2.\n\n\"I'm super happy to be back on this special court,\" Sabalenka said. \"Super to see all of you today supporting us.

Three-time Grand Slam winner Angelique Kerber failed to reach the next round of the clay-court grand slam as she went down to Dutch player Arantxa Rus, who won 6-4, 6-3.Sabalenka cruised into the second round of the French Open with a 6-1, 6-2 win over Erika Andreeva on Court Philippe-Chatrier.\n\nThe two-time reigning Australian Open champion needed just 1 hour and 8 minutes to move through to the second round and drop the elder of the two Andreeva sisters to 0-3 in Grand Slam main draws in her career.\n\nAlready 2-0 against the younger of the two, top 40-ranked Mirra Andreeva, Sabalenka broke the World No.100's serve five times, and tripled her opponent's total of winners, to win her first-ever match against 19-year-old Erika. Sabalenka hit 27 winners to just 16 unforced errors in the 15 games that the two played.\n\nRybakina started slowly but was near-untouchable as she defeated Greet Minnen 6-2, 6-3 in the first round of Roland Garros.\n\nThe former Wimbledon champion was playing her first match in over three weeks, since her defeat in the semifinals in Madrid to Sabalenka, after illness forced her to withdraw from Rome.\n\nThere was some rust in her game at the start of the match as she began with eight straight unforced errors, including a double fault to drop serve in the opening game.\n\nIn the end, she squandered her first match point at 5-1 with a netted drop shot attempt and needed a second chance to serve out victory.\n\nBut for the majority of the match, Rybakina was in dazzling form. From 2-0 down, she rattled off 10 successive games, raining winners down on Minnen from all parts of the court. The Kazakhstan player's forehand was the bedrock of her run, but she also deployed successful drop shots repeatedly and was quick to swarm the net when the opportunity presented itself. In total, she fired 36 winners to 21 unforced errors and won 14 out of 21 points at the net.\n\nChinese star Zheng Qinwen ended the final French Open tournament of the chequered career of Aliz\u00e9 Cornet as the No.7 seed romped to a 6-2, 6-1 victory in the first round. Cornet is participating in the final tournament of her storied career and a lot of people expected her to cause a huge upset one last time.\n\nCornet owns 25 Top 10 wins, spanning multiple generations of players and nearly two decades. Zheng, however, was in no mood to become the 26th. The Australian Open finalist dealt with the occasion coolly to end Cornet's career in 1 hour and 23 minutes.\n\nThe Philippe-Chatrier stands greeted Cornet's last dance before even the first point had been played, but it was Zheng who controlled the tempo of the match throughout. The 21-year-old struck 25 winners to 19 unforced errors, successfully using her raw power to keep Cornet at bay.\n\nThe Frenchwoman roused local hopes briefly in the first set as she pulled back from 4-0 down to 4-2, and was able to show off her array of defensive spins and angles as she dragged Zheng into some excellent exchanges.", "source": {"uri": "weeklyvoice.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Weekly Voice"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Angelique_Kerber", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Angelique Kerber"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grand_Slam_(tennis)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Grand Slam (tennis)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/French_Open", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "French Open"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Erika_Andreeva", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Erika Andreeva"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zheng_Qinwen", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Zheng Qinwen"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aryna_Sabalenka", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Aryna Sabalenka"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arantxa_Rus", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Arantxa Rus"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elena_Rybakina", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Elena Rybakina"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clay_court", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Clay court"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Open", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Australian Open"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paris", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Netherlands", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Netherlands"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Netherlands"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mirra_Andreeva", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Mirra Andreeva"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wimbledon_Championships", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Wimbledon Championships"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greet_Minnen", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Greet Minnen"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drop_shot", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Drop shot"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aliz\u00e9_Cornet", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Aliz\u00e9 Cornet"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rome", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Rome"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Rome"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Italy"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Madrid", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Madrid"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Madrid"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Spain"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Forehand", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Forehand"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kazakhstan", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Kazakhstan"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Kazakhstan"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Recreation", "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Recreation", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Agriculture_and_Forestry/Field_Crops", "label": "dmoz/Business/Agriculture and Forestry/Field Crops", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Online/Play-By-E-Mail", "label": "dmoz/Games/Online/Play-By-E-Mail", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Tennis/Tournaments", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Tennis/Tournaments", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Clans_and_Guilds", "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Clans and Guilds", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 99}], "image": "https://weeklyvoice.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/202405283168065.png", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9604689", "eventUri": "eng-9604689", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-05-28", "textStart": 7, "textEnd": 13}], "sentiment": 0.4980392156862745, "wgt": 151, "relevance": 1}

I mean, I know that if I'll be able to focus on myself and I'll be able to fight for every point and try to find solution in each game I will be able to win these big tournaments,\" she said.\n\n\"But I just try to take it step by step.\"\n\nSabalenka arrived at Roland Garros as a top contender for the title after strong results in the European claycourt swing - losing only to Iga Swiatek and Marketa Vondrousova - and wasted little time to get going on Court Philippe Chatrier.\n\nAfter breaking in the fourth game when 19-year-old Andreeva hit a double fault, Sabalenka fired up her forehand to quickly build up a 5-1 lead and closed out the opening set when her opponent sent a shot wide.\n\nSabalenka pounced on world number 100 Andreeva's serve again to grab the lead in the second set before handing the break back while attempting a chip from deep, but last year's semi-finalist promptly surged ahead 4-2 after saving more breakpoints.\n\nHaving neutralised the increased threat from Andreeva, she wrapped up the contest on serve in 68 minutes, finishing it off on her third matchpoint with a sublime drop shot at the net to huge cheers from the crowd.\n\n\"In practice I do it very well,\" Sabalenka said on court earlier. \"But I wasn't sure I can do it on the match court.\n\n\"Now I started using it in the matches. It didn't work well before but now it has started working finally, after many years of practising my touch game.\"\n\nUp next for the Belarusian is Irene Burillo Escorihuela or Moyuka Uchijima, with the two qualifiers set to face off later.

But he was beaten by 19-year-old Shang Juncheng from China in the quarter-finals.\n\nEarlier this month, Evans split from coach Sebastian Prieto for the second time after a breakdown in their relationship.\n\nRune remains one of the best young talents on the ATP Tour but has also been struggling this year for results and consistency.\n\nWith Andy Murray, Jack Draper and Cameron Norrie already out there will be hope at the LTA that at least one British man makes it past the first round. Evans is the last hope, and on the women's side the last hope is Katie Boulter, who faces Paula Badosa later this evening. Two poor results and it would mean all of Britain's singles interest over before the first Tuesday is over.\n\nElsewhere today, fourth seed Elena Rybakina beat Belgium's Greet Minnen 6-2 6-3, overcoming a late fightback to ease through to the second round. Australian Open finalist Zheng Qinwen beat crowd favourite Alize Cornet 6-2, 6-1 in the Frenchwoman's 20th and final appearance at Roland Garros.\n\nIt was a good day for second seed Aryna Sabalenka, who breezed into the second round thanks to her 6-1, 6-2 demolition job on Erika Andreeva. The highly rated Russian teenager will have to put this defeat down to experience, she simply had no answer to the Belarusian this afternoon.\n\nNorwegian seventh seed Casper Ruud, French Open

One of my highlights. I'm always looking forward to it. The last two years have given me so much here,\" Ruud said. \"I hope I can make it another good year.\"\n\nSabalenka was equally quick as last year's semi-finalist, who is eyeing a second major of the season after her successful Australian Open defence, mowed down Russian teenager Erika Andreeva in 68 minutes 6-1 6-2.\n\n\"I'm super happy to be back on this special court. Super to see all of you today supporting us. It was a great atmosphere,\" Sabalenka said. \"I know you guys didn't have a choice, it's raining outside so you had to be on this court but anyway, thank you so much.\"\n\nFourth seed Elena Rybakina overcame an early wobble to glide past Belgian Greet Minnen 6-2 6-3 earlier in the day, showing no signs of the illness that had hampered her preparations for the year's second major.\n\nThe third straight rain-hit day of the tournament began with a big outpouring of love for Frenchwoman Alize Cornet, as one of the ever-present players at Grand Slams in the last two decades bid adieu after her opening loss to seventh seed Zheng Qinwen.\n\nThe holder of the Open era women's record for consecutive Grand Slam main draw appearances with 69, Cornet had previously said she would retire after the tournament.\n\nAustralian Alex De Minaur thumped Alex Michelsen, Petra Martic overcame Kristina Mladenovic and Arantxa Rus stunned three-times Grand Slam champion Angelique Kerber in the few matches that were completed on the outside courts.", "source": {"uri": "odt.co.nz", "dataType": "news", "title": "Otago Daily Times Online News"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

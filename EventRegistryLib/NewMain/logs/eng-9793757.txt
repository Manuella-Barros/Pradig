In the final against Acosta, Lopez showcased his wrestling prowess with a roll-off par terre in the first period, followed by a takedown in the second, which sealed the victory for the Cuban.\n\nAfter the bout, Lopez took off his shoes and placed them on the mat. He is retiring after the Olympics, ending one of the great careers in wrestling history.\n\n\"It's a moment to demonstrate that someone has retired officially from the sport of wrestling and that also leaves a path wide open for the younger generation to continue inspiring others,\" he said.\n\nLopez first represented Cuba at the Olympic Games in Athens in 2004. He lost in the quarterfinals to Russia's Khasan Baroyev, one of Lopez's career rivals.\n\nThe pair met four years later in the 120-kg final at Beijing in 2008. Lopez avenged his defeat, capturing his first Olympic gold medal. He followed up his success in Beijing with back-to-back world championship titles in the 120-kg division.\n\nHe defended his Olympic gold in London in 2012. When the weight classifications were revised for Rio in 2016, increasing from 120 kg to 130 kg, it didn't matter for Lopez. He won his third consecutive Olympic gold, defeating Turkey's Riza Kayaalp, who previously prevented Lopez from winning his third straight world championship in 2011.\n\nLopez joined an accomplished list of athletes when he won his fourth consecutive Olympic gold in Tokyo. He was the eighth athlete to win four Olympic golds in the same individual event, joining Japanese wrestler Kaori Icho, Denmark sailor Paul Elvstrom, American discus thrower Al Oerter, sprinter Carl Lewis and swimming icons Michael Phelps and Katie Ledecky.\n\nThat changed Tuesday with Lopez's win over Acosta, who represents Chile but was born in Cuba. Acosta began representing Chile in 2017 because Lopez was ahead of him when it came to the Olympics.\n\n\"He's a rival, but also a friend,\" Acosta said. \"We have known each other for a long time now. We did the trials together for this year's Olympic Games. He has been giving me advice in every phase, so he's everything, a rival, a friend, he's a brother.\"\n\nLopez served as Cuba's flag bearer in 2008, 2012, 2016 and 2020. Asked about his future, he said he would like to \"educate the younger generations.\"\n\nAsked to describe his five gold medals in one word, Lopez said, \"Beijing -- youth. London -- transcendence. Rio -- effort. Tokyo -- sacrifice. Paris -- joy.\"", "source": {"uri": "nytimes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The New York Times"}, "authors": [{"uri": "lukas_weese@nytimes.com", "name": "Lukas Weese", "type": "author",

When Cuban Greco-Roman wrestler Mijain Lopez begins his Olympic campaign in Paris, he will be doing so in pursuit of a new type of Olympic dominance; becoming the first Olympian to win five consecutive gold medals in the same event.\n\nLopez made his debut at the 2004 Athens Olympics. He made it to the quarterfinals of the competition, where he lost to Khasan Baroyev of Russia. Four years later, Lopez returned to the 2008 Beijing Olympics and avenged this defeat, overcoming Baroyev in the gold medal final. Between Lopez's first bout of the 2008 Games and today, he has not lost.\n\nOver the next two games, Lopez established a period of Olympic dominance. He beat Heiki Nabi of Estonia at the 2012 London Olympics and Riza Kayaalp of Turkey in the 2016 Rio Olympics to secure two more gold medals and match (he would eventually break) the record for most consecutive wrestling medals by a man, a record that previously held by Russian wrestler Aleksandr Karelin, who had three in the 130kg event.\n\nALSO READ | Lakshya Sen loses to Lee Zii Jia in men's badminton bronze medal match in Paris 2024 Olympics\n\nComing into the 2020 Tokyo Games, it did appear as if Lopez' career may have been coming to an end.\n\nIn an interview on the Olympic website, he said, \"I think it's almost the end of Mijain Lopez, but I want to do it with the desire and joy I've always had.\"\n\nLopez would have bowed out in a fairytale manner, beating Iakob Kajala of Georgia in the final bout to win four gold medals in the same event, an unprecedented feat. He joined an elite club of people who have four Olympic gold medals in the same event including Carl Lewis and Michael Phelps.\n\nNow, Lopez is back in Paris, and is determined to win five consecutive golds in the same event. At the age of 41, it will not be easy, and he goes into it unseeded, but Lopez feels that he is up to the challenge.\n\nALSO READ | Paris 2024 Olympics: Boxers in gender dispute will remain in Games, IOC says\n\n\"The preparation is done. I feel in optimal condition and all wrestlers are motivated both in Cuba and internationally. It has been a very important time for me to keep the motivation to get to my sixth Olympic Games and fight for my fifth medal.\" Lopez said in an interview with United World Wrestling Press.\n\n\"Something I am doing with great focus is to be able to show the world that everything you have in mind, and want to achieve, can be achieved. I know it's in my mind, and I believe that the possibility of achieving that result is high,\" he added.\n\nRegardless of the outcome of this Olympics, Lopez has already secured his place as one of the greatest Olympic athletes of all time. However, Lopez's quest for a new page in the Olympic record books will be an interesting storyline to keep an eye out in the latter stages of the Paris 2024 Olympics.\n\nList of athletes with four

Cuban Greco-Roman wrestler aiming to make Olympic history with fifth consecutive gold medal", "body": "When you think of the all-time greatest Olympian, it's hard not to immediately think of Michael Phelps. The American swimmer ended his Olympic career with a jaw-dropping 23 gold medals and 28 total, running away with the title of most decorated Olympian ever.\n\nHowever, there is a Cuban wrestler who may be challenging Phelps' claim as the most dominant Olympian of all time -- Mijain Lopez.\n\nThe Greco-Roman wrestler who competes in the 130kg weight class has a chance at history on Tuesday afternoon. Lopez is the four-time defending Olympic gold medalist in his weight class, first winning the 130kg division in 2008 in Beijing and successfully defending his title in 2012, 2016 and 2021.\n\nThe 41-year-old is already considered to be one of the greatest wrestlers of all time. In total, Lopez has 32 gold medals in his career, which includes competing at the World Championships, World Cup, Pan American Games, Pan American Championships and the Olympics.\n\nWhat Lopez can do now is solidify himself as arguably the greatest individual Olympian in history. He takes on Chile's Yasmani Acosta in the gold medal match, and if Lopez were to claim gold yet again, he would become the first Olympian ever to win five consecutive gold medals in a single individual event.\n\nHere is more to know about Lopez and his historic Olympic career.\n\n2024 PARIS OLYMPICS\n\nFull Olympics schedule | How to watch in USA | Meet NBC's broadcasters\n\nLopez is a Greco-Roman wrestler from Cuba who competes in the 130kg weight class.\n\nThe towering figure, whose full name is Mijain Lopez Nunez, was born in the town of Pinar Del Rio. He is the younger brother of Michel Lopez Nunez, who is a former boxer in the super heavyweight division.\n\nLopez was named one of the flag bearers for Cuba this year, carrying his country's banner along with judoka Idalys Ortiz. He also carried Cuba's flag at the 2008, 2012, 2016 and 2020 Olympics.\n\nWhile his resume is incredibly impressive, arguably the best part of Lopez's story is his nicknames. Lopez is known as \"El Terrible,\" which is Spanish for \"The Terrible\" -- a fitting moniker considering the size (and success) of the veteran wrestler. He also is referred to as \"Gigante de Herradura\" or \"the giant from Herradura.\" Herradura is one of the villages located in Pinar Del Rio.\n\nLopez entered the 2024 Paris Olympics with four gold medals to his name.\n\nHe made his Olympic debut in 2004 but missed out on the podium spot. After winning his pool, he advanced to the qualification round but lost to Russia's Khasan Baroev. The Russian went on to win the gold medal -- the last time someone other than Lopez was the 130kg Olympic champ in Greco-Roman wrestling.\n\nBEST U.S. OLYMPIANS\n\nTop 33 rankings | Simone Biles | Katie Ledecky | Jesse Owens\n\nLopez won his first Olympic gold medal in 2008 when he defeated Lithuania's Mindaugas Mizgaitis in Beijing. He then defended his gold medal in Rio at the 2016 Olympics, beating Estonia's Heiki Nabi in the gold medal match.\n\nIn 2016, Lopez went up against Turkey's Riza Kayaalp for the gold medal, successfully completing the three-peat at 130kg. He then made it four in a row in Tokyo when he won gold against Georgia's Iakobi Kajaia.\n\nBorn on Aug. 20, 1982, Lopez is 41 years old, soon to be turning 42.\n\nWin or lose on Tuesday, it will be Lopez's final wrestling match in his stellar career. The Cuban is electing to call it quits after competing on the international stage for over 20 years.\n\n\"I'll be retiring, it's over,\" Lopez said ahead of the gold medal match. \"We need to make some space for those who are coming (into the sport).

He does this for the love of his sport, for his pleasure. If God gave him the opportunity to be the greatest in history, why not take advantage of it?\" his coach Raul Trujillo told AFP.\n\nLopez received a standing ovation from the crowd on Tuesday before the legend placed his shoes in the middle of the mat, a tradition for retiring wrestlers.\n\n\"We have to make room for the young people who are coming through to ensure continuity,\" he had said Monday after qualifying for the final.\n\n\"Wrestling has been the love of my life, for all of my life.\"\n\nHis record could be equalled in four years' time if Ledecky, 27, decides to keep swimming at the 2028 Los Angeles Olympics.\n\nAcosta, 36, who recently switched allegiance to Chile as federation rules allow just one wrestler per nation to enter each category at the Olympics, described Lopez as a \"legend worldwide\".\n\n\"He's a rival, but also a friend. We have known each other for a long time now. We did the trials together for this year's Olympic Games,\" said Acosta.\n\n\"He has been giving me advice in every phase, so he's everything, a rival, a friend, he's a brother.\"\n\nThe two men found time for a friendly chat just before the final got underway.\n\n\"I asked him, as a joke, if he had any advice to give me before the final. He responded, 'What do you mean? The final is against me.' But at the end, he just wished me a good match.\"", "source": {"uri": "namibian.com.na", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Namibian"}, "authors": [{"uri": "helge_schutz@namibian.com.na", "name":

Fernandez left his home country because he knew he would probably never make an Olympic team with Lopez ahead of him.\n\nThe score of the final fight was 6-0.\n\nWith the win, Lopez tied Germany's Wilfried Dietrich for the most medals ever won in wrestling with five total, but became the first Olympic wrestler to win five golds. He also became the oldest medalist in Olympic wrestling history at 41. Ironically, Lopez is just a few weeks shy of his 42nd birthday. And to add to the list of incredible achievements, Lopez has also become the first athlete in any sport to win the same event five times.\n\nAfter the match, Lopez announced his retirement by removing his shoes and leaving them in the center of the match - the wrestler's way of retiring.\n\nOn top of his five Olympic gold medals, Lopez is also a five-time World Champion and three-time silver medalist at the World Championships of wrestling.\n\nThe internet celebrated Lopez's achievements, with messages that went from: \"Simply thank you, legend\"\n\nTo: \"MIJA\u00cdN L\u00d3PEZ DID IT AGAIN!!!!!!!!!!!!

Only seven athletes have achieved the feat, including swimming legend Michael Phelps, former track hero Carl Lewis and now Katie Ledecky.\n\nHowever, on Tuesday at the Paris Olympics, Lopez launched into a new group of his own. He achieved a record-breaking fifth straight individual title -- a five-peat -- as he won gold in the men's greco-roman wrestling 130kg category.\n\nTwo other athletes -- U.S. basketball stars Sue Bird and Diana Taurasi -- have achieved the feat in team events. On an individual basis, though, Lopez's achievement is unparalleled.\n\nAnother remarkable part of Lopez's achievement on Tuesday: He hasn't competed internationally since the last Olympic Games in Tokyo.\n\nWhereas other wrestlers compete year-round, Lopez decided he was too old to put his body through the rigors of repeated competition, instead preferring to ready himself at lengthy training camps.\n\nHis advantage comes from his size. Lopez's frame is just that much bigger than any of his opponents. Out of competition, he typically weighs around 150kg, meaning he is able to put a lot more back on after he makes weight. That advantage, and his skill, has resulted in an Olympic dominance unlike any other.\n\nLopez made his Olympic debut aged 21 at Athens 2004 where he exited in the quarterfinals. His golden run started in Beijing in 2008.\n\nThe Cuban wrestler has similarly dominated at these Games, as if his 41-year-old body were defying time itself. He made light work of his first-round match, achieving a 7-0 victory over South Korea's Lee Seungchan. Hours after that, he booked his place in the final with 3-1 win over Iran's Amin Mirzazadeh in the quarterfinals and a 4-1 victory over Sabah Shariati of Azerbaijan in the semifinals.\n\nTuesday's final was a mismatch, too.

They have been lifelong friends, so he should apologize off the mat, but on the mat, he has to win,\" she said firmly.\n\nThe excitement was palpable in Herradura in the lead-up to the fight, with his family waiting from early in the day under a thatched-roof structure decorated with a huge poster of Lopez.\n\nAldo Moreno, a 52-year-old rice farmer, left his plot to enjoy the moment with his neighbors.\n\n\"Today he takes the fifth, that victory goes to Herradura. It is a sporting glory,\" said an emotional Moreno, who has known the wrestler since he was a child.\n\nHe recalls Lopez promising in 2023 that \"he will dedicate that fight to his deceased father.\"\n\nThe fighter's mother ordered a candle to be lit for her husband Bartolo Lopez, whose photograph was placed on an altar to accompany them on the crucial day.\n\n\"It is a great honor that he is a son of this town,\" said Hilario Hernandez, 64, who wandered over on horseback to take part in the event, in the town of about 10,000 inhabitants.\n\nCuban President Miguel Diaz-Canel also congratulated the five-time Olympic champion.\n\n\"Thank you Mijain, for your loyalty, your talent, your dedication. Thank you for the gold of your heart as a Cuban warrior,\" the president wrote on X.\n\n'My idol'\n\nWhen, just shy of his 39th birthday, the Cuban giant overcame the Georgian Iakobi Kajaia in the 130kg competition in the Covid-delayed Tokyo Games three years ago, it was widely expected to be his swansong.\n\nHe had not competed since and had to fight to get his weight below the required 130kg.\n\n\"He's my idol, my friend and my rival too. So I'm going to enjoy this fight a lot,\" said his Paris rival, Yasmani Acosta, 36, who was born in Cuba, in the run-up to the fight.\n\nAcosta fled the communist island nation while in Chile in 2015 after a tournament with the Cuban squad. Four years later he told journalists that it was the most difficult decision of his life.\n\nHe had to work as a security guard in nightclubs, until he was given Chilean nationality and allowed to compete for the country.", "source": {"uri": "rfi.fr", "dataType": "news", "title": "RFI"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wrestling", "type": "wiki", "score": 5,

McLauchlan picked out the top corner with an unstoppable strike in the 24th minute before Lizzie Arnot added a second with four minutes of the 90 left. Nic Doherty had sent an early shot wide after Hearts goalkeeper Charlotte Parker-Smith survived a scare of her own making when she slipped attempting a clearance in the seventh minute, but McLauchlan made the breakthrough in considerable style. The 26-year-old, back in the Scotland squad, had a chance for a second moments later when the ball came to her on the edge of the area, but she could not keep her shot down. Hearts\u2019 Carly Girasoli sent a header straight at the goalkeeper before Rangers threatened again late in the half, with Chelsea Cornet squandering a chance when through on goal. The 16-year-old Husband twins caught the eye for Hearts in the second half but it was again Rangers who were on top, with substitute Rio Hardy twice going close before Parker-Smith made a fine save to deny Cornet. Girasoli forced Vic Esson into a late save with an improvised effort from a Hearts free-kick, but Arnot had the final word in the 86th minute, picking her spot in the bottom left corner with a shot from the edge of the area.", "summary": "Rachel McLaughlan and Lizzie Arnot scored in the 2-0 victory at Hampden.", "url": "https://news.stv.tv/sport/rangers-complete-domestic-cup-double-with-victory-over-hearts", "image": "https://news.stv.tv/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/47e49ed0a1f2dd0a46f7767efa0e1863-1716738119.jpg", "video": null, "publish_date": "2024-05-26 15:43:58", "author": "Andy Coyle", "authors": ["Andy Coyle"], "language": "en", "source_country": "tv", "sentiment": -0.349}

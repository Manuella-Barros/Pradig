The Cafeteros, coached by Argentine N\u00e9stor Lorenzo, extended their unbeaten streak to 25 games with goals from D\u00edaz (31), from a penalty, defender Davinson S\u00e1nchez (59), and striker Jhon C\u00f3rdoba (62), in the second match of Group D. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter who scores, the important thing is to win,\u201d C\u00f3rdoba stated. With a perfect score, Colombia joined Argentina and Venezuela as the only teams with guaranteed spots in the second phase so far. They will determine the group leadership when they face Brazil on Tuesday in Santa Clara, California. The Ticos, meanwhile, remained in third position with one point, after Brazil (second, with four points) eliminated Paraguay (fourth, without points) by thrashing them 4-1 this Friday in Las Vegas, Nevada. The Central Americans, owners of the youngest squad in the tournament, who surprised by debuting with a goalless draw against the Brazilians, will seek against all odds to advance when they face the Paraguayans in Austin, Texas. The Wall Falls The scorching heat in Glendale, above 40 degrees Celsius, was not felt on the playing field of State Farm Stadium, whose climate control system regulated the temperature to between 24 and 26 degrees. What was noticeable was the lack of massive crowd support (27,386 attendees), well below the 63,400-spectator capacity, although with an overwhelming majority of Colombian fans. Without the external suffocation that dries the eyes, Colombia demonstrated from the beginning its desire to take control. With James and D\u00edaz very active up front, the Cafeteros gradually approached the goal of Patrick Sequeira, goalkeeper for Ibiza, from the Spanish third division, and a key figure against the \u2018Canarinha\u2019. The Costa Rican goalkeeper, in charge of the difficult task of replacing Keylor Navas, retired from the national team, had a day of contrasts. First, he denied James (20) his 28th international goal by saving a shot that culminated a quick transition initiated by a long pass from Jefferson Lerma to D\u00edaz. Eight minutes later, in an unnecessary and erratic exit, he brought down C\u00f3rdoba, one of Lorenzo\u2019s new additions, inside the area. D\u00edaz, 27, took the penalty kick hard and high to the left of the 25-year-old goalkeeper. \u201cIn these kinds of matches, errors are costly,\u201d said Alfaro. Cafetero Feast Although he had said he would settle for a draw just to get points, Alfaro started the game with an additional forward, Warren Madrigal, to try to hurt the Colombian defense, weakened by the absence of John Lucum\u00ed, injured in the victorious debut against Paraguay (2-1). The fall of the Central American defense had liberating effects on Colombia, always with the \u201910\u2019 as the protagonist: he took two very dangerous set pieces, but they were wasted by Davinson S\u00e1nchez (33, 37). On the third attempt, this time a corner kick taken by Jhon Arias, the Galatasaray defender didn\u2019t forgive and confirmed, with a header, his country\u2019s favorite status for the title of a tournament they won in 2001. A moment later, James showcased his repertoire by assisting C\u00f3rdoba with his weaker foot, the right one. Face to face with Sequeira, the Krasnodar striker unleashed a right-footed shot to celebrate his first Copa goal. \u201cJames now runs less and thinks more,\u201d Lorenzo highlighted. \u201cHe has a team that surrounds him well and gives alternatives to his game.\u201d With qualification in the bag, and Costa Rica completing two consecutive matches without a single direct shot on target, Lorenzo protected his stars, substituting them for the promising Yaser Asprilla (72) and Jhon Jader Dur\u00e1n (77). The chants of \u201cJames, James\u201d and \u201cLucho, Lucho!\u201d showed the fans\u2019 communion with the stars of a team that is making a strong impression.", "summary": "<p>Led by their stars James Rodr\u00edguez and Luis D\u00edaz, Colombia broke through Costa Rica&#8217;s defense, thrashing them 3-0 this Friday in the hot Glendale, Arizona, and qualified in advance for the quarterfinals of the 2024 Copa Am\u00e9rica in the United States.

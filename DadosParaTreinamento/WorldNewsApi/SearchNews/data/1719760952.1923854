{"id": 225243292, "title": "Brother of soldier lost to suicide returns to the West Highland Way", "text": "For every one of the 96 miles of the West Highland Way he treks this weekend, Struan Adam will be thinking of his younger brother. When they did the walk together back in 2005, it was a special experience that encapsulated their close sibling bond. It was often joked that they\u2019d have to do it again one day, the opposite way. But, five years ago, Sergeant Gordon Adam, a soldier with The Royal Scots Dragoon Guards, sadly took his own life. Struan and some of Gordon\u2019s old army pals are therefore taking on \u2018The Return Journey\u2018 in his memory and supporting charities that would have helped him, and that he would\u2019ve backed himself. \u201cGordon and I were always very close growing up, literally sharing our room, our whole lives,\u201d Struan said. \u201cRight up until his passing, we would phone each other up any time, completely randomly with nothing to say, just for a chat. \u201cI don\u2019t really have that with any other sibling or friend. We could talk rubbish. We could talk about serious things. I really miss that.\u201d The Return Journey Centring on what would\u2019ve been Gordon\u2019s 40th birthday, the challenge has raised almost \u00a33,000 so far. Making it all the more poignant, that walk back in 2005 was pivotal in inspiring him to join the army, where he had a distinguished career. It had started off with 25 boys and leaders from a youth club in Kilwinning, but ended with Struan and Gordon as two of only four to complete the route. \u201cIt was one of the first instances that he finished a challenge,\u201d Struan recalled. \u201cIt\u2019s such a treasured memory \u2013 when he finished it his face lit up, he\u2019s achieved something. \u201cI fondly remember that whole week and what it meant. It means more to me now. I\u2019m really looking forward to doing that again with Gordon\u2019s pals. I think we\u2019ll have a great laugh but it\u2019ll be very emotional as well.\u201d Joining the army in 2006 based out of Leuchars in Fife, keen boxer \u2018Gordy\u2019 was known for being the life and soul of the party, but also someone who would always be there to help a comrade in need. At the time of his death, he had intended to take part in a marathon challenge for Samaritans, in memory of friends he\u2019d lost. His and Struan\u2019s dad also died by suicide when they were young boys. \u201cTragically, the last Facebook post that Gordon put up was that he was going to raise money for them,\u201d Struan said. \u201cI remember seeing it and texting him straight away to say \u2018let\u2019s do it together\u2019. Just a week later, he had taken his own life.\u201d Struan was among Gordon\u2019s friends and family who completed the challenge in his name, running a marathon mere days after his brother\u2019s death. \u201cYou need to do something constructive and positive,\u201d he said. \u201cWe needed a distraction. It was the easiest run I\u2019ve ever done because there was no stopping me.\u201d Charity fundraising Samaritans is one of the charities benefitting from The Return Journey\u2019s fundraising, alongside social inclusion organisation Golden Friendships in Clydebank and Thrive in Stewarton, which supports physical and mental wellbeing in people in their 20s to 40s. \u201cSamaritans do amazing work but when you need to phone them, that\u2019s way too late,\u201d Struan said. \u201cThere\u2019s stuff that needs to be done so people can enjoy their lives and not get to the point where they make that call. \u201cOne of Gordon\u2019s friends said these were the type of charities that would help someone like Gordon out, and in return he would help them out.\u201d Gordon was a father to two sons, a daughter and a stepson, who is now in the Royal Scots. Alongside Struan, sisters Olivia, Kirstie, and Shona and mum Sarah have carried on his legacy by continuing to help others struggling with depression. \u201cParticularly with suicide, I can fully understand why some people who have lost somebody maybe don\u2019t talk about it and don\u2019t go there, just kind of move on,\u201d Struan added. \u201cI was brought up not really talking about my dad. It was all hushed away. With Gordon, I want his kids to be able to think about him fondly. \u201cI want us to be able to talk about him, as hard as that can be sometimes.\u201d \u2018We never talk about Gordon for very long before we start laughing \u2013 and crying\u2019 After her son Gordon Adam\u2019s death, Sarah Frame realised she needed a change in career and set about making her dreams of owning a bookshop come true. Last month, The Book Nook in Stewarton\u2019s High Street was honoured as Independent Bookshop of the Year for Scotland at The British Book Awards, having previously been shortlisted in 2021 and 2022. \u201cI was working in a corporate career when I lost Gordon and although after some months off I\u2019d gone back to work, it took a toll on me,\u201d she said. \u201cGrief is so encompassing, it affects your physical and mental health, you struggle with everything. I realised I had to make room to carry that grief about with me and try and find a way that I could reconfigure my life to accommodate it rather than have it consume me and destroy anything else that was left. \u201cI gave up my corporate career. Like many people who are mad about books like me have always thought, I\u2019d liked to have a book shop. I decided to open one without really envisaging it being what it is now.\u201d A key component of the shop is being community-focussed, providing a place for people to visit and bond over a shared love of books. \u201cI felt it would help me to cope, being surrounded by books and talking to people about them and sharing the joy they bring. \u201cIt was also really important that I could create a place which could have a positive impact on people\u2019s wellbeing as well. I wanted to run some activities and make it a welcoming space, somewhere that anybody could come in. \u201cIt\u2019s not about being a shop, it\u2019s about being a place in the community where people can feel better when they\u2019re in it.\u201d Sarah will join other family members for the last part of the West Highland Way challenge, which will pass where his ashes are scattered. \u201cWe never talk about Gordon for very long before we start laughing \u2013 and crying, perhaps,\u201d she said. \u201cAll we\u2019ve got now are these memories, and they are so precious. \u201cI kept print-outs of all the messages that we got after we lost Gordon and there are hundreds of people who didn\u2019t just say he was a great guy, they went into detail about the positive impact he\u2019d had on their life and things he\u2019d done to help them. I can still take a lot of comfort from that. \u201cSuicide remains the biggest threat to young men and it\u2019s growing rapidly with young women as well. If it\u2019s not talked about, people think it\u2019s not going to be somebody they know. The more that we recognise how prevalent is then the more opportunities there are to try and prevent that happening with other people.\u201d You can donate to the fundraiser at gofundme.com/f/The-Return-Journey When life is difficult, Samaritans are here \u2013 day or night, 365 days a year.

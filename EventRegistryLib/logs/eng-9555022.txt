However, she stepped back, citing the reason being her new life as a mum to baby Bambi.\n\nBut her life is going in a new direction, as she took to her home-dedicated Instagram account, named MollyMaison, and treated fans to a look at her \u00a34 million Cheshire mansion.\n\nIn a video, she showed off the gold fixtures in her bathroom and made her plush white bed, before taking a number of M&S food bags into the kitchen and rustling up a delicious roast dinner for her family.\n\nLittle Bambi even made a cameo in the clip, as she smiled alongside her mother, whilst Molly got to work at the stove.\n\nCaptioning the post, Molly wrote: \"I hope you've all had a lovely bank holiday Monday! I'm excited to announce I'm now a @marksandspencerfood ambassador [white love heart] ad.\"\n\nHer Instagram followers rushed to comment on the announcement, as one wrote: \"Congratulations, great partnership. Those roasties look top notch.\"\n\nAnother said: \"What a partnership, congratulations Molly,\" as a third commented: \"This is iconic tbh.\"\n\nHer sister Zoe Hague even went as far as to call her \"Queen of the roasts.\"\n\nMolly's partner, Tommy, is also a collaborator of M&S, as he recently plugged their healthy meals to go, so it seems to be a no-brainer that Molly-Mae has jumped on board.\n\nThe star has long been affiliated with PrettyLittleThing, but fans were no doubt surprised when she stepped down as Creative Director in June 2023, however, she said there were 'no hard feelings' about her decision.\n\nFollow OK! on Threads here: https://www.threads.net/@ok_mag", "source": {"uri": "ok.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "ok"}, "authors": [{"uri": "lauren_fletcher@ok.co.uk", "name": "Lauren Fletcher", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bikini", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Bikini"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dubai", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Dubai"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Dubai"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Arab Emirates"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bambi_Award", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Bambi Award"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Instagram", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Instagram"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Molly-Mae_Hague", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Molly-Mae Hague"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_and_white", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Black and white"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marks_&_Spencer", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Marks & Spencer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sunglasses", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Sunglasses"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linen", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Linen"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trousers", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Trousers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atlantis", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Atlantis"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hotel", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Hotel"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_media", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Social media"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Kingdom", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Creative_director", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Creative director"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mansion", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Mansion"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emirate", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Emirate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gold", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Gold"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cheshire", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Cheshire"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Cheshire"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Arab_Emirates", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United Arab Emirates"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Arab Emirates"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PrettyLittleThing", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "PrettyLittleThing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cameo_appearance", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Cameo appearance"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OK!", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "OK!"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bank_holiday", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Bank holiday"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Death/In_Memoriam", "label": "dmoz/Society/Death/In Memoriam", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Crafts/Lacemaking", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Crafts/Lacemaking", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 94}], "image": "https://i2-prod.ok.co.uk/incoming/article32717787.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_molly-mae-curls.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9555022", "eventUri": "eng-9555022", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.2941176470588236, "wgt": 151, "relevance": 1}

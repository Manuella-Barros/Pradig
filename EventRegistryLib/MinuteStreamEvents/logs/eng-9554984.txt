But identifying which trial is best suited to a specific patient is time-consuming; doing that work for multiple patients even more so. Enter the San Francisco-based start-up Triomics, which claims its artificial intelligence (AI) platform is the answer.\n\n\"We think our technology can help thousands of patients,\" says Sarim Khan, the co-founder and CEO of Triomics, which is today announcing it has raised $15 million of new funding. \"The workloads involved in reviewing patients' charts can lead to clinical delays, including patients missing out on clinical trials or biomarker-driven treatments.\"\n\nAround 20% of patient data is current held in easily accessible formats that existing technologies can deal with, Triomics says. But the remaining 80% is unstructured data such as doctors' notes that currently needs to be manually searched. For each patient, oncologists have to comb through the entire record to identify the key data points - and therefore to be able to match them to trials and emerging treatments.\n\nTriomics' platform, using specially developed large language models (LLMs), aims to replace that manual process, freeing up oncologists' time and securing better outcomes for more patients at greater speed. Triomics says its AI-driven solution can match patients to trials with 95% accuracy - comparable to the results of manual processing - but get through cases in a matter of minutes. \"It's all about maximising the patient's opportunity to get the best care,\" Khan adds.\n\nTriomics' technology also has other applications, the company points out. It also markets the platform as a vehicle through which healthcare providers can automate a range of manual processes required for different use cases, from quality assurance to the tracking of clinical pathways.\n\nHowever, it is the company's focus on improving patient access to trials and treatments that is likely to garner most attention. \"The ability to quickly and accurately convert complex cancer data into a format that can be used to improve patient care is crucial,\" says Anai Kothari, a surgical oncologist at the Medical College of Wisconsin Cancer Center, one early adopter of Triomics' platform.\n\nHrituraj Singh, CTO and co-founder of the company, says Triomics' success since its launch in 2020 reflects its efforts to bring in two different types of talent. \"Our investments in our core areas of focus have been deliberate,\" Singh says. \"We have successfully merged expertise in two complex functional areas: our AI researchers, who are specialists in customising language models to specific domains, and our clinical staff, who have decades of oncology-specific experience.\"\n\nThat has seen the company build out its platform with a number of hospital and healthcare partners. It has now moved into the commercialisation stage, signing up a several early customers and aiming to reach as many as 15 institutions by the end of the year.\n\nClearly, the company's intellectual property sits at the heart of its efforts to break through - hence the fund raising, which is largely aimed at helping Triomics to continue recruiting. The business currently employs around 50 specialists but expects that to rise to 60 or so in the short to medium term.\n\nThe company's investors are excited by its potential, with today's raise including participants such as Lightspeed, Nexus Venture Partners, General Catalyst and Y Combinator.\n\n\"Triomics is leveraging existing healthcare datasets and generative AI to empower hospital staff to automate clinical trials and streamline cancer centre workflows,\" says Dev Khare, a partner at Lightspeed.\n\nJishnu Bhattacharjee, managing director at Nexus Venture Partners, adds: \"With robust early results for its proprietary oncology specific LLMs and partnerships with leading cancer care and research centers, Triomics is well poised to deliver significant value to cancer care providers and patients in the US and globally.\"", "source": {"uri": "forbes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Forbes"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oncology", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Oncology"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Cancer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unstructured_data", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Unstructured data"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Artificial intelligence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Large_language_model", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Large language model"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_College_of_Wisconsin", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Medical College of Wisconsin"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quality_assurance", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Quality assurance"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Clinical trial"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health_care", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Health care"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chief_executive_officer", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Chief executive officer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Generative_artificial_intelligence", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Generative artificial intelligence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Y_Combinator", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Y Combinator"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Language_model", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Language model"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chief_technology_officer", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Chief technology officer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Workflow", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Workflow"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commercialization", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Commercialization"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proprietary_software", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Proprietary software"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intellectual_property", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Intellectual property"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Media_(communication)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Media (communication)"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Health/Conditions_and_Diseases/Cancer", "label": "dmoz/Health/Conditions and Diseases/Cancer", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Health/Conditions_and_Diseases", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Health/Conditions and Diseases", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Men's_Health/Conditions_and_Diseases", "label": "dmoz/Health/Men's Health/Conditions and Diseases", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Public_Health_and_Safety/Patient_Safety", "label": "dmoz/Health/Public Health and Safety/Patient Safety", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 48}, {"uri": "news/Technology", "label": "news/Technology", "wgt": 49}], "image": "https://imageio.forbes.com/specials-images/imageserve/663c8b1a248f77c3ba88caf6/0x0.jpg?format=jpg&crop=4746,2669,x0,y311,safe&height=600&width=1200&fit=bounds", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9554984", "eventUri": "eng-9554984", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.2392156862745098, "wgt": 192, "relevance": 1}

Find out how you can attend here.\n\nAs many continue to debate the role of AI in healthcare, startups are going all in on the technology - with the full support of venture capital firms. Today, San Francisco-based Triomics, a startup looking to accelerate cancer care with generative AI, announced its $15 million from Lightspeed, Nexus Venture Partners, General Catalyst and Y Combinator.\n\nFounded by former MIT and Adobe researchers Sarim Khan and Hrituraj Singh, Triomics has developed a family of large language models (LLMs), dubbed OncoLLM, that streamlines the complex and time-consuming oncology-related workflows staffers at medical centers have to go through to determine the right treatment path for a patient.\n\nThe models work with a set of workflow-specific tools and have been proven to do tasks that would usually take days or weeks in just minutes.\n\n\"We have successfully merged expertise in two complex functional areas: our AI researchers, who are specialized in customizing language models to specific domains, and our clinical staff, who have decades of oncology-specific experience. As a result, our software can complement the strengths of these advanced models while also proactively addressing potential flaws, all with the intricacies of cancer research and care in mind,\" Singh said in a statement.\n\nWhat exactly Triomics aims to solve?\n\nToday, millions of people suffer from cancer. The number of new cases has been increasing over the years and is estimated to touch 35 million people by 2050 - a 77% increase from the 20 million cases in 2022. In this situation, medical and cancer care centers are bound to be under pressure, especially due to the dwindling healthcare workforce.\n\nCurrently, most nurses and cancer care staffers determine patients' care pathway or clinical trial eligibility with manual chart reviews, where they sift through the entire longitudinal record manually to identify relevant data points. This covers everything, from doctors' unstructured free-text notes to test reports, and takes a lot of time, leading to clinical delays such as patients missing out on trials or biomarker-driven treatments.\n\nTriomics tackles this problem by providing care centers with Oncology-focused OncoLLM and allowing them to fine-tune the model - using their own internal datasets - for deployment with the company's workflow automation offerings.\n\n\"OncoLLM is essentially a family of models, each model serving different purposes including retriever and generator models, some of them are trained from scratch and some are fine-tuned on SOTA open-source models. Our models undergo extensive fine-tuning on each provider's proprietary data and reinforcement learning, leveraging human feedback for tailored learning. We deploy customized models for each partner institution,\" Khan told VentureBeat.\n\nWhen the models are institution-tuned, they are deployed across Triomics' software offerings that integrate with health system EHRs to help with specific care workflows. Currently, the company has two products in place: Harmony and Prism. The former curates the data for registry, reporting or research needs, while the latter handles patient-trial matching by prescreening oncology patients to find relevant clinical trials. At scale, this cuts the time to review patient charts from days or weeks to mere minutes.\n\nWhen the model, and the associated software, were tested by the Medical College of Wisconsin Cancer Center, the teams found that the offering outperformed larger open-source and proprietary LLMs at patient-trial matching and rivaled qualified medical experts and GPT-4, despite being much smaller and 35 times less expensive. Since then, the company has also developed another variant of OncoLLM (70B) that surpasses both GPT-4 and medical experts in terms of accuracy.\n\nGoal to hit scale\n\nWith this round of funding, Triomics plans to increase its team across domains and scale up the reach of the product.\n\nThe company has already signed a few deals and is targeting to rope in over a dozen partner institutions by the end of the year. It says there's no fixed pricing strategy as the OncoLLM-based solution is tailored for each customer.\n\n\"We are either piloting or actively working with about half a dozen academic medical centers, which should be double digits by summer's end. We also have started to expand our customer base beyond the academic centers entering into agreements with large community oncology practices, to make an impact on as many patient lives as we possibly can,\" Khan said.\n\nWhile some solutions help with patient-trial matching, Khan notes that the company has developed a specialization around oncology with OncoLLM-powered software. Further, he says most other solutions in this space are not gen AI native and are reliant upon utilizing / modifying legacy technologies without the scale benefit or step-function ROI the industry is asking for.", "source": {"uri": "venturebeat.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "VentureBeat"}, "authors": [{"uri": "shubham_sharma@venturebeat.com", "name": "Shubham Sharma", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Startup_company", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Startup company"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oncology", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Oncology"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Workflow", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Workflow"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Artificial intelligence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Large_language_model", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Large language model"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Generative_artificial_intelligence", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Generative artificial intelligence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence_in_healthcare", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Artificial intelligence in healthcare"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adobe_Inc.", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Adobe Inc."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Y_Combinator", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Y Combinator"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Language_model", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Language model"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Speed_of_light", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Speed of light"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Venture_capital", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Venture capital"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Massachusetts_Institute_of_Technology", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Massachusetts Institute of Technology"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bias", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Bias"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ethics", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Ethics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Software"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_City", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "New York City"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "New York City"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer_research", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Cancer research"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open-source_software", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Open-source software"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proprietary_software", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Proprietary software"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nursing", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Nursing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Clinical trial"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health_care", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Health care"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Cancer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_College_of_Wisconsin", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Medical College of Wisconsin"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Health/Conditions_and_Diseases/Cancer", "label": "dmoz/Health/Conditions and Diseases/Cancer", "wgt": 29}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Models", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Models", "wgt": 29}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Models/Scale", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Models/Scale", "wgt": 30}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Public_Health_and_Safety/Patient_Safety", "label": "dmoz/Health/Public Health and Safety/Patient Safety", "wgt": 27}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Models/Boats_and_Ships", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Models/Boats and Ships", "wgt": 28}, {"uri": "news/Technology", "label": "news/Technology", "wgt": 94}], "image": "https://venturebeat.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/GettyImages-1365534802-e1695059225220.jpg?w=1200&strip=all", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9554984", "eventUri": "eng-9554984", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-06-05", "textStart": 31, "textEnd": 39}], "sentiment": 0.07450980392156858, "wgt": 192, "relevance": 1}

However, busy oncologists and nurses often lack the time to learn about all the clinical trials that may be right for their patients.\n\nI am not a doctor, so I don't know about the day-to-day challenges of oncology medical staff. But I unfortunately know from personal experience how hard it is to find clinical trials for cancer patients. I've spent countless hours poring over clinicaltrials.gov, a website and database that lists thousands of ongoing trials when my father was sick. And just in March, I spent half a Saturday trying to find a clinical trial for a friend who has stage IV cancer. Her doctor only offered one trial, so she asked me if there were other options.\n\nSince most clinical trials have complex criteria, there are often dozens of factors such as stage of cancer, mutations and previous treatments for eligibility. Medical staff often need hours to manually review a patient's medical record to find a fitting clinical trial. But due to a shortage of oncology professionals, many cancer patients aren't offered to participate or miss their eligibility window.\n\nThe company was founded by former MIT biotech researcher Sarim Khan and AI scientist at Adobe, Hrituraj Singh. The pair, who have been friends since college, decided to build Triomics in 2021 after realizing that advances in generative AI and LLMs could help extract data from electronic health records (EHR) to help find appropriate clinical trials for cancer patients in minutes instead of hours.\n\nKhan and Singh entered Y combinator in the winter of 2021 and proceeded to work on an LLM built specifically for cancer centers and oncology departments in hospital systems.\n\nThree years later, Triomics says six cancer centers and hospitals are actively using or piloting its LLM, and it plans to double that number by the end of the year. And now the company has raised $15 million Series A from Lightspeed, Nexus Venture Partners, General Catalyst and Y Combinator to help it continue to develop its platform and roll it out to new customers.\n\nWhile reducing how long it takes for patients to be matched with clinical trials may seem like the most immediately valuable application of Triomics software, Khan says that Triomics is a lot more than a clinical trials company. \"Doctors use it for several different use cases that I could just go on and on about,\" he said.\n\nAfter Triomics' LLM, which the company is calling OncoLLM, \"reads\" the patient's medical record, the data could be used to help prepare doctors and other medical staff for patient visits or to submit cancer data with details of organs affected and stage of progressions to state regulatory agencies.\n\nOf course, Triomics isn't alone in tackling this area. Other startups doing AI clinical trial matching include Deep 6 AI, QuantHealth, Trajectory, among others\n\nBut Khan believes that Triomics is one of the few startups processing large swaths of data sets specifically for cancer centers.", "source": {"uri": "techcrunch.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "TechCrunch"}, "authors": [{"uri": "marina_temkin@techcrunch.com", "name": "Marina Temkin", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oncology", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Oncology"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Clinical trial"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Cancer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Generative_artificial_intelligence", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Generative artificial intelligence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ClinicalTrials.gov", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "ClinicalTrials.gov"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nursing", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Nursing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adobe_Inc.", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Adobe Inc."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Y_Combinator", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Y Combinator"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Master_of_Laws", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Master of Laws"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer_staging", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Cancer staging"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electronic_health_record", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Electronic health record"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mutation", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Mutation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Startup_company", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Startup company"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biotechnology", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Biotechnology"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Massachusetts_Institute_of_Technology", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Massachusetts Institute of Technology"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Series_A_round", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Series A round"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_set", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Data set"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Software"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Artificial intelligence"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Health/Medicine/Medical_Specialties", "label": "dmoz/Health/Medicine/Medical Specialties", "wgt": 25}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Conditions_and_Diseases", "label": "dmoz/Health/Conditions and Diseases", "wgt": 25}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Conditions_and_Diseases/Cancer", "label": "dmoz/Health/Conditions and Diseases/Cancer", "wgt": 39}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Biotechnology_and_Pharmaceuticals/Contract_Research_Organizations", "label": "dmoz/Business/Biotechnology and Pharmaceuticals/Contract Research Organizations", "wgt": 32}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Public_Health_and_Safety/Patient_Safety", "label": "dmoz/Health/Public Health and Safety/Patient Safety", "wgt": 25}, {"uri": "news/Technology", "label": "news/Technology", "wgt": 60}], "image": "https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Triomics-co-founders-Sarim-Khan-and-Hrituraj-Singh-1.jpg?resize=1200,900", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9554984", "eventUri": "eng-9554984", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.1137254901960785, "wgt": 182, "relevance": 1}

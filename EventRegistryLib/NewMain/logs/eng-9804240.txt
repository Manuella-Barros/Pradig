But organizers have only issued health recommendations, and no restrictions, allowing athletes to compete if they wish and are able to.\n\nThis comes in sharp contrast with the Tokyo Olympics in 2021, which had to be delayed by a year due to the global pandemic and were held under intense COVID-19 regulations -- and no fans allowed at any events. Six months later, the Winter Games in Beijing had even stricter protocols because of China's zero-tolerance policy.\n\nIn Paris, the Olympics recall pre-COVID times. French people have revived the double-cheeked greeting embrace -- \"la bise.\" Fans joyfully reach out at venues to slap athletes' hands.

Three years later, it's a very different scene at the 2024 Paris Olympics.\n\nAccording to a Wednesday, August 7, Washington Post piece, at least 40 athletes have tested positive for COVID-19 at the Paris Games thus far, but there is no rule barring said athletes from continuing to train and compete.\n\nLate last month, Australian swimmer Lani Pallister was cleared to return to the pool one day after she tested positive for COVID-19 and withdrew from the women's 1500m freestyle event Her decision to sit out the 1500m freestyle wasn't based on Olympic guidelines, but a desire to \"save her energy\" for the 4x200m freestyle relay that took place two days later, the Australian Olympic Committee announced via social media.\n\nPallister's COVID-19 case came days after five members of Australia's women's water polo team tested positive for the virus.\n\n\"We treat COVID no differently to any other respiratory illness, but we want to ensure that we have our protocols working as well. Dealing with these illnesses and minimizing them is a part and parcel of every Olympic Games,\" Australian chef de mission Anna Meares said during a press conference last month.\n\nMeares added that the water polo athletes would continue to practice with protocols in place.\n\n\"They have been wearing their masks, they are isolating from other team members when they are not training, they are not going into the high-volume areas of the allotment like the gym and the performance pantry,\" she explained.\n\nThere are no specific COVID-19 restrictions at the 2024 Paris Olympics, meaning that individual athletes and teams may determine for themselves how to prevent or respond to infection. There is no mandated masking, testing or temperature checking, although the Olympic Village does have single rooms available for athletes who test positive for COVID-19.\n\nGiven the new rules -- or lack thereof -- some athletes who test positive for COVID-19 may continue competing while others may decide to bow out. German decathlete Manuel Eitel announced via Instagram late last month that he had withdrawn from the Olympics due to a COVID-19 infection.\n\n\"Today is and will be one of the worst days of my life,\" his statement began. \"Due to COVID infection, I have to cancel my entry for the Paris Olympics for 2024. What I feel right now exceeds any defeat I've ever experienced in sports. I'm absolutely stunned, completely lost and do not understand the world anymore. How many times I've fought, how hard I've worked to earn these games, few people know.\"\n\nBritish swimmer Adam Peaty, meanwhile, tested positive for COVID-19 last month less than 24 hours after winning a silver medal in the men's 100m breaststroke final. He returned to the pool less than one week later and helped his team reach the final of the men's 4\u00d7100 medley relay.\n\nTeam USA has also been impacted; sprinter Noah Lyles tested positive before winning a bronze medal in the men's 200m final on Thursday, August 8. After the race, he exclusively told NBC News that he'd never considered sitting out the race.\n\n\"We were just going to try and quarantine as much as possible and stay away [from other people], not try and pass it off,\" he said.\n\nWhile Lyles, 27, acknowledged that COVID-19 had \"taken its toll\" on him, he said he'd \"run with worse conditions.\"\n\nAs for whether he'll compete in the men's 4x100m relay on Friday, August 9, Lyles admitted he's not sure at the moment.\n\n\"I don't know. I'm feeling more on the side of letting Team USA do their thing,\" he said. \"They've proven with great certainty that they can handle it without me. If that's the case coming off today, I'm perfectly fine saying, 'You guys go do your thing.'\"\n\nThe U.S. Olympic and Paralympic Committee and USA Track and Field released a joint statement on Thursday regarding Lyles' decision to compete in the 200m final with COVID-19.\n\n\"Our primary commitment is to ensure the safety of Team USA athletes while upholding their right to compete,\" the two entities said. \"After a thorough medical evaluation, Noah chose to compete tonight. We respect his decision and will continue to monitor his condition closely.\"\n\nWhile more than 40 COVID-19 cases among this year's Olympic athletes may seem like a lot, NBC News medical contributor Dr. Kavita Patel told Today.com last month that based on existing guidelines, 5 percent of athletes (there are about 10,500 athletes participating in the Paris Games) would need to contract COVID-19 within a seven-day period to be considered an outbreak.", "source": {"uri": "usmagazine.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Us Weekly"}, "authors": [{"uri": "sara_donnellan@usmagazine.com", "name":

Restrictions are a thing of the past", "body": "PARIS (AP) -- Many hoped the Paris Olympics would be the post-COVID-19 Games. Instead they seem to be the \"who cares about COVID-19\" Games.\n\nNoah Lyles won a bronze with the virus in front of tens of thousands of spectators, and dozens of other athletes at the Games have tested positive. But organizers have only issued health recommendations, and no restrictions, allowing athletes to compete if they wish and are able to.\n\nThis comes in sharp contrast with the Tokyo Olympics in 2021, which had to be delayed by a year because of the pandemic and were held under intense COVID-19 regulations -- and no fans allowed at any events. Six months later, the Winter Games in Beijing had even stricter protocols because of China's zero-tolerance policy.\n\nIn Paris, the Olympics recall pre-COVID-19 times. French people have revived the double-cheeked greeting embrace -- \"la bise.\" Fans joyfully reach out at venues to slap athletes' hands. Masks are rarely seen in crowds of supporters, and people from across the world could come to France without proof of vaccines or negative virus tests.\n\nThe World Health Organization said earlier this week that at least 40 athletes at the Olympics had tested positive for the virus, amid growing cases worldwide.\n\nOn Thursday night, Lyles was carted off the track in a wheelchair after he finished third in the 200 meters. He then said he had tested positive for COVID-19 two days before.\n\nLast week, British star Adam Peaty tested positive less than 24 hours after claiming a swimming silver medal. He said he first began feeling ill a day earlier ahead of the 100-meter breaststroke final.\n\nThe Australian delegation in Paris said five COVID-19-hit players on its women's water polo team were clear to practice when they feel well enough to train.\n\nCOVID-19 \"is being treated like any other respiratory disease,\" International Olympic Committee president Thomas Bach said Friday. \"It is being treated like flu now, so there is no obligation for any special measures or notifications.\"\n\nCOVID-19 is no longer a global health emergency according to the WHO, and with much higher vaccination levels now than during the previous two Olympics, it is typically treated like any other respiratory illness. There has been a surge of COVID-19 globally this summer, but because of vaccination and prior infection, most cases are mild unless people are over 65 or have underlying conditions.\n\nA Paris 2024 spokesperson said organizers remind athletes of \"good practices\" if they experience respiratory symptoms, including wearing a mask in the presence of others, limiting contacts and washing hands regularly. National Olympic committees and federations can add further measures, said the spokesperson, who could not be identified by name in line with the Paris 2024 organizing committee's policies.\n\nThe Olympic Village is equipped with its own clinic offering a broad range of health care services at no cost to athletes.\n\nThe Tokyo Games in August 2021 were held before most countries had finished their immunization programs, and when vaccine supplies were still quite limited. Athletes, media and other visitors had to submit saliva samples daily, with thousands of tubes being submitted and tested over the course of the Games. Surges in positive cases outside the Olympic bubble had provoked the government to declare increasingly widespread states of emergency.\n\nAny positive tests led to immediate isolation at a separate \"COVID-19 hotel.\" Anyone with significant symptoms was hospitalized.\n\nAll Olympic visitors had to have two negative COVID-19 tests before boarding flights to Japan, and they were tested again upon arrival.\n\nOlympic dining facilities had plastic screens between each seat, and diners had to wear gloves to pick up their food. No fans were allowed at any events, leading to strange scenes, with sound echoing through empty stadiums and coaches able to be heard encouraging their athletes.\n\nThe rules at the Winter Games in Beijing in February 2022 were even stricter, in line with China's policies.\n\nOlympic organizers operated a health security bubble -- called a \"closed-loop management system\" -- even for vaccinated people before, during and after the Winter Olympics and Paralympics.\n\nNo fans from outside China were allowed in. Any Olympic media or sports official had to test negative.\n\nAny Olympic volunteers from China had to go to individual hotel rooms and quarantine for three weeks before the Olympics and for three weeks after the Games before returning home. They had food delivered and were not allowed to leave their rooms.\n\nAnyone who tested positive was immediately isolated.\n\nFrance once had tight COVID-19 restrictions, including strict lockdowns when the pandemic broke out in 2020, followed by mandatory regulations to wear masks outdoors, an 8-month nightly coronavirus curfew and vaccine requirements. The country lifted isolation measures last year, instead advising people to follow basic health recommendations -- just in time for Olympics that organizers labeled the \"Games Wide Open.\"\n\n___\n\nAssociated Press Writer Kate Brumback in Paris and AP Medical Writer Maria Cheng in London contributed to this report.", "source": {"uri": "baynews9.com", "dataType": "news",

Instead they seem to be the ''who cares about COVID'' Games.\n\nNoah Lyles won a bronze with the virus in front of tens of thousands of spectators, and dozens of other athletes at the Games have tested positive. But organizers have only issued health recommendations, and no restrictions, allowing athletes to compete if they wish and are able to.\n\nThis comes in sharp contrast with the Tokyo Olympics in 2021, which had to be delayed by a year due to the global pandemic and were held under intense COVID-19 regulations -- and no fans allowed at any events. Six months later, the Winter Games in Beijing had even stricter protocols because of China's zero-tolerance policy.\n\nIn Paris, the Olympics recall pre-COVID times. French people have revived the double-cheeked greeting embrace -- \"la bise.\" Fans joyfully reach out at venues to slap athletes' hands. Masks are rarely seen in crowds of supporters, and people from across the world could come to France without proof of vaccines or negative virus tests.\n\nThe World Health Organization said earlier this week that at least 40 athletes at the Olympics had tested positive for the virus, amid growing cases worldwide.\n\nOn Thursday night, Noah Lyles was carted off the track in a wheelchair after he finished third in the 200 meters. He then said he had tested positive for COVID two days before.\n\nLast week, British star Adam Peaty tested positive less than 24 hours after claiming a swimming silver medal. He said he first began feeling ill a day earlier ahead of the 100-meter breaststroke final.\n\nThe Australian delegation in Paris said five COVID-hit players on its women's water polo team were clear to practice when they feel well enough to train.\n\nCOVID \"is being treated like any other respiratory disease,\" International Olympic Committee president Thomas Bach said Friday. \"It is being treated like flu now, so there is no obligation for any special measures or notifications.\"\n\nCOVID is no longer a global health emergency according to the WHO, and with much higher vaccination levels now than during the previous two Olympics, it is typically treated like any other respiratory illness. There has been a surge of COVID globally this summer, but because of vaccination and prior infection, most cases are mild unless people are over 65 or have underlying conditions.\n\nA Paris 2024 spokesperson said organizers remind athletes of ''good practices'' if they experience respiratory symptoms, including wearing a mask in the presence of others, limiting contacts and washing hands regularly. National Olympic committees and federations can add further measures, said the spokesperson, who could not be identified by name in line with the Paris 2024 organizing committee's policies.\n\nThe Olympic Village is equipped with its own clinic offering a broad range of health care services at no cost to athletes.\n\nThe Tokyo Games in August 2021 were held before most countries had finished their immunization programs, and when vaccine supplies were still quite limited. Athletes, media and other visitors had to submit saliva samples daily, with thousands of tubes being submitted and tested over the course of the Games.

No fans were allowed at any events, leading to strange scenes, with sound echoing through empty stadiums and coaches able to be heard encouraging their athletes.\n\nThe rules at the Winter Games in Beijing in February 2022 were even stricter, in line with China's policies.\n\nOlympic organizers operated a health security bubble -- called a \"closed-loop management system\" -- even for vaccinated people before, during and after the Winter Olympics and Paralympics.\n\nNo fans from outside China were allowed in. Any Olympic media or sports officials had to test negative.\n\nAny Olympic volunteers from China had to go to individual hotel rooms and quarantine for three weeks before the Olympics and for three weeks after the Games before returning home. They had food delivered and were not allowed to leave their rooms.\n\nAnyone who tested positive was immediately isolated.\n\nFrance once had tight COVID restrictions, including strict lockdowns when the pandemic broke out in 2020 followed by mandatory regulations to wear masks outdoors, an 8-month nightly coronavirus curfew and vaccine requirements. The country lifted isolation measures last year, instead advising people to follow basic health recommendations -- just in time for Olympics that organizers labeled the ''Games Wide Open.''\n\nKate

Instead they seem to be the ''who cares about COVID'' Games.\n\nNoah Lyles won a bronze with the virus in front of tens of thousands of spectators, and dozens of other athletes at the Games have tested positive. But organizers have only issued health recommendations, and no restrictions, allowing athletes to compete if they wish and are able to.\n\nThis comes in sharp contrast with the Tokyo Olympics in 2021, which had to be delayed by a year due to the global pandemic and were held under intense COVID-19 regulations -- and no fans allowed at any events. Six months later, the Winter Games in Beijing had even stricter protocols because of China's zero-tolerance policy.\n\nPeople are also reading...

French people have revived the double-cheeked greeting embrace -- \"la bise.\" Fans joyfully reach out at venues to slap athletes' hands. Masks are rarely seen in crowds of supporters, and people from across the world could come to France without proof of vaccines or negative virus tests.\n\nThe World Health Organization said earlier this week that at least 40 athletes at the Olympics had tested positive for the virus, amid growing cases worldwide.\n\nOn Thursday night, Noah Lyles was carted off the track in a wheelchair after he finished third in the 200 meters. He then said he had tested positive for COVID two days before.\n\nLast week, British star Adam Peaty tested positive less than 24 hours after claiming a swimming silver medal. He said he first began feeling ill a day earlier ahead of the 100-meter breaststroke final.\n\nThe Australian delegation in Paris said five COVID-hit players on its women's water polo team were clear to practice when they feel well enough to train.\n\nCOVID \"is being treated like any other respiratory disease,\" International Olympic Committee president Thomas Bach said Friday. \"It is being treated like flu now, so there is no obligation for any special measures or notifications.\"\n\nCOVID is no longer a global health emergency according to the WHO, and with much higher vaccination levels now than during the previous two Olympics, it is typically treated like any other respiratory illness. There has been a surge of COVID globally this summer, but because of vaccination and prior infection, most cases are mild unless people are over 65 or have underlying conditions.\n\nA Paris 2024 spokesperson said organizers remind athletes of ''good practices'' if they experience respiratory symptoms, including wearing a mask in the presence of others, limiting contacts and washing hands regularly. National Olympic committees and federations can add further measures, said the spokesperson, who could not be identified by name in line with the Paris 2024 organizing committee's policies.\n\nThe Olympic Village is equipped with its own clinic offering a broad range of health care services at no cost to athletes.\n\nThe Tokyo Games in August 2021 were held before most countries had finished their immunization programs, and when vaccine supplies were still quite limited. Athletes, media and other visitors had to submit saliva samples daily, with thousands of tubes being submitted and tested over the course of the Games. Surges in positive cases outside the Olympic bubble had provoked the government to declare increasingly widespread states of emergency.\n\nAny positive tests led to immediate isolation at a separate \"COVID hotel.\" Anyone with significant symptoms was hospitalized.\n\nAll Olympic visitors had to have two negative COVID tests before boarding flights to Japan, and they were tested again upon arrival.\n\nOlympic dining facilities had plastic screens between each seat, and diners had to wear gloves to pick up their food. No fans were allowed at any events, leading to strange scenes, with sound echoing through empty stadiums and coaches able to be heard encouraging their athletes.\n\nThe rules at the Winter Games in Beijing in February 2022 were even stricter, in line with China's policies.\n\nOlympic organizers operated a health security bubble -- called a \"closed-loop management system\" -- even for vaccinated people before, during and after the Winter Olympics and Paralympics.\n\nNo fans from outside China were allowed in. Any Olympic media or sports officials had to test negative.\n\nAny Olympic volunteers from China had to go to individual hotel rooms and quarantine for three weeks before the Olympics and for three weeks after the Games before returning home. They had food delivered and were not allowed to leave their rooms.\n\nAnyone who tested positive was immediately isolated.\n\nFrance once had tight COVID restrictions, including strict lockdowns when the pandemic broke out in 2020 followed by mandatory regulations to wear masks outdoors, an 8-month nightly coronavirus curfew and vaccine requirements. The country lifted isolation measures last year, instead advising people to follow basic health recommendations -- just in time for Olympics that organizers labeled the ''Games Wide Open.''\n\nKate Brumback in Paris and Maria Cheng in London contributed to the story.\n\nCopyright 2024 The Associated Press.

He then got onto one knee and stayed there for nearly 30 seconds before getting up and asking for water. He later left in a wheelchair.\n\nAfter being treated by medical staff, a masked Lyles revealed he tested positive for COVID-19 two days earlier on Aug. 6.\n\nMany people on social media asked why Lyles was even allowed to compete in the race after testing positive for COVID-19, while some questioned whether similar protocols apply to other Olympians participating in the Paris games.\n\nAre Olympians allowed to compete after testing positive for COVID-19?\n\nYes, Olympians are allowed to compete after testing positive for COVID-19.\n\nSign up for the VERIFY Fast Facts daily Newsletter!\n\nAthletes at the 2024 Paris Olympics can compete after testing positive for COVID-19. That's because there are no official COVID-19 restrictions at this year's Games.\n\nOlympic organizers have only issued health recommendations for respiratory viruses, allowing Olympians to participate in the events if they wish and are able to.\n\n\"COVID is being treated like any other respiratory disease,\" International Olympic Committee (IOC) President Thomas Bach said on Aug. 9. \"It is being treated like flu now, so there is no obligation for any special measures or notifications.\"\n\nIn an email, a Paris 2024 spokesperson told VERIFY that organizers remind athletes of \"good practices\" if they experience respiratory symptoms, including wearing a mask in the presence of others, limiting contact and washing hands regularly.\n\nNational Olympic committees and federations can add further measures, according to the spokesperson. The Olympic Village is also equipped with its own clinic offering a broad range of health care services at no cost to athletes.\n\nOn Aug. 8, USA Track & Field (USATF) and the U.S. Olympic and Paralympic Committee released a joint statement confirming that Noah Lyles had tested positive for COVID-19 on Aug. 6. In response, USATF said it \"swiftly enacted all necessary protocols to prioritize his health, the wellbeing of our team, and the safety of fellow competitors.\"\n\n\"Our primary commitment is to ensure the safety of Team USA athletes while upholding their right to compete. After a thorough medical evaluation, Noah chose to compete tonight. We respect his decision and will continue to monitor his condition closely,\" the statement said.\n\nThe USATF also said that it was adhering to current CDC, USOPC, and IOC guidelines for respiratory illnesses \"to prevent the spread of illness.\"\n\nIn 2021, at the Tokyo Olympics, a positive COVID-19 test would have put an athlete in immediate isolation, forcing them to quarantine in a special hotel with no contact with other Olympic athletes. Even in 2022 at the Winter Games in Beijing, China, daily tests and strict isolation measures were automatic.\n\nBut COVID-19 rules have changed in much of society, including at the Olympics. France, which once had tight COVID-19 restrictions, no longer has rules for people with the virus. Instead, the Ministry of Health recommends that people who test positive wear a mask, self-isolate and practice hand hygiene.\n\nThe World Health Organization (WHO) said during a press conference on Aug. 6. that at least 40 athletes at the Olympics had tested positive for COVID-19 or other respiratory illnesses, amid growing cases worldwide.", "source": {"uri": "cbs8.com", "dataType": "news",

Athletes are not required to wear a mask or wash their hands if they test positive, but they are encouraged to use single rooms in the Olympic Village and separate transport to and from events when possible to avoid spread.\n\nAlthough he took bronze in the race, Noah was clearly feeling the effects of COVID afterward and was taken off the track in a wheelchair after the event.

Statements of Scottish defiance are now rarely heard at major tournaments, yet on the eve of the Euros, captain Andy Robertson declared: \"If we perform the way we know we can perform, we believe we can make history.\"\n\nIt has been 26 years since Scotland played a fixture of such international magnitude. Against Germany, there will be a symmetry to when the Tartan Army took on Brazil at the Stade de France in the opening game of the 1998 World Cup. That tournament, like many before, became one of glorious failure for Scotland. A generation on, this team believes they can become the first to progress from a group stage.\n\nRobertson admitted an opening game against the hosts \"doesn't get much tougher\". Germany will be fueled by emotion and a sense of timing, while head coach Julian Nagelsmann issued a rallying cry of his own. \"We want to have the country behind us, to push us forward,\" he said. A nation expects a victory to send Germany hurtling into a golden summer. It is up to Scotland to stand in their way.\n\nThey will do so with the Tartan Army behind them. For the thousands who filled the Marienplatz square in Munich on Thursday, Scotland's first major men's tournament abroad since 1998 feels like a once-in-a-lifetime experience. For the 26 players in Steve Clarke's squad, those emotions are only enhanced: the majority will not have faced an occasion like it, and may not do so again. It is the game of their lives.\n\nEven the 60-year-old Clarke, despite featuring in matches as big as Champions League finals in his time as assistant manager at Chelsea, was taken aback by the size of the press conference room at the Allianz Arena in Munich.\n\nClarke, though, was never going to get carried away, or deliver too much of a performance. The manager who has led Scotland to back-to-back European Championships is not one for wasting his words. \"Settled well, trained well, looking forward to the match,\" he said. Clarke did describe the enormity of Scotland's opener as a \"sideshow\" but amid all the noise and excitement back home, he will have been telling his players to trust the basics.\n\nAs messages from family and videos of the Tartan Army arriving in Munich reached the squad, Clarke and Robertson were more than aware of how proud the country is of their achievement in reaching the Euros. But there is a determination within the group to create something else to be proud of. Robertson admitted Scotland \"let ourselves down\" at Euro 2020, where they claimed a draw against England at Wembley but were eliminated following defeats at home to the Czech Republic and Croatia.\n\nThat experience should help. As it was ahead of Euro 2020, the build-up to a major tournament can feel like \"years and years\", but Scotland are aware of how quickly it can then slip away. \"We don't want to have regrets,\" Robertson said. The manner of Scotland's qualification campaign proved what they were capable of, and they are not in Germany to make up the numbers. \"There's no pressure or expectation from the wider world, but we expect a lot from ourselves,\" Robertson added.\n\nGermany may be the hardest start but Scotland have nothing to lose. It is their remaining fixtures against Switzerland and Hungary where Clarke is aiming to claim the four points that would be enough to reach the last 16. Scotland will prepare for Germany to have the majority of the ball, and will set out to be \"compact\" and \"frustrate\" their hosts. Nagelsmann has warned his team of the \"Scottish mentality\", that offers more than just \"long balls\" into the box. \"They are a team without world stars but that makes them dangerous,\" he said, as a compliment.\n\nThere were two schools of thought when Scotland were drawn to face Germany in the tournament opener. The first was the risk that Scotland could run into an inspired opponent, with their first opportunity to display the power of home advantage and show they are coming together at the right time. Against that, Scotland would do well not to be swept aside. Conversely, the other theory is it could be the best time for Scotland to play Germany, to jump upon any uncertainty, to expose a young, fraught team burned by recent embarrassments at major tournaments.\n\nNagelsmann is not looking at the past. Scotland, though, can look to the future with hope. Beyond their return at Euro 2020, failure to get out of the group stages is not on this squad, but they would go down in history should they progress. If not, as Robertson pointed out, they will simply join the long list of Scottish teams who fell at the first hurdle. And ahead of facing the hosts, it was a message that felt better when it was out in the open, said loud and clear.

I don't view it that way.\n\n\"Under Steve Clarke, people will talk about their recent form in friendlies and they've won one out of their last nine games but they had some tricky fixtures in there and actually tested themselves.\"\n\nScotland will be hell-bent on demonstrating they are not just in Germany to make up the numbers.\n\nIn their first and only previous meeting with the tournament hosts at a European Championship, the Germans ended Scotland's hopes of Euro 92 progression with a 2-0 victory in Norrkoping.\n\nAvenging that defeat will be in the back of the minds of those setting up camp in Munich, but manager Clarke must decide on a couple of selection conundrums, according to Sutton.\n\n\"We've learned from qualifying that Scotland are a really well-balanced team,\" added the Sky Sports pundit. \"There are areas of concern, of course.\n\n\"Scotland have a centre-back dilemma like England. Grant Hanley hasn't played a lot of football at Norwich City this past season.\n\n\"But Clarke likes him and I suspect he will start. The other question mark is over who starts up front: Lawrence Shankland or Che Adams.\n\n\"I suspect Clarke will go with Adams, who is probably a better leader of the line but Shankland is a phenomenal finisher.\"\n\n\"I'm looking forward to the game as Clarke and the players will view this as an opportunity and if Germany are slightly off it, I think they can get a positive result.\n\n\"If Germany are on form, at home, I can't see how they don't beat Scotland but you just never know.\"\n\nMuch was made of Germany's indifferent form last year.\n\nBeing a host nation means no qualification games and in 2023 they played 11 friendlies and won only three - against Peru, France and the United States - while losing six.\n\nAmid that run, new boss Julian Nagelsmann took over in September and, since the turn of the year, Germany are unbeaten in four matches.\n\nWins against France and Netherlands preceded a goalless draw against Ukraine, which came before a victory over Greece last Friday.\n\nEven if performances have still been patchy, then they look to have found the way to get results just in time.\n\n\"Nagelsmann has come in quite late in the day and they had a couple of morale-boosting wins in March against the Netherlands and France. He'll be hoping they can carry on that form.\n\n\"We've seen in recent years that Hungary can be a very awkward team and they've got some phenomenal players, led by Liverpool's Dominik Szoboszlai.\n\n\"The Swiss, albeit you feel they're on the decline and have an ageing team, they're still very capable. Clarke will have to make a decision on his midfield balance in those games.\n\n\"Will it be Billy Gilmour or Ryan Christie? Scott McTominay had a phenomenal qualifying campaign in terms of goals while John McGinn and Callum McGregor are both wonderful footballers.\n\n\"Scotland's midfield stands up to most in this competition so it'll come down to how brave they are on the ball, how are they going to get up the pitch and whether they can pray on a little bit of German hesitation if they're not quite at it.\"\n\nSky Sports' Kris Boyd:\n\n\"It's been a long time coming. We're looking forward to it, Steve Clarke has done an incredible job. I'm sure the boys will be ready.\n\n\"Whatever happens, the Tartan Army make the tournament. Everybody has travelled. They will be well behaved and have the banter that goes with the kilts.\n\n\"We have to go there with belief to get out the group - that would be success although it's a difficult group. It's going to be a great occasion on Friday night but the two games after that will be just as difficult. Hungary have been at the last three Euros and Switzerland qualify for every tournament. The other two nations have some big names and all this Germany on home soil.\n\n\"We need to get away from Scotland just being happy to turn up. It's a negative mindset. We have to go and enjoy it but Clarke won't be speaking to the players like that. There's a chance for Scotland to get out of this group.\n\n\"John McGinn is one goal behind Ally McCoist and level with Kenny Miller, so it's an unbelievable achievement for a midfielder. Since Clarke has come in, McGinn's levels have gone through the roof. Scott McTominay has been Scotland's best player, even when playing for Manchester United he's done well.\n\n\"It's a fresh start for the players. These players are under pressure every week with their clubs. Andy Robertson, under pressure. Callum McGregor, under pressure. It will be the same for Scotland. The fans will expect.\"\n\nGermany are packed full of world-class players starting in goal with 38-year-old Manuel Neuer, albeit he recently made a high-profile blunder in Bayern Munich's Champions League semi-final defeat to Real Madrid.\n\nThe defence can boast experience in Antonio Rudiger of Real Madrid and Bayern Munich's Joshua Kimmich.\n\nGermany have also been boosted by the return of midfielder Toni Kroos after a long absence. The midfielder has 109 caps and will finish his football career after this tournament.\n\nCaptain Ilkay Gundogan of Barcelona and Leroy Sane of Bayern Munich both had spells at Manchester City while Pascal Gross is a team-mate of Billy Gilmour's at Brighton.\n\nArsenal's Kai Havertz scored in last week's friendly win over Greece and evergreen 34-year-old forward Thomas Muller has a remarkable 45 goals in 129 caps.\n\nOn the face of it, Scotland's record against the Germans is not too bad - winning four and drawing five of their 17 meetings.\n\nHowever, Scotland have never beaten them in a competitive game.\n\nIn tournament finals, Germany won the 1986 World Cup encounter 2-1 and recorded a 1-0 win at Euro 92.\n\nScotland's last victory in the fixture was in 1999 when Don Hutchison, earning his second cap, scored the winner in a 1-0 friendly win in Bremen.\n\nThe most recent meeting between the sides was in September 2015 when Germany won 3-2 in a European Championship qualifier at Hampden.\n\nGrant Hanley and James Forrest remain from the Scotland squad while Germany had Neuer, Kroos, Muller and Gundogan in their line-up. Muller scored twice and Gundogan got the winner.", "source": {"uri": "skysports.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "SkySports"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

The other two nations have some big names and all this Germany on home soil.\n\n\"We need to get away from Scotland just being happy to turn up. It's a negative mindset. We have to go and enjoy it but Clarke won't be speaking to the players like that. There's a chance for Scotland to get out of this group.\n\n\"John McGinn is one goal behind Ally McCoist and level with Kenny Miller, so it's an unbelievable achievement for a midfielder. Since Clarke has come in, McGinn's levels have gone through the roof. Scott McTominay has been Scotland's best player, even when playing for Manchester United he's done well.\n\n\"It's a fresh start for the players. These players are under pressure every week with their clubs. Andy Robertson, under pressure. Callum McGregor, under pressure. It will be the same for Scotland. The fans will expect.\"\n\nGermany are packed full of world-class players starting in goal with 38-year-old Manuel Neuer, albeit he recently made a high-profile blunder in Bayern Munich's Champions League semi-final defeat to Real Madrid.\n\nThe defence can boast experience in Antonio Rudiger of Real Madrid and Bayern Munich's Joshua Kimmich.\n\nGermany have also been boosted by the return of midfielder Toni Kroos after a long absence. The midfielder has 109 caps and will finish his football career after this tournament.\n\nCaptain Ilkay Gundogan of Barcelona and Leroy Sane of Bayern Munich both had spells at Manchester City while Pascal Gross is a team-mate of Billy Gilmour's at Brighton.\n\nArsenal's Kai Havertz scored in last week's friendly win over Greece and evergreen 34-year-old forward Thomas Muller has a remarkable 45 goals in 129 caps.\n\nOn the face of it, Scotland's record against the Germans is not too bad - winning four and drawing five of their 17 meetings.\n\nHowever, Scotland have never beaten them in a competitive game.\n\nIn tournament finals, Germany won the 1986 World Cup encounter 2-1 and recorded a 1-0 win at Euro 92.\n\nScotland's last victory in the fixture was in 1999 when Don Hutchison, earning his second cap, scored the winner in a 1-0 friendly win in Bremen.\n\nThe most recent meeting between the sides was in September 2015 when Germany won 3-2 in a European Championship qualifier at Hampden.\n\nGrant Hanley and James Forrest remain from the Scotland squad while Germany had Neuer, Kroos, Muller and Gundogan in their line-up. Muller scored twice and Gundogan got the winner.", "source": {"uri": "skysports.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "SkySports"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

More info\n\nJulian Nagelsmann refuses to underestimate Scotland ahead of Germany's Euro 2024 opener.\n\nGermany kick off the tournament by taking on The Tartan Army at the Allianz Arena on Friday night. Die Mannschaft are one of the favourites to win the Euros - the first competition they have hosted since the 2006 World Cup - while Scotland have never progressed to the knockout stages of an international tournament.\n\nGermany manager Nagelsmann admitted after the draw was made in December that his side had avoided one of the tougher groups, like the dreaded 'Group B'. But he was under no impression that facing Steve Clarke's side was a straightforward task.\n\nThe former Bayern Munich boss said: \"This is not a group of death, but there are no really bad opponents. This is an interesting group in which we obviously want to assert ourselves.\"\n\nVoicing his thoughts on Germany's chances, he also stated: \"It's only the second time Germany has hosted a European Championship. For the players, and for myself as a manager, to take part in a tournament on home soil is a unique opportunity. There is pressure involved, but more so joy. If we can see that joy on the pitch, then we will have a great tournament.\"\n\nMeanwhile, Clarke wants his Scotland stars to remain laser-focused ahead of their monumental challenge amid all the distractions that come with facing the hosts, such as the opening ceremony.\n\nHe told the BBC Scotland post-draw show: \"It's good, you know when you're up against it. It's nice to be in the tournament and it's nice to be involved in that first game and hopefully, we can start the tournament off with a good match.\"\n\nClarke added: \"Germany are going to be very good. It's their home tournament and they won't want to let anyone down. When it gets to the big stage, the German national team are always one of the most dangerous teams. We expect a tough game, but hopefully we can give Germany a tough game as well.\"\n\nScotland finished second in their qualification group behind Spain with 17 points, winning five, drawing two and losing just one game. After the opener against Germany, they face Switzerland and Hungary as they attempt to make history.", "source": {"uri": "dailyrecord.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "Daily Record"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scotland", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Scotland"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Scotland"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Germany", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Germany"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Germany"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euro", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Euro"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Julian_Nagelsmann", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Julian Nagelsmann"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tartan_Army", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Tartan Army"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Allianz_Arena", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Allianz Arena"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FIFA_World_Cup", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "FIFA World Cup"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manager_(association_football)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Manager (association football)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single-elimination_tournament", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Single-elimination tournament"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Group_of_death", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Group of death"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steve_Clarke", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Steve Clarke"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UEFA_European_Championship", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "UEFA European Championship"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FC_Bayern_Munich", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "FC Bayern Munich"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Football_pitch", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Football pitch"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BBC_Scotland", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "BBC Scotland"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Germany_national_football_team", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Germany national football team"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hungary", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Hungary"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Hungary"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spain", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Spain"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Spain"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Switzerland", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Switzerland"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Switzerland"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Golf/Tournaments_and_Events", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Golf/Tournaments and Events", "wgt": 17}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Tournaments", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Tournaments", "wgt": 24}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Tennis/Tournaments", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Tennis/Tournaments", "wgt": 21}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Hand-Eye_Coordination", "label": "dmoz/Games/Hand-Eye Coordination", "wgt": 17}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Volleyball/Tournaments", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Volleyball/Tournaments", "wgt": 17}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 97}], "image": "https://i2-prod.dailystar.co.uk/incoming/article33020596.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_Germany-Training-Session-And-Press-Conference-Herzogenaurach-Training-Camp-Day-1.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9648341", "eventUri": "eng-9648341", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.0117647058823529, "wgt": 171, "relevance": 1}

Borussia Dortmund's Emre Can was called up as his replacement, although he is unlikely to be in the first 11 for this match.\n\nToni Kroos will start ahead of his retirement after the tournament, with Arsenal star Kai Havertz expected to lead the attack after scoring in the 2-1 friendly win over Greece. Nagelsmann has previously made it clear he plans to stick with the lineup from their March friendly wins over France and the Netherlands.\n\nGermany projected starting lineup (4-3-3): Neuer (GK) -- Kimmich, Rudiger, Tah, Mittelstadt -- Kroos, Gundogan, Andrich -- Musiala, Havertz, Wirtz.\n\nScotland were held to a late 2-2 draw against Finland in their final pre-Euro 2024 friendly game and head coach Steve Clarke is missing some key names for the tournament due to injury.\n\nCaptain Andrew Robertson has been passed fit with Premier League duo Scott McTominay and John McGinn set to partner up in midfield for Scotland.\n\nScotland projected starting lineup (3-4-2-1): Gunn (GK) -- Hendry, Hanley, Tierney -- Ralston, Christie, McGregor, Robertson -- McGinn, McTominay -- Shankland.\n\nScotland look well placed to end their frustrating record of missing out on the knockout stages with the possibility of a third place finish being enough to see them through to the Round of 16.\n\nHowever, it's difficult to see past a solid win for the home side, despite their lack of competitive action since the 2022 World Cup.

The Euros kick off in Munich, Friday June 14, when host country Germany plays Scotland at Bayern Munich's Allianz Arena. The tournament begins with six groups of four teams.\n\nMUNICH (AP) -- The sound of bagpipes, and men in kilts on the streets of Munich -- Scotland is in town and the excitement is ramping up ahead of the European Championship curtainraiser on Friday.\n\nHost nation Germany plays Scotland at Allianz Arena in the opener of the month-long tournament.\n\nThe final is in Berlin on July 14 and Germany is even keener to get there after three straight fiascos at major tournaments that has forced its fans to readjust their expectations of the men's national team.\n\n\"We are not here just to say hello but we still have to be humble,\" Germany defender Antonio R\u00fcdiger said. \"We don't have to talk about past tournaments, we all know what happened there.\n\n\"It's been up and down for us all the way here and that's why we have to be humble. The first match is very important and then we'll see what happens during the rest of the tournament.\"\n\nA good first match and group stage would set off a new wave of excitement in Germany, even though scenes similar to when it brilliantly hosted the 2006 World Cup (and reached the semifinals) are hard to imagine in a changed political landscape.\n\nWhile the Scots are out in droves in Munich, proudly wearing their team jerseys (many combined with kilts), there is hardly a sighting of a Germany shirt or flag. Political extremists are flourishing, anxiety pervades the country, and the national team has under-performed. It is understandable the home fans are going about their daily life in contrast to the partying visitors.\n\nWhile the Germans are bemused by their raucous Scottish counterparts, there should still be plenty of more colors on matchday.\n\n\"First and foremost, there's a lot of anticipation because it's a huge event,\" Germany coach Julian Nagelsmann said. \"It's probably not just Europe, but the whole world that will be watching how the Euros will go ... we're really looking forward to it.\"\n\nGermany went out at the group stage of both previous World Cups and was eliminated by England in the round of 16 at Euro 2021. But defeat to Scotland would be a shock, even though the Scots have improved a lot in recent years.\n\n\"It's going to be an amazing experience ... being part of that kind of opening ceremony,\" Scotland forward Ryan Christie said when asked about playing the opening match.\n\n\"Germany, an amazing team. All the international teams go through peaks and drops in form. But when these big tournaments come up, the big teams normally show up most of the time. So it will be a really tough game.\"\n\nHungary and Switzerland are also in Group A.\n\nHaving failed to reach the Euros from 2000-16, Scotland has qualified for back-to-back tournaments and the next aim is to reach the knockout stage for the first time.\n\n\"That's the dream,\" Christie said. \"To everyone around Scotland, it would mean the world, a massive kind of footballing country. If we come out of the group stages, that's the furthest Scotland will have ever been in a major tournament.\n\n\"So, you know, it puts us down in history as the most successful Scottish team ever, and that's the kind of motivation right there. We've got a huge belief in ourselves, with this squad of players, that we can really do a lot of damage to other teams and hopefully do well when we go to these big tournaments.\"\n\nScotland showed during the qualifying campaign it can surprise, in beating Spain and Norway.\n\nHowever, Scotland has won only one of its last 13 matches against Germany and that was more than 25 years ago, 1-0 in a friendly in April 1999.\n\nPlus, Germany has another, rather more unusual motivation to win the trophy on its own turf.\n\nDeniz Undav has said he will shave the head of fellow Germany forward Thomas M\u00fcller if the team becomes European champion.\n\n\"Thomas M\u00fcller bald? Then we have to do everything we can to make this happen. I don't think he will look so beautiful with a shaved head,\" defender R\u00fcdiger said with a laugh.\n\nAP Euro 2024: https://apnews.com/hub/euro-2024", "source": {"uri": "register-herald.com",

But defeat to Scotland would be a shock, even though the Scots have improved a lot in recent years.\n\n\"It's going to be an amazing experience ... being part of that kind of opening ceremony,\" Scotland forward Ryan Christie said when asked about playing the opening match.\n\n\"Germany, an amazing team. All the international teams go through peaks and drops in form. But when these big tournaments come up, the big teams normally show up most of the time. So it will be a really tough game.\"\n\nHungary and Switzerland are also in Group A.\n\nHaving failed to reach the Euros from 2000-16, Scotland has qualified for back-to-back tournaments and the next aim is to reach the knockout stage for the first time.\n\n\"That's the dream,\" Christie said. \"To everyone around Scotland, it would mean the world, a massive kind of footballing country. If we come out of the group stages, that's the furthest Scotland will have ever been in a major tournament.\n\n\"So, you know, it puts us down in history as the most successful Scottish team ever, and that's the kind of motivation right there. We've got a huge belief in ourselves, with this squad of players, that we can really do a lot of damage to other teams and hopefully do well when we go to these big tournaments.\"\n\nScotland showed during the qualifying campaign it could surprise, in beating Spain and Norway.\n\nALSO READ: Top controversies in European Championships before EURO 2024: From match-fixing allegations to coin toss to decide a match\n\nHowever, Scotland has won only one of its last 13 matches against Germany and that was more than 25 years ago, 1-0 in a friendly in April 1999.\n\nPlus, Germany has another, rather more unusual motivation to win the trophy on its own turf.\n\nDeniz Undav has said he will shave the head of fellow German forward Thomas M\u00fcller if the team becomes European champion.\n\n\"Thomas Muller bald? Then we have to do everything we can to make this happen. I don't think he will look so beautiful with a shaved head,\" defender R\u00fcdiger said with a laugh.\n\nLatest on SportstarBAN vs NED Live Score, T20 World Cup 2024: Toss at 7:30 p.m. IST;

Steve Clarke's side in opener", "body": "EURO 2024 kicks off with a bang as the hosts Germany take on Scotland in Munich!\n\nThe winner will give themselves a fantastic chance of qualifying for the knock-out round, so the pressure is on.\n\nEuro 2024 free bets and offers\n\nGermany already carry the weight of expectation that comes with being the host nation.\n\nIt is the first time they will host a major tournament since the 2006 World Cup, when they reached the semi-finals.\n\nThat will be the minimum goal for Julian Nagelsmann and his side, though Germany have struggled in recent years.\n\nThey were knocked out in the group stage of the previous two World Cups, while England beat Die Mannschaft 2-0 at Wembley at Euro 2020.\n\nHowever with the likes of Mats Hummels, Jamal Musiala and Kai Havertz enjoying impressive campaigns for their clubs this season, there is a chance they could go far in the tournament.\n\nScotland will have something to say about that with a lot of excitement surrounding Steve Clarke's side.\n\nA superb qualifying campaign saw them finish second in their group ahead of a Norway team boasting Erling Haaland and Martin Odegaard.\n\nThey also proved they can compete with the best after a convincing 2-0 win over Spain at Hampden in March last year.\n\nAnd while Scott McTominay grabbed the headlines with seven goals in qualifying, the midfield duo of John McGinn and Billy Gilmour have been key to Scotland's resurgence.\n\nGermany qualified for the tournament as hosts but have played several top teams over the last few months in preparation.\n\nThey beat France and the Netherlands in March before drawing with Ukraine 0-0 on Monday, but appear to have got over the hiccup which saw them lose to Turkey and Austria in successive matches last year.\n\nMeanwhile Scotland lost just once in qualifying - in Spain, winning five of their eight games.\n\nHowever their form has dropped off since with defeats to Northern Ireland and the Netherlands, with the 2-0 win over Gibraltar a much needed confidence booster.\n\nEURO 2024 LIVE: LATEST UPDATES FROM GERMANY\n\nForward Serge Gnabry has been ruled out of the tournament in a big blow to Germany.\n\nThe Bayern Munich star suffered a torn hamstring in the Champions League semi-final against Real Madrid and is facing weeks out.\n\nWhile a thigh injury kept Timo Werner out of Tottenham's final five games of the season, so he now faces a race against time to be fit.\n\nScotland were also dealt a setback last week with the injury to Lyndon Dykes, who now looks set to miss the Euros.\n\nLewis Ferguson will also be a big miss for The Tartan Army after undergoing knee surgery which could keep him out of action for six to seven months.\n\nGermany have a number of exciting players, perhaps none more so than Florian Wirtz who was a key part of Bayer Leverkusen's invincible Bundesliga-winning team.\n\nThe 21-year-old scored 11 goals and produced 12 assists in the league this season, and has 17 caps to his name, with one goal.\n\nFinding a way to get the best out of him and fellow midfielder Musiala will be pivotal for Nagelsmann, and the role Havertz plays could be key.\n\nMikel Arteta got Havertz back to his best this season operating as a false nine, but Nagelsmann has tended to prefer playing Nicolas Fullkrig as the focal point in attack.\n\nFor Scotland their midfield could be decisive in winning games.\n\nEven without Ferguson the likes of Gilmour and McGinn will look to wrestle control of possession, with McTominay the key source of goals.\n\nCaptain Andy Robertson is ever reliable and Bournemouth's Ryan Christie can produce moments of magic too.\n\nGermany will be favourites for the clash and history backs them up.\n\nThey have won eight out of 17 games against Scotland, losing just four of those with their most recent defeat in 1999.\n\nGermany have won their last three meetings with Scotland, winning home and away in qualifying for Euro 2016.\n\nGermany have not fared too well in recent major tournaments but with the help of home support they should prove too much for Scotland. 2-0.", "source": {"uri":

His team are seeking to shine in the post-Joachim Low era, aiming for European glory for the first time since 1996.\n\nGermany, favourites to finish top of the group, boast a solid record in friendlies but haven't faced competitive action since 2022, having qualified for these finals automatically by virtue of being the hosts. Scotland, with just one win in their past nine games, are hoping to upset the odds.\n\nIn head-to-head clashes, Germany hold the edge, winning eight times compared with Scotland's four victories, with five matches ending in a draw. Scotland's recent record against these opponents hasn't been stellar, but in football, surprises are always possible.

Since that tournament, the Germans were eliminated twice at the group stage of the World Cup, and lost to England in the last 16 at the Euros in 2021.\n\nAdmitting to being a \"little nervous\" ahead of his first game coaching Germany at a major tournament, Nagelsmann said he told his players to embrace the pressure in front of their home fans. \"I think it's normal that you feel a little bit of pressure before a tournament and before important games like these,\" the 36-year-old told reporters.\n\n\"Ultimately for me it's the most important theme, when I speak with my players, that pressure is a form of privilege. We need to simply enjoy being on the pitch. That's very important. Our players started playing when they were young. They love it (football). If you do it that way, you're doing it right. We will work out the pressure and we will work out Scotland,\" he added.\n\n\"Scotland isn't a team full of world stars, but that makes them dangerous, because they are very agile players who give everything, with classic Scottish mentality,\" he said.\n\nWhile tens of thousands of Scotland supporters are due in Munich for today's game, Nagelsmann said Germany must capitalise on their \"home-field advantage\" during the tournament. \"It's crazy, I come from a village with 700 residents,\" said Nagelsmann, joking his hometown had \"more cows than people\".\n\n\"And now we have the opening of the Euros in Munich tomorrow - we're really looking forward to it.\"\n\nGermany captain Ilkay Gundogan also spoke of the \"huge privilege\" and \"incredible honour\" of leading the hosts onto the pitch. \"It's something that doesn't come around often in your career. To be a part of this team, this country, and to represent the German people is an honour.\" Nagelsmann shed light on the process of bringing veteran midfielder Toni Kroos, who retired from international duty in 2021, back into the squad. He revealed it took a while to convince the 2014 World Cup winner to return. \"It took a period of time to convince him because he wanted to know what we'll change in the future,\" explained Nagelsmann.\n\n\"He said he'll only be part of the team when he feels we can win, so he wanted to know how we'll change the team. Then he said he'll be part of it and 'let's rock'.\"\n\nKroos retired from club football after winning the Champions League with Real Madrid at the start of the month and will hang up his boots for good at the end of the Euros. Gundogan, who will line up alongside Kroos in midfield, said the six-time Champions League winner \"made the difficult look easy\".\n\n\"I know how important and how decisive these simple-looking passes can be,\" said the Barcelona midfielder. \"You have to be a ridiculously good footballer to achieve the things he has achieved, so that's why he's so important for us.\"\n\nNagelsmann warned his players not to underestimate Scotland, saying Steve Clarke's side were not the \"kick and rush\" team of the past. \"They have flair and good physicality. They may not be full of superstars, but that can make them dangerous.\"", "source": {"uri": "gulf-times.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Gulf-Times"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euro", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Euro"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Munich", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Munich"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Munich"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Germany"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scotland", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Scotland"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Scotland"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Germany", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Germany"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Germany"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Julian_Nagelsmann", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Julian Nagelsmann"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/England_national_football_team", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "England national football team"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UEFA_European_Championship", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "UEFA European Championship"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FIFA_World_Cup", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "FIFA World Cup"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/\u0130lkay_G\u00fcndo\u011fan", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "\u0130lkay G\u00fcndo\u011fan"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toni_Kroos", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Toni Kroos"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Association_football", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Association football"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Real_Madrid_CF", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Real Madrid CF"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Midfielder", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Midfielder"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UEFA_Champions_League", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "UEFA Champions League"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barcelona", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Barcelona"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Barcelona"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Spain"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Paintball/Teams", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Paintball/Teams", "wgt": 16}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Flying_Discs", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Flying Discs", "wgt": 17}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Flying_Discs/Ultimate_Frisbee", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Flying Discs/Ultimate Frisbee", "wgt": 18}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/Statistics", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/Statistics", "wgt": 19}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Team_Handball/Tournaments", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Team Handball/Tournaments", "wgt": 16}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 95}], "image": "https://www.gulf-times.com/gulftimes/uploads/images/2024/06/13/thumbs/300x300/188635.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9648341", "eventUri": "eng-9648341", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1764705882352942, "wgt": 159, "relevance": 1}

Let us know in the comments section.\n\nClarke said on BBC Scotland's post-draw show: \"It's good, you know when you're up against it. It's nice to be in the tournament and it's nice to be involved in that first game and hopefully, we can start the tournament off with a good match.\"\n\nHe added: \"Germany are going to be very good.

The battle for midfield will be critical either way and let's hope the hosts are slow starters.\n\nGermany 0 Scotland 0\n\nScott McDermott\n\nIt's almost tradition the hosts stumble in the opening game of their own major tournament and it can happen again in Munich. Scotland will need to be at their best to limit the Germans' chances but we can get our Euro 2024 campaign off to a flyer with a point - and a Scott McTominay goal.\n\nGermany 1 Scotland 1\n\nMichael Gannon\n\nLet's be honest, Scotland couldn't have landed a tougher opening game. We are right up against it with the hosts out to get off to a flier. Anything Steve Clarke's men can get out of this one will be a bonus, but I've got a good feeling about this. It might be blind optimism but there will be immense pressure on the Germans while we have nothing to lose. Scotland can stun them with the opening goal of the tournament and then hang on for a battling draw.\n\nGermany 1 Scotland 1\n\nScott Burns\n\nI have just got a sneaky feeling this is going to be the tournament where we make our mark. It could all start tonight against the Germans.\n\nAll the pressure is on the hosts and I can see us using that to our advantage. An opening point and a goal from Super John McGinn would set things up nicely.\n\nGermany 1 Scotland 1\n\nAndy Newport\n\nThe Germans will be out to put on a show as hosts but Julian Nagelsmann's team are a long way off the uber efficient machine of old. Of course they have some serious talent with the likes of Kai Havertz, Jamal Musiala and Florian Wirtz leading their attack but I fancy this Scotland side to spoil the hosts' Euro Welcome Party and snatch a valuable draw.\n\nCocky Krauts 1 Scotland 1\n\nGavin Berry\n\nThe fact the hosts are third favourites to win the tournament on home soil tells you this Germany side aren't the force they once were - but let's not kid ourselves it isn't a daunting prospect. And regardless of the fact it's been bounce games and glorified friendlies - a run of one win in nine for Steve Clarke's side has to be a concern. Getting a result in Munich is likely to be too much to ask for a Scotland side missing key players.\n\nGermany 3 Scotland 1\n\nFraser Wilson\n\nIt will take a mammoth effort in Munich but with Steve Clarke's tactical nous, a group of players willing to put their bodies on the line and, of course, a good dollop of quality throughout the ranks then we can get off to a running start if not a flier. I really fancy us to score but the big question is can we keep the Germans out? With minds focused then hopefully Scotland can spoil the party for the hosts and ensure the Tartan Army are raising the steins on opening night.\n\nGermany 1 Scotland 1\n\nGraeme Young\n\nIt's time to be bold on and off the pitch. Germany possesses a myriad of prodigal attacking talents but maybe, just maybe, their best form will come after the fireworks of opening night. Scotland are battle tested and Steve Clarke's steadfast belief in his players is compelling. A win would be a gargantuan result but it doesn't feel impossible. Belief and following our national team haven't always been a perfect pair but maybe the times they are a-changin.\n\nGermany 1 Scotland 2", "source": {"uri": "dailyrecord.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "Daily Record"}, "authors": [{"uri": "sns_group@dailyrecord.co.uk", "name": "Sns Group)", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scotland", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Scotland"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Scotland"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Germany", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Germany"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Germany"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tartan_Army", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Tartan Army"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steve_Clarke", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Steve Clarke"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beer", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Beer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euro", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Euro"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Munich", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Munich"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Munich"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Germany"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UEFA_Euro_2020_Group_A", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "UEFA Euro 2020 Group A"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Julian_Nagelsmann", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Julian Nagelsmann"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Billy_Gilmour", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Billy Gilmour"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oktoberfest", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Oktoberfest"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Allianz_Arena", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Allianz Arena"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FC_Bayern_Munich", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "FC Bayern Munich"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bavaria", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Bavaria"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Bavaria"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Germany"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Midfielder", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Midfielder"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scott_McTominay", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Scott McTominay"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jamal_Musiala", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Jamal Musiala"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Florian_Wirtz", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Florian Wirtz"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newport,_Wales", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Newport, Wales"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Newport, Wales"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_McGinn", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "John McGinn"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kai_Havertz", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Kai Havertz"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Football_pitch", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Football pitch"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/England_national_football_team", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "England national football team"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exhibition_game", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Exhibition game"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fireworks", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Fireworks"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Multiplayer", "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Multiplayer", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Tournaments", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Tournaments", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Tennis/Tournaments", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Tennis/Tournaments", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Open_Source/Project_Hosting", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Open Source/Project Hosting", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Table_Tennis/Tournaments", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Table Tennis/Tournaments", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 95}], "image": "https://i2-prod.dailyrecord.co.uk/sport/football/article33025603.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_Quote-template-2.png", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9648341", "eventUri": "eng-9648341", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.2078431372549019, "wgt": 158, "relevance": 1}

The host Germans open against Scotland in Group A play in the Allianz Arena in Munich.\n\nThis is the only match on Friday before the tournament hits a three-match-per-day cadence for the next three days. Germany is heavily favored to win at home.\n\nGermany is behind only England and France in the odds to win the tournament and is heavily favored to win Group A. Scotland is the longshot in the group, with the longest odds to win the group (+1000) and to advance (-110). If you read that sentence and wondered how -110 are the so-called longest odds to advance, well, the odds are a bit silly. Even if two-thirds of the 24-team Euro 2024 field will make it to the knockout stage, some of the more balanced groups on paper have minus-odds for all four teams due to the hold taken by sportsbooks. Safe to say, that might not be the best spot to place your bets.\n\nThis isn't exactly starting the tournament with a marquee match, but Scotland is a good embodiment of the expanded Euro field. The Scots made two of the 12 the Euros (1992, 1996) from 1968-2012. Since it expanded to 24 teams with the 2016 tournament, they have made it two out of three times. Scotland managed a draw and two losses in the 2020 (2021*) edition, but did not score a goal.\n\nScotland was more impressive in qualifying this cycle though. Scotland beat Spain 2-0 in Glasgow and only suffered one defeat in eight qualifying matches, which was a 2-0 loss at Spain.\n\nThe Germans have much higher expectations and anything other than a win on Friday would send alarm bells ringing. As a host nation that did not need to go through qualifying, Germany hasn't played a competitive match since the shocking group stage exit at the 2022 World Cup. In the interim, Germany has six wins, three draws and six defeats in friendlies. While there are losses to the likes of Poland, Japan, Turkey and Austria in that stretch, Germany did beat France and the Netherlands in back-to-back matches in March.\n\nGermany is in need of a good result at a tournament, not only because of the host status but because Germany has not had good results in recent tournaments. Germany went out in the group stage in the last two World Cups and lost in the Round of 16 at the last Euros. That means Germany doesn't have a win in a knockout match since 2016, which is hard to believe. That's a big drop off from the run from 2002-2016, which saw the Germans make at least the semifinals in seven of eight major tournaments. Germany is even money to make the semifinals in this tournament.\n\nOn a player level, plenty of eyes will be on Toni Kroos. The German midfielder is retiring after the tournament.

The first match is very important and then we\u00b4ll see what happens during the rest of the tournament.\"\n\nA good first match and group stage would set off a new wave of excitement in Germany, even though scenes similar to when it brilliantly hosted the 2006 World Cup (and reached the semifinals) are hard to imagine in a changed political landscape.\n\nGermany's head coach Julian Nagelsmann, front center, players and staff members walk on the pitch during a training session of the German national soccer team in Herzogenaurach, Germany, Thursday, June 13, 2024. (Federico Gambarini/dpa via AP)\n\nWhile the Scots are out in droves in Munich, proudly wearing their team jerseys (many combined with kilts), there is hardly a sighting of a Germany shirt or flag. Political extremists are flourishing, anxiety pervades the country, and the national team has under-performed. It is understandable the home fans are going about their daily life in contrast to the partying visitors.\n\nWhile the Germans are bemused by their raucous Scottish counterparts, there should still be plenty of more colors on matchday.\n\n\"First and foremost, there\u00b4s a lot of anticipation because it\u00b4s a huge event,\" Germany coach Julian Nagelsmann said. \"It\u00b4s probably not just Europe, but the whole world that will be watching how the Euros will go ... we\u00b4re really looking forward to it.\"\n\nGermany went out at the group stage of both previous World Cups and was eliminated by England in the round of 16 at Euro 2021. But defeat to Scotland would be a shock, even though the Scots have improved a lot in recent years.\n\n\"It\u00b4s going to be an amazing experience ... being part of that kind of opening ceremony,\" Scotland forward Ryan Christie said when asked about playing the opening match.\n\n\"Germany, an amazing team. All the international teams go through peaks and drops in form. But when these big tournaments come up, the big teams normally show up most of the time. So it will be a really tough game.\"\n\nHungary and Switzerland are also in Group A.\n\nHaving failed to reach the Euros from 2000-16, Scotland has qualified for back-to-back tournaments and the next aim is to reach the knockout stage for the first time.\n\n\"That\u00b4s the dream,\" Christie said. \"To everyone around Scotland, it would mean the world, a massive kind of footballing country. If we come out of the group stages, that\u00b4s the furthest Scotland will have ever been in a major tournament.\n\n\"So, you know, it puts us down in history as the most successful Scottish team ever, and that\u00b4s the kind of motivation right there. We\u00b4ve got a huge belief in ourselves, with this squad of players, that we can really do a lot of damage to other teams and hopefully do well when we go to these big tournaments.\"\n\nScotland showed during the qualifying campaign it can surprise, in beating Spain and Norway.\n\nHowever, Scotland has won only one of its last 13 matches against Germany and that was more than 25 years ago, 1-0 in a friendly in April 1999.\n\nPlus, Germany has another, rather more unusual motivation to win the trophy on its own turf.\n\nDeniz Undav has said he will shave the head of fellow Germany forward Thomas M\u00fcller if the team becomes European champion.\n\n\"Thomas M\u00fcller bald? Then we have to do everything we can to make this happen. I don\u00b4t think he will look so beautiful with a shaved head,\" defender R\u00fcdiger said with a laugh.\n\nAP Euro 2024: https://apnews.com/hub/euro-2024\n\nFrom left, Germany's Antonio Rudiger, Leroy Sane, Jamal Musiala, Jonathan Tah and Benjamin Henrichs attend a training session in Freudenstadt, Germany, Wednesday June 12, 2024, ahead of the Euro 2024 European soccer Championships.

And I told him, and then he said, 'Yes, I will be part of it' and 'Let's rock!'\"\n\nNow Kroos, who confirmed his return to Germany in February, will try to help the hosts beat a dangerous Scotland team that boasts several Premier League players and beat Spain during qualification.\n\n\"Scotland isn't a team full of world stars, but that makes them dangerous, because they are very agile players who give everything, with classic Scottish mentality,\" Nagelsmann said at a news conference on Thursday.\n\nWhile Germany do feel the pressure and tension ahead of the tournament's opening game, that was necessary, Nagelsmann added, and the team is fully fit and prepared.\n\n\"When I look in my players' eyes, I see a lot of belief and a lot of confidence, which is what I want,\" the former Bayern Munich coach said. \"We have the home advantage, we want to win.\n\n\"We can beat pressure, and we can beat Scotland, as well.\"\n\nGermany have won four World Cups and three European Championship titles, but their stellar tournament reputation has been somewhat tarnished with a series of failures since a 2014 World Cup victory in Brazil.\n\nThey went out of the next two World Cups in the group stage, their worst showing in over 80 years, and exited the last European Championship in the round of 16.\n\n\"We will have more pressure on us than Scotland, and they will want to capitalise on that,\" Nagelsmann, who took over as Germany manager in October 2023, said.\n\nScotland can create chances and retain ball possession and will put the Germany defence under stress in the Group A match.\n\n\"We have to stay focused to avoid crosses,\" he added.\n\nNagelsmann also said he was feeling emotional ahead of the match, describing how he comes from a tiny village with 700 inhabitants and more cows than people, and now was preparing for the opening game of Euro 2024 in Munich.\n\nGermany captain \u00cdlkay G\u00fcndogan said Nagelsmann gave the players clarity and conveyed a sense of calm, which had helped the team.\n\n\"The coach gives us confidence, a clear direction, he has discussed roles with us,\" Gundogan said. \"Everyone knows what is expected of them and can give their all on the pitch, and that helps us a great deal after the negative experiences of the last tournaments.\n\n\"No other game is like the first one, because then you can use that momentum and that euphoria for the next few games, and that is why the most important objective tomorrow is to win the game.\"", "source": {"uri": "espn.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "ESPN.com"}, "authors": [],

I admire Steve Clarke's optimism, but scoring goals could be a major issue in this tournament. Can't see anything other a win for the host nation.\n\nMuch is made of Scotland's lack of a top-level No9 but there are goals throughout the team and Clarke's boys can cause problems.\n\nGermany 3 Scotland 1\n\nI think we'll give the Germans a real fright in Munich and I have a sneaky feeling we might even score first.\n\nBut as noisy as the Tartan Army will be I also have a suspicion Julien Nagelsmann's side will have too much quality playing in front of their own crowd and will eventually come onto a game.\n\nI'm going to become a Positive Pete by predicting a share of the spoils on Friday night.\n\nThe Scotland boss is at his best when he's setting his side up against fancied opposition and you can bank on him coming up with a tactical masterplan to nullify the German threats.\n\nAs always, so much will depend on Scotland's top men like Callum McGregor, Andy Robertson, Scott McTominay, John McGinn, Billy Gilmour and Kieran Tierney performing at their peak and after getting a taste of Euro action three years ago, this is their time to shine on the international big stage.\n\nScoring goals has been the issue for Scotland for as long as we can remember but we qualified on the back of McGinn and McTominay finding their shooting boots so we'll need them to step up again now.\n\nClarke will work out a way to keep it tight so it'll all come down to whether we can take our chances when they come along.\n\nGermany 1 Scotland 1\n\nAvoiding defeat in Munich will be dreamland territory for Steve Clarke's Dark Blue heroes.\n\nAnd the closer we get to our biggest profile international for over 25 years the happier I'm feeling about our chances.\n\nI've spent most of this week in the Germany camp and there's genuine respect for Scotland. Our wins over Norway and Spain, they see them as a warning.\n\nI'm sticking my neck out for a wonderful start to the Euros.\n\nGermany 1 Scotland 1\n\nTournament openers are nervy affairs no matter how strong the hosts are and Friday night will be no exception.\n\nJulian Nagelsmann has picked up some decent results in friendlies but is yet to even face a competitive fixture and is already under pressure to deliver success.\n\nSteve Clarke has proved at both Kilmarnock and Scotland that his biggest strength as a boss is setting up an underdog to get a result against a so-called stronger opponent.\n\nI won't go as far as predicting a win, but I expect us to press high in the early stages and hopefully catch the Germans cold.\n\nIf we can nick an opener and then hold on for a draw it will set us up beautifully for the remaining two group games.\n\nI predict another home nation hiccup - with Scotland benefitting.\n\nScotland 1 Germany 1\n\nIT'S Germany's first competitive game since December 2022 and they'll have the eyes of an expectant nation watching.\n\nScotland go into the clash with hope but their players won't be fazed by facing the likes of Toni Kroos, Florian Wirtz, Jamal Musiala and co.\n\nEveryone will think the hosts will walk this but dating back to his days at Kilmarnock Steve Clarke has a track record of knowing how to set up his sides when all the odds are stacked against them.", "source": {"uri": "thescottishsun.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Scottish Sun"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steve_Clarke", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Steve Clarke"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Munich", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Munich"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Munich"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Germany"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scotland", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Scotland"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Scotland"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Germany", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Germany"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Germany"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_McGinn", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "John McGinn"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scott_McTominay", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Scott McTominay"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andrew_Robertson", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Andrew Robertson"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kieran_Tierney", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Kieran Tierney"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Billy_Gilmour", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Billy Gilmour"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tartan_Army", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Tartan Army"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Callum_McGregor", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Callum McGregor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jamal_Musiala", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Jamal Musiala"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Florian_Wirtz", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Florian Wirtz"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Julian_Nagelsmann", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Julian Nagelsmann"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kilmarnock_F.C.", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Kilmarnock F.C."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toni_Kroos", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Toni Kroos"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exhibition_game", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Exhibition game"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Norway", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Norway"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Norway"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spain", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Spain"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Spain"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Games", "label": "dmoz/Games", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Recreation", "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Recreation", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Multiplayer", "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Multiplayer", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Tile_Games", "label": "dmoz/Games/Tile Games", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Dice/Farkle", "label": "dmoz/Games/Dice/Farkle", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 85}], "image": "https://www.thescottishsun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/06/VP-GER-V-SCOT_OP.jpg?strip=all&quality=100&w=1920&h=1080&crop=1", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9648341", "eventUri": "eng-9648341", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.003921568627450966, "wgt": 156, "relevance": 1}

self belief in his players and hunger for success.\n\n\"Scotland isn't a team full of world stars, but that makes them dangerous, because they are very agile players who give everything, with classic Scottish mentality,\" he told a press conference on Thursday.\n\nWhile Germany do feel the pressure and tension ahead of the tournament's opening game, that was necessary, Nagelsmann added, and the team is fully fit and prepared.\n\n\"When I look in my players' eyes, I see a lot of belief and a lot of confidence, which is what I want,\" the former Bayern Munich coach said. \"We have the home advantage, we want to win.\n\n\"We can beat pressure, and we can beat Scotland as well.\"\n\nGermany have won four World Cups and three European Championship titles, but their stellar tournament reputation has been somewhat tarnished with a series of failures since a 2014 World Cup victory in Brazil.\n\nThey went out of the next two World Cups in the group stage, their worst showing in over 80 years, and exited the last European Championship in the round of 16.\n\n\"We will have more pressure on us than Scotland and they will want to capitalise on that,\" said Nagelsmann, who took over as Germany manager in October 2023.\n\nScotland can create chances and retain ball possession and will put the Germany defence under stress in the Group A match.\n\n\"We have to stay focused to avoid crosses,\" he added.\n\nNagelsmann also said he was feeling emotional ahead of the match, describing how he comes from a tiny village with 700 inhabitants and more cows than people, and now was preparing for the opening game of Euro 2024 in Munich.\n\nGermany captain \u00cdlkay G\u00fcndogan said Nagelsmann gave the players clarity and conveyed a sense of calm which had helped the team.\n\n\"The coach gives us confidence, a clear direction, he has discussed roles with us,\" Gundogan said. \"Everyone knows what is expected of them and can give their all on the pitch, and that helps us a great deal after the negative experiences of the last tournaments.\n\n\"No other game is like the first one, because then you can use that momentum and that euphoria for the next few games,

Germany have won the tournament three times, which is tied with Spain for the most titles ever. The Germans enter this year's monthlong tournament as a +550 shot to lift the Euro 2024 trophy, behind England (+300) and France (+340). On Friday, Germany will face a Scotland side that has never advanced past the group stage in the Euros.\n\nKickoff is set for 3 p.m. ET. The Germans are the -340 favorites (risk $340 to win $100) in the latest Germany vs. Scotland odds, with the Scots the +900 underdogs. A draw is priced at +500, and the over/under for total goals scored is 2.5. Before you lock in your Scotland vs. Germany picks or Euro 2024 predictions, you need to see what proven SportsLine soccer expert Martin Green has to say.\n\nAfter working in the sports betting industry for several years, Green became a professional sports writer and handicapper and has covered the game worldwide.

Germany have not lost against Scotland since 1999. That was Germany's lone loss in the series over the last 13 meetings.\n\nIn addition, the Germans have a proven winner in Toni Kroos. The 34-year-old midfielder has won six Champions League titles with Real Madrid and has 70 assists over the last 10 La Liga seasons. He is set to retire from professional soccer after Euro 2024. Kai Havertz is also coming off a sensational season with Arsenal. Havertz recorded 13 goals and seven assists for the Gunners in the Premier League this season. See which team to pick here.\n\nWhy you should back Scotland\n\nThe Tartan Army have a Premier League-caliber midfielder in Scott McTominay. The 27-year-old playmaker for Manchester United scored 10 goals across all competitions this season, including a career-high seven in league play. He also scored seven goals for Scotland in qualifying for Euro 2024.\n\nMcTominay and the Scots will face a Germany side that faltered badly in its last major competition. In the 2022 World Cup, the Germans lost to Japan in the group stage opener and failed to advance to the knockout stage. Ten months after the World Cup, manager Hansi Flick was sacked and replaced by Julian Nagelsmann. See which team to pick here.\n\nHow to make Germany vs. Scotland picks\n\nGreen has broken down the Euro 2024 match from every possible angle.

''We don't have to talk about past tournaments, we all know what happened there.\n\n''It's been up and down for us all the way here and that's why we have to be humble. The first match is very important and then we'll see what happens during the rest of the tournament.''\n\nA good first match and group stage would set off a new wave of excitement in Germany, even though scenes similar to when it brilliantly hosted the 2006 World Cup (and reached the semifinals) are hard to imagine in a changed political landscape.\n\nWhile the Scots are out in droves in Munich, proudly wearing their team jerseys (many combined with kilts), there is hardly a sighting of a Germany shirt or flag. Political extremists are flourishing, anxiety pervades the country, and the national team has under-performed. It is understandable the home fans are going about their daily life in contrast to the partying visitors.\n\nWhile the Germans are bemused by their raucous Scottish counterparts, there should still be plenty of more colors on matchday.\n\n''First and foremost, there's a lot of anticipation because it's a huge event,'' Germany coach Julian Nagelsmann said. ''It's probably not just Europe, but the whole world that will be watching how the Euros will go ... we're really looking forward to it.''\n\nGermany went out at the group stage of both previous World Cups and was eliminated by England in the round of 16 at Euro 2021. But defeat to Scotland would be a shock, even though the Scots have improved a lot in recent years.\n\n''It's going to be an amazing experience ... being part of that kind of opening ceremony,'' Scotland forward Ryan Christie said when asked about playing the opening match.\n\n''Germany, an amazing team. All the international teams go through peaks and drops in form. But when these big tournaments come up, the big teams normally show up most of the time. So it will be a really tough game.''\n\nHungary and Switzerland are also in Group A.\n\nHaving failed to reach the Euros from 2000-16, Scotland has qualified for back-to-back tournaments and the next aim is to reach the knockout stage for the first time.\n\n''That's the dream,'' Christie said. ''To everyone around Scotland, it would mean the world, a massive kind of footballing country. If we come out of the group stages, that's the furthest Scotland will have ever been in a major tournament.\n\n''So, you know, it puts us down in history as the most successful Scottish team ever, and that's the kind of motivation right there. We've got a huge belief in ourselves, with this squad of players, that we can really do a lot of damage to other teams and hopefully do well when we go to these big tournaments.''\n\nScotland showed during the qualifying campaign it can surprise, in beating Spain and Norway.\n\nHowever, Scotland has won only one of its last 13 matches against Germany and that was more than 25 years ago, 1-0 in a friendly in April 1999.\n\nPlus, Germany has another, rather more unusual motivation to win the trophy on its own turf.\n\nDeniz Undav has said he will shave the head of fellow Germany forward Thomas M\u00fcller if the team becomes European champion.\n\n''Thomas M\u00fcller bald? Then we have to do everything we can to make this happen. I don't think he will look so beautiful with a shaved head,'' defender R\u00fcdiger said with a laugh.", "source": {"uri": "startribune.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Star Tribune"}, "authors":

While their performances at Euro 2020 left a lot to be desired, there will be renewed optimism among Steve Clarke's side this time around.\n\nWith some Premier League stars in strong form and a squad capable of playing beyond the sum of its parts, Scotland will be aiming to at least make it to the knockout stages of the tournament this summer.\n\nHere's 90min's guide to Euro 2024 for Scotland.\n\nClarke has named his final 26-man Euro 2024 following pre-tournament friendlies against Gibraltar and Finland, with several players dropping out of the provisional squad with injury. Both Lyndon Dykes and young Ben Doak had to withdraw due to fitness concerns, being replaced by Lewis Morgan and Tommy Conway.\n\nInjuries have been a theme for Scotland in the build-up to the tournament, with 12-cap Lewis Ferguson, who was a key part of a Bologna side that secured Champions League football last season, suffering an anterior cruciate ligament injury. Elsewhere, Brentford and Everton right-backs Aaron Hickey and Nathan Patterson have also failed to make the plane due to injuries.\n\nHowever, despite being doubtful for the tournament because of fitness concerns, the likes of Stuart Armstrong and Grant Hanley have both made it to Germany, as has Rangers midfielder Ryan Jack despite an injury-hit campaign.\n\n41-year-old Craig Gordon was a surprise inclusion in the initial provisional squad but has been dropped with no need for four goalkeepers at the tournament. Rangers defender John Souttar was also included but has since been cut by Clarke.\n\nEmploying a 3-4-2-1 or 5-4-1 shape with width being offered by wing-backs, Scotland have flexibility in their setup. They are able to drop deep and soak up pressure with a flat back five, but also capable of committing more bodies forward with the security of three central defenders.\n\nThis system has mainly been utilised to accommodate a lack of natural wingers within Scotland's ranks, with James Forrest and Lewis Morgan the only senior options on the flanks.\n\nOne of Scotland's strongest areas is the centre of the pitch, especially with the likes of John McGinn, Scott McTominay, Callum McGregor and Billy Gilmour available. In McGinn and McTominay they have versatile players capable of pushing further forward, or even drifting wide in the former's case.\n\nDefence is where Scotland come up short, despite boasting Liverpool's Andy Robertson at left-back. In particular, Clarke's centre-back options are not incredibly strong, with the likes of Jack Hendry and Scott McKenna among their better players.\n\nWhile Scotland avoided some of the toughest opponents available to them, they still face some impressive sides in Group A. That includes hosts Germany, with a clash against Julian Naglesmann's side coming in the opening game of the tournament on 14 June.\n\nThe Tartan Army then face a meeting with Euro 2020 quarter-finalists Switzerland in their second match, with Dominik Szoboszlai's Hungary the final nation standing in Scotland's way of qualifying for the knockout rounds.\n\nOf course, Scotland could qualify by finishing third in Group A, but a top two finish will guarantee progression.\n\nShould Scotland defy expectation and beat group favourites Germany to top spot, they would face the second-placed side in Group C. That means they could take on England, although it's more likely they would clash with Serbia, Slovenia or Denmark.\n\nFinishing the group as runners-up would mean a meeting with the side that finished second in Group B. Already touted as the 'group of death', Spain, Croatia, Italy or surprise qualifiers Albania would be their opponents.\n\nA third-placed finish would see them face off against the winners of Group B, Group E or Group F.\n\nScotland's biggest threats generally come in the middle or final third of the pitch, but they do have captain Andy Robertson to rely on in defence. Having said that, the Liverpool star, whose form picked up at the end of the season after several injuries, will likely play high up the pitch as a wing-back.\n\nJohn McGinn's impressive performances helped Aston Villa secure Champions League football and he will likely be joined by either Callum McGregor or Billy Gilmour in midfield, both of whom can act as deep-lying playmakers.\n\nScotland do have some decent centre-forward options, but the prolific Scott McTominay is the nation's biggest goal threat. The midfielder, who can play off a central striker, scored seven goals in qualification, including braces against Spain and Cyprus.\n\nClarke hasn't selected many youngsters for his squad, with a number of those who could have made the cut sidelined through injuries. That now includes Liverpool winger Ben Doak, who was called up despite having never earned a senior cap.\n\nTommy Conway, who was brought in to replace Dykes, could be handed some minutes at the tournament, with the 21-year-old forward having impressed with 12 goals for Bristol City last term.\n\nExpectations are unlikely to be too high for Scotland at Euro 2024 but Clarke's men could perhaps upset the odds in Group A. While Germany will likely prove too strong, they could well pick up results against Hungary and Switzerland.\n\nTheir form in qualifying suggests that finishing in the top two is a distinct possibility, even if they have only won one of their last nine matches - a 2-0 victory over Gibraltar. Individual quality and a determined spirit may help them through to the knockout stages.\n\nBeyond that it's difficult to predict what might happen, with progression depending heavily on their opponents in the subsequent rounds. However, Scotland have to focus on navigating a challenging but fallible group first.", "source": {"uri": "90min.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "90min.com"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

Clarke will likely choose between Ryan Porteous, Jack Hendry and Grant Hanley for his two partners and it could well be the former two who get the nod. Captain Andrew Robertson will be left wing-back and with right wing-backs Nathan Patterson and Aaron Hickey left behind through injury, Anthony Ralston could edge out Ross McCrorie on the other side of the pitch, although attacking opportunities could be limited.\n\nMidfield pints into a quart pot\n\nClarke's biggest dilemma is probably in midfield, the strongest part of his squad. John McGinn, Scott McTominay and Callum McGregor are all but certain to start. If the Scotland boss plays a box midfield, who joins them? Billy Gilmour is more defensively-minded and could partner McGregor in front of the defence leaving McTominay and McGinn further forward. However, Clarke could tweak his formation to allow Ryan Christie to be chief support to the lone striker, likely to be Che Adams. Kenny McLean and Stuart Armstrong can also be hopeful of contributing at some stage of the game.\n\nGroup prospects\n\nScotland have never qualified out of a group at a major finals. Aside from taking on the host country, Clarke's side face Switzerland and Hungary and neither of them come with the promise of three points. One win could be enough to take Scotland into the knockout stages, while four points would surely guarantee that landmark feat. Goal difference could come into consideration so if the Scots are to fail to beat Germany then the narrowest of defeats is preferred.\n\nHead-to-head record\n\nScotland have never beaten Germany in a competitive game. In 17 meetings the Scots have won four and drawn five. Scotland first met Germany in 1929 when they drew 1-1 in a friendly in Berlin. The last Scotland victory over Germany was a 1-0 friendly win in 1999, with Don Hutchison scoring the winner. Germany have won the last three meetings, the last being a 3-2 win in a European Championship qualifier at Hampden Park in 2015.\n\nTartan Army on its travels\n\nScotland fans will travel abroad to a major competition for the first time since the 1998 World Cup in France. Tens of thousands of Tartan Army are flooding into Germany and most of them do not have tickets for the games. Clarke and his squad are aware of the feel-good factor which is surrounding both this fixture and the tournament and, while there is realism about the task against the Germans, there is pressure to put in a positive performance on Friday night.", "source": {"uri": "irishnews.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Irish News"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

As four-time World Cup winners and three time European Championship champions, they are one of the most successful teams in the history of international football.\n\nTheir showings at finals in recent years, however, have been desperately disappointing. They failed to progress out of the group stages at Russia 2018 and Qatar 2022 and only made it as far as the last 16 at Euro 2022. Can they do any better this time out?\n\nJulian Nagelsmann has a wealth of talent at his disposal in defence, midfield and attack and the wins which his charges recorded over France away and the Netherlands at home back in March augured well for Euro 2024. There are, however, concerns in the Fatherland.\n\nREAD MORE: Scotland midfielder Billy Gilmour to take kid gloves off at Euro 2024\n\nFabian Scheler, a sports journalist with ZEIT Online, is optimistic that Germany will get off to a winning start against Scotland in their opening Group A match in the Allianz Arena this evening. But he is not entirely convinced that Ilkay Gundogan will be lifting the Henri Delaunay trophy after the final in the Olympiastadion in Berlin\n\n\"Germany should still beat Scotland because they are better positioned in every area. Having said that, that's what people thought when we played Mexico in our opening game at Russia 2018 and Japan in our opening game at Qatar 2022 and it turned out differently.\n\n\"So maybe the opening game is the best chance for the Scots to get something. The pressure on Germany will be immense. On paper, the team can go very far. But I have refrained from making predictions for a long time. We journalists have been punished for that on a few occasions in recent years.\"\n\nSo what are the areas which are causing German fans sleepless nights? Incredibly, it is the recent form of two of their most celebrated players, Bayern Munich goalkeeper Manuel Neuer and defender Joshua Kimmich.\n\nREAD MORE: Celtic player branded 'ultimate professional' ahead of Toni Kroos duel\n\n\"Everyone is currently discussing Manuel Neuer,\" said Scheler. \"He has almost always made mistakes lately, but Nagelsmann has clearly set his mind on him. That could lead to a few exciting moments at the back.\n\n\"The two full-backs are the weak points in the Germany team in my opinion. Kimmich has been downgraded from his favourite position in the central midfield and you can see that he has problems there whenever he plays. He's not 100 per cent happy with it.\n\n\"(Max) Mittelst\u00e4dt and (David) Raum (the centre back pairing) are solid, but nothing more. It won't be a huge issue in the group stage. But if we are talking about Germany winning the title then I think it will.\"\n\n\"The centre-forward question is also not completely clear because (Kai) Havertz and (Niclas) F\u00fcllkrug are simply such different strikers. It is a question of the system, who to field, not a question of personnel.\"\n\nSo can Germany end their disappointing run at major tournaments and win Euro 2024 in front of their own fans? Or are they set to suffer another crushing disappointment? \"Anything is possible,\" said Scheler. \"It could be a round of 16 exit or a European Championship victory. Football can be so beautiful!\"\n\nAnd how do the Germans think that Scotland will acquit themselves in the coming 10 days? Scheler suspects that Clarke's men can progress beyond the group stages for the first time in their history. But he thinks they have to develop more of a ruthless streak in the final third.\n\nREAD MORE: Scotland to go all out for victory against Germany, says Billy Gilmour\n\n\"From everything I've read about and seen of Scotland, they are very organized,\" he said. \"The midfield is the best part - McGinn, McTominay, Robertson and Gilmour are all names familiar to German fans from the Premier League.\n\n\"We shouldn't underestimate the whole team because their qualification was so successful and their support will be massive. And we are really looking forward to the Tartan Army being the 25th participant in this tournament.\n\n\"Julian Nagelsmann said before the European Championship that he had seen the 4-0 defeat against the Netherlands and he thought it should have been a 3-0 win for Scotland. I believe the Scots have a good chance of finally reaching the round of 16 if they can find enough people to score goals.\"", "source": {"uri": "heraldscotland.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The

Come what may across the matches with Germany, Switzerland, Hungary and hopefully more in the coming days, this time skipper Andy Robertson intends boarding the plane home knowing the team has gone out on its shield.\n\nSkipper Robertson says Scots are ready to compete with Germans and beyond\n\nScotland captain Robertson is looking confident ahead of the curtain raiser\n\nRobertson and boss Clarke emerge from the tunnel at the Allianz Arena\n\n'Qualifying for the first Euros was massive for us and doing two in a row was incredible,' he said.\n\n'But now we want to actually compete. The last time, we did fairly well in the England game, but in the other two we let ourselves down a bit.\n\n'We could have done better. We don't want to have any regrets this time.\n\n'We have to move on from that. We believe we can be the team that makes history.\n\n'We'll focus on tomorrow night first and it doesn't come much tougher. But we're excited by the challenge and what's ahead.\n\n'We've done the hard bit by qualifying. Now let's see what else we can do.'\n\nThroughout a journey which started in the foothills of the game at Queen's Park, Robertson has climbed to places where the view is clear and the air is thin.\n\nThe Glaswegian won a Champions League with Liverpool and played in two other finals.\n\nHe was part of the first team at Anfield in two decades to win the title, lifted the FA Cup and the League Cup twice.\n\nIn the colours of his country, he helped end that long wait to reach a major finals on a famous night in Belgrade.\n\nNow aged 30, he could have been forgiven for believing that nothing he could possibly experience in football could eclipse what he's already seen. And then came the Euro 2024 draw in Hamburg in December.\n\nWhile Scotland's adventure in Germany this summer was going to be seismic whatever lay in store, the scale of tonight's match in Munich is hard to quantify.\n\nEven from their quiet training camp in Bavaria, the sense that this is the biggest occasion Scotland have been involved in since facing Brazil in the opening game for the World Cup in France '98 has been impossible to escape.\n\n'We've seen all the videos of the fans landing, of them in the squares across the city,' Robertson added.\n\n'We all know so many people who are out here - it feels like most of the country's come over.\n\n'The Tartan Army have been great with us from day one. When the gaffer came in there was a conscious decision to try and get them onside, because support at home games had nose-dived, even if the ones who go abroad with us have always been incredible.\n\n'Listen, we know they can't all get into the stadium tomorrow night - we wish they could - but wherever they are, either here or at home, we want to make them proud.\n\n'If we perform the way we know we can, they'll hopefully have a great ten or 12 days.'\n\nRobertson has good memories of the vast arena Scotland will walk out into after a lavish opening ceremony.\n\nFive years ago, Liverpool's hopes of winning a sixth European Cup were fading after a goalless draw with Bayern Munich at Anfield.\n\nRobertson admits Scots let themselves down at last Euros and are ready to atone\n\nClarke shares a joke with his players during the countdown to Germany match\n\nOn a famous night for Jurgen Klopp's side, they stunned the local favourites to start a run that would end with a victory in the final over Tottenham. What Robertson wouldn't give for a similar outcome tonight.\n\n'It was a massive win for Liverpool,' he recalled.\n\n'A lot of people had written us off after we draw 0-0 at Anfield, but we went in front of all those Bayern supporters and beat them 3-1.\n\n'It was incredible to be part of and it's even more special that it took us on the journey to win the Champions League. It was such an important game.\n\n'Jurgen Klopp texted me last week when I broke the record for captaining Scotland, which he didn't have to do and which was good of him. He just said congratulations.\n\n'I know he'll be here, and I know who he'll be supporting! I hope he enjoys his night, but not too much...'\n\nExpectation within Germany is not quite at the level you would associate with a host nation with such a history.\n\nNo one within the Scotland camp is buying any notion that Julian Nagelsmann's side will present anything other than the most arduous of challenges, though.\n\n'There's no secret here. Germany will dominate the ball against us,' Robertson predicted.\n\n'They have the best midfielder in the world in Toni Kroos and plenty others who are great on the ball.\n\n'What we have to do is capitalise when we have the ball. Then we have to make it difficult for them, close the spaces.\n\nRobertson has good memories of Munich after winning there with Liverpool five years ago\n\nJohn McGinn puts his best foot forward as Scots continue training sessions\n\n'The key to getting a result here will be whose game-plan work better, who shows up.\n\n'There's a lot of pressure on Germany to win the tournament and they don't want anyone or anything to get in their way. But that's our job.'\n\nOf the three games Scotland face in the next 10 days, this is - without question - the most arduous assignment.\n\nTo go where no Scotland team has gone before, though, nothing can be considered a free hit.\n\n'We all know how quickly a tournament can go by you, so we have to make the most of the opportunity we have here,' said Robertson.\n\n'As a group, it doesn't get much more difficult, but at the same time there's no outside pressure or expectation on us. All we can do is play to our maximum and see how we go. It's time to show what we can do.'", "source": {"uri": "dailymail.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "Daily Mail Online"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

Robertson", "body": "MUNICH, Germany : Scotland go into their opening Euro 2024 match against Germany on Friday with no pressure or expectations and will fight for a result to help push them towards the knockout rounds, captain Andy Robertson said on Thursday.\n\nLiverpool defender Robertson acknowledged the team put in tepid performances during the group stage at the last European Championship but said players will not make the same mistake again.\n\nWith Germany likely to dominate possession, Robertson said the Scots needed to frustrate their opponents as much as possible and make the most of situations when they have the ball.\n\n\"If we can do that, hopefully, that is the key to getting a result,\" Robertson told a news conference. \"We believe we can do it and it is up to us to show it.\"\n\nThe Scots returned to the big stage of international football at the last Euros, having not appeared at a major tournament since the 1998 World Cup in France.\n\nThey have never made it out of the group stage in 11 major tournaments, something Robertson said was the main goal at Euro 2024.\n\n\"We don't want to have any regrets this time,\" said Robertson, who called himself good to go after an injury scare in training this week. \"We believe we are a team that can create history.\"\n\nTens of thousands of supporters who have flooded into Munich will roar on a team who also face Switzerland and Hungary in Group A.\n\nScotland manager Steve Clarke played down the fact his side will face the three-times European champions in the opening match.\n\n\"The enormity of the opening game is a side show,\" he said. \"Hopefully, on the night we can show the host nation we are a good side.\"\n\nFor Scotland to get a result against Germany they will need to recreate the kind of performances that brought five consecutive victories at the start of their qualification campaign, including a 2-0 win over Spain.\n\nClarke expects German coach Julian Nagelsmann to be well prepared.\n\n\"When we had the first draw, we expected it to be a tough game and nothing has changed my mind,\" he said.", "source": {"uri": "channelnewsasia.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "CNA"},

But Clarke masterminded wins over Spain at home and Norway away during qualifying and believes that anything is possible if his charges perform at their best and do no let the enormity of the occasion affect them.\n\n\"It's quite a busy press conference so it must be a big game!\" he said with a smile as he entered the media room at the Allianz Arena. \"Obviously it's a big game, but for us it's the opening game of a four team section so we'll have three matches.\n\n\"We know what we have to do to qualify out of the section and that's the only thing we're focussed on. The enormity of the opening game or whatever? That's a little bit of a sideshow and hopefully we don't get too involved in that.\"\n\nClarke added: \"Germany are a good team. I think a lot of people have been trying to talk them down a little bit lately. When Julian first went in, he probably found it similar to how I found it when I became Scotland head coach.\n\n\"He had to try and find out his best team and he's managed to do that. When the draw was first made I felt this would be a really tough game and nothing has made me change my mind.\n\n\"But one of the mantras I've always had is: 'Respect everyone and fear no-one!' So, while we have a lot of respect for the host nation, hopefully on the night we can cause them problems. We've settled in well, trained well and we're looking forward to the match.\n\n\"They have to deal with the pressure themselves. That's what they have to do. But most of them have played in big matches before. I'm sure they'll all handle the occasion quite well.\"\n\nREAD MORE: The German view on Germany's chances of success at Euro 2024\n\nAsked if he thought Scotland could draw with or defeat Germany, he said: \"Absolutely. That's why we're here. We feel as though we can get a good result every time we step onto the pitch. Otherwise, what's the point in going out there. We feel we're ready and hopefully you'll see that pan Friday night.\"\n\nIt is believed that over 200,000 Scots have travelled to Germany this week to cheer on Robertson and his team mates in their matches against the home favourites, Switzerland and Hungary. Clarke is eager for his side to give their fans something to celebrate.\n\n(Image: PA) \"We know the supporters are here in their numbers to support us,\" he said. \"We know they are going to be right behind us in every minute of every game. That's really important for us.\n\n\"We've had a little taste of that in Garmisch-Partenkirchen where we are based. It made the walk to training more enjoyable. I know there are many more here in Germany who we haven't seen and I hope they enjoy themselves.\"\n\nREAD MORE: Celtic player branded 'ultimate professional' ahead of Toni Kroos duel\n\nClarke continued: \"I can enjoy it. I think now that with the experience I've picked up along the way, I can do that. I have been lucky enough to have been involved in big matches throughout my career, for example Champions League finals.\n\n\"I was lucky enough to be involved in big games like that. I have also been a manager at the European Championships as well.

The 17th edition of the UEFA European Championship is set to begin on Friday, June 13th, and build towards the finals in Berlin on July 14th.\n\nHosts Germany kick things off on Friday in Munich against a Scotland side that claimed their place at the Euros early in qualifying, but are lacking for results as of late.\n\nOdds in Germany vs Scotland heavily favor Die Nationalmannschaft, a team who is currently getting +550 to win UEFA Euro 2024, while their opponents in The Tartan Army are a longshot +10000 to win the tournament.\n\nGermany are big favorites at -340 to win the tournament opener, with Scotland set as massive +900 underdogs to score an upset. A potential draw is listed at +500.\n\nThe Total Goals line for the match is set at O/U 2.5. In the qualifiers and friendlies played by Germany and Scotland prior to Friday's match, the two teams combined for 10 out of 16 matches that went over 2.5 goals.\n\n*Odds as of June 13th at DraftKings Sportsbook. Use the best sportsbook promotions before betting on the Euro 2024 tournament.\n\nPerhaps the greatest benefit of hosting a major soccer tournament is that the host countries will always automatically qualify!\n\nThat isn't to say that the German men's national team would not have qualified for Euro 2024 under their own merit. Rather, it's incumbent on the host nation to put together a meaningful schedule of games that will shape the team for the road ahead. Has manager Julian Nagelsmann sufficiently challenged his players prior to the tournament? Let's break down their recent results.\n\nDating back to October 2023, Germany owns a record of 4 wins, 2 draws, and 2 losses over their last 8 matches. That's a solid string of games regardless of who's produced them, but what's important to note is when each result took place. The more recent matches should have a strong correlation to how the current team will perform.\n\nIn other words? Last November's losses in Austria and at home to Turkey, as well as the draw against Mexico in Philadelphia, carry less significance than the wins over 2nd-ranked France and 6th-ranked Netherlands roughly two and a half months ago.\n\nYes, these aren't the World Cup winners from a decade ago, but Germany's current 16th-place FIFA ranking belies the improvements of the national team. Under Nagelsmann, that involves a patient advancement with the ball and a tactical high press without it. The press can be beat, but only by teams with sharp precision.\n\nScotland stands on the laurels of being one of the earliest qualifiers, despite finishing as runners-up to Spain in Group A.\n\nThat's what happens when you open the campaign with five consecutive victories. You can't blame a team for coasting once qualification was secured, but the path to Euro 2024 for The Tartan Army has not exactly been the smoothest road to traverse.\n\nIn their last eight matches, Scotland hold a record of 1 win, 3 draws and 4 losses. Take away the formalities against Georgia and Norway since Scotland was already in the Euros, and that record drops to 1-1-4. That includes multi-goal losses to Spain, France, and the Netherlands, as well as a loss at home to Northern Ireland.\n\nYes, there's a win in the mix, but it was against an 832nd-ranked Gibraltar on neutral ground. For the sake of confidence, ideally, that score would have been juiced a little bit.\n\nDon't get me wrong, Scotland knows how to dig in their heels and earn results: that 5-0 record to open qualifying is not an aberration. Nor was their qualifying for the 2020 Euros if you go back even further.\n\nBut if you're going off recent form alone, particularly against opponents on a level similar to Germany, this opening match will be an extremely difficult test.\n\nGiven that Germany will likely dominate possession by pressing the Scottish five-man defensive block, it stands to reason that Die Nationalmannschaft garner larger betting lines on offense.\n\nThat said, if Germany's Total Corners prop continues to be plus-money at 6.5, hammer it. Look to their last two matches for inspiration: Germany earned 11 corners against Ukraine and 13 against Greece, a team with a defense-first mentality similar to that of Scotland. There may also be money in Germany's Total Shots prop, but it's likely the total will stay under 17.5.\n\nFor Scotland, stay with the unders. A low possession percentage will limit their numbers on offense, particularly if they score first; if that happens, the backline may grow from five to ten players. Until that happens, however, +2.5 Shots on Target feels like a safe bet, while you can also take a risk on -2.5 Corners.\n\n*Team Props as of June 12th at Bet365 Sportsbook.\n\nGiven how the German strikers will likely be pressing hard, I wouldn't blame anyone for taking a 3-leg flyer on Kai Havertz: Anytime Scorer (+145), 2+ Fouls (-165), and To Be Booked (+550).\n\nHowever, be warned on the To Be Booked prop for any German player: the team has collected just seven cards in eight matches under Nagelsmann (eight, if you count the card Nagelsmann himself earned from the bench against France). Instead, I'd look at Havertz for Anytime Scorer & 2+ Fouls, plus an Anytime Assist from Jamal Musiala (+300).\n\nIf you're looking for an Anytime Scorer prop for Scotland, I'd lean into the striker who gets the start, whether it's Che Adams (+500) or Lawrence Shankland (+500).\n\nAndrew Robertson will be looked to for delivering looping crosses to his strikers, but if you want a second leg for a Scottish player prop I'd look at John McGinn. The Scottish captain will have a lot of running to do both in support of his striker and leading the front defensively. That will likely result in McGinn picking up at least 2 fouls (-125) and being booked (+270).\n\n*Player Props as of June 12th at FanDuel Sportsbook.\n\nWhen picking a potential full-time result, it's always helpful to find common opponents to make an informed decision. Thankfully, for Germany and Scotland, we get have that info at our disposal, and the data for each team couldn't be more dissimilar.\n\nBoth sides have faced off against France and the Netherlands within the last year, with the Germans winning their matches 2-0 and 2-1, while the Scots dropped both, losing 1-4 and 0-4. Mash those stats together and I think it's fair to say Germany will likely win comfortably in the tournament opener.\n\nBut \"How comfortably?\" is the real question to ask. Despite their FIFA ranking going unchanged since last October, Germany has been resurgent under Nagelsmann, while Scotland has had a tough go of getting quality results in pre-tournament matches.\n\nScotland will put in work on both sides of the ball and The Tartan Army will find their chances on offense, likely on the counter, but I fear those chances will likely come few and far between.", "source": {"uri": "sportsbettingdime.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Sports Betting Dime"}, "authors": [{"uri": "ian_jones@sportsbettingdime.com", "name": "Ian Jones", "type": "author",

That's why the most important objective is to win the game.\"\n\nWhile some of the Germans may be bemused by their raucous Scottish counterparts, there's plenty of pressure on the home nation which is the clear favourite in the opener.\n\n24 teams from across Europe will play in a total of 51 matches before the final in Berlin on July 14.", "source": {"uri": "euronews.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Euronews English"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scotland", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Scotland"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Scotland"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Germany", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Germany"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Germany"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Norway", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Norway"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Norway"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spain", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Spain"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Spain"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steve_Clarke", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Steve Clarke"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Allianz_Arena", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Allianz Arena"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UEFA_European_Championship", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "UEFA European Championship"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exhibition_game", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Exhibition game"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single-elimination_tournament", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Single-elimination tournament"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Munich", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Munich"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Munich"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Germany"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andrew_Robertson", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Andrew Robertson"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tartan_Army", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Tartan Army"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FIFA_World_Cup", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "FIFA World Cup"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tournament", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Tournament"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/\u0130lkay_G\u00fcndo\u011fan", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "\u0130lkay G\u00fcndo\u011fan"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Europe", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Europe"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_wave_music", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "New wave music"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euro", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Euro"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/England", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "England"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "England"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Berlin", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Berlin"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Berlin"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Germany"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Recreation", "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Recreation", "wgt": 18}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Multiplayer", "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Multiplayer", "wgt": 18}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Online/Play-By-E-Mail", "label": "dmoz/Games/Online/Play-By-E-Mail", "wgt": 17}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Play_Groups", "label": "dmoz/Games/Play Groups", "wgt": 18}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Play_Groups/Europe", "label": "dmoz/Games/Play Groups/Europe", "wgt": 18}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 94}], "image": "https://static.euronews.com/articles/stories/08/50/20/84/1200x675_cmsv2_3d3ad4d2-40b4-5813-b135-c552d687e6e6-8502084.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9648341", "eventUri": "eng-9648341", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-07-14", "textStart": 3459, "textEnd": 3466}, {"amb": false, "date": "1999-04-", "textStart": 225, "textEnd": 235, "freq": 2}], "sentiment": 0.2549019607843137, "wgt": 148, "relevance": 1}

As in, not a single one. On Sunday evening, for a brief time only, McGinn and Scotland had their fun. They have not arrived in Germany as a circus act. The sole focus is on competing at the European Championship. Nobody is here to have their tummy tickled.\n\nIf an opening meeting with the hosts sounds galling to the Tartan Army, they must consider the alternatives. From 1996 until 2021, Scotland did not feature in the Euros. From 1998 until the same point, the Scots did not play in any major tournament. Anxiety over a clash with a seemingly reinvigorated Germany team is clearly preferable to watching from afar.\n\nScotland carry the burden of historic baggage. That is wholly unfair, of course; failure to emerge from a tournament group section in 1958, 1974 or 1992 - there are other examples, over half a dozen of them - has nothing whatever to do with Steve Clarke's class of 2024. Nonetheless, until a Scotland team can sample knockout football in a domain such as this, the tag of glorious failures will stick.\n\nThis is actually inaccurate in the specific context of this team. Typical Scotland would not have seen off Serbia on penalties to qualify for the last Euros. Typical Scotland would not have played the greatest get-out-of-jail card of all time, courtesy of 87th- and 89th-minute goals to stun Norway in Oslo last June.\n\nFor much of that game, the visitors were a clear second best. Typical Scotland would not have rattled in three goals in the opening half hour in Larnaca three months later, when qualification was within view. New Scotland, new danger. Clarke is perfectly within his rights to rail against tired perceptions.\n\nThe manager has, however, delivered one flawed assessment. Clarke has articulated that the absolute worst outcome his side can deliver in Germany is the same as all of those who came before: a group stage exit. There were only eight teams at Euro 92. Four years later, 16 competed. The subsequent expansion of the competition has diminished its competitive value but also made it statistically easier than ever to make the knockout rounds. Even Wales and Northern Ireland have done it.\n\nClarke will never admit it, but Scotland can treat the Germany fixture as a free hit. All the pressure is on the Germans; with the trouble being, they tend to cope with that rather well. Far more significant, surely, is whether three points can be claimed from Switzerland on Wednesday. Scotland must respect Switzerland - who are tournament experts in comparison - but have no cause to fear them. The same applies to Hungary, whom Scotland face in what should be a crucial final group fixture in Stuttgart next Sunday.\n\nClarke's buildup was disrupted by injuries but the strong core of his team - including Kieran Tierney, Andy Robertson, Callum McGregor, Billy Gilmour, McGinn and Scott McTominay - remains untouched. If that sextet perform, it would be a shock to see Scotland eliminated after three games.\n\nGilmour, Clarke's baby-faced assassin, could well be outplayed by Toni Kroos but there is no prospect of the 23-year-old being intimated by the former Real Madrid star.\n\nConfidence must not be absolute. The cocky Scottish football fan provides an unedifying spectacle. Against Finland in Glasgow last Friday, Scotland gave up far too many chances. This was not an isolated case. Clarke was also frustrated about the lack of conviction shown in front of goal against a hapless Gibraltar days earlier.\n\nEven the stately Scottish midfield will not be a saviour should this team offer generosity at both ends of the pitch. A red flag is that Tierney, a left-back, is Scotland's finest centre-half. Scotland's regular trouble against a low block must have been noted in the camps of Switzerland and Hungary.\n\nClarke is savvy enough to know his squad's limitations. He will have learned lessons from 2021, when the physical rigours of the Euros - namely, a fighting draw at Wembley - seemed to catch Scotland out. Yet the 60-year-old's finest achievement to date has been securing buy-in from a supporter base that had been become beleaguered or uninterested by virtue of their team's years in the wilderness.\n\nThey have travelled to Germany en masse because, at last, there are traces of justifiable expectation alongside hope.", "source": {"uri": "theguardian.com", "dataType": "news", "title":

Scotland narrowly lost the game and exited France 98 at the first stage.\n\n\"I was brought up with Scotland qualifying regularly,\" he said of the sides that took part in five consecutive World Cups from 1974, and two European championships, featuring names such as Kenny Dalglish, Archie Gemmill and Ally McCoist. \"Whereas this generation it's like, 'oh my God, Scotland's qualified'.\"\n\nScotland's men also took part in the last European championship in 2021, but their three games were played in the UK and crowds were limited due to the Covid pandemic. Scotland's women have participated in two major tournaments in recent years, and are well-placed to qualify for next year's women's European championship.\n\nThe prolonged absence of the men, which Lambert attributed to a \"lull\" in the emergence of enough quality players, was a source of anguish and frustration for Scottish football and its passionate fan base known as the Tartan Army.\n\nAs if to make up for lost time, an estimated 200,000 Scotland supporters will travel to Germany this month, according to the British embassy in Munich, only a fraction of them with tickets.\n\n\"It's absolutely massive,\" said Alan Duncan, 53, chair of Tartan Army's north of Scotland branch. \"There's a whole generation of younger guys who have never been to a major championship.\"\n\nDuncan said Scotland had been \"gripped\" by excitement about Euro 2024, the quest for match tickets and travel plans to Germany, adding that this had provided a much-needed distraction for those grappling with worries such as the cost of living crisis.\n\n\"I've had people come up to me and say, 'I'll see you in Germany', and I say: 'you don't even follow football'.\"\n\nCraig Ferguson, a 20-year-old from Paisley, is one of those travelling to the tournament, having quit his job as a waiter to walk to Munich for the opening game, to raise money for Brothers in Arms, a mental health charity.\n\n\"It started as a silly joke\u2009.\u2009.\u2009.\u2009fast forward six months and here I am,\" he said from the German city of Karlsruhe, having already traversed southern Scotland, northern England, the Netherlands, Belgium and Luxembourg.\n\n\"For a whole generation of people my age, and slightly older, this is the first time we can just fully embrace a European tournament,\" he explained. \"After hearing all the stories, we're finally able to create stories of our own.\"\n\nThe return of the Scotland men's national team to the big time was made possible by five consecutive victories during qualification, including memorable wins over Norway and Spain.\n\nBut the team led by manager Steve Clarke has stuttered of late, labouring to victory over Gibraltar and drawing with Finland in recent warm-ups.\n\nYet Lambert, who managed Norwich City and Aston Villa in the English Premier League, insisted Scotland should go into the tournament, in which they also face Hungary and Switzerland, in confident mood.\n\n\"Germany are coming into a bit of form but Scotland has a good spirit about them,\" said the former national captain, who won Europe's premier club competition, the Uefa Champions League, with Germany's Borussia Dortmund and retains strong links with the country.\n\n\"It's going to be tough but we've nothing to lose -- the pressure is totally on Germany. If we can get something from this game then it sets us up for the other two.\"\n\nEven the most diehard Scotland supporters do not expect their side to win Euro 2024, with the likes of France, England and the hosts Germany among the favourites. The aim instead is to achieve something that eluded even the revered sides of the past: secure enough points to make it out of the group stage and into the knockout rounds for the first time.\n\n\"We're more than capable of doing it,\" Lambert said of a prospect made easier by Uefa's decision to tweak the tournament format so more teams can progress, meaning a single win may be sufficient.\n\n\"The lads are in a good place, playing with good clubs,\" he added, singling out Andrew Robertson, a Champions League winner with Liverpool, John McGinn of Aston Villa and Manchester United's Scott McTominay, Scotland's leading goalscorer in qualifying. \"There's a really good chance.\"\n\nDuncan was equally sure that Scotland could make history. \"There's a togetherness between the players, the coaching staff and the fans,\" he said. And the prize, now within grasp: \"A chance to become legends.\"", "source": {"uri": "ft.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Financial Times News"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

Scotland, who open the tournament against Germany on Friday evening, have never played in a knockout phase of a tournament. This miserable run dates back to the 1954 World Cup.\n\n\"We want to make history,\" said Robertson. \"We know what's at stake. What's the worst that can happen? We join the list of Scotland teams who haven't got out of a group? We have so many incentives here, but becoming a legendary squad is the biggest. That's what has to drive us forward.\n\n\"The thought of being the first Scotland team to make a knockout round is our driving force. If we manage that? You just never know.\"\n\nSwitzerland and Hungary complete Group A. Common consensus is that Scotland are in a three-team race for qualification with that duo. \"In the last Euros we played well in getting a draw at Wembley, but we let ourselves down a bit in the other two games,\" Robertson said. \"We know we could have done better. To qualify that last time was massive. To do it twice in a row is incredible. Now, we know we can make history.\n\n\"We've done the hard bit by qualifying. Now let's see what else we can do. We'll need to step things up from the warm-ups games, but when you look at results so will every other team in the tournament. Once we knew we were coming here our standards dropped a little; they shouldn't, but they did. But now it's time to get competitive again. It's time to show what we can do.\"\n\nRobertson has fond memories of the Munich Football Arena. He was part of the Liverpool team who defeated Bayern Munich 3-1 there in March 2019. Less than three months later, Liverpool were lifting the trophy.\n\n\"Last time I came here was a massive win,\" Robertson said. \"A lot of people had written us off after we draw 0-0 at Anfield, but we went in front of all those Bayern supporters and beat them 3-1. It was incredible to be part of and it's even more special that it took us on the journey to win the Champions League. It was such an important game.\n\n\"J\u00fcrgen Klopp texted me last week when I broke the record [for number of games captaining Scotland], which he didn't need to do and which was good of him. He just said congratulations. I know he'll be here and I know who he'll be supporting. I hope he enjoys his night, but not too much.\"\n\nSteve Clarke echoed Robertson's confidence when asked whether Scotland could pull off a shock against Germany. \"Absolutely,\" the manager said. \"That's why we're here.\n\n\"We feel as though we can get a good result every time we step on to the pitch. Otherwise, what's the point in going on there? We feel we're ready and hopefully you'll see that pan out. Everyone is fully fit, flying and desperate to be selected. They're ready to go.\"\n\nClarke appears to have relished a normal tournament buildup after the strange backdrop to the last Euros. \"I think we should all be proud that we're here,\" be said. \"It's been a long time, since 1998, when we last travelled abroad for a major tournament.

Toni Kroos, Manuel Neuer, Antonio Rudiger and Ilkay Gundogan are all hugely experienced players who have competed at the highest level for several years.\n\nBut while so many of the faces are familiar, we know far less about their recent form given they have played so few competitive games in recent times. Bypassing qualifying by virtue of being hosts, Germany played 11 friendlies last year but won only three, losing six.\n\nFormer Bayern Munich and RB Leipzig coach Julian Nagelsmann, at 36 younger than the likes of Kroos and Neuer, took over in September and they are unbeaten since the turn of the year, a run that has included wins over France and the Netherlands - but the pressure has been off. At least until now.\n\n\"Now we're all getting kind of nervous, a little bit,\" Nagelsmann said on the eve of the tournament. \"I think it's normal, but it's good as well, because if you're kind of nervous, you'll be focused, on the first game especially.\"\n\nGood news for England\n\nJohn Stones returned to training with England on Thursday (Adam Davy/PA)\n\nEngland do not get their campaign under way until Sunday, when they are due to face Serbia in Gelsenkirchen.\n\nBut there was good news for Gareth Southgate on Thursday as John Stones returned to training to mean there was a full compliment of players going through their paces in Blankhenhain.\n\nStones was withdrawn as a precaution during Friday's friendly defeat to Iceland after taking a blow to the ankle, and then missed Wednesday's training session with an unspecified illness.\n\nBut the versatile Manchester City defender now appears to be back up to full speed.\n\nPicture of the day\n\nGermany and Scotland fans

I see a lot of belief and a lot of confidence, which is what I want ... we have the home advantage, we want to win.\"\n\n\"We can beat pressure, and we can beat Scotland as well.\"\n\nGermany have won four World Cups and three European Championship titles but their stellar tournament reputation has been somewhat tarnished with a series of failures since their 2014 World Cup victory in Brazil.\n\nThey went out of the next two World Cups in the group stage, their worst showing in over 80 years, and exited the last Euros in the round of 16.\n\n\"We will have more pressure on us than Scotland and they will want to capitalise on that,\" said Nagelsmann, who took over as Germany manager in October 2023.\n\nScotland can create chances and retain ball possession and will put the Germany defence under stress in the Group A match. \"We have to stay focused to avoid crosses,\" he added.\n\nNagelsmann said he was feeling emotional ahead of the match, describing how he comes from a tiny village with 700 inhabitants and more cows than people, and now was preparing for the opening game of Euro 2024 in Munich.\n\nGermany captain Ilkay Gundogan said Nagelsmann gave the players clarity and conveyed a sense of calm which had helped the team.\n\n\"The coach gives us confidence, a clear direction, he has discussed roles with us ... everyone knows what is expected of them and can give their all on the pitch, and that helps us a great deal after the negative experiences of the last tournaments.\n\n\"No other game is like the first one, because then you can use that momentum and that euphoria for the next few games, and that is why the most important objective tomorrow is to win the game,\" he said.

Julian Nagelsmann has the home squad on an upward trajectory since taking over and his contract has already been extended to cover at least the FIFA 2026 World Cup cycle and the 36-year-old's group reflects that long-term thinking.\n\nHow the Germans handle their first competitive action since the 2022 World Cup will be interesting with 2023 a barren year for Die Mannschaft which cost Hansi Flick his job and opened the door to Nagelsmann. This will be Toni Kroos' swansong in soccer having already signed off at club level with Real Madrid's UEFA Champions League success at Wembley.\n\nThe Scottish will not be in Germany to simply make up the numbers, though, with Steve Clarke leading the Tartan Army to their second consecutive Euro after 2020's return to international competition. That ended in group stage elimination so the aim will be to avoid that but a solid Switzerland and relative wildcard in Hungary suggests that it could be tough.\n\nHere are our storylines, how you can watch the match and more:\n\nHow to watch and oddsDate: Friday, June 14 | Time: 3 p.m. ETLocation: Fu\u00dfball Arena M\u00fcnchen -- Munich, GermanyTV: FOX | Stream: Fubo (try for free)Odds: Germany -400; Draw +480; Scotland +1200More Euro 2024Standings and scheduleHow to watchSquadsPredicting every matchExpert predictionsGroup A\n\nJoining Germany and Scotland in Group A will be Hungary and Switzerland which adds a geographical and cultural advantage given the links between three of these four nations. The Scottish are up against it but start off with their toughest game and will fancy themselves to build on a potentially positive result against the Germans when they take on the Swiss and the Hungarians. Expectations are slightly higher surrounding Nagelsmann's men now compared with before and home advantage helped the team massively back in 2006's semifinal run before defeat to eventual winners Italy after extra time which birthed a new era for German soccer.\n\nTeam news\n\nGermany: Nagelsmann's squad selection has raised a few eyebrows with Timo Werner, Serge Gnabry, Leon Goretzka, Julian Brandt, Emre Can and Mats Hummels all fairly high-profile absentees given previous squads. The big news was the return of Toni Kroos for his farewell to professional soccer while a handful of fairly untested players made the preliminary squad including VfB Stuttgart contingent Alexander Nubel, Waldemar Anton, Maximilian Mittelstadt, Chris Fuhrich and Deniz Undav as well as Bayern Munich's Aleksandar Pavlovic. Familiar faces like Manuel Neuer, Thomas Muller and Ilkay Gundogan are all present, though.\n\nPossible Germany XI: Ter Stegen; Kimmich, Rudiger, Tah, Mittelstadt; Andrich, Kroos; Musiala, Gundogan (c), Wirtz; Havertz.\n\nScotland: Clarke does not have as many top tier talents to pick from as Nagelsmann but it is still a solid enough squad and the return of Andrew Robertson from injury is a big boost. Lyndon Dykes, Aaron Hickey and Elliot Anderson are all out injured while Nathan Patterson has also been overlooked. Key men will obviously be Robertson and Aston Villa captain John McGinn as well as Manchester United's Scott McTominay but only McGinn boasting double figures for goals suggests that the Scottish attack could have issues in front of goal in Germany.\n\nPossible Scotland XI: Clark; Patterson, Hendry, McKenna, Robertson (c); McTominay, McGregor; Armstrong, McGinn, McLean; Brown.\n\nPrediction\n\nIt might be tight at times but expect for the hosts to make a winning start and to possibly win by a couple of goals to build up some early momentum.

You can check out at any time. More info\n\nGermany legend Dietmar Hamann insists Jurgen Nagelsmann's side must be ahead by half-time against Scotland if they want to avoid their opening night party going flat.\n\nThe 59-times capped midfielder claims nerves could get the better of the hosts against a Scotland team he holds as dark horses in Euro 2024 Group A. Hamman questioned veteran goalkeeper Manuel Neuer's form and how many players Nagelsmann can hang his hat on to perform under pressure when the curtain goes up on the Euros in the Allianz Arena. And the 2002 World Cup runner-up says it would be foolish to write off Steve Clarke's troops.\n\nSpeaking to In The Zone podcast Hamann said: \"The Scots won't go down without a fight. When Germany go on the pitch on Friday, we have to come off at halftime with at least one goal or more than the Scots. \"I don't think it'll be a straightforward game. I know Scotland have got a few injury worries, especially with the big man up top, Lyndon Dykes, he's out.\n\n\"But nerves will come into it. We've got Manuel Neuer in goal, who's obviously fighting for his position at the moment. But you need players where you can rely on, who are going to perform. And at the moment, I'm not too sure how many we've got, Toni Kroos and that's it. Germany could win the game 5-0, but I'd be very surprised.\n\n\"I think it'll be a very, very tight game on Friday. If things don't go well in the first half hour against the Scots on Friday, the 70,000 fans who are there to push you on will start whistling after 40 minutes, and that can be something that goes against us as the home team.\"\n\nMeanwhile the former Liverpool and Manchester City ace has pinpointed Scotland's main threats as he told Nagelsmann's men not to underestimate the opening game. And he says Germany must avoid the off-field drama that blew apart their 2022 World Cup bid if they want to succeed on home soil.\n\nSpeaking to Prime Casino he added: \"It would be incredibly foolish to write Scotland off. They have some excellent players in Andy Robertson, John McGinn. Scott McTominay always does it in a Scotland shirt. This is a great opportunity for Scotland to show the world just how much they have improved as a footballing nation over the last few years.\n\n\"The opening game will be a big test for this group. The expectation is high and, in many ways, it's a bit of a free hit for Scotland.\n\n\"Everyone will expect the host nation to beat them convincingly, but it won't be that simple. Scotland are a good team, and they will make it as difficult as possible for Germany.\n\n\"It's important that there is a little bit of tension in the group when they stand in that tunnel before the match kick-off. It's not nerves, you don't want that because that is a negative energy. Use the tension to focus your minds and get the job done.\n\n\"At the World Cup, there were too many issues off the pitch that had a major impact on the squad. The rainbow armband and the fall-out from that, it was just too much of a distraction and I think it split the team.\n\n\"At the World Cup, we had a divided team. If you're not united, if you haven't got 26 players and staff all pulling in the same direction, you won't go anywhere. So that is a major difference going into this tournament.\n\n\"Have we learned anything from that World Cup experience? We'll find out. We've got an okay group. On paper, I think this group might look a bit easier than it actually is.\n\n\"All three games are potential banana skins for Germany. I don't think there are any easy games in this group. Germany should go through, but I think it'll be a fight against all three teams.\"", "source": {"uri": "dailyrecord.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "Daily Record"}, "authors": [{"uri": "fraser_wilson@dailyrecord.co.uk", "name": "Fraser Wilson", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scotland", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Scotland"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Scotland"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Germany", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Germany"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Germany"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dietmar_Hamann", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Dietmar Hamann"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manuel_Neuer", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Manuel Neuer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euro", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Euro"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UEFA_Euro_2016_Group_A", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "UEFA Euro 2016 Group A"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Half-time", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Half-time"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scotland_national_football_team", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Scotland national football team"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cap_(sport)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Cap (sport)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Horse_racing", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Horse racing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steve_Clarke", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Steve Clarke"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Allianz_Arena", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Allianz Arena"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Podcast", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Podcast"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FIFA_World_Cup", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "FIFA World Cup"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Midfielder", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Midfielder"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goalkeeper_(association_football)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Goalkeeper (association football)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lyndon_Dykes", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Lyndon Dykes"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Football_pitch", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Football pitch"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liverpool_F.C.", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Liverpool F.C."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toni_Kroos", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Toni Kroos"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manchester_City_F.C.", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Manchester City F.C."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andrew_Robertson", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Andrew Robertson"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_McGinn", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "John McGinn"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scott_McTominay", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Scott McTominay"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/Competitions", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/Competitions", "wgt": 22}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Board_Games/War_and_Politics", "label": "dmoz/Games/Board Games/War and Politics", "wgt": 17}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Multiplayer", "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Multiplayer", "wgt": 17}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Play-By-Mail", "label": "dmoz/Games/Play-By-Mail", "wgt": 17}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Play-By-Mail/Companies", "label": "dmoz/Games/Play-By-Mail/Companies", "wgt": 17}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://i2-prod.dailyrecord.co.uk/incoming/article33021664.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_GettyImages-2156732888.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9648341", "eventUri": "eng-9648341", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.0117647058823529, "wgt": 142, "relevance": 1}

He said that he would only be back if he felt that we could win something with the team. And then he said 'Yes, let's do it.'\"\n\nKroos retired after Germany's dismal Euro 2020 campaign ended in the Round of 16 against England, while they went on to go out in the group at the Qatar 2022 World Cup.\n\n\"I don't want to talk about the past,\" said Nagelsmann. \"It's about the present. We want to be more successful than we were last time.\n\n\"It's important to start well tomorrow.

campaign.\n\nMeanwhile Julian Nagelsmann's Germany come into this tournament with question marks around their form but the individual talent to go all the way.\n\nHere's everything you need to know about the opening game.\n\nWhat time does Germany vs Scotland kick off?\n\nGermany vs Scotland will kick off at the Allianz Arena, Bayern Munich's home stadium, at 8pm BST on Friday 14 June.\n\nAn opening ceremony with fireworks and a ceremonial presentation of each Euro 2024 nation's flag will also take place an hour before the game starts.\n\nThe opening ceremony will also include a tribute to Germany legend Franz Beckenbauer, who captained his nation to winning Euro 1972.\n\nBeckenbauer's wife Heidi will be joined by the two living captains from Germany's previous victorious European Championship campaigns, Jurgen Klinsmann and Bernard Dietz.\n\nThe first three matches of the tournament will be shown by ITV, before the BBC's first game on Saturday evening.\n\nITV's coverage of the match starts at 6.30pm BST and will feature Ally McCoist and Graeme Souness alongside a host of other big names.\n\nGermany vs Scotland talking points\n\nFor Scotland, this game is about demonstrating they are capable of carrying their qualification form into the tournament proper.\n\nThey have still never made it out of the group stages of a major tournament and will consider this perhaps their best-ever chance.\n\nIn a group with Germany, Hungary and Switzerland, Scotland may only have to win one game to get through to the last 16 as the top four third-placed sides earn a knockout spot.\n\nThey have been dealt a blow by a pre-tournament injury to striker Lyndon Dykes, yet Che Adams is a capable replacement.\n\nAnd Scotland's greatest strength is in midfield, where John McGinn, Scott McTominay and Billy Gilmour are a dangerous Premier League unit.\n\nFor Germany, they have issues at either end of the pitch.\n\nManuel Neuer has come under increased scrutiny after a series of high-profile mistakes.\n\nNagelsmann has said he is certain to start regardless, but the fan clamour and criticism may grow if there are further mistakes, especially with Marc-Andre ter Stegen waiting in the wings.\n\nGoing forward, goals are Germany's biggest issue, a responsibility which will fall to Arsenal striker Kai Havertz.\n\nDie Nationalmannschaft have been creating a huge amount of chances without scoring, including 27 shots in their 0-0 draw with Ukraine pre-tournament.\n\nIf they can convert these into goals, Scotland may well be in trouble.", "source": {"uri": "inews.co.uk",

Germany, three-time winners, three-time runners-up, who have qualified for the finals more than any other side, will face neighbours Switzerland, Hungary and Scotland.\n\nGermany will take on Scotland in the first game of the tournament in Munich on June 14 but it's likely to be their clash with Hungary in Stuttgart five days later, and potentially the final-day clash with Switzerland in Frankfurt on June 23 which will determine the order in which they finish in Group A.\n\nGermany are heavy odds on to finish top and the shortest price with the bookies to win all their group games, however they lag well behind England and France in the betting to lift the trophy.\n\nWell, the short answer is because they are ranked 16 in the FIFA world rankings with eight European sides ahead of them.\n\nThe past 10 years have not been kind to Germany. Since they thrashed the hosts on their way to lifting the World Cup in Rio in 2014 they have suffered an historically bad run, going out in the group stage in both the 2018 World Cup in Russia and Qatar 2022 and losing in pretty dismal fashion in the Round of 16 against England at Wembley at Euro 2020.\n\nThe page was turned as Joachim Low departed in 2021 but his replacement Hansi Flick became the first Germany manager to be sacked, ever, when he was axed in September 2023 after three straight defeats, the final straw a 4-1 reverse against Japan, who had also beaten them in Qatar the previous year.\n\nDark days indeed for German football. Stop chuckling at the back. Flick's average of 1.72 points per game was the second worst in the history of the Germany national team. Former Bayern boss Julian Nagelsmann took over last September and although his tenure did begin with some iffy results, losing 3-2 to Turkey in Berlin and 2-0 in Austria three days later in particular, friendly wins in March against the might of France and the Netherlands has given hope they have turned the corner.\n\nThe 36-year-old has blended some young stars in with some old heads and sprinkled in some in-form lesser names in an attempt to find the recipe for success on home soil. His greatest master stroke of all might be tempting Toni Kroos out of international retirement for one last dance on home soil this summer.\n\nIt didn't help them break the deadlock in a warm-up game stalemate against Ukraine last week, however, and they limped to victory against Greece on Friday, coming from behind and nicking a late winner.\n\nThe fact remains that Germany have not won a knockout game at a major tournament since Euro 2016. That's eight years and four tournaments ago, just to be clear. They might also have been hindered by automatically qualifying as hosts - their lack of competitive football in the past few years can't have helped them during such a period of turmoil.\n\nWhile they possess some wonderful attacking players, the Germans have not kept a clean sheet in a tournament since they faced Slovakia in the Round of 16 that same summer of 2016 - they have conceded in 12 straight matches at World Cups and Euros since then. Unprecedented.\n\nYes, but that might not be as important as you think, the omens are certainly not great. No country hosting the Euros on their own has lifted the trophy since France in 1984. Three years before Nagelsmann was born and when there were only eight teams present.\n\nIn the 16 editions of the Euros only two other sides have lifted the trophy on home soil, Spain in 1964 and Italy four years later - only four teams took part in each of those tournaments.\n\nOnly co-hosts Poland and Ukraine, in 2012, and Austria and Switzerland four years earlier have failed to reach the last four, at least, since the tournament's inception.\n\nHowever, it's worth remembering Germany do enjoy playing at home. They lifted the 1974 World Cup on home soil, made the semi-finals of Euro 1988 and then finished third in the 2006 World Cup under Jurgen Klinsmann when they had widely been written off before the tournament, with serious comparisons able to be drawn to this year too.\n\nThere will certainly be a powerful wave of emotion fuelling this Germany campaign. Kroos returned to international football having retired three years ago and will be playing the final matches of his glittering career. He bowed out of club football with his sixth Champions League medal but can he add a European Championship to his World Cup medal to complete the set?\n\nHe returned for the March friendlies where Germany overcame World Cup runners-up France and quarter-finalists the Netherlands in the space of four days, which bodes well.\n\nHe's arguably still the best player in the German squad which is an eclectic mix of household names - who have possibly seen better days - and some relative unknowns.\n\nManuel Neuer, Thomas Muller, Ilkay Gundogan and Antonio Rudiger possess a wealth of experience but it might be the new breed of Jamal Musiala, Florian Wirtz and Kai Havertz who hold the hopes of a nation in their hands.\n\nAlthough they are heavy odds on to finish top of Group A, it would not be a complete shock if Germany faced some stiff competition from Hungary.\n\nGermany came from behind late-on to draw against Marco Rossi's side in Munich at Euro 2020 and did the same in Budapest in the Nations League in June 2022.\n\nHungary actually won the return match in Leipzig 1-0 later that year and also beat England home and away in the Nations League.\n\nThey qualified top of their group for the first time, finishing unbeaten and four points ahead of Serbia, and only saw a 14-match unbeaten streak ended by a freak breakaway goal in a friendly against the Republic of Ireland in Dublin last week.\n\nAfter 36 years without a finals appearance Hungary have qualified for the third straight tournament for the first time and are worthy of respect. That second group game in Stuttgart on June 19 (5pm BST) looks huge.\n\nShould Germany manage to finish above the Magyars then they will take on the runners-up in Group C, England's group - so you'd think that might be Denmark.\n\nIn that half of the draw Spain or Italy would likely await the winner in the quarter-final while Portugal could be the semi-final opposition.\n\nEngland or France would ultimately be lurking as potential opposition in the final in Berlin on July 14.\n\nIf that's not tough enough then it looks even worse were Germany to qualify as runners-up, or even as one of the four best third-place finishers.\n\nIf they finish second then Spain or Italy would likely form the opposition in the Round of 16 with England looming as potential quarter-final opponents and France in the semi-final. Portugal, Spain or Italy in the Final would almost feel a relief at that stage.\n\nCan Germany win it? Of course they can. They might be a force in transition but they still possess two of the world's most exciting talents in Jamal Musiala and Florian Wirtz, they also have the quality, experience and drive of Toni Kroos and the guile of Ilkay Gundogan ahead of him.\n\nWill they win it? Probably not. To do so Germany would likely need to beat three of England, France, Italy and Spain. While their first XI looks a match for most on their day, they lack the squad depth of their rivals and do not possess as many potential match-winners either.\n\nThe boss himself is keen to avoid the weight of expectation, urging his squad to try to have fun and ignore the pressure.\n\nNagelsmann told uefa.com: \"It is a huge task, it will be challenging, and it's certainly not a chance that comes around very often.\n\n\"It's only the second time Germany has hosted a European Championship. For the players, and for myself as a manager, to take part in a tournament on home soil is a unique opportunity.\n\n\"There is pressure involved, but more so joy. If we can see that joy on the pitch, then we will have a great tournament.\"\n\nExpect to see them have some fun at the expense of Scotland and Switzerland but Hungary might be a different matter. If they finish second in the group then it's hard to see how they get past Spain or Italy in the Round of 16, even if the home crowd help them, a quarter-final exit at the hands of England would be one which is spoken about for years.", "source": {"uri": "101greatgoals.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "101greatgoals.com"}, "authors": [{"uri": "alex_hoad@101greatgoals.com", "name": "Alex Hoad",

A small movement of his chest towards our camera as he spoke, demonstrating what he wants from his players inside the Allianz Arena on Friday night.\n\nWhat an occasion this promises to be.\n\nThere will be 70,000 fans - of whom at the very least 10,000 will be draped in dark blue - inside the awesome home of Bayern Munich. Tens of thousands more Scots in the city - some reckon as many as 200,000 will be in Germany. And millions back home watching with pride, hope and expectation.\n\nScotland's moment is upon us.\n\nNo doubt we'll be put through the wringer. This is part of the package when you're invested in the national football team.\n\nThis is something I've experienced as a fan and as a journalist.\n\nIt's approaching 25 years since I started covering sport, so I missed France '98. There was a feeling back then Scotland playing at a major tournament was a routine experience.\n\nWe'd qualified for six out of the previous seven World Cups and played at Euro 92 and Euro 96.\n\nEveryone had grown to expect to party at a major tournament every two years.\n\nWhat followed were the wilderness years. Berti Vogts, Walter Smith, Alex McLeish (twice), George Burley, Craig Levein and Gordon Strachan all tried to but failed to get Scotland back to the top table.\n\nStep forward, Steve Clarke.\n\nWhen he took over as head coach five years ago, it was a bumpy start.\n\nScotland suffered four consecutive defeats to Belgium and Russia in their Euro 2020 qualifying campaign. The road back to the big time looked an arduous one.\n\nBut qualification was secured via the Nations League. We'll never forget that night in Serbia as Scotland reached dreamland.\n\nThe Euro 2020 championship had its moments.\n\nA hard-fought draw against England, with Billy Gilmour shining through a player of the match performance, being the highlight. But Covid restrictions and a UK setting for all of Scotland's games meant it didn't quite capture the glamour of previous tournaments.\n\nEuro 2024 has a special feeling. To play the opening game against one of the giants of world football is a once in a generation opportunity.\n\nOr as Clarke puts it: \"The opening game, come on, the opening game against the host nation. It's going to be a spectacular occasion.\"\n\nScotland go into the game as big underdogs. Some bookmakers are offering 12/1 on a win for Steve Clarke's side.\n\nBut this team has come a long way under this head coach. An exhilarating run in qualifying - with the Scots securing their place at this year's tournament with two games to spare - included an unforgettable win over Spain, meaning the players fear no one.\n\nResults in friendly matches since then show there's a bit to go. The late slip that saw the team draw with Finland in the send-off game at Hampden is the latest example. And Scotland have kept just one clean sheet in their last nine games - against the second lowest ranked team in Europe (Gibraltar).\n\nBut, when on their game, there's a belief, purpose and even a swagger in the team.\n\nThey will be led on the pitch by Andy Robertson. Following last week's game against Finland, the Liverpool defender became Scotland's most-capped captain, overtaking George Young. Robertson epitomises the drive and confidence in the team. As well as his defensive duties, he offers a potent attacking threat.\n\nScott McTominay - who was the joint fifth top scorer in the qualifying campaign with seven goals - has become a talismanic figure. Some of us took a deep breath when McTominay was injured against Burnley a few weeks ago. He later revealed on Instagram all was fine and dandy. Phew.\n\nAnd there's John McGinn. Super John McGinn. His cheeky chappy and relatable nature shouldn't overshadow his talent.\n\nClarke has found a way to get the best from McGinn, who like McTominay has become a vital source of goals. He goes into the Euros after captaining Aston Villa into the Champions League places.\n\nWhile Ben Doak may not have been in the starting eleven, his inclusion in the provisional squad generated a lot of excitement. The uncapped teenager would have offered the team something different with his pace and skill. His withdrawal last week due to injury is a major disappointment. Doak, Aaron Hickey, Nathan Patterson, Lyndon Dykes, Lewis Ferguson and Jacob Brown all miss out through injury.\n\nRight back is a concern. With Hickey and Patterson ruled out of the tournament, Clarke's options are Anthony Ralston - who hasn't had much game time at Celtic this season - or Ross McCrorie. McCrorie earned his first cap against Gibraltar last week.\n\nRalston grew into the game against Finland and the smart money would be on the Celtic defender being tasked with keeping Bayer Leverkusen star Florian Wirtz quiet. And what a task.\n\nAnd who'll be Clarke's three central defenders? Kieran Tierney will take his place on the left of three. Meaning it's likely to be two out of Grant Hanley, Jack Hendry and Ryan Porteous.\n\nPorteous started seven out of the eight qualifiers, with Hendry alongside him in four of those games.\n\nHanley, who was sidelined for most of the campaign with an Achilles problem, tends to start when fit.\n\nClarke was keen to get him as much game time as possible before the Euros, with the Norwich defender playing 45 minutes against Gibraltar and the 90 against Finland, partnering Hendry in the latter. That would suggest Clarke is set to go with the pair in Munich.\n\nWhoever takes to the pitch, the aim is clear: create history and reach the knockout stages at a major tournament for the first time. They've got three games to achieve this. A positive result against the hosts could ignite the whole campaign.\n\nThe size of the occasion makes it difficult to look past the opening game. I've been to big matches in Germany and they don't lack for atmosphere. But the noise inside the Allianz Arena promises to be on a different level.\n\nClarke recently said he wants his players to play the game rather the occasion. But with a global audience tuned in, it will be difficult for reality to match the rhetoric.\n\nThe Tartan Army expects a big performance, the players have belief that can kick off with a positive result and the head coach has insisted that his side will be ready when it matters.\n\nWhen the decibel count lifts in the Allianz Arena, Scotland need to rise to the occasion.\n\nFrom the moment the national anthem starts, that's when we'll need to see those chests puffed out and the team that made huge strides in qualifying step up to another level.\n\nAnd if they do, it could be the start of a special campaign. Amen to that. I drew Scotland in the office sweep.", "source": {"uri": "news.stv.tv", "dataType": "news", "title": "STV News"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steve_Clarke",

Let's have a deepeer dive to find out...\n\nScotland qualifying for a major tournament is rare enough, so the ease at which they did so is something of a relic.\n\nThey needed a nail-biting penalty shoot-out in a play-off match against Cyprus to reach Euro 2020 but this time around it was much more smooth sailing.\n\nPitched as 14-1 outsiders to win a group containing 2012 winners Spain and Erling Haaland's Norway, the Scots claimed the scalp of both those sides during a memorable campaign, with Scott McTominay transitioning into an unlikely goalscoring machine.\n\nThey spent most of the campaign in top spot before being pipped by Spain but only after a place at Germany this summer had already been secured.\n\nWinning five out of eight games overall and also sealing promotion to the top tier in the Nations League, Scotland appear ready to take on Europe's top teams.\n\nAfter qualifying last Autumn while riding the crest of a wave, Clarke may have been forgiven for wanting the tournament to start there and then, with their form since then hitting a sticky patch.\n\nAfter their Nations League promotion, Scotland organised friendlies against higher-quality opponents - taking on England, France and the Netherlands.\n\nThose three games between September and March ended in 3-1, 4-1 and 4-0 defeats... before they lost 1-0 to Northern Ireland.\n\nIt was a stark reminder of the step up required to become a threat on the international stage.\n\nTheir warm-up games ahead of the tournament have ever so slightly dampended optimism too. After labouring to a 2-0 win over minnows Gibraltar, they let a two-goal lead slip to draw with Finland.\n\nThough it could have been worse, qualifying from a group made up of Germany, Switzerland and Hungary will not exactly be a walk in the park and they are unsurprisingly outsiders to win the group at 11-1.\n\nThey will have the whole of Europe watching when they kick off the tournament against the hosts on Friday, with optimism growing over their nation's prospects under Julian Nagelsmann.\n\nTaking anything away from that opener looks a tall order and the Scots will look to the other two games as the chance to get the points needed.\n\nThat is easier said than done though. Switzerland will not be a threat to the grand prize but are an experienced tournament team, while Hungary have some notable stars in their ranks.\n\nBut with the format likely allowing a third place in the group to qualify for the knockout stages, it could well be anyone's game.\n\nShould Scotland cause a huge upset and win Group A, they would take on the runners-up in England's group.\n\nThat likely means Denmark in the last 16, before qualiying nemeses Spain in the quarter-finals providing they top Group B.\n\nIf they finish second in the group, a last-16 tie against one of Spain, Italy or Croatia likely awaits. Come through that and it could be England in the quarter-finals. Yikes!\n\nFinishing third in the group would probably result in drawing a similar high-profile name from Groups B, E or F - containing Spain, Belgium and Portugal respectively.\n\nScotland are not short of household names we regularly see light up the Premier League but there are aerguably a few noticeable gaps in the side Clarke has to choose from.\n\nCaptain Andy Robertson and Kieran Tierney majke up a strong left side, with Brighton creator Billy Gilmour also operating in those areas.\n\nJack Hendry and Nathan Patterson perhaps don't offer the same threat on the right, creating something of an inbalance in the team.\n\nThat is not to say there isn't plenty more quality elsewhere, with McTominay always coming alive for his national side, as does fellow advanced midfielder John McGinn who has just enjoyed a superb campaign for Aston Villa.\n\nThose two will be tasked with taking the goalscoring burden away from a light set of goalscoring strikers, with Lyndon Dykes ruled out and Che Adams not a prolific No9.\n\nLaurence Shankland certainly has been that with 31 goals for Hearts this season, however. The 31-year-old is full of confidence and may prove something of an unknown quantity on the continent.\n\nDespite a few disappointing results in the build-up to the tournament, Clarke has got no time for any negativity as they embark on another major tournament adventure.\n\nHe said: \"Any time I read a little snippet from someone who wants to be a negative Norman I just dismiss it because what's to be negative about?\n\n\"We're going into another major tournament, the squad is in a good place and we're all determined to do as well as we can for our country. Why not just relax and enjoy it?\n\n\"That's what we're going to try and do. Obviously we've got to try and produce the goods on the pitch and that's what we'll do.\n\n\"I just don't understand why anyone would be negative about a second European Championships in a row and really good squad of players who have shown how good they are for their country.\n\nScotland have come on leaps and bounds in three years and the way they were comfortably swept aside at Euro 2020 - aside from THAT England draw - is surely out of the question.\n\nClarke's troops have a real chance of making history by reaching the knockout stages, something no other Scottish team has achieved, and they have as good a chance as Switzerland or Hungary in that group.\n\nBut whether troubling the bigger nations if they get there might just be a step too far.", "source": {"uri":

With the nation having lost the opening game in their last three major tournaments Nagelsmann admits the pressure his 11 will feel is a privilege as they seek to break years of failure that have followed the 2014 World Cup win in Brazil.\n\nA positive March international break and significant change in the squad has built expectations but the former Bayern Munich manager reiterates it's time to back up talk with action as the eyes of his nation and the world watch.\n\n\"It's a special moment for me and the whole team, tomorrow we will do our best to convince our fans that we are one of the best competitive teams in the tournament,\" he said.\n\n\"I don't want to talk about the past, it's about where we want to go. We've tried to make changes to the squad since March and now we want to go and be more successful than other tournaments. It doesn't make sense to talk about the past when we're only focused on where we want to go - to be one of the best nations.\n\n\"It's normal to feel a little bit of pressure before such a tournament. In the end, it's important to remember that such pressure is a privilege. It's important to feel a little pressure but we can beat pressure and beat Scotland.\n\n\"We have more pressure than Scotland so they will want to capitalise. It will be a very interesting game but if I look in my players' eyes it has been the same since March, they are looking forward to it and want to win.\"\n\nNagelsmann was full of praise for Steve Clarke's team and their development since the most recent Euros in 2021. The Germany boss believes it's a squad that boasts variety - capable of playing directly when needed while still possessing a blend of technique and talent throughout.\n\n\"Scotland are a team that doesn't have world-class starts but that makes them very dangerous. They work very hard and have a classic Scottish mentality. They've had an incredible development,\" he added.\n\n\"They're not a kick-and-rush team. When they played against Holland and lost 4-0 Scotland were actually better than the Dutch. I think the mentality of the team is to fight for every ball and they've made a great journey from a team who plays a lot of long balls and fights for second balls to one who are really good with ball possession. They play a lot of crosses and create stress on a defence.\n\n\"Steve Clarke is a well-experienced coach who has spent many years as an assistant manager to many big names so he's learned a lot in this time. I mentioned transformation because of his brilliant job in the last couple of years. When you watched Scotland a few years ago it was balls in the air and fighting for the seconds, now they are capable in every department. They can counterattack and have a good build-up game, they have effective pressing moments but can defend compactly. They are in a good way and it's because of the brilliant job of my colleague.\"\n\nThe German boss also continued his defence of Manuel Neuer. The storied goalkeeper has returned to the fold from a broken leg in recent months while committing a number of high-profile errors, including in the lead-up to Greece's opener during Germany's 2-1 friendly win last week.\n\nNagelsmann is confident that despite sticky moments across that encounter and a 0-0 draw with Ukraine his 38-year-old goalkeeper and team will be ready to perform at top level tonight.\n\n\"Manuel and I know how media works but I think my recent statement made it clear. I am sorry but I don't care what you discuss, with my players it only matters that they have my trust and I'm sure Manuel will have a good tournament.\"\n\nMeanwhile, captain Ilkay Gundogan is relishing the opportunity to lead his nation out in Munich tomorrow, nearly 20 years on from watching the last major tournament hosted by Germany, the 2006 World Cup.\n\n\"It means a lot and is such a privilege not only to be the captain of this team but simply to be part of this team and atmosphere. Having the tournament in our country is not an opportunity you have often,\" he said.\n\n\"In 2006 I was watching games as a teenager and now I am part of this team. Representing the German people with pride is such an honour for me and I want to show on the pitch to everyone that I feel that.\n\n\"I expect a difficult game against Scotland, knowing a lot of players from the Premier League. Especially the likes of John McGinn, Andy Robertson and Scott McTominay, there is a really experienced axis who play at the highest level with very good teams. We aren't underestimating them and have lots of respect for them but I also know what we can do. If we reach our potential I am confident that we can win tomorrow.\"", "source": {"uri": "heraldscotland.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Herald"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scotland", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Scotland"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Scotland"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Germany", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Germany"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Germany"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manager_(association_football)", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Manager (association football)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euro", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Euro"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steve_Clarke", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Steve Clarke"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FC_Bayern_Munich", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "FC Bayern Munich"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FIFA_World_Cup", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "FIFA World Cup"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Netherlands", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Netherlands"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Netherlands"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brazil", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Brazil"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Brazil"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manuel_Neuer", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Manuel Neuer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goalkeeper_(association_football)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Goalkeeper (association football)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andrew_Robertson", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Andrew Robertson"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_McGinn", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "John McGinn"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Football_pitch", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Football pitch"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/\u0130lkay_G\u00fcndo\u011fan", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "\u0130lkay G\u00fcndo\u011fan"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Premier_League", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Premier League"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exhibition_game", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Exhibition game"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scott_McTominay", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Scott McTominay"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Munich", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Munich"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Munich"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Germany"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ukraine", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Ukraine"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Ukraine"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greece", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Greece"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Greece"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Paintball/Teams", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Paintball/Teams", "wgt": 25}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Robotics/Competitions", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Robotics/Competitions", "wgt": 20}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Flying_Discs", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Flying Discs", "wgt": 19}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Flying_Discs/Ultimate_Frisbee", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Flying Discs/Ultimate Frisbee", "wgt": 20}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Amateur", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Amateur", "wgt": 20}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 97}], "image": "https://www.heraldscotland.com/resources/images/18193471/", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9648341", "eventUri": "eng-9648341", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.2549019607843137, "wgt": 140, "relevance": 1}

But Clarke masterminded wins over Spain at home and Norway away during qualifying and believes that anything is possible if his charges perform at their best and do no let the enormity of the occasion affect them.\n\n\"It's quite a busy press conference so it must be a big game!\" he said with a smile as he entered the media room at the Allianz Arena. \"Obviously it's a big game, but for us it's the opening game of a four team section so we'll have three matches.\n\n\"We know what we have to do to qualify out of the section and that's the only thing we're focussed on. The enormity of the opening game or whatever? That's a little bit of a sideshow and hopefully we don't get too involved in that.\"\n\nClarke added: \"Germany are a good team. I think a lot of people have been trying to talk them down a little bit lately. When Julian first went in, he probably found it similar to how I found it when I became Scotland head coach.\n\n\"He had to try and find out his best team and he's managed to do that. When the draw was first made I felt this would be a really tough game and nothing has made me change my mind.\n\n\"But one of the mantras I've always had is: 'Respect everyone and fear no-one!' So, while we have a lot of respect for the host nation, hopefully on the night we can cause them problems. We've settled in well, trained well and we're looking forward to the match.\n\n\"They have to deal with the pressure themselves. That's what they have to do. But most of them have played in big matches before. I'm sure they'll all handle the occasion quite well.\"\n\nREAD MORE: The German view on Germany's chances of success at Euro 2024\n\nAsked if he thought Scotland could draw with or defeat Germany, he said: \"Absolutely. That's why we're here. We feel as though we can get a good result every time we step onto the pitch. Otherwise, what's the point in going out there. We feel we're ready and hopefully you'll see that pan Friday night.\"\n\nIt is believed that over 200,000 Scots have travelled to Germany this week to cheer on Robertson and his team mates in their matches against the home favourites, Switzerland and Hungary. Clarke is eager for his side to give their fans something to celebrate.\n\n(Image: PA) \"We know the supporters are here in their numbers to support us,\" he said. \"We know they are going to be right behind us in every minute of every game. That's really important for us.\n\n\"We've had a little taste of that in Garmisch-Partenkirchen where we are based. It made the walk to training more enjoyable. I know there are many more here in Germany who we haven't seen and I hope they enjoy themselves.\"\n\nREAD MORE: Celtic player branded 'ultimate professional' ahead of Toni Kroos duel\n\nClarke continued: \"I can enjoy it. I think now that with the experience I've picked up along the way, I can do that.

Toni Kroos, Manuel Neuer, Antonio Rudiger and Ilkay Gundogan are all hugely experienced players who have competed at the highest level for several years.\n\nBut while so many of the faces are familiar, we know far less about their recent form given they have played so few competitive games in recent times. Bypassing qualifying by virtue of being hosts, Germany played 11 friendlies last year but won only three, losing six.\n\nFormer Bayern Munich and RB Leipzig coach Julian Nagelsmann, at 36 younger than the likes of Kroos and Neuer, took over in September and they are unbeaten since the turn of the year, a run that has included wins over France and the Netherlands - but the pressure has been off. At least until now.\n\n\"Now we're all getting kind of nervous, a little bit,\" Nagelsmann said on the eve of the tournament. \"I think it's normal, but it's good as well, because if you're kind of nervous, you'll be focused, on the first game especially.\"\n\nEngland do not get their campaign under way until Sunday, when they are due to face Serbia in Gelsenkirchen.\n\nBut there was good news for Gareth Southgate on Thursday as John Stones returned to training to mean there was a full compliment of players going through their paces in Blankhenhain.\n\nStones was withdrawn as a precaution during Friday's friendly defeat to Iceland after taking a blow to the ankle, and then missed Wednesday's training session with an unspecified illness.\n\nBut the versatile Manchester City defender now appears to be back up to full speed.\n\nGermany v Scotland, 8pm, RT\u00c9 2\n\nRSS Syndicated Content Published: Thu 13 Jun 2024, 9:20 PM Last updated: Thu 13 Jun 2024, 9:41 PM", "source": {"uri":

their opening opponents four times, with the last victory coming in a friendly in 1999.\n\nManaged by Craig Brown, Scotland defeated a German side that included names such as Oliver Bierhoff and Lothar Matthaus thanks to a second-half goal from Everton's Don Hutchison.\n\nScotland have history kicking off tournaments, having been drawn to face Brazil in the opener at World Cup 1998, a game they narrowly lost 2-1 to a second-half Tom Boyd own goal.\n\nThis time around the venue is the Munich Football Arena (Allianz Arena) where the hosts are their opponents.\n\nThe Scots also face games

The midfielder has 109 caps and will finish his football career after this tournament.\n\nCaptain Ilkay Gundogan of Barcelona and fellow midfielder Leroy Sane of Bayern Munich both had spells at Manchester City while Pascal Gross is a team-mate of Billy Gilmour's at Brighton.\n\nArsenal's Kai Havertz scored in last week's friendly win over Greece and evergreen 34-year-old forward Thomas Muller has a remarkable 45 goals in 129 caps.\n\nJulian Nagelsmann was appointed Germany head coach in September 2023, taking over from the sacked Hansi Flick.\n\nAt 36, he became the country's second youngest coach, only behind Otto Nerz, who was 34 when hired in 1926.\n\nNagelsmann previously managed TSG Hoffenheim, RB Leipzig and Bayern Munich in the Bundesliga.\n\nHe took RB Leipzig to the semi-finals of the Champions League in 2020 and won the Bundesliga title in his debut season at Bayern Munich before being sacked in March 2023.\n\nGermany are truly one of the superpowers in world football.\n\nThey have been World Cup winners on four occasions, runners-up four times and had four third-place finishes.\n\nThey have won the European Championship three times and have also been runners-up on three occasions.\n\nGermany have taken part at every World Cup since 1954 and every European Championship since 1972.\n\nThey last won the European Championship in 1996 when they beat Czech Republic 2-1 in the final at Wembley.\n\nOn the face of it, Scotland's record against the Germans is not too bad - winning four and drawing five of their 17 meetings.\n\nHowever, Scotland have never beaten them in a competitive game.\n\nIn tournament finals, Germany won the 1986 World Cup encounter 2-1 and recorded a 1-0 win at Euro 92.\n\nScotland's last victory in the fixture was in 1999 when Don Hutchison, earning his second cap, scored the winner in a 1-0 friendly win in Bremen.\n\nThe most recent meeting between the sides was in September 2015 when Germany won 3-2 in a European Championship qualifier at Hampden.\n\nGrant Hanley and James Forrest remain from the Scotland squad while Germany had Neuer, Kroos, Muller and Gundogan in their line-up. Muller scored twice and Gundogan got the winner.", "source": {"uri": "irishnews.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Irish News"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

He played a blinder of a qualification group. Scotland are supposed to go agonisingly close and then fail at the 11th hour, but this time they forgot the script and won their first five matches. They qualified with two to spare.\n\nMcTominay, who has made more than 250 appearances for Manchester United, was at the heart of Scotland's charge, scoring seven goals from midfield, most of them arriving late in the box for a decisive finish. The only players to score more than he did in qualifying were Romelu Lukaku for Belgium, Cristiano Ronaldo for Portugal, France's Kylian Mbapp\u00e9 and Harry Kane. McTominay scored twice against Spain, the second a beautiful guided volley into the bottom corner.\n\nThis is the fourth time Scotland have qualified for the European Championship finals and for once they go in with a swagger. Mind you, they will need to. Their first match is against the host nation, Germany, in Munich. After that, they play Switzerland and then Hungary. Qualification for the knock-out stage is possible, but it will require a few heroics. It will be a first for Scotland if they do manage it: the three previous times they qualified, in 1992, 1996 and 2020, they never got out of their groups.\n\nEuro 2020 wasn't a happy experience: they lost to the Czech Republic and Croatia. The one bright(ish) moment came at Wembley where they frustrated England with a tigerish 0-0 draw. This is the kind of crumb that Scotland tend to live on in major tournaments. It's always just about to be the moment they make a real statement in the international game.\n\nBut Steve Clarke, Scotland's manager since May 2019, has built a defence every other country must respect - \"They are a team who defend brilliantly,\" Germany's manager Julian Nagelsmann has said - and McTominay's inspiration is capable of changing the course of any match. Scotland's tradition is disappointment garnished with beautiful but futile heroism. But maybe this time...\n\nIs Scotland's group the group of death?\n\nI don't subscribe to that idea. Sure, the first game is against Germany, but then we play the Swiss and the Hungarians and neither of them are better than us. We should respect them, but not fear them.\n\nHow do Scotland approach Germany?\n\nThere's a phrase we use in Scotland that means \"get into them\". That doesn't mean throwing caution and tactics to the wind, but if you're too negative, you're going to be disappointed. When I played for Scotland in Euro 1992 we also faced the Germans, who were then world champions. We wanted to get stuck into them, and I would say the same is true of the present squad.\n\nWho are Scotland's key players?\n\nScott McTominay, Andy Robertson and John McGinn. He's someone I have admired since his days at Hibs.\n\nWho are the dark horses?\n\nScotland! I was in Qatar for the World Cup in 2022 and who thought Morocco would go as far as they did? We've played a whole bunch of teams - like Spain - where we've been rank outsiders and given them a bloody nose. Steve Clarke has done a fantastic job.\n\nWho do you think will win the whole thing?\n\nEngland and France should make the finals, and I'd never write off Croatia or Spain.

Toni Kroos, Manuel Neuer, Antonio Rudiger and Ilkay Gundogan are all hugely experienced players who have competed at the highest level for several years.\n\nBut while so many of the faces are familiar, we know far less about their recent form given they have played so few competitive games in recent times. Bypassing qualifying by virtue of being hosts, Germany played 11 friendlies last year but won only three, losing six.\n\nFormer Bayern Munich and RB Leipzig coach Julian Nagelsmann, at 36 younger than the likes of Kroos and Neuer, took over in September and they are unbeaten since the turn of the year, a run that has included wins over France and the Netherlands - but the pressure has been off. At least until now.\n\n\"Now we're all getting kind of nervous, a little bit,\" Nagelsmann said on the eve of the tournament. \"I think it's normal, but it's good as well, because if you're kind of nervous, you'll be focused, on the first game especially.\"\n\nEngland do not get their campaign under way until Sunday, when they are due to face Serbia in Gelsenkirchen.\n\nBut there was good news for Gareth Southgate on Thursday as John Stones returned to training to mean there was a full compliment of players going through their paces in Blankhenhain.\n\nStones was withdrawn as a precaution during Friday's friendly defeat to Iceland after taking a blow to the ankle, and then missed Wednesday's training session with an unspecified illness.\n\nBut the versatile Manchester City defender now appears to be back up to full speed.", "source": {"uri": "breakingnews.ie", "dataType": "news", "title": "Breaking News.ie"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

I look forward to this moment, but I am nervous.\"\n\nThe population of Landsberg am Lech is just over 27,000. That's a lot of cows.\n\nCalmness inside the Allianz Arena will come in the form of Toni Kroos, the 34-year-old Real Madrid midfielder who Nagelsmann recently talked out of international retirement.\n\n\"Toni wanted to know how we were going to try to win. When we spoke about that, he was like, 'Let's rock'.\"\n\nStandard questions about Scotland invite the usual European managerial cliche of \"British style\" and euphemisms for the Scots being hackers. Not Nagelsmann.\n\n\"Scotland do not have many world stars but that is what makes them so dangerous. Lots of physicality, aggressiveness on the second ball, lots of crosses. They are not a kick and rush team. But they can do that.\n\n\"They have come a long way from balls up in the air. We will have more possession than Scotland, but when I look into my players' eyes, I know they are ready to win.\"\n\nScotland are expected to play patsy to Germany's second coming of Sommerm\u00e4rchen, but the Tartan Army numbers in the tens of thousands in Munich's central tributaries, plenty wearing embroidered kilts, many taking liberal libations of local hops.\n\n\"If feels as if most of the country are over here, which is crazy,\" said Andy Robertson, the Scottish captain.\n\n\"We've waited a long time for this game, years and years,\" added Robertson, who knows his history, this being their first major tournament for Scotland outside the UK since 1998. \"We know how quickly it can go by you, so it is important that we show up for the match.\n\n\"If we do that we can create a bit of history, but we know we have to be at our best, Germany are an exceptional team in front of their home fans. It does not get more difficult than that. There is no expectation from the outside world but we expect a lot from ourselves.\"\n\nA father and son over from Glasgow nestled into Viktualienmarkt in the old town to sample some stomach-swelling bratwurst. \"We cannae score, unless from midfielders,\" says the boy to nodding approval from dad and the travelling media.\n\nThis is a golden age for Scottish second-ballers arriving late into the box. Scott McTominay's seven goals in qualifying forced Erik Ten Hag to reimagine his Manchester United career while John McGinn has been Aston Villa's grittiest performer.\n\nMcGinn's quality puts him above McTominay and Celtic skipper Callum McGregor but together the trio will hunt down the stellar German midfield of \u0130lkay G\u00fcndo\u011fan and Kroos.\n\nThree years ago at the Euros, Billy Gilmour lit up Wembley against England. Now at Brighton, where his career has slowed, a late cameo is still expected from the 23-year-old.\n\n\"We think we can break them down and go and win the game,\" said Gilmour. \"Everyone doubts us sometimes - 'Typical Scotland' - and we need to get out of that kind of routine.\"\n\nBack in the old town, the father remembers the routine, and its glorious failure, like Archie Gemmill's wonder goal against the Netherlands in 1978 instantly followed by elimination from that World Cup on goal difference. Also-rans at the Euros is another part of this routine; as happened in 1992, Paul Gascoigne's goal in '96, and the best forgotten Hampden Park losses of 2021.\n\nBut the son only sees the possibility of McGinn and McTominay blotting this grey German summer.\n\n\"One of the mantras we have always had,\" said Scotland manager Steve Clarke \"is we respect everyone, fear no one.\"", "source": {"uri":

Toni Kroos, Manuel Neuer, Antonio Rudiger and Ilkay Gundogan are all hugely experienced players who have competed at the highest level for several years.\n\nBut while so many of the faces are familiar, we know far less about their recent form given they have played so few competitive games in recent times. Bypassing qualifying by virtue of being hosts, Germany played 11 friendlies last year but won only three, losing six.\n\nFormer Bayern Munich and RB Leipzig coach Julian Nagelsmann, at 36 younger than the likes of Kroos and Neuer, took over in September and they are unbeaten since the turn of the year, a run that has included wins over France and the Netherlands - but the pressure has been off. At least until now.\n\n\"Now we're all getting kind of nervous, a little bit,\" Nagelsmann said on the eve of the tournament. \"I think it's normal, but it's good as well, because if you're kind of nervous, you'll be focused, on the first game especially.\"\n\nEngland do not get their campaign under way until Sunday, when they are due to face Serbia in Gelsenkirchen.\n\nBut there was good news for Gareth Southgate on Thursday as John Stones returned to training to mean there was a full compliment of players going through their paces in Blankhenhain.\n\nStones was withdrawn as a precaution during Friday's friendly defeat to Iceland after taking a blow to the ankle, and then missed Wednesday's training session with an unspecified illness.\n\nBut the versatile Manchester City defender now

It's easy and will only take a moment.\n\nRyan Christie admits Scotland are chasing history at Euro 2024.\n\nThe Scots will open the tournament against host Germany tomorrow night, with the added personal prestige for Christie of it potentially being his 50th cap - which would put him on the Scotland roll of honour.\n\nIt would make the 29-year-old the first ever Inverness Caley Thistle academy graduate to reach that landmark, and would undoubtedly be a proud moment for both him and every football fan in the Highlands.\n\nOn the pitch, Steve Clarke's side will also have to deal with Switzerland and Hungary alongside Germany in their group, with the potential for whoever finishes third to progress into the round of 16.\n\nWith Scotland never having progressed past the first round in any major international tournament finals they have qualified for, that is a clear goal for Christie and his national team cohorts.\n\n\"I think we just want to do as well as possible,\" Christie explained.\n\n\"In the last Euros, we wanted to prove that we are a team that belonged there, and we wanted to make sure we weren't a one-tournament wonder.\n\n\"We wanted to do it campaign after campaign, so it's good that we've managed to get here again and now we can set our stall a little further ahead.\n\n\"You look at it and think 'can we make it out of the group?' We would be the first Scottish team to do that in history, but that's what we're chasing right now.\n\n\"Obviously it's going to be tough, because every team you face in the Euros will be a really hard match, but we will go into it with confidence and believing we can get good results.\"\n\nScotland will be backed by thousands of fans who have travelled over to Germany, and plenty more who will be watching from home.\n\nChristie has been keenly aware of the excitement around the country for this summer's tournament, and he is determined to help give those supporters something to celebrate over at least the next nine days.\n\n\"It will be amazing, I'm really looking forward to it,\" he said.\n\n\"It has been like there's a feeling across Scotland that everyone is getting ready to leave and head to Germany.\n\n\"Getting to see all the Scots over in Germany having the time of their lives is really exciting.\n\n\"It adds some pressure, but it's also inspiring. All of my friends and family are heading over, so it's amazing for them to get to experience it.\n\n\"When I was growing up, there weren't any opportunities for me to go to tournaments and support Scotland, so it's nice that they've got that and I'm sure they will love it.\n\n\"We put pressure on ourselves anyway because we want to represent the country as well as we can. We know it's a big tournament, but it would be even better if we can give the fans something to celebrate too.\"\n\nScotland's prospects may be boosted by the fact that it is their second European Championship in-a-row.\n\nLast time around, it was under very different circumstances. The Covid-19 pandemic meant that, even though matches were spread around the continent and Scotland played two of their group games at Hampden Park, there were still restrictions in place for supporters.\n\nOn the pitch though, Christie feels Scotland will be stronger this summer for those experiences three years ago, with the bulk of the squad remaining the same.\n\n\"Just it being our second Euros will help a lot,\" he added.\n\n\"It will be nice to know what to expect, and hopefully we can adapt to it a little bit better this time.\n\n\"Since that last Euros, the core of this group has been together so much and that definitely helps.\n\n\"We've been together so long that it definitely helps with our preparation, and dealing with expectations as a group.\"", "source": {"uri": "inverness-courier.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "Inverness Courier"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ryan_Christie", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Ryan Christie"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euro", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Euro"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scotland", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Scotland"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Scotland"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Germany", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Germany"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Germany"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inverness_Caledonian_Thistle_F.C.", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Inverness Caledonian Thistle F.C."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scottish_Highlands", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Scottish Highlands"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cap_(sport)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Cap (sport)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single-elimination_tournament", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Single-elimination tournament"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Association_football", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Association football"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hungary", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Hungary"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Hungary"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Switzerland", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Switzerland"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Switzerland"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/England_national_football_team", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "England national football team"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coronavirus", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Coronavirus"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UEFA_European_Championship", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "UEFA European Championship"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hampden_Park", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Hampden Park"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Paintball/Teams", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Paintball/Teams", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Golf/Tournaments_and_Events", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Golf/Tournaments and Events", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Tournaments", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Tournaments", "wgt": 18}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Tennis/Tournaments", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Tennis/Tournaments", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Volleyball/Tournaments", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Volleyball/Tournaments", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 89}], "image": "https://www.inverness-courier.co.uk/_media/img/UTAL1042EJXR63A9P8GR.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9648341", "eventUri": "eng-9648341", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.4352941176470588, "wgt": 130, "relevance": 1}

What's the worst that can happen? We join the list of Scotland teams who haven't got out of a group? We have so many incentives here, but becoming a legendary squad is the biggest. That's what has to drive us forward.\n\n\"The thought of being the first Scotland team to make a knockout round is our driving force. If we manage that? You just never know.\" Switzerland and Hungary complete Group A. Common consensus is that Scotland are in a three-team race for qualification with that duo.\n\n\"In the last Euros we played well in getting a draw at Wembley, but we let ourselves down a bit in the other two games,\" Robertson said. \"We know we could have done better. To qualify that last time was massive. To do it twice in a row is incredible. Now, we know we can make history.\n\n\"We've done the hard bit by qualifying. Now let's see what else we can do. We'll need to step things up from the warm-ups games, but when you look at results so will every other team in the tournament. Once we knew we were coming here our standards dropped a little; they shouldn't, but they did. But now it's time to get competitive again. It's time to show what we can do.\" Robertson has fond memories of the Munich Football Arena. He was part of the Liverpool team who defeated Bayern Munich 3-1 there in March 2019. Less than three months later, Liverpool were lifting the trophy.\n\n\"Last time I came here was a massive win,\" Robertson said. \"A lot of people had written us off after we draw 0-0 at Anfield, but we went in front of all those Bayern supporters and beat them 3-1. It was incredible to be part of and it's even more special that it took us on the journey to win the Champions League. It was such an important game.\n\n\"J\u00fcrgen Klopp texted me last week when I broke the record [for number of games captaining Scotland], which he didn't need to do and which was good of him. He just said congratulations. I know he'll be here and I know who he'll be supporting. I hope he enjoys his night, but not too much.\"\n\nSteve Clarke echoed Robertson's confidence when asked whether Scotland could pull off a shock against Germany. \"Absolutely,\" the manager said.\n\n\"That's why we're here.\n\n\"We feel as though we can get a good result every time we step on to the pitch. Otherwise, what's the point in going on there? We feel we're ready and hopefully you'll see that pan out. Everyone is fully fit, flying and desperate to be selected. They're ready to go.\" Clarke appears to have relished a normal tournament buildup after the strange backdrop to the last Euros. \"I think we should all be proud that we're here,\" be said. \"It's been a long time, since 1998, when we last travelled abroad for a major tournament. That's why the nation is so excited.\n\n\"The last championships was obviously Covid-affected but I'm proud we've managed to achieve back-to-back qualifications for the European championships. Hopefully by the end of these championships we're all proud that we've achieved a little bit more.\"", "source": {"uri": "irishexaminer.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Irish Examiner"}, "authors": [{"uri": "ewan_murray@irishexaminer.com", "name": "Ewan Murray", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scotland", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Scotland"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Scotland"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scotland_national_football_team", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Scotland national football team"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wembley_Stadium", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Wembley Stadium"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single-elimination_tournament", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Single-elimination tournament"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liverpool", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Liverpool"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Liverpool"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hungary", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Hungary"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Hungary"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Switzerland", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Switzerland"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Switzerland"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anfield", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Anfield"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FC_Bayern_Munich", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "FC Bayern Munich"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euro", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Euro"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Munich", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Munich"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Munich"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Germany"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steve_Clarke", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Steve Clarke"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/J\u00fcrgen_Klopp", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "J\u00fcrgen Klopp"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manager_(association_football)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Manager (association football)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UEFA_Champions_League", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "UEFA Champions League"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Germany", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Germany"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Germany"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Paintball/Teams", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Paintball/Teams", "wgt": 16}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Flying_Discs", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Flying Discs", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Flying_Discs/Ultimate_Frisbee", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Flying Discs/Ultimate Frisbee", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Business_Services/Supplies_and_Equipment", "label": "dmoz/Business/Business Services/Supplies and Equipment", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Multiplayer", "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Multiplayer", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 96}], "image": "https://www.irishexaminer.com/cms_media/module_img/8321/4160914_1_articlelarge_2.67386280.jpg.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9648341", "eventUri": "eng-9648341", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "date": "2019-03-", "textStart": 1351, "textEnd": 1361}], "sentiment": -0.003921568627450966, "wgt": 129, "relevance": 1}

After moving to Bavaria from Chelsea in 2019 for just \u00a3170,000 his value has skyrocketed, and the former England youth star will be among the first names on the team sheet due to his creativity and dribbling ability.\n\nForm guide: Middling\n\nSince Nagelsmann took over, Germany have only won half of their matches and lost to Turkey and Austria. Since those shock defeats though, they have secured notable wins over the Netherlands and France, as well as Greece.\n\nKEOWN'S VERDICT: Recent showings at Euros and World Cups have not lived up to expectations but Germany should top this group under Nagelsmann, the highly-rated tactician hopeful of inspiring the home nation to triumph.\n\nJamal Musiala played for England in his youth but Die Mannschaft have been lucky enough to win his talents at senior level\n\nScotland enjoying a romping qualifying campaign which featured starry performances from Man United's Scott McTominay (left)\n\nScotland\n\nWorld ranking: 39th\n\nEuro best: Group - 1992, 1996, 2020\n\nOdds: 150/1\n\nThe boss: Steve Clarke\n\nClarke learned the ropes as an assistant to Jose Mourinho at Chelsea and Gianfranco Zola at West Ham, and Scotland's fortunes have improved notably since his appointment in 2019.\n\nMain man: Andy Robertson\n\nThe Liverpool defender is the consummate modern full back: uncompromising in defence and dangerous in attack. A tough opponent and Scotland's key man on and off the pitch.\n\nRising star: Billy Gilmour\n\nThe 23-year-old Brighton midfielder has flourished since moving to the south coast from Chelsea and played 41 games for the Seagulls last season.\n\nForm guide: Poor\n\nEnded a seven-game winless run dating back to September with a 2-0 win over Gibraltar earlier this month. Denied an uplifting win at Hampden last Friday when Finland scored two late goals to draw 2-2.\n\nKEOWN'S VERDICT: Having pencilled my predictions into my Mail Sport wallchart I've got Scotland finishing third behind Germany and Switzerland, which Clarke will hope is enough to see them reach the knockout stages for the first time. You can guarantee the Tartan Army will give everything to make that happen.\n\nSwitzerland\n\nWorld ranking: 19th\n\nEuro best: Quarter-finals - 2020\n\nOdds: 66/1\n\nThe boss: Murat Yakin\n\nWith a long managerial CV including stints with Champions League regulars Spartak Moscow and Basle, Yakin led Switzerland to the last 16 of the World Cup in Qatar in 2022.\n\nMain man: Granit Xhaka\n\nThe former Arsenal midfielder's leadership was key to Bayer Leverkusen's domestic double in Germany. His tactical acumen and passing range will be vital if the Swiss are going to progress.\n\nGranit Xhaka has enjoyed a blistering season with domestic champions Bayer Leverkusen\n\nZeki Amdouni (foreground) has had less club success with Burnley but will hope to make a splash for his national team\n\nRising star: Zeki Amdouni\n\nThe Burnley man is an explosive winger who can drive with the ball at his feet and never neglects his defensive duties.\n\nForm guide: Patchy\n\nLost just once since Portugal thrashed them 6-1 to dump them out of the World Cup but they drew six out of eight before back-to-back wins against the Republic of Ireland and Estonia in March. Drew 1-1 with Austria in their final warm-up match.\n\nKEOWN'S VERDICT: Switzerland have got used to making it out of their Euros group, reaching the last 16 in 2016 and the quarter-finals in 2020, and I expect the same again here. They have talented players, including the tenacious Xhaka in midfield, and should be targeting second if Germany finish first as expected.\n\nHungary\n\nWorld ranking: 26th\n\nEuro best: Third - 1964\n\nOdds: 150/1\n\nThe boss: Marco Rossi\n\nSix years into the job and Rossi, 59, has helped put this proud football nation back on the map.\n\nMain man: Dominik Szoboszlai\n\nThe Liverpool midfielder made an instant impact in his debut season at Anfield, scoring seven goals in 45 games. His form tailed off a little towards the end of the season but he will be a key man for his country this summer.\n\nDominik Szokoszlai (right) was named Hungary's captain and scored his first goal with the armband in March 2023\n\nThe Magyars were enjoying a seamless unbeaten run before encountering Republic of Ireland\n\nRising star: Milos Kerkez\n\nThe 20-year-old left back made debut in 2022.

Comfortable back-to-back victories earlier this month against Andorra (5-0) and Northern Ireland (5-1) will have boosted the confidence among De la Fuente's side ahead of their first game on Saturday against Croatia.\n\nRead More Jose Mourinho, Jamie Carragher and other top pundits make their predictions ahead of Euro 2024\n\nKEOWN'S VERDICT: Spain won the Nations League last summer to secure their first international trophy since Euro 2012, when they thumped Italy 4-0 in the final with a glut of generational talents. Heading into this 2024 edition, at the heart of their team is Rodri, the 27-year-old Manchester City midfielder who hardly ever finds himself on the losing side. They should have enough to finish first in this group.\n\nCroatia\n\nWorld ranking: 10th\n\nEuro best: Quater-finals - 1996, 2008\n\nOdds: 40/1\n\nThe boss: Zlatko Dalic\n\nNow in his seventh year, Dalic has overseen some of the team's best days, including reaching the World Cup final in 2018. But with an ageing squad the pressure is on to see if the new generation keep up standards set by Luka Modric, Ivan Perisic and Co.\n\nMain man: Luka Modric\n\nEven at 38, Modric shows no signs of fading. He is now Real Madrid's most decorated player; this month's Champions League success represented his 26th trophy at the club. He will be tasked with leading Croatia one last time as they bid for a maiden international honour.\n\nCroatia head coach Zlatko Dalic helped the side reach the 2018 World Cup final in Russia\n\nLuke Modric is one of the tournament veterans but is still a reliable and impressive presence\n\nRising star: Josko Gvardiol\n\nThe defender has come into his own at Manchester City after his \u00a378million move last summer, settling comfortably into Pep Guardiola's system - even adding goals to his game, too.\n\nForm guide: Good\n\nLate losses to Wales and Turkey threatened to scupper their qualifying campaign but Croatia got over the line and are now unbeaten in six games, including an impressive 2-1 win against Portugal in Lisbon last weekend.\n\nKEOWN'S VERDICT: Midfield maestros Modric and Mateo Kovacic will look to use every ounce of their experience, and Croatia can never be discounted, having proven that they can embark on long runs at international tournaments.\n\nArgentine transplant Mateo Retegui (pictured) is coming into his own in the Italian side under Luciano Spalletti\n\nItaly\n\nWorld ranking: 9th\n\nEuro best: Winners 0 1968, 2020\n\nOdds: 14/1\n\nThe boss: Luciano Spalletti\n\nWith three decades' worth of managerial experience, Spalletti was well placed to take the reins after Roberto Mancini resigned last summer. The 65-year-old led Napoli to their first Serie A title since 1990 in the 2022-23 season.\n\nMain man: Nicolo Barella\n\nOne of those players who makes the game look easy. An energetic and experienced figure in midfield, the Inter man is always a threat to change a game.\n\nRising star: Mateo Retegui\n\nThe Argentine-born striker impressed for Genoa last season and scored two vital goals in qualifying for Italy.\n\nForm guide: Good\n\nA 0-0 draw with Ukraine was enough to seal automatic qualification on goal difference for the holders. Friendly victories over Venezuela and Ecuador and a draw with Turkey was followed before a narrow win over Bosnia in their last game before setting off for the Euros.\n\nFresh off winning the Scudetto with Inter, Nicolo Barella will look to be a force in Germany\n\nKEOWN'S VERDICT: Italy didn't qualify for the 2018 and 2022 World Cups but won Euro 2020 in between and, as proud defending champions, they will hope to repeat history under Mancini's replacement Spalletti. First, though, the Italians will need to navigate their way out of this tournament's most challenging group. I suspect they will manage it but they may struggle to stop Spain finishing ahead of them.\n\nAlbania\n\nWorld ranking: 66th\n\nEuro best: Group stage - 2016\n\nOdds: 500/1\n\nThe boss: Sylvinho\n\nFormer Arsenal and Barcelona star has limited coaching experience after brief spells with Lyon and Corinthians.\n\nMain man: Etrit Berisha\n\nThe 35-year-old goalkeeper and occasional penalty taker is likely entering his last dance.\n\nFormer Arsenal star Sylvinho has had a transformative impact in the dugout for Albania\n\nKristjan Asllani has impressed for Inter Milan and will look to shine at his nation's second-ever European Championship\n\nRising star: Kristjan Asllani\n\nThe midfielder, 22, has featured regularly for Inter Milan since joining two years ago.\n\nForm guide: Improving\n\nStopped the rot after four games without a win by beating Liechtenstein and Azerbaijan.\n\nKEOWN'S VERDICT: Underdogs. An achievement for them to even be here.\n\nGROUP CEnglandRead More Meet England's new leadership: The four stars tasked with being Southgate's generals\n\nWorld ranking: 4th\n\nEuro best: Runners-up - 2020\n\nOdds: 3/1\n\nThe boss: Gareth Southgate\n\nNow entering his fourth - and probably last - tournament, the pressure is on to deliver the silverware fans have been craving since 1966. Critics argue he is too cautious but his record stands up against every England manager since Sir Alf Ramsey.\n\nMain man: Jude Bellingham\n\nSpectacular debut season at Real Madrid saw the 20-year-old win the Champions League, La Liga and Player of the Season with 23 goals and 13 assists. He is central to England's hopes.\n\nAfter a meteoric season for Real Madrid, Jude Bellingham is England's biggest draw at just 21\n\nBut snapping at his heels is ultra-talented teenager Kobbie Mainoo, who is set to make his major tournament debut in\n\nGareth Southgate has made some tough calls with his squad selection - and time will tell if they were the right ones\n\nRising star: Kobbie Mainoo\n\nTeen enjoyed a brilliant season for Manchester United, becoming a mainstay and scoring in their FA Cup final win.\n\nForm guide: Uninspiring\n\nAfter qualifying for the Euros with ease, last week's win over Bosnia was England's first since they beat Malta 2-0 last year. The humbling by Iceland at Wembley was a grim reality check.\n\nKEOWN'S VERDICT: There is no doubt England have players capable of going to Germany and winning Euro 2024, especially in attack. A great deal will depend on whether Southgate can strike a successful balance between attack and providing enough protection for the defence. Here's hoping we are in that final in Berlin come July 14.\n\nSerbia\n\nWorld ranking: 33rd\n\nEuro best: First tournament as an independent Serbia\n\nOdds: 66/1\n\nThe boss: Dragan Stojkovic\n\nAfter learning the managerial ropes in Japan and China, he took Serbia to the Qatar World Cup but they were eliminated at the group stage.\n\nMain man: Aleksandar Mitrovic\n\nThe former Fulham striker is now playing in Saudi Arabia for Al Hilal, where he has more goal involvements (33) than appearances (28). Won the Saudi Pro League last season.\n\nAleksandar Mitrovic will be back to terrorise English defences after leaving the Premier League ahead of last season\n\nStrahinja Pavlovic (right) is Serbia's force at the back, and will look to hold England back on Sunday evening\n\nRising star: Strahinja Pavlovic\n\nThe 23-year-old defender has flourished since his 2022 move to Red Bull Salzburg after struggling for game time at his previous clubs.\n\nForm guide: Patchy\n\nA 1-0 win over Cyprus in March was Serbia's first since October. After losses to Belgium, Russia and Austria in their previous five games, Stojkovic's men signed off for the Euros with an impressive 3-0 win in Sweden last Saturday.\n\nKEOWN'S VERDICT: Serbia finished second in qualifying to Hungary, who beat them twice. Advancing to the knockout stages will be tricky. They will need to be defensively tight but also hope that Mitrovic and Juventus forward Dusan Vlahovic can break through the back lines of their opponents in this challenging group.\n\nDenmark\n\nWorld ranking: 21st\n\nEuro best: Winners - 1992\n\nOdds: 50/1\n\nThe boss: Kasper Hjulmand\n\nThe exclusion of Celtic's 19-goal midfielder Matt O'Riley from the squad turned heads. A poor Qatar World Cup saw the Danes finish bottom of the group, below Tunisia and Australia, managing just one point and one goal.\n\nMain man: Christian Eriksen\n\nInspiring to see Eriksen back at this level after his cardiac arrest at Euro 2020. His creative output has slowed but the Manchester United man will be pulling the strings in midfield.\n\nRising star: Rasmus Hojlund\n\nA difficult first season at United and the weight of a hefty price tag leaves the 21-year-old striker with plenty to prove.\n\nForm guide: Strong\n\nOne defeat in 12 games - a 2-0 loss to Northern Ireland after they had qualified - suggests Denmark are likely to be England's toughest test. Wins against Sweden and Norway last week boosted confidence further.\n\nChristian Eriksen (left) and Rasmus Hojlund (right) are Manchester United's Danish stalwarts\n\nKEOWN'S VERDICT: It is 32 years since Denmark stunningly won Euro 1992 and I suspect they will at least qualify from this group - behind England, of course! They have recognisable talents throughout their team, from Eriksen to Pierre-Emile Hojbjerg to Hojlund, and would love a repeat of their semi-final run in 2020 when they lost to England.\n\nSlovenia\n\nWorld ranking: 57th\n\nEuro best: Group stage - 2000\n\nOdds: 200/1\n\nThe boss: Matjaz Kek\n\nNow in his second stint after guiding Slovenia to the 2010 World Cup where they were beaten by Fabio Capello's England in the group stages.\n\nMain man: Jan Oblak\n\nLong-serving captain has had another impressive season at Atletico Madrid, keeping 13 clean sheets.\n\nRising star: Benjamin Sesko\n\nThe 21-year-old striker has caught the eye of Europe's big clubs after a fruitful first year at RB Leipzig in which he scored 14 goals in 31 league games. Signed a contract extension this week.\n\nJan Oblak is Slovenia's long-serving captain and will look to add tournament nous to his side\n\nBut up-and-comer Benjamin Sesko is far more likely to catch the eye, particularly after snubbing Premier League interest this week\n\nForm guide: Impressive\n\nOne defeat in 12 - against Denmark last November - suggests they will be no pushovers.\n\nKEOWN'S VERDICT: Slovenia will rely heavily on goalkeeper and captain Oblak, their Footballer of the Year, to shine if they are to get out of this group.\n\nGROUP DFrance\n\nWorld ranking: 2nd\n\nEuro best: Winners - 1984, 2000\n\nThe boss: Didier Deschamps\n\nRead More England's Euro 2024 rivals who will smell blood after Three Lions' defeat by Iceland\n\nLed France to World Cup glory -- as a player and manager -- but the Euros title has so far eluded him, having lost as hosts to Portugal in the 2016 final.\n\nMain man: Kylian Mbappe\n\nThe bookies' favourite to win the Golden Boot has just joined Real Madrid from Paris Saint-Germain. Mbappe, 25, is already France's third top goal scorer with 47, behind Olivier Giroud and Thierry Henry.\n\nRising star: Warren Zaire-Emery\n\nThe 18-year-old PSG star scored on his France debut, a 14-0 demolition of Gibraltar. He scored three goals and provided seven asissts in 43 appearances from central midfield last season.\n\nKylian Mbappe (left) is Didier Deschamps' (right) talisman and squad captain in Germany\n\nFrance will look to improve upon their disappointing exit three years ago against Switzerland\n\nWarren Zaire-Emery is one of a number of promising young players Les Bleus will rely on\n\nForm guide: Strong\n\nLes Bleus have lost twice to Germany in friendlies since September, but Greece (in a qualifying dead rubber) are the only other team to deny them victory since the 2022 World Cup final defeat by Argentina.\n\nKEOWN'S VERDICT: As finalists in three of the last four tournaments -- the outlier being Euro 2020 when they lost on penalties to Switzerland in the last 16 -- France will hope to go all the way. My predictions have them clashing with England in the semi-finals and that is where their stay in Germany will end... we hope!\n\nThe Netherlands\n\nWorld ranking: 7th\n\nEuro best: Winners - 1988\n\nOdds: 18/1\n\nThe boss: Ronald Koeman\n\nThe 61-year-old has returned to the Dutch dugout after a brief hiatus to manage Barcelona, with his defensive approach suiting the wealth of back-line talent in the Netherlands squad.\n\nMain man: Virgil van Dijk\n\nNow 32 but still at the top of his game, the Liverpool captain is among the world's best central defenders. He will be crucial at the back as his side attempt to keep group heavyweights France - Kylian Mbappe et al - quiet in Leipzig on June 21.\n\nRising star: Xavi Simons\n\nThe Leipzig forward, 21, had a standout campaign in Germany on loan from PSG, racking up eight goals and 13 assists in 32 appearances as his side finished fourth in the Bundesliga.\n\nForm guide: Good\n\nSix wins in their last seven games will have built confidence ahead of the Euros, including 4-0 victories over Canada and Iceland in their warm-up games.\n\nKEOWN'S VERDICT: The Netherlands boast a mature team packed with experienced players, not least Van Dijk at the heart of their three-man defence. Even someone as supreme as Van Dijk will be tested to his limit by Mbappe and my predictions have them finishing second to France as they chase their first Euros title since 1988.\n\nPoland\n\nWorld ranking: 28th\n\nEuro best: Quarter-finals - 2016\n\nOdds: 150/1\n\nThe boss: Michal Probierz\n\nPoland are unbeaten in eight matches since Probierz took over in September 2023. His three-at-the-back system has transformed the team's fortunes.\n\nA major concern for Poland will be the fitness of their squad standout Robert Lewandowski\n\nMain man: Robert Lewandowski\n\nAlmost 20 years on from his pro debut, the 35-year-old will be playing in his sixth major tournament. He is his nation's top scorer with 82 goals and netted 26 times for Barcelona last season - but will miss their opener against the Netherlands with a hamstring injury.\n\nRising star: Kacper Urbanski\n\nThe 19-year-old attacking midfielder was a regular in the Bologna side who finished fifth in Serie A last season. He only made his senior debut for Poland last week and provided an assist.\n\nForm guide: Fair\n\nScraped into the tournament by beating Wales on penalties in the play-offs, but are hitting form at the right time having not lost in eight games.\n\nKEOWN'S VERDICT: Poland scored all five of their penalties to ensure they made it to these Euros instead of Wales, with Lewandowski setting the tone with the first spot-kick. Lewandowski will be relying on the hugely talented Piotr Zielinski creating chances for him to help Poland score their way out of this group.\n\nAustria\n\nWorld ranking: 25th\n\nEuro best: Last 16 - 2020\n\nOdds: 80/1\n\nThe boss: Ralf Rangnick\n\nRemember him? The German led Manchester United to their lowest Premier League points total (58) in 2021-22 but has managed 14 wins from his 23 games in charge of Austria.\n\nAfter departing Manchester, Ralf Rangnick has overhauled Austria in eye-catching fashion\n\nLeopold Querfeld (centre) is the youngest member of the squad and an improving talent\n\nMain man: Marcel Sabitzer\n\nEnjoyed a resurgence at Borussia Dortmund last season after an underwhelming loan spell at Manchester United.\n\nRising star: Leopold Querfeld\n\nThe 20-year-old centre back is the youngest member of the squad. Scored three goals in his first full season at Rapid Vienna.\n\nForm guide: Excellent\n\nOne defeat in 16 (a 3-2 loss to Belgium) suggests they should not be underestimated.\n\nKEOWN'S VERDICT: Austria could provide a shock with their high press under former United boss Rangnick. If that does not pay dividends, they are likely to finish fourth in this group.\n\nGROUP EBelgium\n\nWorld ranking: 3rd\n\nEuro best: Runners-up - 1980\n\nOdds: 20/1\n\nThe boss: Domenico Tedesco\n\nAppointed immediately after Belgium's group-stage exit from the World Cup, the Italian has yet to taste defeat as Red Devils boss. Won the German Cup with RB Leipzig in 2022.\n\nBelgium is a squad somewhat in transition but members of their Golden Generation - such as Kevin De Bruyne (centre) and Romelu Lukaku (right) - are still present\n\nArthur Vermeeren has struggled for minutes at Atletico but dazzles on national team duty\n\nMain man: Kevin De Bruyne\n\nThe midfield mastermind behind Manchester City's years of dominance, De Bruyne's experience will be key to developing Belgium's youngsters following the retirement of many of their golden generation.\n\nRising star: Arthur Vermeeren\n\nA young midfielder who has shown bags of potential in limited game-time at Atletico Madrid. The four-time capped 19-year-old has a particular point to prove at this tournament as he looks to show he deserves more minutes at club level.\n\nForm guide: Good\n\nBelgium are unbeaten in 14 games since the World Cup. They drew both friendlies against Republic of Ireland and England in March before back-to-back wins against Montenegro and Luxembourg in their warm-up friendlies.\n\nKEOWN'S VERDICT: Belgium have started to lose some of the stars from their 'Golden Generation' so with that fading tag, maybe the pressure on Tedesco's side is easing. They still have some stellar names in their attack - it will be interesting to see how successfully De Bruyne can link up with Romelu Lukaku - but I worry for them defensively.\n\nUkraine\n\nWorld ranking: 22nd\n\nEuro best: Quarter-finals - 2020\n\nOdds: 100/1\n\nThe boss: Serhiy Rebrov\n\nThe former Tottenham forward took over the national side after two stints managing in the Middle East and a trophy-laden spell with Dynamo Kyiv.\n\nUkraine head coach Serhiy Rebrov has had to navigate his duties against the backdrop of war\n\nChelsea winger Mykhailo Mudryk is gearing up to rise to the occasion after an uneven season\n\nMain man: Oleksandr Zinchenko\n\nWas a key player in his first season for Arsenal after moving away from Manchester City, where he won four Premier League winner's medals and four Carabao Cups in five seasons.\n\nRising star: Mykhailo Mudryk\n\nBecame a household name when he moved to Chelsea for \u00a388million in January last year. Mudryk's superb technique and blink-and-you-miss-him pace make him a dangerous presence in Ukraine's attack.\n\nForm guide: Good\n\nDefeat by Poland last week was their first since September and came just days after an admirable draw in Germany. Beat Moldova 4-0 on Tuesday.\n\nKEOWN'S VERDICT: With last season's La Liga top scorer Artem Dovbyk up front, Ukraine should fancy their chances of escaping this group behind Belgium. They did not make life easy for England or Italy in qualifying, before relying on Mudryk's late winner against Iceland to reach this tournament. It is commendable, given what is going on in their country, that they are here at all.\n\nSlovakia\n\nWorld ranking: 48th\n\nEuro best: Last 16 - 2016\n\nOdds: 500/1\n\nThe boss: Francesco Calzona\n\nThe Italian is a multitasker, splitting his time in the last few months of the season by juggling the Slovakia job with a temporary head coach role at Napoli.\n\nParis Saint-Germain's Milan Skriniar is one of Slovakia's most-capped players and a defensive heavyweight\n\nMain man: Milan Skriniar\n\nWith 68 caps to his name, 29-year-old Skriniar is a rock at the back for both Slovakia and his club, Paris Saint-Germain, where he has just won the league and cup double.\n\nRising star: Leo Sauer\n\nThe 18-year-old winger has made a strong impression at Feyenoord with his quick feet, direct dribbling and ability to create chances. Sauer became the youngest player to represent Slovakia when he made his debut off the bench against Norway in March.\n\nForm guide: Impressive\n\nThree defeats in 17 games and just one - a friendly at home to Austria - in their last six. Calzona's side warmed up for the Euros with 4-0 wins over San Marino and Wales.\n\nKEOWN'S VERDICT: Slovakia are one of the hopefuls looking to secure second position behind Belgium, but my predictions have them finishing fourth. They rely heavily on their midfield trio of Stanislav Lobotka, Ondrej Duda and Juraj Kucka and may struggle from their first match against Belgium.\n\nRomania\n\nWorld ranking: 46th\n\nEuro best: Quarter-finals - 2000\n\nOdds: 200/1\n\nThe boss: Edward Iordanescu\n\nModest playing career and not much of a managerial CV.\n\nTottenham's Radu Dragusin joined the Premier League side in January from Serie A's Genoa\n\nMain man: Nicolae Stanciu\n\nMost capped player and top scorer in the squad.\n\nRising star: Radu Dragusin\n\nNo-nonsense centre back signed for Tottenham in January.\n\nForm guide: Decent\n\nUnbeaten in a weak qualifying group and warmed up with goalless draws against Bulgaria and Liechtenstein.\n\nKEOWN'S VERDICT: Romania have won only one match at the Euros - a 3-2 victory over England in 2000 - and need to improve that record to stand a chance here.\n\nGROUP FPortugal\n\nWorld ranking: 6th\n\nEuro best: Winners - 2016\n\nOdds: 15/1\n\nThe boss: Roberto Martinez\n\nHanded another high-profile job despite failing to lead Belgium out of their group at the World Cup. Has won every competitive match since his appointment in January 2023.\n\nMain man: Cristiano Ronaldo\n\nProbably his last dance at a tournament and the 39-year-old will want to sign off his top-level career with a bang now he plays his club football in the Saudi Pro League at Al Nassr.\n\nCristiano Ronaldo (pictured centre) is still the man for the big occasion on duty for Portugal\n\nBut 21-year-old Francisco Conceicao is proving that the side has longevity in attacking options\n\nRising star: Francisco Conceicao\n\nThe 21-year-old winger has established himself as a first-team regular since joining Porto from Ajax. The son of Portugal great Sergio Conceicao scored eight goals last season.\n\nForm guide: Good\n\nWon all 10 of their qualifying matches but defeats by Slovenia and Croatia have tempered expectations. Beat Ireland 3-0 in their final friendly on Tuesday.\n\nKEOWN'S VERDICT: Portugal have a real chance of triumphing in Germany under Martinez. They were the only team to qualify for these Euros with a perfect record - 10 wins in which they scored 36 goals and conceded only twice. Ronaldo could yet collect another European Championship medal and will have plenty of talent around him, from Rafael Leao and Bruno Fernandes to Bernardo Silva.\n\nCzech Republic\n\nWorld ranking: 36th\n\nEuro best: Runners-up - 1996\n\nOdds: 100/1\n\nThe boss: Ivan Hasek\n\nManager with 25 years' experience who was president of the Czech FA from 2009 to 2011. A month after taking the role, he appointed himself head coach, then resigned after four months! Returned early this year.\n\nMain man: Patrik Schick\n\nThe Bayer Leverkusen striker played an important part in his club's historic domestic double and 51-game unbeaten run, scoring 13 goals in 33 appearances. He has 19 goals in 38 games for his country.\n\nRising star: Adam Hlozek\n\nAnother Leverkusen striker, who already has 32 caps aged 21. He made the most of limited minutes last season with seven goals for Xabi Alonso's side.\n\nForm guide: Unconvincing\n\nFinished second to Albania in their qualifying group, ahead of Poland. Hasek's side beat North Macedonia in their final warm-up game on Monday with a stoppage-time penalty, having thrashed Malta 7-1 last week.\n\nPatrik Schick blazed a trail at the last Euros and is coming off the back of a terrific season with Bayer Leverkusen\n\nKEOWN'S VERDICT: The Czech Republic made hard work of qualifying but they are tough to beat, losing only one of their last 14 matches. If the Czechs finish second, as I have predicted here, that would leave them the daunting task of facing the winner of Group D, which will probably be fancied France.\n\nTurkey\n\nWorld ranking: 40th\n\nEuro best: Semi-finals - 2008\n\nOdds: 66/1\n\nThe boss: Vincenzo Montella\n\nThe former Roma striker's only managerial silverware came eight years ago when he won the Italian Super Cup with AC Milan. He has done well to ensure a third consecutive Euros qualification for Turkey.\n\nMain man: Hakan Calhanoglu\n\nThe 30-year-old starred for Inter Milan last season with 15 goals and three assists from central midfield. Turkey's captain will be key to their chances.\n\nInter Milan Hakan Calhanoglu is Turkey's standout player and will command from the midfield\n\nThere are high hopes Real Madrid youngster Arda Guler (centre) can show off his myriad skills\n\nRising star: Arda Guler\n\nMade a \u00a317million move to Real Madrid from Fenerbahce last summer aged just 18 and, although his first season there was disrupted by injury, the attacking midfielder showed signs of brilliance, netting six times in 12 appearances.\n\nForm guide: Poor\n\nWinless in five games since beating Germany 3-2 in November. They did hold Italy to a 0-0 draw in earlier this month but were beaten 2-1 by Poland on Monday.\n\nKEOWN'S VERDICT: The last time Turkey got out of a Euros group was in 2008, when they went all the way to the semi-finals. But they have failed to win any of their last four friendlies in preparation for this tournament, including a 6-1 loss to Austria in March. They will hope Guler, the 19-year-old Real Madrid prospect, can help them pose a threat.\n\nGeorgia\n\nWorld ranking: 75th\n\nEuro best: Tournament debut\n\nOdds: 250/1\n\nThe boss: Willy Sagnol\n\nFormer France right back who won the Champions League with Bayern Munich as a player in 2001. Out of work for four years before he took the Georgia job in February 2021.\n\nMain man: Khvicha Kvaratskhelia\n\nThe 23-year-old Napoli winger's electric pace and quick feet mean he is drawing interest from Europe's biggest clubs.\n\nLed by Napoli's Khvicha Kvaratskhelia, Georgia have made it to their first major tournament\n\nRising star: Gabriel Sigua\n\nThe 18-year-old has impressed at Swiss side Basle, showing his versatility by playing every position in midfield and attack.\n\nForm guide: Fair\n\nOne defeat in seven games (a 3-1 loss in Spain) suggests they will be no pushovers.\n\nKEOWN'S VERDICT: Georgia are entering their first major tournament. Others will see them as cannon fodder but they will no doubt see this as a chance to prove everyone wrong.", "source": {"uri": "dailymail.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "Daily Mail Online"},

This summer's hosts have struggled at major tournaments since winning the World Cup a decade ago, but there's scope for them to dazzle in front of a home crowd this summer.\n\n2023 was a wretched year for the German national team in the wake of their early World Cup elimination in Qatar. Die Mannschaft recorded defeats to Colombia, Poland, Japan, Turkey and Austria within a six-month period, with supporters fearing the worst ahead of a home Euros.\n\nHowever, 2023/24 was a bright season for German football. Bayer Leverkusen emerged as the standout team on the continent as they finally dethroned Bayern Munich following a decade of subjugation, while Borussia Dortmund's Champions League run despite a fifth-place Bundesliga finish depicted the division's strength in depth.\n\nWith an emerging generation coming to the fore, there's a sense of the hosts entering the tournament with plenty of momentum behind them.\n\nHere's 90min's guide to Germany heading into Euro 2024.\n\nJulian Nagelsmann selected a 27-man provisional squad which was then whittled down to 26 for the tournament, dropping fourth-choice goalkeeper Alexander Nubel.\n\nThere were a couple of notable omissions, with Bayern Munich's Leon Goretzka and Borussia Dortmund's Mats Hummels missing out. Goretzka perhaps isn't the player he was during Bayern's dominant 2019/20 campaign but remains a prominent figure in Munich and his absence was seen as a surprise.\n\nThe same goes for Hummels, who many expected would return to the international fold this summer off the back of a vintage season. The centre-back played a pivotal role in Dortmund's Champions League success. With Hummels out, Antonio Rudiger is set to be partnered by either Bayer Leverkusen's Jonathan Tah or Dortmund's Nico Schlotterbeck.\n\nGermany faced Ukraine and Greece in two pre-tournament friendlies at the start of June, picking up a draw and a victory.\n\nJulian Nagelsmann is regarded as one of the shrewdest tacticians around and the German manager is attempting to instil a club-like system with the German national team.\n\nFollowing some initial teething problems, Germany's victories over France and the Netherlands offered sources of vindication.\n\nHis principles focus on possession. Nagelsmann wants his team to control games with the ball, build efficiently and win it back rapidly. The German coach has previously been revered for his pressing structures and the emphasis he places on counter-pressing. Installing a cohesive press is tough at international level given the reduced time the manager has with his group of players, but Germany have shown signs of evolving into a coherent team without the ball having struggled throughout 2023.\n\nIn possession, Nagelsmann encourages attacking fluidity via rotations, with his introduction of a 4-2-3-1 allowing Germany's playmakers to operate in close proximity. Width can be supplied from full-back, with Nagelsmann wanting the likes of Jamal Musiala and Florian Wirtz to receive the ball between the lines as much as possible.\n\nTheir shape in possession can resemble the 3-2-5 or 2-3-5 commonly seen at club level. Overall, Nagelsmann's Germany are fast, dynamic and ever-improving. The return of Toni Kroos aids them immensely in terms of control and their evolution without the ball has seen them produce sturdier defensive showings ahead of the tournament.\n\nAs the hosts, Germany were placed into Group A and are favourites to top an evenly-contested set of teams.\n\nSwitzerland are perennial major tournament contestants and very rarely fail to make it into the knockout stages. Their last group-stage exit came at the 2010 World Cup.\n\nHungary were very impressive in qualifying and, led by Liverpool's Dominik Szoboszlai, could emerge as one of the dark horses this summer as an aggressive and defensively stout outfit. They faced Germany at Euro 2020, earning a 2-2 draw, and have improved since their previous appearance.\n\nScotland are regarded as the outsiders in Group A, but their victory over Spain in qualifying showed they can not only compete with the best but beat them, too. Germany must be wary of Steve Clarke's side when they face off in the tournament opener on 14 June.\n\nIf Germany meet expectations and win Group A, they'll face the runner-up of Group C in the round of 16. England are likely to top that group, with second place well up for grabs.\n\nGermany could face Serbia, Slovenia or Denmark in the last 16 and potentially take on the Group B winner in the quarters. Spain, Italy and Croatia will fight it out for top spot in that group.\n\nShould they follow the group-winning path, Nagelsmann's side could face Portugal in the semi-finals.\n\nHowever, a second-place finish would see them take on the runners-up of Group B. That's likely to be Spain, Italy or Croatia. That's a route Germany will be keen to avoid, especially given France and England will probably be on that side of the draw.\n\nToni Kroos' impact was felt during Germany's March friendlies and the superstar midfielder has a huge role to play for Nagelsmann this summer. His ability to provide control should counter-balance Nagelsmann's verticality and ensure Germany aren't constantly playing in back-and-forth contests.\n\nIlkay Gundogan also has a key role to play in this regard. The Barcelona star could perform a handful of roles this summer, but he'll likely drop deep and operate closer to Kroos and crash the box when necessary.\n\nThese two will be aiming to serve Germany's two potential standouts at Euro 2024, Florian Wirtz and Jamal Musiala. The two young playmakers have been around the national team set-up for quite some time and this feels like their time to come to the fore. While Musiala had an up-and-down season with Bayern, Wirtz inspired Bayer Leverkusen to an unbeaten domestic season.\n\nNagelsmann's in-possession structure revolves around these two majestic creators, although Leroy Sane is a game-breaking talent who simply can't be ignored.\n\nGermany's Euro 2024 squad has a largely familiar feel, although there are a few young stars who could enjoy breakout tournaments this summer.\n\nLeft-back is an area of contention for Nagelsmann and Stuttgart's Max Mittelstadt could fill the void. The 27-year-old perhaps doesn't fit the 'young' brief, but he's nonetheless new to the international stage. Mittelstadt has just two caps for the national team, with his performances in March highlighting his potential to thrive in Nagelsmann's set-up. The defender scored in Germany's 2-1 win over the Netherlands.\n\nIn attack, Kai Havertz's impressive end to the Premier League season means he's the favourite to start as Nagelsmann's number 9 this summer, but Hoffenheim's Maximilian Beier also enjoyed a stellar domestic season and is poised to be an option for the Germany boss. Beier's a savvy operator with Raumdeuter-like qualities. He ended 2023/24 with 16 Bundesliga goals.\n\nGermany once enjoyed perpetual success at major tournaments but they've been starved of success for the past decade. A home Euros increases expectation and pressure, but Germany's momentum heading into the tournament suggests they should enjoy an exciting summer.\n\nPlus, is Toni Kroos really going to go out with a whimper? No chance.\n\nGermany should top a competitive Group A and progress deep into this summer's tournament. They should at least match their performance at the 2006 World Cup, which they hosted, by reaching the semi-finals. Victory of their group should leave them on the 'easier' side of the draw.\n\nAnything can happen if they make the last four and the Germans cannot be written off on home soil this summer - even if there are doubts over who'll be scoring the goals.", "source": {"uri": "90min.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "90min.com"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

But will the Germans once again defy the odds at a major tournament and deny favourites England their first major title in 58 years?\n\nDespite not having to qualify for the Euros, Germany's path to the finals has been tumultuous. 2023 was particularly challenging, with defeats against Belgium, Poland and Colombia compounded by the team's openness and lack of defensive shape.\n\nA harrowing 4-1 loss to Japan in Wolfsburg in September ultimately saw head coach Hansi Flick dismissed. Incredibly, he became the first manager to be sacked by Germany since the role was created in 1926, with former Bayern boss Nagelsmann stepping in to fill the void.\n\nHowever, he also suffered early losses against Turkey and Ralf Rangnick's energetic Austria side. The good news is that the latter defeat may have been the nadir for this German outfit, as they lost 2-0 in a match that saw forward Kai Havertz inexplicably start at left wing-back.\n\nNagelsmann has certainly gone back to basics since, reverting to a fluid 4-2-3-1 formation and eradicating much of the tactical confusion and lack of defensive structure that defined Flick's reign. This adjustment has seen Havertz return to lead the line, with Germany having beaten France and the Netherlands of late while going unbeaten in four matches through 2024.\n\nFor anyone betting on Euro 2024, Germany's outright odds have certainly shortened as their form has improved. They now have a 12.4% chance of winning the tournament too, behind favourites England (19.9%) and 2018 world champions France (19.1%).\n\nSpain is the next most likely winner, with Luis de la Fuente's team afforded a 9.6% probability of winning Euro 2024. The Germans have also been given a 58.4% chance of reaching the quarter-finals, and a 36.5% probability of progressing to the last four.\n\nGermany has a good chance of topping Group A (ahead of Scotland, Hungary, and Switzerland). However, this remains one of the more challenging groups, with Germany, Switzerland, and Hungary placed 16th, 19th and 26th in FIFA's latest rankings. The Scots are ranked 39th at the time of writing.\n\nIf Germany do top Group A as expected, the round of 16 will see them face off against the runners-up from Group C. Opta's statistics suggest that their most likely opponents will be Denmark or Serbia, with the match scheduled for June 29th at the Westfalenstadion.\n\nNagelsmann's men will be the bookmakers' favourites to win there, setting up a potential last eight clash against Spain in Stuttgart. Other possible opponents include Group B competitors Italy and Croatia, or the Austrian side that defeated Germany 2-0 last November.\n\nWhen you consider implied probability values, either Portugal or the Netherlands could await in Munich in the semi-finals. Another victory here could pit Germany against either England or France in a mouth-watering final at Berlin's Olympiastadion on July 14th, although the hosts would probably start this encounter as the underdogs.\n\nOpta have revealed that Germany have a 22.4% probability of reaching the final. They've certainly been afforded a competitive advantage by the structure of the draw, which has put them in the opposing half to both England and France.\n\nThere's no doubt that Germany boast one of the best and most talented Euro 2024 squads. This is despite the non-selection of Mats Hummels, Emre Can, Julian Brandt and Karim Adeyemi, each of whom started Borussia Dortmund's recent Champions League final defeat to Real Madrid.\n\nGermany's defence depth and quality also looks much improved when compared to recent tournaments. The powerful Antonio Rudiger is likely to lead and organise the defensive unit, having excelled for Real Madrid in 2023/24.\n\nBayer Leverkusen's Jonathan Tah also played a key role in his side's historic Bundesliga title win last season, while the towering Nico Schlotterbeck marshalled Dortmund's historic defensive efforts against PSG in the UCL.\n\nNagelsmann has also repaired Germany's broken midfield dynamic, with the returning Toni Kroos offering experience and metronomic passing alongside Leverkusen's tenacious Robert Andrich. This has allowed Joshua Kimmich to revert to full back, where his ability to invert affords Germany greater tactical flexibility when in possession.\n\nNagelsmann is also spoilt for choice in the attacking third. His reversion to a fluid 4-2-3-1 shape has certainly enabled him to get the best out of the precocious Jamal Musiala and playmaker Florian Wirtz, with \u0130lkay G\u00fcndo\u011fan operating primarily in the number 10 role. Kai Havertz will lead the line and offers exceptional movement, while striker Niclas F\u00fcllkrug provides a more physically imposing alternative as and when required.\n\nDespite a turbulent start to his Germany tenure, Nagelsmann has created a well-balanced German outfit that's in good form ahead of the Euro 2024 finals.\n\nHe has undoubtedly introduced a greater sense of purpose and tactical clarity, while establishing a system that optimises talents such as G\u00fcndo\u011fan, Havertz, Wirtz and Kimmich.\n\nGermany's squad is also one of the strongest at the tournament, with depth and experience in every single position. A positive start for Die Mannschaft will considerably create momentum and home support too, so the stars appear to be aligning for a positive campaign in front of their own fans.\n\nWe certainly expect Germany to make the quarter-finals, while it would be far from surprising if they met France or England in the tournament's show-piece final in Berlin. One thing is for sure: they have more than enough talent to win Euro 2024 and become the outright most successful nation in the competition's history.", "source": {"uri": "ca.sports.yahoo.com",

I feel the same as the rest of the boys. I feel immensely proud and very excited as well.\"\n\nRobertson is wary of the threat of the host nation - three time winners and four-time World Cup winners - but said his side are capable of shocking the world.\n\n\"It's important we show up to our maximum and if we do that we can create a bit of history,\" he said.\n\n\"Tomorrow night we are playing a team full of quality, in front of their home fans, but it's a challenge we're excited for.\n\n\"We expect a lot from ourselves and hopefully we can do that on the pitch.\"\n\nWith up to 1000,000 Scots expected in Germany for the opening week, Robertson added: \"We know there's a lot of fans over here and we hope to make them proud. We know not all of them can get in the stadium, we wish they could, it would help us out.\n\n\"We can't do it without the support and we hope they enjoy themselves. Hopefully we can give them something to shout about and they can stay in Germany a little bit longer.\"\n\nScotland have qualified for successive European Championships but have still never reached the knockouts at a major tournament, something which Robertson wants to put right.\n\nHe said: \"The first Euros was massive for us, now we want to compete. Last time we felt in the England game (a 0-0 draw at Wembley in Group D) we did pretty well but let ourselves down in the others.\n\n\"We don't want to have any regrets this time. What's the worst that can happen? We go into a long list of teams that haven't made it out the group or we put ourselves in a good position to be a team to make history.\n\n\"We're excited by the challenge, we're excited about what's ahead and if we perform the way I know we can perform then I'm confident we can make history.\"\n\nThough they qualified in some style, Scotland have won only once in their last nine games, a 2-0 slog against Gibraltar in their penultimate warm-up game last week.\n\nRobertson admitted: \"When you look at results up and down the board, I think every team will need to step up.\n\n\"You can't recreate competitive football. After we qualified we probably took a little bit of a drop which shouldn't happen but it did.\n\n\"But now we're ready, you get no bigger stage than this. Tomorrow night all eyes will be on us against Germany and it's time to show what we can do.\n\n\"Of course we need to step it up but all nations are in the exact same boat.\"\n\nRobertson admitted losing main forward Lyndon Dykes to injury on the eve of the tournament had dealt the squad a blow but revealed the QPR frontman will remain with the group in Germany, adding: \"It's great to have him here. The day he got his injury was difficult for the whole squad.\n\n\"But now that he's here as a fan, as a staff member probably, it's great. He's very important off the pitch as well because not many could have done that with the emotions he's gone through in the last few weeks.\n\n\"We'd love him to be on the pitch but unfortunately that wasn't possible. He'll be a big factor for us and hopefully he can stay with us the whole time.\"\n\nRobertson revealed he has also shrugged off a nagging injury sustained on Liverpool duty, saying he feels: \"Physically good, mentally good, looking forward to what's ahead. I had an ankle injury from March and I've been nursing it a little bit from then on.\n\n\"It's all good now, we were pretty relaxed about the whole situation but I'm all good to go.

Kick-off time, channel and how to watch Euro 2024 opener", "body": "Euro 2024 has finally arrived and Germany from tomorrow play hosts to the continent, opening up the month-long event with a Group A clash against Scotland.\n\nConfidence has been building among the Germans that they are peaking at the right time after a turbulent period under Julian Nagelsmann, with some key players looking in strong form and the return of Toni Kroos boosting their elite quality in the ranks.\n\nAs for the Scots, Steve Clarke has had to overcome a number of setbacks but being at the tournament is already a big sign of progress - and with three potentially getting through to the knockouts from the four-nation group stage, the head coach will know it's not necessarily all about tonight's result.\n\nEven so, they'll want to show they are ready to take on the best and cause an upset, with the eyes of the world on Munich on day one.\n\nHere's everything you need to know ahead of the match.\n\nWhen is Germany vs Scotland?\n\nThe opening match of Euro 2024 kicks off at 8pm BST on Friday 14 June 2024.\n\nHow can I watch it?\n\nThis match will be shown on ITV and streamed via ITV X. Every match at Euro 2024 is free-to-air on BBC or ITV in the UK. You can find a full list of which channel is showing each match here.\n\nIf you're travelling abroad and want to watch major sporting events, you might need a VPN to unblock your streaming app. Our VPN round-up is here to help and includes deals on VPNs in the market. Viewers using a VPN need to make sure that they comply with any local regulations where they are, and also with the terms of their service provider.\n\nTeam news\n\nGermany's buildup has gone reasonably well in fitness terms, though they did see Serge Gnabry ruled out before the tournament and opted to leave out Champions League finalist Mats Hummels. The biggest change this year, however, is the return of Toni Kroos from international retirement - on a short-term basis though, as he'll be retiring from all football at the end of the Euros. Kai Havertz looks to have done enough to start up front, while Nagelsmann seems to have settled on a triumvirate of Ilkay Gundogan, Florian Wirtz and Jamal Musiala behind him. Aleksandar Pavlovic was the only late withdrawal, through tonsilitis.\n\nAs for Scotland, they've been beset by misfortune. Lyndon Dykes was ruled out by injury soon after being named in the squad, Ben Doak didn't make it because of his own one and Lewis Ferguson suffered an injury just before the end of the campaign. It certainly means there's at least one place up for grabs in attack, with Che Adams or Lawrence Shankland battling for the starting role and the likes of John McGinn and Scott McTominay even more important in support.\n\nPredicted lineups\n\nGER - Ter Stegen, Kimmich, Rudiger, Tah, Mittelstadt, Kroos, Andrich, Musiala, Gundogan, Wirtz, Havertz\n\nSCO - Gunn, Hendry, McKenna, Tierney, Ralston, McTominay, McGregor, Christie, Robertson, McGinn, Adams\n\nThe hosts to get off to the perfect start and the Tartan Army to realise the scale of the task they face to progress. Roared on by the home crowd and powered by the adrenaline of the tournament starting, it's hard to see anything other than a victory for the three-time European Championship winners.

In a bit of worry for the head coach Julian Nagelsmann, Die Mannschaft failed to find a goal against Ukraine in their first warm-up game and needed a late winner against Greece in the last game.\n\nOn the other hand, Scotland will fancy a maiden knockout-round qualification having drawn with Germany, Hungary and Switzerland in Group A.

Havertz made a stunning comeback in the second half of the 2023-24 season where he scored 13 goals in the English Premier League. Havertz also scored the opening goal against Greece in the last warm-up game and will be a safe captaincy choice on the Dream11 team.\n\nFlorian Wirtz: The rising German star enjoyed a stunning 2023-24 campaign with the eventual Bundesliga winners Bayer Leverkusen. Wirtz scored 11 goals and provided 11 assists in the 32 league matches and also proved his consistency in the German Cup and Europa League.\n\nGermany playing XI: Manuel Neuer; Joshua Kimmich, Jonatan

on Switzerland and Hungary with the top two sides in each group guaranteed a place in the last-16.\n\nThe best four third placed teams will also reach the knock-out stages.\n\nAn estimated 200,000 Scotland fans have made the journey to see the country in its first oversees Euros since 1992.\n\nThe game against Germany will be Scotland's first major tournament game outside of the UK since the World Cup in France away back in 1998.\n\nThe hosts will be heavy favourites for the opening game, but after a strong qualifying campaign that saw victories over the likes of Spain and Norway, Steve Clarke's men can be quietly confident of causing an upset.", "source": {"uri": "news.stv.tv", "dataType": "news", "title": "STV News"}, "authors": [{"uri": "peter_cassidy@news.stv.tv", "name": "Peter

It was a survival guide of sorts, and it contained a chilling warning: \"The Deutsche Bahn is not Deutsch at all: which is to say, it's never on time.\"\n\nThat old idea of German efficiency, evidently, does not apply as it once did. Such is the sorry state of the country's railways, the Deutsche Bahn was last year described as being in a \"permanent crisis\" by Germany's national audit office. As they say in a popular joke in these parts: \"If you want German efficiency, go to Switzerland.\"\n\nIn the case of public transport, then, Germany's reputation no longer matches its reality. And now, with the European Championship just hours away, many are questioning whether the same is true of the country's national team. To repurpose Die Zeit's phrasing: \"The Deutsche team is not Deutsch at all: which is to say, it keeps collapsing at major tournaments.\"\n\nGermany's reputation for turning up at the crucial moments, for delivering when the pressure is most intense, is well-established. They even have a word for it: Turniermannschaft, which translates as \"tournament team\".\n\nBut over the last decade, the notion of Germany's excellence at tournaments has been eroded almost as drastically as their reputation for punctual public transport. The great \"tournament team\" has not progressed beyond the last 16 of a major finals since 2016. In their last two World Cup campaigns, Germany were dumped out at the group stages.\n\nAll of which has contributed to a shifting of the national mood. This summer's European Championship is a home tournament but the German people are not particularly optimistic, about their trains or their team. A headline on Sport Bild this week excitedly noted that \"not even Jurgen Klinsmann\" expected Germany to win.\n\nIt was indicative of the situation that Julian Nagelsmann, the Germany manager, used his pre-match press conference to plead for the support of the home crowd during Friday's opener against Scotland. \"Belief is very important,\" he said. \"I hope that everyone in the stadium will be very loud. We want to have the country behind us, to push us forward. We have to use our home advantage. Please be very loud.\"\n\nThe fact that Nagelsmann was asking for significant support was evidence that such backing is not guaranteed. By contrast, there was certainly no need for Steve Clake, the Scotland manager, to make similar representations to his team's tens of thousands of travelling fans.\n\nRecent history has created an air of vulnerability around Germany, even ahead of a competition on their own turf. Their previous tournament showings were either disastrous (the World Cups of 2018 and 2022) or disappointing (they lost to England in the round of 16 in Euro 2020), and their results in 2023 were truly horrific.\n\nWithin that one calendar year, Germany lost to Belgium, Poland, Colombia, Japan, Turkey and Austria. In September last year, Hansi Flick became the first ever Germany manager to be sacked.\n\nUnder Nagelsmann, Germany started slowly. The 36-year-old was in charge for the losses against Turkey and Austria, and in the first of those games he deployed Arsenal forward Kai Havertz as a left-back. It is not an experiment that is likely to be repeated.\n\nAt the turn of the year, many Germans understandably feared for the worst. Based on their form at the Qatar World Cup and in the months that followed, Euro 2024 threatened to be a genuine humiliation.\n\nThose fears have not been totally allayed but Nagelsmann has at least steadied the ship in recent months. Few expect Germany to win, but most now expect them to at least compete in the knockout stages. They are unbeaten in their last four matches, including a 2-0 win in France, and should have too much for Scotland in Munich.\n\nWhat has changed in recent months? The return of Toni Kroos is perhaps the single most important factor. Kroos had retired from international football in 2021 but he was convinced to come back into the fold for this tournament. Announcing his comeback, he said: \"I'm sure that a lot more is possible with the team than most people believe!\"\n\nKroos made his return in March, against France. Within seven seconds, he had assisted a goal. It was another demonstration of the midfielder's enduring class and, having won the Champions League with Real Madrid in his final club match, he intends to head into full retirement with another international trophy to his name.\n\nGermany have the oldest squad in the tournament and, on paper at least, they boast a promising blend between experience and youthful talent. In Florian Wirtz and Jamal Musiala, they have two of the most exciting young attackers in the world. If those two can produce their best, Germany will quickly defy the more negative pre-match expectations.\n\nNothing is guaranteed with this team, though. Not these days, anyway. If anything, Germany's recent history suggests that, as with their trains, it will not take much to push them off-track.", "source": {"uri": "sports.yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo

This summer's hosts have struggled at major tournaments since winning the World Cup a decade ago, but there's scope for them to dazzle in front of a home crowd this summer.\n\n2023 was a wretched year for the German national team in the wake of their early World Cup elimination in Qatar. Die Mannschaft recorded defeats to Colombia, Poland, Japan, Turkey and Austria within a six-month period, with supporters fearing the worst ahead of a home Euros.\n\nHowever, 2023/24 was a bright season for German football. Bayer Leverkusen emerged as the standout team on the continent as they finally dethroned Bayern Munich following a decade of subjugation, while Borussia Dortmund's Champions League run despite a fifth-place Bundesliga finish depicted the division's strength in depth.\n\nWith an emerging generation coming to the fore, there's a sense of the hosts entering the tournament with plenty of momentum behind them.\n\nHere's 90min's guide to Germany heading into Euro 2024.\n\nJulian Nagelsmann selected a 27-man provisional squad which was then whittled down to 26 for the tournament, dropping fourth-choice goalkeeper Alexander Nubel.\n\nThere were a couple of notable omissions, with Bayern Munich's Leon Goretzka and Borussia Dortmund's Mats Hummels missing out. Goretzka perhaps isn't the player he was during Bayern's dominant 2019/20 campaign but remains a prominent figure in Munich and his absence was seen as a surprise.\n\nThe same goes for Hummels, who many expected would return to the international fold this summer off the back of a vintage season. The centre-back played a pivotal role in Dortmund's Champions League success. With Hummels out, Antonio Rudiger is set to be partnered by either Bayer Leverkusen's Jonathan Tah or Dortmund's Nico Schlotterbeck.\n\nGermany faced Ukraine and Greece in two pre-tournament friendlies at the start of June, picking up a draw and a victory.\n\nJulian Nagelsmann is regarded as one of the shrewdest tacticians around and the German manager is attempting to instil a club-like system with the German national team.\n\nFollowing some initial teething problems, Germany's victories over France and the Netherlands offered sources of vindication.\n\nHis principles focus on possession. Nagelsmann wants his team to control games with the ball, build efficiently and win it back rapidly. The German coach has previously been revered for his pressing structures and the emphasis he places on counter-pressing. Installing a cohesive press is tough at international level given the reduced time the manager has with his group of players, but Germany have shown signs of evolving into a coherent team without the ball having struggled throughout 2023.\n\nIn possession, Nagelsmann encourages attacking fluidity via rotations, with his introduction of a 4-2-3-1 allowing Germany's playmakers to operate in close proximity. Width can be supplied from full-back, with Nagelsmann wanting the likes of Jamal Musiala and Florian Wirtz to receive the ball between the lines as much as possible.\n\nTheir shape in possession can resemble the 3-2-5 or 2-3-5 commonly seen at club level. Overall, Nagelsmann's Germany are fast, dynamic and ever-improving. The return of Toni Kroos aids them immensely in terms of control and their evolution without the ball has seen them produce sturdier defensive showings ahead of the tournament.\n\nAs the hosts, Germany were placed into Group A and are favourites to top an evenly-contested set of teams.\n\nSwitzerland are perennial major tournament contestants and very rarely fail to make it into the knockout stages. Their last group-stage exit came at the 2010 World Cup.\n\nHungary were very impressive in qualifying and, led by Liverpool's Dominik Szoboszlai, could emerge as one of the dark horses this summer as an aggressive and defensively stout outfit. They faced Germany at Euro 2020, earning a 2-2 draw, and have improved since their previous appearance.\n\nScotland are regarded as the outsiders in Group A, but their victory over Spain in qualifying showed they can not only compete with the best but beat them, too. Germany must be wary of Steve Clarke's side when they face off in the tournament opener on 14 June.\n\nIf Germany meet expectations and win Group A, they'll face the runner-up of Group C in the round of 16. England are likely to top that group, with second place well up for grabs.\n\nHowever, a second-place finish would see them take on the runners-up of Group B. That's likely to be Spain, Italy or Croatia. That's a route Germany will be keen to avoid, especially given France and England will probably be on that side of the draw.\n\nToni Kroos' impact was felt during Germany's March friendlies and the superstar midfielder has a huge role to play for Nagelsmann this summer. His ability to provide control should counter-balance Nagelsmann's verticality and ensure Germany aren't constantly playing in back-and-forth contests.\n\nIlkay Gundogan also has a key role to play in this regard. The Barcelona star could perform a handful of roles this summer, but he'll likely drop deep and operate closer to Kroos and crash the box when necessary.\n\nThese two will be aiming to serve Germany's two potential standouts at Euro 2024, Florian Wirtz and Jamal Musiala. The two young playmakers have been around the national team set-up for quite some time and this feels like their time to come to the fore. While Musiala had an up-and-down season with Bayern, Wirtz inspired Bayer Leverkusen to an unbeaten domestic season.\n\nNagelsmann's in-possession structure revolves around these two majestic creators, although Leroy Sane is a game-breaking talent who simply can't be ignored.\n\nGermany's Euro 2024 squad has a largely familiar feel, although there are a few young stars who could enjoy breakout tournaments this summer.\n\nLeft-back is an area of contention for Nagelsmann and Stuttgart's Max Mittelstadt could fill the void. The 27-year-old perhaps doesn't fit the 'young' brief, but he's nonetheless new to the international stage. Mittelstadt has just two caps for the national team, with his performances in March highlighting his potential to thrive in Nagelsmann's set-up. The defender scored in Germany's 2-1 win over the Netherlands.\n\nIn attack, Kai Havertz's impressive end to the Premier League season means he's the favourite to start as Nagelsmann's number 9 this summer, but Hoffenheim's Maximilian Beier also enjoyed a stellar domestic season and is poised to be an option for the Germany boss. Beier's a savvy operator with Raumdeuter-like qualities. He ended 2023/24 with 16 Bundesliga goals.\n\nGermany once enjoyed perpetual success at major tournaments but they've been starved of success for the past decade. A home Euros increases expectation and pressure, but Germany's momentum heading into the tournament suggests they should enjoy an exciting summer.\n\nPlus, is Toni Kroos really going to go out with a whimper? No chance.\n\nGermany should top a competitive Group A and progress deep into this summer's tournament. They should at least match their performance at the 2006 World Cup, which they hosted, by reaching the semi-finals. Victory of their group should leave them on the 'easier' side of the draw.\n\nAnything can happen if they make the last four and the Germans cannot be written off on home soil this summer - even if there are doubts over who'll be scoring the goals.", "source": {"uri": "ca.sports.yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo Sports Canada"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

Bypassing qualifying by virtue of being hosts, Germany played 11 friendlies last year but won only three, losing six.\n\nFormer Bayern Munich and RB Leipzig coach Julian Nagelsmann, at 36 younger than the likes of Kroos and Neuer, took over in September and they are unbeaten since the turn of the year, a run that has included wins over France and the Netherlands - but the pressure has been off. At least until now.\n\n\"Now we're all getting kind of nervous, a little bit,\" Nagelsmann said on the eve of the tournament. \"I think it's normal, but it's good as well, because if you're kind of nervous, you'll be focused, on the first game especially.\"\n\nBut there was good news for Gareth Southgate on Thursday as John Stones returned to training to mean there was a full compliment of players going through their paces in Blankhenhain.\n\nStones was withdrawn as a precaution during Friday's friendly defeat to Iceland after taking a blow to the ankle, and then missed Wednesday's training session with an unspecified illness.\n\nBut the versatile Manchester City defender now appears to be back up to full speed.", "source": {"uri": "jerseyeveningpost.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Jersey Evening Post"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Germany", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Germany"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Germany"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scotland", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Scotland"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Scotland"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Olympiastadion_(Berlin)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Olympiastadion (Berlin)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exhibition_game", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Exhibition game"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UEFA_Champions_League", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "UEFA Champions League"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euro", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Euro"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/England", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "England"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "England"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Munich", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Munich"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Munich"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Germany"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/France", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "France"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Northern_Ireland", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Northern Ireland"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Northern Ireland"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Netherlands", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Netherlands"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Netherlands"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gibraltar", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Gibraltar"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Gibraltar"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Julian_Nagelsmann", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Julian Nagelsmann"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gareth_Southgate", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Gareth Southgate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Stones", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "John Stones"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RB_Leipzig", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "RB Leipzig"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FC_Bayern_Munich", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "FC Bayern Munich"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toni_Kroos", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Toni Kroos"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manchester_City_F.C.", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Manchester City F.C."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iceland", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Iceland"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Iceland"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Recreation", "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Recreation", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Board_Games", "label": "dmoz/Games/Board Games", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Multiplayer", "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Multiplayer", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Online/Play-By-E-Mail", "label": "dmoz/Games/Online/Play-By-E-Mail", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Tennis/Tournaments", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Tennis/Tournaments", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 94}], "image": "https://d3gvyx4eg3tne0.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Img38291029.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9648341", "eventUri": "eng-9648341", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-07-14", "textStart": 258, "textEnd": 265}], "sentiment": 0.3725490196078431, "wgt": 123, "relevance": 1}

Now they will hope to go one better and escape their group and make history as the first side in the nation's history to do so.\n\nThere's plenty of hope they can do it in a group that's hard to pick, however there's one clear favourite, and that's their first opponents, Germany, which is live on talkSPORT.\n\nJulian Nagelsmann's side have been all over the place. Disastrous at the 2022 World Cup, they sacked Hansi Flick after a five-game winless run following the tournament.\n\nNaglesmann has since arrived from Bayern Munich, and back-to-back wins over France and the Netherlands in March have brought the feel good factor back to both the team and the country.\n\nHowever, that could all change if Scotland can pile the pressure on in Munich, and here's what talkSPORT's pundits think of the key storylines heading into the match...\n\nMario Krischel of Kicker: \"Germany tend to struggle against deep-lying defensive teams, recently they struggled against Greece and Ukraine but showed up against France and the Netherlands. Overall they should beat Scotland, though.\"\n\ntalkSPORT's Chief Football Correspondent Alex Crook: \"I'm not sure they have much confidence. [Leroy] Sane's form has dropped off and [Kai] Havertz is going to lead the line, is he really going to score enough goals?\"\n\nEx-Germany international Thomas Hitzlsperger: \"He's had an incredible season, but the opening game is crucial going into the tournament, McGinn might score a couple of goals, I wish him the best of luck but only if Germany scores one more.\"\n\ntalkSPORT host Simon Jordan: \"They're not in a rich vein of form but they have every reason to be enthusiastic because they've got players that are doing well in the Premier League, John McGinn being one of them.\"\n\nEuropean football journalist Andy Brassell: \"They've had the same coach for ages in Marco Rossi and they were unbeaten in qualifying. The fact they didn't have [Domink] Szoboszlai in the last tournament as well but they do now and he has three more years of experience. All of these things point to them really being able to do something. They go into this tournament thinking 'we are qualifying from this group'.\"\n\nAlex Crook: \"Hungary are a real dark horse, they went the whole of 2023 unbeaten, beat England home and away the year before in the Nations League and, caused Germany problems in that competition as well. My tip for the tournament is Hungary top that group ahead of the host nation.\"\n\ntalkSPORT host and former Scotland forward Alan Brazil: \"We're going to need three points but maybe four - I keep being told Hungary are decent and we shouldn't underestimate them.\"\n\ntalkSPORT host Jeff Stelling: \"I think that they will get through the group stage and I think that's an achievement for them as well - don't mean to be condescending. Tough opening game against Germany but I expect them to go through maybe at the expense of Hungary.\"\n\nFormer England striker Darren Bent: \"I love seeing Home Nations in major competitions but I think you look at their squad and the strength and depth certainly in other teams in their group. I think they're really going to struggle. I think it's been an achievement them making it to the major tournament but I can't see them getting out their group.\"\n\ntalkSPORT host Shebahn Aherne: \"Scotland get out of the group at the Euros and we'll take that. A lot of people we've been talking to see this as a group of death and we might struggle to get out of the group. You cannot look at that squad and tell me it's a bad team.\"\n\nAlex Crook: \"Scotland won't ever get a better chance to finally make it out of the group at a major tournament, but in true Scottish style, I think it'll be a glorious failure again. I think they'll be one of the first teams on the plane home.\"", "source": {"uri": "talksport.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "talkSPORT"}, "authors": [{"uri": "connor_andrews@talksport.com",

And yet, as Germany prepares to cut the ribbon on Euro 2024, there is little evidence of the arrogance and triumphalism that once walked hand-in-hand with their players and supporters alike.\n\nUnlike the World Cup in 2006 or the last time the Euros were here in 1988, expectations about what Die Mannschaft might achieve across the coming month have been tempered.\n\nThis is in no small part down to the recent failings of the team, which saw it exit the group stages of the past two World Cups and suffer elimination at the round of 16 in Euro 2020.\n\nFans arrive in Munich ahead of the Euro 24 opening match between Germany and Scotland\n\nThe opening match of Euro 2024 will be played at the stunning Allianz Area in Munich\n\nScottish fans are already arriving in their droves and taking to the streets of Munich\n\nAppointed last year after Hansi Flick's sacking, Julian Nagelsmann has galvanised a squad which looked to be lost. Victories over the Netherlands and France in March were a welcome shot in the arm.\n\nBut there remains something of a disconnect between the supporters and the side.\n\nExpectation has been displaced by hope. In the winding alleys around Munich's Marienplatz yesterday, you could be mistaken for believing that the German public remains to be convinced that they will lift the trophy in Berlin on July 14.\n\nThe souvenir stalls remain dominated by Bayern Munich scarves and pennants. The colours of 1860 Munich, now languishing in the third tier, were just as visible as the black, red and gold of this nation.\n\nYou cannot miss the fact that a footballing festival is about to begin. There is Euro 2024 livery everywhere you look. But the only flags being draped over balconies were saltires and the only voices being heard above the chimes of the church bells were Scottish.\n\nSo far, at least, the German public has kept its affection for -- and its belief in -- Nagelsmann's side well hidden.\n\n'In the past, we expected nothing other than victory,' said Hans Neumann, who owns a coffee shop in the market district. 'But the last few tournaments have been huge disappointments. We hope, of course, but we now assume nothing.\n\n'There is a different approach now. We want to be good hosts and to enjoy the tournament. I don't think too many supporters anticipate us winning the trophy.'\n\nFrom a distance, this standpoint is curious. Germany may be behind England and France in betting odds, but the historical importance of home advantage in this competition cannot be understated.\n\nPortugal, France and England made it to the final on home soil this century with Spain (1964), Italy (1968) and France (1984) all previously victorious in front of their own fans. The domestic game was given a much-needed shot in the arm last season as Bayer Leverkusen completed the jaw-dropping feat of landing the double unbeaten while reaching the Europa League final.\n\nFlorian Wirtz, Robert Andrich and Jonathan Tah were central to that astonishing campaign and are key components of Nagelsmann's squad.\n\nVfB Stuttgart, who finished second in the Bundesliga, also have five representatives.\n\nAlthough Borussia Dortmund lost their Champions League final to Real Madrid, it was a fine year for German clubs in Europe with only Serie A faring better. An additional place in the revamped Champions League next year has added to the feelgood factor.\n\nAntonio Rudiger and Toni Kroos both arrived at the training camp near Nuremberg fresh from Madrid's win at Wembley. The latter will retire after these finals but will do so having lost little of the brilliance that marked him out as one of the best midfielders of his generation.\n\nSome Scotland fans even managed to meet and greet Sky Sports legend Jeff Stelling\n\nCaptain Ilkay Gundogan, Joshua Kimmich, Manuel Neuer, Marc-Andre ter Stegen, Thomas Muller and Kai Havertz have also lifted Europe's top club honour.\n\nHavertz is 25 now, but the Arsenal man is still bracketed along with the attacking young guns who could illuminate the competition. Wirtz simply reached a ridiculous level in the colours of Leverkusen last season, cutting a swathe through opposing defences at will and adding every conceivable individual award to the medals he won as part of Xabi Alonso's all-conquering side.\n\nJamal Musiala, of Bayern, also just 21, has long been established as one of the true stars of German football with his outrageous dribbling skills. He already has four Bundesliga titles in his locker.\n\nIf recent matches are any guide, Nagelsmann will unleash Wirtz and Musiala ahead of Gundogan so they can support Havertz. If it all clicks, it could make for a long night for Steve Clarke's defenders.\n\nThe concern for Germany is keeping the back door shut. Neuer lost a soft goal to Greece last week with his suitability now something of a national debate. Lothar Matthaus believes he should be dropped but that simply won't happen.\n\nOver the past year, the side has kept just two clean sheets in 13 games -- against France and Ukraine. That might explain the lack of faith that exists.\n\n'It's a team with strengths but some weaknesses,' explains Marie Fischer, an economics student who still hopes to snare a ticket for the opening game.\n\n'We can score goals, but the problem is we lose too many. It can be an exciting team and we have a better chance than when Hansi (Flick) was in charge. But perhaps there are other nations that are more complete.'\n\nWith a winnable group, Germany still expects to be in with a shout of the latter stages. But the mood this time is certainly more one of cautious optimism.", "source": {"uri": "dailymail.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "Daily Mail Online"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

Wind the calendar back to their first-ever World Cup finals defeat to Austria and the national team have consistently fluffed their lines on opening night.\n\nThey've played in eight World Cups and reached the European Championships three times previously. That's 11 tournaments in total and they've only won their first game twice. The first was against mighty Zaire, the second against New Zealand.\n\nThis matters because the opening skirmish of tournament football sets the tone. Win and it gets the monkey off the back. Lose and game two is like walking a tightrope blindfolded. One more slip and it could be curtains.\n\nScotland have never been much cop at hitting the ground running. Never terribly good full stop, if truth be told. You don't have to be one of Steve Clarke's Negative Normans to acknowledge the historical reality of the team's record at major tournaments.\n\nIn total, the men's national team have played 32 games at World Cups and European Championships and won just six of them. A win rate of 18.75 per cent is woeful stuff and too often the die is cast on the opening night.\n\nHead coach Steve Clarke has been getting his message across to his Scotland players\n\nThe Scotland players are put through their final paces ahead of Friday night's opener\n\nThe Scots have been warmly welcomed in Germany - but they need to turn parties into points\n\nPlenty will tell you that the game against Germany doesn't matter much. Clarke wants four points from three games and that's a perfectly achievable target against Switzerland and Hungary, even if his side lose the first match.\n\nThat attitude is fine if Scotland are happy being the nation who put parties before points. If they're simply happy to be there and pose for selfies on the pitch, what happens in Munich is irrelevant.\n\nIf there's an actual ambition to reach the second stage of a major international tournament for the first time ever they should be clear-eyed over the importance of taking a point -- at least -- from the Allianz Arena. Qualification becomes an awful lot easier if they do.\n\nArgentina 1978 was the high-water mark of opening-night cock-ups. Joe Jordan scored the opening goal against a Peru side manager Ally MacLeod hadn't bothered watching in person.\n\nDon Masson missed a penalty for 2-0 and the brilliant Teofilo Cubillas grabbed the game by the scruff of the neck as Peru won 3-1. A team tipped to win the World Cup returned to a hotel with no water in the swimming pool and, had the Tartan Army got hold of them that night, they'd have chucked them in anyway.\n\nMexico '86 brought an opening-night to defeat to Denmark. And when Scots of a certain vintage wake up sweating in the middle of the night it's nothing to do with the onset of middle age. They're having nightmares over that defeat to Costa Rica in the first game of Italia '90.\n\nTom Boyd's own goal against Brazil at France '98 summed up what happens the minute the curtain goes up and the spotlight beams down. Scots everywhere are programmed to hope for the best and prepare for the worst.\n\nThe last time Scotland played in an opening match in a finals, a Tom Boyd own-goal handed eventual finalists Brazil a 2-1 victory at France 98\n\nIt's illogical to judge the current team by that standard. If failure was an inherited condition, Clarke's team would never have won that penalty shoot-out in Serbia in 2020. They wouldn't have won all five of their opening games in qualification. They would never have gone to Cyprus and rattled in three goals in the first half. They'd have found a way to blow their hopes of reaching Germany in the first place.\n\nScotland's mental scarring is nothing to do with these players, it's all down to fans of a certain generation.\n\nSome of us grew up accepting that mishap was in with the bricks. Even when they did win the opening game, another calamity was just round the corner.\n\nWhen Kenny Dalglish, Joe Jordan and Denis Law played against Zaire in '74 Willie Ormond couldn't have mustered more firepower if he'd rolled Mons Meg on to the Dortmund pitch. All they had to show for it at time up was two goals from Peter Lorimer and Jordan.\n\nUrban myth has it that the Scots took their feet off the gas against a team of no-hopers. They crashed out of the World Cup unbeaten after Yugoslavia rattled nine goals past the same opponents. There was more to it than that.\n\nWhen money went missing from Zaire's player pool, a strike was averted when FIFA stepped in. The African champions were placed under house arrest by their own security forces, smoked and drank more than they should have, and went 3-0 down to Yugoslavia inside 20 minutes before the coach replaced their first-choice goalkeeper with a guy who was 5ft 4ins. He shipped another six goals and Scotland crashed out on goal difference.\n\nEven the best dark blue squad in living memory fared no better. When Spain '82 came around, Alan Hansen, Graeme Souness, Dalglish and John Robertson had already amassed a glittering array of European Cup-winners' medals among them. They were the Abba of Scotland squads.\n\nDespite rattling five goals past New Zealand in the opener, calamity struck in the final game against the Soviet Union and they crashed out on goal difference. Again.\n\nIf there's a doom-laden fatalism amongst older fans, then, it's based on cold, hard experience. Leave aside television, the telephone and penicillin and Scotland is at its most inventive when it comes to finding new ways to muck up qualification for the knockout stages of an international tournament.\n\nIt's not really fair to level that charge at Andy Robertson and Co. While the last Euros were underwhelming, the events of Argentina '78 or France '98 are as relevant to Billy Gilmour or Scott McTominay as the Cuban missile crisis or the shooting of JFK. All that angst belongs to generations like mine, who grew up fearing the worst and -- more often than not -- proved to be astute judges.\n\nThe Scots will run out at the impressive Allianz Arena on Friday night, home of Bayern Munich\n\nDespite the PTSD of the past, nothing beats the hope and excitement of Scotland at another finals. A country polarised by club football, politics and religion draws a little closer together for a fortnight at least.\n\nThe only thing worse than being mocked is being ignored. For too long, the national football team were mediocre and, on nights like this, Scots shrug off the cloak of invisibility and feel relevant again.\n\nEven if it's just for one night, this game against Germany puts the national team front, left and centre of Planet Football for the first time in years and, for the tens of thousands of fans congregating in Munich, it's a nice place to be.\n\nA new generation of players have an opportunity to confound Negative Normans everywhere by writing a positive new chapter in national team history.\n\nIf the 50th anniversary of the last meaningful win on German soil isn't an omen, then God knows what is.", "source": {"uri": "dailymail.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "Daily Mail Online"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

Teams that host this tournament perform reasonably well, with the country rallying behind them.\n\nIn the previous 15 tournaments, 10 of the host nations have reached at least the semifinal stage, with three finishing as runner-ups and another three went on to be crowned champions.\n\nAs a result, the Germans will likely fancy their chances of winning the tournament with the third shortest odds at +550.\n\nWhile Germany is a heavy favorite (-350) in the opening match, the hosts might find it difficult to break down the Scots.\n\nOdds via DraftKings\n\nGermany comes into the competition in decent form. It's undefeated in its last four matches and produced an impressive 2-0 result on the road against a French team with the second-shortest tournament odds at +400.\n\nIt followed that performance with a 2-1 result at home against the Netherlands, which could be a sleeper team in this competition.\n\nBut since Germany is the host country, it hasn't quite had the pressure of having to qualify for the tournament. As a result, it might take a little time before they adjust to the intensity of the match.\n\nAccording to FootyStats, Germany's expected goals (xG) rate is 1.67, which would put it 13th among the teams in the tournament.\n\nThere's been a bit of a transition with the Germans as Thomas M\u00fcller, who has the most caps (129) on the roster, is unlikely to be in the starting 11. Arsenal's Kai Havertz will likely lead the line, but even at his best, he's never shown quite the finishing prowess as M\u00fcller.\n\nThus, the Germans will need some big performances from their younger midfield players, including 21-year-olds Jamal Musiala and Florian Wirtz.\n\nWhile the Germans should dominate possession in the middle of the pitch, their bigger challenge will be putting the ball in the back of the net.\n\nVery few teams can match the fighting spirit or industrious work ethic of the Scots, who are often outmanned in terms of quality and have suffered their share of heartache in major competitions.\n\nNonetheless, Scotland is a very prideful team that will give its all until the final whistle.\n\nThe key in this match will be to frustrate the Germans by getting all 11 players behind the ball when they are out of possession. Scotland will likely opt for a 5-4-1 formation to provide extra protection along its backline. It has some workhorses in the midfield led by Aston Villa's John McGinn.\n\nOne thing that could work to Scotland's advantage is that its best players are on the wing, with Liverpool's Andy Robertson on the left side and Celtic's Anthony Ralston on the right. Scotland will need the pace of both players on the wing to try to contain Musiala and Wirtz.\n\nAs a result, it'll take the hosts a little time to break Scotland down. Germany will likely need some magic from one of their midfield players, or it will try to overload one side of the field.\n\nAlthough Scotland will do its best to hang on as long as possible, eventually the dam will break, and Germany will get on the scoresheet.\n\n\" READ MORE: Croatia has long shot value to win the 2024 UEFA Euros tournament\n\nYou never want to get too ahead of yourself in an opening match that could be filled with tons of jitters on both sides. And given Germany's current odds, there's not much value in backing the favorites at the current price.\n\nThe best way to approach this match would be to find creative ways to play the under.\n\nThe European Football governing body introduced group play in 1980. Since then, there have been 11 tournaments and only 22 goals scored in the opening match. During that time frame, no opening match has had more than three goals.\n\nSix matches went scoreless in the first half, four had a 1-0 result and one was tied 1-1. Thus, it's rare to see many goals in the first half.\n\nHowever, we wouldn't need to wait for the full 45 minutes to find some action in this match. At bet365, we can wager on a scoreless result in the first 26 minutes of the first half at -120 odds.\n\nThat price seems undervalued for an opening match where both teams will likely come out somewhat conservative.", "source": {"uri": "inquirer.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Philadelphia Inquirer"}, "authors": [{"uri": "michael_arinze@inquirer.com", "name": "Michael Arinze", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scotland", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Scotland"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Scotland"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Germany", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Germany"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Germany"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thomas_M\u00fcller", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Thomas M\u00fcller"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UEFA_European_Championship", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "UEFA European Championship"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Midfielder", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Midfielder"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Munich", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Munich"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Munich"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Germany"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/France", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "France"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jamal_Musiala", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Jamal Musiala"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Florian_Wirtz", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Florian Wirtz"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kai_Havertz", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Kai Havertz"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Football_pitch", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Football pitch"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cap_(sport)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Cap (sport)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Netherlands", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Netherlands"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Netherlands"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andrew_Robertson", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Andrew Robertson"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_McGinn", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "John McGinn"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anthony_Ralston", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Anthony Ralston"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aston_Villa_F.C.", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Aston Villa F.C."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liverpool", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Liverpool"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Liverpool"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Croatia", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Croatia"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Croatia"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Paintball/Teams", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Paintball/Teams", "wgt": 19}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Flying_Discs/Ultimate_Frisbee", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Flying Discs/Ultimate Frisbee", "wgt": 19}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Tournaments", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Tournaments", "wgt": 22}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Tennis/Tournaments", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Tennis/Tournaments", "wgt": 21}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/Statistics", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/Statistics", "wgt": 21}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 85}], "image": "https://www.inquirer.com/resizer/cRVkinjECMxFGVEuAergbM0ZEtc=/760x507/smart/filters:format(webp)/cloudfront-us-east-1.images.arcpublishing.com/pmn/O7N225KJQZBJ3NWMFUPWYXXMHQ.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9648341", "eventUri": "eng-9648341", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.2549019607843137, "wgt": 118, "relevance": 1}

Their pre-tournament form has been alarmingly poor, their squad has been ravaged by injuries and their opponents boast some of the best players in Europe.\n\nThe usual footballing logic can be awfully boring, though, and no one of a Scottish persuasion has travelled to Munich in expectation of a bland few days. For Scotland, playing in their first overseas tournament since 1998, this is not a time to worry about the form guide or fitness issues. It is instead a moment for dreaming; for expecting the unexpected.\n\nDespite their recent performances - Scotland have won just one of their last nine matches, and that was against Gibraltar - there are reasons to believe they are capable of hurting the host nation. One of those reasons is Austin MacPhee, the man with the longest hair in the Scotland setup and perhaps also the biggest brain.\n\nIn the German press, MacPhee has this week been described as \"Scotland's secret weapon\". The locals have evidently become aware of the threat posed by the set-piece coach with the flowing locks, who is regarded within football as one of the game's leading experts on dead-ball situations.\n\nFor Premier League viewers, MacPhee is better known for his work at Aston Villa than for his role on Steve Clarke's Scotland coaching staff. MacPhee has been Villa's set-piece specialist since August 2021 and it speaks volumes of his importance at the club that he has survived the sackings of both Dean Smith and Steven Gerrard. Managers have come and gone, but MacPhee and his ever-evolving set-piece routines have remained.\n\nThe fuss around MacPhee is not just hype. In all competitions last season, Villa scored 25 goals from set pieces (15 of which came from corners). Across Europe's top five leagues, only Bayer Leverkusen scored more.\n\nOn the international stage, with the help of MacPhee's coaching, Scotland pose a serious threat from free-kicks and corners. Since his appointment in 2021, around 25 per cent of their goals have been scored from set pieces, or from penalties won at set-piece situations. In their last 14 competitive fixtures, they have scored eight goals from set pieces and conceded only two.\n\nIs one of Scotland's best hopes against Germany therefore to simply stick it in the mixer? The routines are much more complicated than that in the modern game but, on the most basic level, the answer is probably yes. The likes of John McGinn, Andy Robertson, Kieran Tierney and Ryan Christie are all capable of producing excellent deliveries from wide.\n\nMacPhee's success and rising profile in recent seasons has helped to make set-piece coaches the latest must-have trend in football. They are so in-demand in the Premier League that clubs are now paying transfer fees for them, as Chelsea did when signing Bernardo Cueva from Brentford for \u00a3750,000.\n\nIndeed, these specialists have become so commonplace that managers are now grilled about not having one on their staff, as was the case with Ange Postecoglou at Tottenham Hotspur last season, rather than about the need to employ one.\n\nOf course, no one in football will claim that set pieces are the most attractive part of the game. Most players dread the section of training which is devoted to corners and free-kicks. Ollie Watkins, the Villa striker, admitted earlier this year that MacPhee's set-piece sessions are \"not the most exciting\" and \"a little bit boring\".\n\nThey are absolutely necessary, though, and for Scotland they will present an opportunity in the tournament opener against Germany, as well as in the subsequent matches against Switzerland and Hungary. The ambition is to progress beyond the group stages of a major tournament for the first time, and such a goal will only be achieved if they can excel in all areas of the game.\n\nMacPhee, in contrast to the Scotland players, has personal experience of the knockout stages of a European Championship: he was part of Northern Ireland's coaching team in 2016, when they reached the round of 16. MacPhee is a proud Scot (born in Kirkcaldy, he attended the 1998 World Cup in France as a teenage fan) and is hoping to repeat that feat in the coming weeks.\n\nThe worrying question for him and Clarke is whether Scotland will be able to perform at their best -- on set pieces and in open play -- without so many important players. Their list of injuries is brutally long, and has perhaps done even more damage to national optimism than their run of concerning results since they lost 3-1 to England in September.\n\nAmong those missing are right-backs Aaron Hickey and Nathan Patterson, key forward Lyndon Dykes, young talent Ben Doak and midfielder Lewis Ferguson, who was named the best midfielder in Serie A for his excellent performances at Bologna (Robertson also picked up a knock earlier this week, although Scotland played down fears he could miss the opener).\n\nThat is the bad news, then. The good news is that Scotland still have the mighty McGinn, who has so far embraced this tournament with the same gusto he shows on the pitch: when Scotland arrived at their Bavarian base this week, McGinn took part in a traditional folk dance at the local town hall.\n\nMcGinn is a huge character in the squad and is regarded by many as Scotland's most important player. The 29-year-old has been involved in 11 goals (six goals, five assists) of Scotland's last 35 in all competitions, and comes into the tournament still riding the high of Champions League qualification with Villa.\n\nWith the likes of Billy Gilmour, Scott McTominay, Robertson and Tierney supporting McGinn, Scotland have quality players who can make a difference on the pitch as their German adventure begins. And with MacPhee in their ranks, they might just have a coach who can make a difference with his work off it.", "source": {"uri": "ca.sports.yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo Sports

Can Steve Clarke's men make history by becoming the first Scottish team to make the knockouts of a major finals?\n\nAre England going to triumph for the first time since 1966? And which players are most likely to shine at the tournament? Mail Sport's resident experts JOHN McGARRY and CALUM CROWE answer these questions and more....\n\nDo Scotland have a chance against Germany?\n\nJOHN McGARRY: Absolutely. History tells us that the opening game of any tournament tends to be a cagey affair with a goal either way often deciding the outcome.\n\nIf we can ease our way into the contest, we'll get chances.\n\nFor all the firepower Germany have in Kai Havertz, Florian Wirtz and Jamal Musiala, they are vulnerable at the back. Now aged 38, Manuel Neuer is beginning to show signs of fragility.\n\nThe Scots were in high spirits as they were put through their paces at their training base\n\nThe Tartan Army have high hopes of a knees-up to match John McGinn's on arrival in Germany\n\nSteve Clarke has kept things suitably low-key but the excitement of fans is bubbling up nicely\n\nInjuries may have weakened the depth of Steve Clarke's squad, but the nucleus of the side which famously defeated Spain is still there. Set-pieces at both ends of the park could affect the outcome. In that regard, the work of Austin MacPhee could prove vital.\n\nThe pressure is all on the hosts here. If we seize the moment and remember what we are good at, we can rattle them.\n\nCALUM CROWE: Of course we do. All the pressure is on the Germans. They are the host nation playing in front of their own fans on opening night. There will be a massive weight of expectation on them to deliver not only a victory, but also a performance to excite their supporters. There has been a disconnect between the German national team and their public over these past few years due to repeated failures at the past few major tournaments.\n\nWhile still boasting some top players like Wirtz, Toni Kroos, Ilkay Gundogan and Musiala, Germany are also very workmanlike in other positions. Scotland are good enough to frustrate them and take a point at the very least.\n\nSteve Clarke has some selection issues -- what's your starting team for the opener and why?\n\nJM: Angus Gunn obviously starts in goal. He's simply the best keeper we have. Anthony Ralston showed enough against Finland to merit the nod at right wing-back with Andy Robertson deployed on the opposing flank.\n\nI suspect the three in the middle of defence will be Jack Hendry, Grant Hanley and Kieran Tierney, purely because they featured against the Finns.\n\nGrant Hanley's lack of match sharpness could see him miss out on a spot in central defence\n\nRyan Christie has enjoyed a stellar season and will be unlucky if he misses out in midfield\n\nScott McTominay will come back into the midfield in an advanced position beside John McGinn. This the toughest call facing the manager, but my suspicion is that Ryan Christie will make way and be asked to make an impact from the bench. Callum McGregor and Billy Gilmour will sit deeper, tasked with breaking up attacks and building the play.Che Adams will start ahead of Lawrence Shankland purely because of his superior mobility.\n\nCC: I expect Clarke to go with a 3-4-2-1 system. Gunn will start in goal and I would go with a back three of Hendry, Ryan Porteous and Tierney. I would go for Porteous as I just don't think Hanley is fit enough to start a match of this magnitude.\n\nHe hardly played for Norwich last season and looked really rusty against Finland at Hampden last week. That said, Clarke trusts him and values his experience. If it was up to me, I'd go with Porteous.\n\nRobertson and Ralston would be my wing-backs, with McGregor and McTominay in midfield. I would then have McGinn and Christie playing just off Adams. That means Gilmour misses out, which is probably harsh on him. But Gilmour is a ball player and I don't expect us to see much of the ball against Germany.\n\nChristie offers more energy to press and is a goal threat. That said, if McTominay isn't fully fit, he could be the one to miss out and Gilmour could play.\n\nWho will be the breakout star across the tournament?\n\nJM: Turkey's Arda Guler missed most of the domestic season with Real Madrid due to injury, but returned with a few games to spare to help seal the title and remind us why Fenerbahce made \u00a323million from his sale a year ago.\n\nWhen this attacking midfielder is on his game, he's a joy to behold with his incredible dribbling skills and vision.\n\nTurkey's Real Madrid attacking midfielder Arda Guler could have a breakthrough tournament\n\nStill just 19 years old, he's set to take the world by storm in the coming years. He could serve notice by starring in a tight section which includes Portugal, the Czech Republic and Georgia.\n\nCC: Benjamin Sesko of Slovenia. For any young striker to be mentioned in the same breath as Erling Haaland, there can be no higher praise. But that's the sort of comparisons that have been made about Sesko as he's come through the ranks of the Red Bull football machine, firstly at Salzburg in Austria and now at Leipzig in the Bundesliga.\n\nStill only 21, he scored 18 goals for Leipzig in all competitions last year in his first season with the club. He has 11 goals in 29 caps for Slovenia -- and I fully expect him to add to that tally in the Euros. Tall, strong and deceptively quick, Sesko and the Slovenians should reach the knockout stage at the very least as I expect them to cause problems in a group featuring England, Denmark and Serbia.\n\nWho are your dark horses?\n\nJM: Belgium. In qualifying, they topped a tough group containing Sweden and Austria without losing a game.\n\nMany of the golden generation like Eden Hazard, who seemed unable to handle the expectation on the big stage, have now retired.\n\nHowever, they still can call upon the likes of Kevin De Bruyne, Youri Tielemans and Romelu Lukaku. Add to that players of the calibre of Jeremy Doku and Leandro Trossard and you have a squad that's brimming with quality. Manager Domenico Tedesco has an abundance of options but -- this time -- no one is predicting that they will lift the trophy. That low-key approach will help them.\n\nBenjamin Sesko is a huge talent for Slovenia and has many admires across the continent\n\nThey are listed eighth favourite in the betting to go all the way -- priced around 22-1. Given they have Slovakia, Romania and Ukraine for company in Group E, that seems somewhat generous.\n\nCC: I expect Slovenia and Hungary will cause a few shocks along the way. But, in terms of going all the way and winning the tournament, Portugal could go under the radar. Everyone seems to be talking about France and England as the two favourites, with Germany, Spain and Portugal in the next bracket. But, of those teams, I think Portugal are best placed to go deep in the tournament.\n\nThey will stroll through their group, with Turkey, Georgia and the Czechs unlikely to offer much opposition. Then, when the knockout stuff begins, you can guarantee Bruno Fernandes, Bernardo Silva and Co will come alive. In Cristiano Ronaldo, they also have a man who thrives on the big occasions. Despite the fact he's now 39 and playing in Saudi Arabia, I wouldn't be surprised at all if Ronaldo was to pop up and score some big goals in these Euros.\n\nIt's a squad packed with talent and, in Roberto Martinez, they have a manager with a point to prove in major tournaments after falling short with Belgium. I expect a Portugal-France final.\n\nOf course, no tournament would be complete without Cristiano Ronaldo making an impact\n\nAre England going to go all the way?\n\nJM: They certainly have the players in Jude Bellingham, Phil Foden and Harry Kane. A group which sees them facing Slovenia, Denmark and Serbia should not present too many difficulties.\n\nAssuming they top the section, they should win a last-16 game against the third-placed team from groups D, E or F in Gelsenkirchen on June 30.\n\nA quarter-final opponent requires a lot of supposition, but Hungary or Italy look well placed to make it that far. England would probably come through that contest but would then face a rematch with France in the semis -- a repeat of their epic last-eight clash in the World Cup in Qatar which was edged by Les Bleus. It will end there again.\n\nNice man though he is, Gareth Southgate is simply not a top-drawer manager.\n\nAfter eight years in charge, he remains the missing link.\n\nCC: No. I expect them to be knocked out in the semis against France. That will rightly be deemed a failure when you look at the abundance of talent at Southgate's disposal. He is just too cautious as a manager. In terms of the talent available to him, he owns a Ferrari -- but drives it like a Ford Fiesta.\n\nSouthgate is often labelled boring and cautious, but beware if he gets it right with England\n\nSouthgate has also got some major selection calls wrong. Jack Grealish should be in the squad.\n\nHe's not everyone's cup of tea, but Grealish is exactly the sort of player and personality who would thrive at a major tournament knowing that he's carrying the hopes of a nation.\n\nAnd, finally, will Scotland make it past the group stage?\n\nJM: Yes. Since the tournament moved to its current format, three points have often been enough to go through in third place. The key to happiness in that instance is to ensure your goal difference doesn't take a battering in a game you lose.\n\nBilly Gilmour will play a key role for Scotland and looked fairly relaxed doing his media duties\n\nI believe Scotland can do enough to dispense with the need for favours from other groups, though. They can take a point from Germany and Hungary either side of a win over the Swiss in Cologne.\n\nWe have a squad filled with players who are at top clubs and are in or around their peak years. This is our time to go further than we've ever been before.\n\nCC: I expect we will. Especially given that one win might well be enough to secure a place as one of the best third-placed teams. It would be a failure if Clarke and this group of players don't reach the last 16.", "source": {"uri": "dailymail.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "Daily Mail Online"}, "authors": [], "concepts":

Not a bit of it as he breezily addressed the key issues ahead of the tournament opener, clearly very aware that his team have the opportunity to write their names into history.\n\nEveryone and their Granny knows the painful stat that Scotland have never before reached the knock out stage of a major European competition and it's something Robertson is clearly using as fuel, aware what it would mean to the nation and each of his teammates' personal legacies as internationals.\n\n\"We've waited years and years for this and now there's only one more sleep,\" he beamed. \"We can't wait. I don't think too much about my own emotions in these situations. But I feel the same as all the others right now, excited and proud.\n\n\"In the last Euros we played well in getting a draw at Wembley, but we let ourselves down a bit in the other two games. We know we could have done better. To qualify that last time was massive. To do it twice in a row is incredible. Now, we know we can make history.\n\n\"We've done the hard bit by qualifying. Now let's see what else we can do. We'll need to step things up for the warm-ups games, but when you look at results so will every other team in the tournament. Once we knew we were coming here our standards dropped a little; they shouldn't, but they did. But now it's time to get competitive again. It's time to show what we can do.\"\n\nKey to Scotland's ability to reach the last 16 promised land will be the backing of the Tartan Army. Walking around Munich is to feel like the whole of Scotland has travelled to Germany and it's hard to imagine the stadium won't be heavily infiltrated by wily Scots nabbing tickets for every part of the ground. One of the strengths of Steve Clarke's Scotland is in pulling everyone together and there's no doubting a powerful sense of unity can galvanise Scotland to glory.\n\n\"We've seen all the videos of the fans landing, of them in the squares across the city,\" he smiled. \"We all know so many people who are out here - it feels like most of the country's come over.\n\n\"The Tartan Army have been great with us from Day One. When the gaffer came in there was a conscious decision to try and get them onside, because support at home games had nose-dived, even if the ones who go abroad with us have always been incredible.\n\n\"Listen, we know they can't all get into the stadium tomorrow night - we wish they could - but wherever they are, either here or at home, we want to make them proud. If we perform the way we know we can, they'll hopefully have a great ten or 12 days.\"\n\nSome wondered if Robertson might make it at all when he pulled up earlier in the week as Scotland trained. As he limped off the pitch with the nation's medical stuff there was panic as the thought of losing the captain, not long after injuries claimed the likes of Lyndon Dykes, Aaron Hickey and Nathan Patterson, seemed too much to bear. There were no such worries for Robertson who's been carefully managing an ankle injury since March but his family were like the rest of us.\n\nHe said: \"It probably didn't help that the cameras were there and saw it! We were pretty relaxed about it - maybe a bit more so than my family, who knew it about before I could tell them I was fine. Physically, mentally, I feel good and am looking forward to what lies ahead.\"\n\nWhile Robertson will lead his team out for the biggest game of his international career, Dykes can't influence proceedings on the grass after his injury. An important part of the dressing room camaraderie that's helped shape recent success, the QPR man has still travelled to Germany as an essential cog in the behind the scenes machine.\n\n\"It's brilliant that we have him here with us now, as a fan or a member of staff, whatever you chose to call him, he said. \"Not many people could have handled their emotions well enough to make the trip after what happened to him. He's so import to us off the pitch, such a big influence. But obviously we'd rather have him out there with us.\n\n\"We all know how quickly a tournament can go by you, so we have to make the most of the opportunity we have here. As a group, it doesn't get much more difficult, but at the same time there's no outside pressure or expectation on us. All we can do is play to our maximum and see how we go.\n\n\"We want to make history. We know what's at stake. What's the worst that can happen? We join the list of Scotland teams who haven't got out of a group?\n\n\"We have so many incentives here, but becoming a legendary squad is the biggest. That's what has to drive us forward. The thought of being the first Scotland team to make a knockout round is our driving force. If we manage that? You just never know.\"", "source": {"uri": "heraldscotland.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Herald"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scotland", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Scotland"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Scotland"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andrew_Robertson", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Andrew Robertson"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tartan_Army", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Tartan Army"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wembley_Stadium", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Wembley Stadium"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/J\u00fcrgen_Klopp", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "J\u00fcrgen Klopp"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UEFA", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "UEFA"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euro", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Euro"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liverpool", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Liverpool"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Liverpool"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lyndon_Dykes", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Lyndon Dykes"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steve_Clarke", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Steve Clarke"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Munich", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Munich"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Munich"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Germany"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Germany", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Germany"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Germany"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nathan_Patterson_(footballer)", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Nathan Patterson (footballer)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aaron_Hickey", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Aaron Hickey"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scotland_national_football_team", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Scotland national football team"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Queens_Park_Rangers_F.C.", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Queens Park Rangers F.C."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single-elimination_tournament", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Single-elimination tournament"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Paintball/Teams", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Paintball/Teams", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Robotics/Competitions", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Robotics/Competitions", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games", "label": "dmoz/Games", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Hand-Eye_Coordination", "label": "dmoz/Games/Hand-Eye Coordination", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Crafts/Candles", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Crafts/Candles", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 82}], "image": "https://www.heraldscotland.com/resources/images/18193466/", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9648341", "eventUri": "eng-9648341", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1843137254901961, "wgt": 117, "relevance": 1}

What I mean is that Germany are desperate to get off to a flying start, like they did when they were the home side at the 2006 World Cup, to get the country behind them.\n\nI have a feeling Germany will get over the line here, but I think it might be a struggle. People will look at Scotland's recent run of one win in nine games, but Steve Clarke took on some difficult friendlies for a reason, to test his team. I actually like that mindset, even if they ended up losing to France, the Netherlands and England.\n\nIn qualifying they were brilliant, but injuries mean they have got a few decisions to make. Up front, for example, do they go with Che Adams or Lawrence Shankland? Adams is a better all-round centre-forward but Shankland is a lethal finisher.\n\nScotland have some issues at the back too. They are strong in midfield, where their players have all had good seasons, but they will have to be brave on the ball and take chances when they come around.\n\nIf they do that, you never know, but it is going to be very difficult for them to get anything out of this game or get out of this group.", "source": {"uri": "bbc.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "BBC"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scotland", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Scotland"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Scotland"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Germany", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Germany"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Germany"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chris_Sutton", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Chris Sutton"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BBC_Radio_5_Live", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "BBC Radio 5 Live"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euro", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Euro"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hungary", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Hungary"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Hungary"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Switzerland", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Switzerland"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Switzerland"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steve_Clarke", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Steve Clarke"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FIFA_World_Cup", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "FIFA World Cup"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exhibition_game", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Exhibition game"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ch\u00e9_Adams", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Ch\u00e9 Adams"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lawrence_Shankland", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Lawrence Shankland"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/England", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "England"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "England"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Netherlands", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Netherlands"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Netherlands"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/France", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "France"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Browser_Based", "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Browser Based", "wgt": 18}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Downloads", "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Downloads", "wgt": 17}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Board_Games/Historical", "label": "dmoz/Games/Board Games/Historical", "wgt": 18}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Hand-Eye_Coordination", "label": "dmoz/Games/Hand-Eye Coordination", "wgt": 18}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Board_Games/Developers_and_Publishers", "label": "dmoz/Games/Board Games/Developers and Publishers", "wgt": 18}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 71}], "image": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_sport/f9b8/live/b8b256e0-2907-11ef-80aa-699d54c46324.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9648341", "eventUri": "eng-9648341", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.01960784313725494, "wgt": 116, "relevance": 1}

"body": "Click here to follow Mail Sport's Euro 2024 WhatsApp Channel for all the latest breaking news and updates from Germany\n\nThe details of Julian Nagelsmann's contract have been revealed, with the Germany manager reportedly set to pocket over \u00a3300,000 if the Euro 2024 hosts win the tournament.\n\nNagelsmann, 36, signed his contract with the German national team in September 2023 and will be looking to lift his first international trophy on home soil after less than a year in charge.\n\nHaving crashed out at the group stage during the 2022 World Cup -- their last major tournament outing -- the German FA (DFB) will not tolerate another humiliation, especially given Euro 2024 is being played in front of home support.\n\nAccording to German outlet Bild, there is a 'ripcord clause' in Nagelsmann's contract for such an eventuality.\n\nIf Nagelsmann fails to guide Germany to the tournament knockouts, the financially-troubled association can axe him with immediate effect, void any ongoing talk of an extension and boot him out with no severance pay.\n\nThe details of Julian Nagelsmann's Germany contract have been revealed ahead of Euro 2024\n\nAfter Germany crashed out of the 2022 World Cup at the group stage with ex-manager Hansi Flick (above), the DFB have created a 'ripcord clause' for that eventuality under Nagelsmann\n\nAlthough Nagelsmann will earn over \u00a3300,000 if Germany win the Euros, the 'ripcord' clause means he won't receive any severance pay and will be axed instantly after a group stage exit\n\nHansi Flick, who was sacked after Germany's poor display in Qatar, reportedly cost the DFB a lot of money because of the length of his contract, and the association were eager to avoid this scenario when agreeing terms with Nagelsmann.\n\nAnother aspect of the 'ripcord clause' is that only assistant coach Sandro Wagner, 36, would remain as part of Germany's set-up following Nagelsmann's departure.\n\nNagelsmann, who earns \u00a35million per year with Germany, has several success clauses in his contract as well, with one being a \u20ac400,000 (\u00a3337,000) bonus for winning the tournament.\n\nThe players would also receive the same sum should Germany triumph as they last did in 1996.\n\nGermany begin their Euro 2024 campaign against Scotland on Friday, before facing Hungary and Switzerland in their remaining group stage matches.\n\nGermany are gearing up to face Scotland in the Euro 2024 curtain-raiser on Friday evening\n\nToni Kroos is bidding to mark the perfect end to his playing career with

Julian Nagelsmann, the head coach, finalized his roster just ahead of the tournament's kickoff on June 14. The excitement builds as Germany hosts the prestigious event, eager to bounce back from their disappointing performance at the 2022 World Cup in Qatar, where they were eliminated in the group stage for the second consecutive time.\n\nOne setback for the squad came with the late exclusion of rising Bayern Munich talent Aleksandar Pavlovic due to illness. This unexpected change has forced Nagelsmann to adjust his plans as Germany gears up to impress their home supporters. The pressure is palpable on the 2014 World Cup champions to deliver a memorable performance in the Euros, especially under the leadership of Nagelsmann, who took the helm from Hansi Flick in September 2023 amid a series of disappointing results.\n\nAs anticipation mounts among fans and pundits alike, Germany prepares to embark on their quest for European glory amidst high expectations and a fervent desire to showcase their prowess on home soil.\n\nNagelsmann's squad for Euro 2024 presents an intriguing blend of seasoned veterans and relatively inexperienced players, with an average age of 28 highlighting a mix of maturity and emerging talent.\n\nAmong the stalwarts are Thomas Muller and Toni Kroos, whose enduring presence is pivotal despite previous speculations about their international futures. Joining them is Manuel Neuer, the 38-year-old goalkeeper who remains a cornerstone of the team's defensive solidity, alongside captain Ilkay Gundogan, whose leadership will be crucial on and off the pitch.\n\nA notable absentee due to illness was 20-year-old Aleksandar Pavlovic, who had been making waves at Bayern Munich and was set to feature prominently before contracting tonsillitis. His replacement, Emre Can from Borussia Dortmund, steps into a crucial role at the last minute.\n\nMeanwhile, Bayern's Jamal Musiala and Leverkusen's Florian Wirtz represent the youth brigade, already established as key figures in the squad despite their tender ages.\n\nOn the flip side, there are older players with fewer international appearances, such as Stuttgart's Waldemar Anton and Maximilian Mittelstadt, who bring just six caps combined. Pascal Gross of Brighton & Hove Albion adds depth as a relative newcomer to the international scene.\n\nStriker Deniz Undav, who caught the eye during his loan spell at Stuttgart from Brighton in the 2023/24 season, made his senior debut for Germany only in March, illustrating the squad's diverse blend of experience and fresh talent as they aim to make an impact at Euro 2024.\n\nTeams participating in UEFA Euro 2024 have the flexibility to select squads ranging from a minimum of 23 players to a maximum of 26 players. This adjustment marks an increase of three players compared to previous tournament regulations. Interestingly, UEFA's guidelines do not specify a mandatory number of goalkeepers that must be included in the squad, leaving this decision entirely up to the discretion of each national team's coaching staff and selectors.\n\nThis flexibility allows teams to tailor their squads to meet tactical and strategic needs, balancing the number of goalkeepers with outfield players according to their game plan and contingency plans for injuries or other unforeseen circumstances during the tournament. It underscores the importance of strategic squad selection in international football tournaments like Euro 2024, where depth and versatility can often prove decisive factors in a team's success.\n\nAs the host nation of UEFA Euro 2024, Germany was automatically assigned to Group A of the tournament. Joining them in this group are Scotland, Hungary, and Switzerland, determined by the draw.\n\nGermany, ranked 16th by FIFA, holds the highest ranking among the teams in Group A. They are followed by Switzerland, ranked 19th, Hungary at 26th, and Scotland, ranked 39th.\n\nThis ranking hierarchy sets the stage for competitive matchups within Group A, with Germany expected to leverage their higher FIFA ranking and home advantage as they aim to advance through the group stage and pursue success in the tournament.", "source": {"uri": "businessupturn.com", "dataType": "news",

All he said was congratulations.\n\n\"I think he is at the game tomorrow [Germany vs Scotland] so it will be interesting to see who he supports. I'm sure there is only one answer for that. I don't need any advice from him, I think he knows that. Hopefully he can enjoy the game, but hopefully not too much,\" joked the 30-year-old.\n\nGermany versus Scotland will be staged at the Allianz Arena, home of Bayern Munich, a stadium that brings back fond memories for Robertson having experienced a Champions League round of 16 second-leg win there en route to securing a sixth European Cup for Liverpool in 2019.\n\nReflecting on this night, he said: \"The last time I was at this stadium, it was a massive win for us. A lot of people wrote us off when we drew 0-0 at Anfield. To then come here, a very difficult place, to win 3-1 was incredible. It was even more incredible that took us on the journey to go and win the Champions League. There are a lot of good memories here, the game was very important for us to go on the way to winning the trophy.\"\n\nLastly offering an update on his fitness, having recently suffered an injury scare in training, Robertson added: \"[I am] Physically good, mentally good, looking forward to what's ahead.\n\n\"I had an ankle injury from March and I've been nursing it a little bit from then on. It's all good now, we were pretty relaxed about the whole situation but I'm all good to go. Mentally, physically we're all ready and come kick-off we'll be 100 per cent.\"", "source": {"uri": "liverpoolecho.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "Liverpool Echo"}, "authors": [{"uri": "tom_cavilla@liverpoolecho.co.uk", "name": "Tom Cavilla", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andrew_Robertson", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Andrew Robertson"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/J\u00fcrgen_Klopp", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "J\u00fcrgen Klopp"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euro", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Euro"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liverpool", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Liverpool"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Liverpool"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scotland", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Scotland"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Scotland"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Germany", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Germany"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Germany"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tartan_Army", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Tartan Army"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manager_(association_football)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Manager (association football)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Finland", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Finland"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Finland"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Olise", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Michael Olise"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philippe_Coutinho", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Philippe Coutinho"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UEFA_Champions_League", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "UEFA Champions League"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Allianz_Arena", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Allianz Arena"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anfield", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Anfield"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FC_Bayern_Munich", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "FC Bayern Munich"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single-elimination_tournament", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Single-elimination tournament"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Games", "label": "dmoz/Games", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Recreation", "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Recreation", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Software/Educational", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Software/Educational", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/Stadiums", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/Stadiums", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Board_Games/Historical", "label": "dmoz/Games/Board Games/Historical", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 98}], "image": "https://i2-prod.liverpoolecho.co.uk/incoming/article29351582.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_Robertson.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9648341", "eventUri": "eng-9648341", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1843137254901961, "wgt": 113, "relevance": 1}

You can check out at any time. More info\n\nAndy Robertson says Scotland's players are ready to take on the mantle of legends by reaching the knock-out stage of Euro 2024.\n\nOn the eve of the tournament opener against hosts Germany, the skipper insists the sole aim of Steve Clarke 's men is to get out of Group A. They could become the first Scottish team in history to achieve it at a major finals after failed attempts at eight World Cups and three European Championships. Iconic status awaits if they can pull it off - but Robertson is adamant they'll handle the pressure.\n\nAt the Munich Arena, the Liverpool defender said: \"That's what we want (legendary status). That's what we all want and we know that's what's at stake. What's the worst that can happen? Join the list of so many good Scotland teams that failed to get out of the group? The flip side is that we can be the first team ever to do it.\n\n\"We've got lots of incentives but that's the main one. To become a legendary squad, which we would go down as if we made it into the knock-outs. That has to drive us forward. We have a lot of motivation, like every country here.\n\n\"But we can feel how excited everyone is back in Scotland and, for me, that's what's driving us forward - to be the first team to get out of the groups. Because if you do that, you never know what might happen.\n\n\"We have to get there first. We're in a difficult group with three good teams. We have to be at our best in every game to have a chance of doing it. If we are, let's see where we are come June 24.\"", "source": {"uri": "dailyrecord.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "Daily Record"}, "authors": [{"uri": "scott_mcdermott@dailyrecord.co.uk", "name": "Scott McDermott", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scotland", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Scotland"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Scotland"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andrew_Robertson", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Andrew Robertson"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steve_Clarke", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Steve Clarke"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single-elimination_tournament", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Single-elimination tournament"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Germany", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Germany"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Germany"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Athletics_Championships", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "European Athletics Championships"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FIFA_World_Cup", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "FIFA World Cup"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Munich", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Munich"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Munich"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Germany"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liverpool", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Liverpool"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Liverpool"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Paintball/Teams", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Paintball/Teams", "wgt": 19}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Robotics/Competitions", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Robotics/Competitions", "wgt": 17}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Flying_Discs", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Flying Discs", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Flying_Discs/Ultimate_Frisbee", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Flying Discs/Ultimate Frisbee", "wgt": 16}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Education_and_Training/Team_Building", "label": "dmoz/Business/Education and Training/Team Building", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 81}], "image": "https://i2-prod.dailyrecord.co.uk/incoming/article33026744.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_Scotland-Training-Session-and-Press-Conference.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9648341", "eventUri": "eng-9648341", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-06-24", "textStart": 1637, "textEnd": 1644}], "sentiment": 0.04313725490196085, "wgt": 111, "relevance": 1}

He's the one who has looked after you',\" Hendry said.\n\n\"He's been tried and tested and is certainly trusted in the Scotland set-up. That 'goal' in Spain alone - there's no doubt, he's a big player for us.\n\n\"And maybe that is a big plus for Steve Clarke in relation to selecting so many defenders and midfielders because maybe he has got an eye on something like playing McTominay higher up.\"\n\nHendry made 51 appearances for his country between 1993-2001 and won the Premier League title with Blackburn in 1995.\n\nHe was the bedrock for Scotland when they failed to get out of their group at both Euro 96 and the 1998 World Cup and despite the lack of a proven international goalscorer in Germany, he has tipped Clarke's side to progress.\n\n\"We've got the same problem we had back in my day - we don't score enough goals - but I do think this side can do it,\" Hendry added.\n\n\"With the four third-best finishers qualifying for the knockout stages, we've got as good a chance now as we've ever had.\n\n\"But it's important that we don't get beat on Friday night. If we don't, we can go toe-to-toe with Switzerland and Hungary. Player for player, I think we can beat them.\n\n\"But all eyes are on the Germany game. Scotland cannot afford to give anything away at the back.\n\n\"They do at some point need to create a few chances and I think that will happen on Friday night.\"", "source": {"uri": "irishnews.com",

We haven't done ourselves justice in recent tournaments.\n\n\"We hope this time that we benefit somewhat from the euphoria in our home country and the support of the fans, and that this carries us along. But we know we first have to earn the trust of our fans on the pitch. If we do, I think we will go a long way.\"\n\nGermany have begun a new era under 36-year-old head coach Julian Nagelsmann, who has won four, drawn two and lost two of his first eight games in charge since replacing Hansi Flick in September last year.\n\nAnalysing what he believes has changed for Germany since the arrival of Nagelsmann, Gundogan said: \"He has brought structure to the team. He has clear ideas about what he wants but still, there is a calmness about how the coaching team deals with the squad, and there's a sense that they have confidence in the players, which reflects well on us.\n\n\"We knew that not everything would go perfectly, we knew we would make mistakes, but we have always felt that the coach was right behind the team. We have the right set-up and are capable of producing our best, to pay back the confidence he has in us.\"\n\n\u00a9 Reuters\n\nGundogan 'honoured' to captain Germany at home Euros\n\nGundogan has had plenty of success during his club career, most notably winning 14 trophies at Manchester City, but the 33-year-old is yet to claim silverware on the international stage with Germany.\n\nThe 77-cap midfielder was non-playing squad member for Germany at Euro 2012, before missing their 2014 World Cup triumph and run to the semi-finals of Euro 2016 due to injury.\n\nGundogan has been ever-present for Die Mannschaft since then and has now been chosen to captain the national team by Nagelsmann at Euro 2024.\n\n\"It's a huge honour, a huge privilege to be captain,\" said Gundogan. \"I have experienced an awful lot in my career, lots of great times but also lots of difficult times.\n\n\"I kind of know what it takes to be successful. All I can do is lead from the front, both on and off the pitch. I think the people of Germany - not just the fans - deserve some success.\"\n\nGundogan is expected to start and lead his team out as captain when the Euro 2024 hosts face Scotland in their Group A opener at the Allianz Arena on Friday night.\n\nID:545839:1false2false3false:QQ:: from db desktop :LenBod:collect5360:No Data Analysis info", "source": {"uri": "sportsmole.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "Sports Mole"}, "authors": [{"uri": "oliver_thomas@sportsmole.co.uk", "name": "Oliver Thomas", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/\u0130lkay_G\u00fcndo\u011fan", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "\u0130lkay G\u00fcndo\u011fan"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euro", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Euro"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Germany", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Germany"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Germany"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UEFA_European_Championship", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "UEFA European Championship"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FIFA_World_Cup", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "FIFA World Cup"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Italy_national_football_team", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Italy national football team"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/England_national_football_team", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "England national football team"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FIFA", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "FIFA"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Association_football", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Association football"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spain", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Spain"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Spain"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hansi_Flick", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Hansi Flick"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Julian_Nagelsmann", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Julian Nagelsmann"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Football_pitch", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Football pitch"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Midfielder", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Midfielder"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barcelona", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Barcelona"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Barcelona"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Spain"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Allianz_Arena", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Allianz Arena"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manchester_City_F.C.", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Manchester City F.C."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reuters", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Reuters"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scotland", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Scotland"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Scotland"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Paintball/Teams", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Paintball/Teams", "wgt": 16}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Flying_Discs/Ultimate_Frisbee", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Flying Discs/Ultimate Frisbee", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/Competitions", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/Competitions", "wgt": 16}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Tournaments", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Tournaments", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/Statistics", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/Statistics", "wgt": 16}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 98}], "image": "https://sm.imgix.net/24/24/ilkay-gundogan.JPG", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9648341", "eventUri": "eng-9648341", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.3098039215686275, "wgt": 104, "relevance": 1}

They dubbed Germany's dramatic exit as \"the end of a once great and proud soccer nation\". Hyperbole aside, the failure to get out of an admittedly tricky group in Qatar was an embarrassment back home.\n\nGermany may have been a squad stuck partially in between generations, but there were few excuses to be found. This was a group of world-class players, led by a manager in Hansi Flick who two years earlier had led Bayern Munich to a treble. They didn't have to win the World Cup, but Germany were supposed to at least get out of their group. That failure, combined with a run of poor results that followed it, led to Flick being removed from his post in September.\n\nEighteen months on from that World Cup embarrassment, though, it feels like things are moving in the right direction for the Euro 2024 hosts. Julian Nagelsmann, after a tricky start to his tenure, has stripped it all down, entrusted a young core to do its thing, and shed the Bayern Munich loyalties that were arguably holding the side back.\n\nAt the centre of it all is an attacking midfield duo with a combined age of 42. Florian Wirtz and Jamal Musiala are two of the most exciting, incisive talents the sport has to offer, and over the next month, they will line up together for Die Mannschaft, a dynamic partnership challenged with restoring glory to a national team in shame.

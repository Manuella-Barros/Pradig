Insolvency and Companies Court Judge Catherine Burton said Price had received \"very clear warnings\" that she must attend the hearing on July 30.\n\nPrice was due to face questions about her finances in the specialist bankruptcy court in London from barristers representing the trustee of her two bankruptcies. A judge at a previous hearing said the former glamour model risked arrest if she did not attend further court dates, adding that evidence must be provided if she could not appear.\n\nBut the court heard it had been reported that Price had travelled to Turkey. Issuing the arrest warrant, Judge Burton said that Price had provided no explanation for her absence from the court hearing. Judge Burton added that an arrest warrant was not issued \"lightly\", but that Price had offered only \"piecemeal co-operation\" and failed to provide the \"most basic information\" in relation to her

failing to appear at court, and was remanded in custody at a west London police station.\n\nBrighton-born Price will appear at the Royal Courts of Justice on Friday, according to the Metropolitan Police.\n\nIt comes after an arrest warrant was issued by a judge after she failed to attend a hearing relating to her bankruptcies.\n\nPrice, 46, previously said she was \"not running from matters\", but was \"away working for a documentary on corrective surgeries\" during the court hearing.\n\nIn a now-deleted statement on Instagram, Price wrote: \"I am aware that I am about to be detained at the airport which is obviously what the courts feel is necessary.\n\n\"I do hope of course for my sons sake who is with me that they will allow some dignity and protection for at least his sake as this will be extremely disturbing for him to see.\n\n\"Whilst I understand the importance and severity of the matter I do feel like I am being treated like a criminal.\"\n\nPrice was declared bankrupt in November 2019 and again in March this year.\n\nAt a hearing in February, Price was ordered to pay 40 per cent of her monthly income from the adult entertainment website OnlyFans to the trustee for the next three years, in relation to her first bankruptcy.\n\nShe was then declared bankrupt for a second time in March due to an unpaid tax bill worth more than \u00a3750,000 owed to HM Revenue and Customs.\n\nREAD MORE: Inside Katie Price's Mucky Mansion which is up for sale\n\nInsolvency and Companies Court Judge Catherine Burton said Price had received \"very clear warnings\" that she must

judge at a previous hearing said the former glamour model risked arrest if she did not attend further court dates, adding that evidence must be provided if she could not appear.\n\nBut the court heard it had been reported that Price had travelled to Turkey.\n\nIssuing the arrest warrant, Judge Burton said that Price had provided no explanation for her absence from the court hearing.\n\nJudge Burton added that an arrest warrant was not issued \"lightly\", but that Price had offered only \"piecemeal co-operation\" and failed to provide the \"most basic information\" in relation to her bankruptcies.\n\nLast month, photographs showed Price's Mucky Mansion in Dial Post, near Horsham, being repossessed by bailiffs.\n\nPrice failed to keep up with mortgage repayments for the property, which is currently valued at \u00a32.5 million.\n\nShe has moved into a new home in Sussex, near Judy Parfitt who plays Sister Monica Joan in BBC's Call the Midwife.", "source": {"uri":

Courts of Justice in London for a hearing related to her bankruptcies following her arrest at Heathrow Airport.\n\nThe former glamour model arrived on foot through the main entrance wearing a beige outfit and black head covering on Friday, surrounded by photographers, ahead of a hearing due to start at 2pm.\n\nMs Price was detained at Heathrow on her return to the UK on Thursday evening, the Metropolitan Police previously said.\n\nThe 46-year-old's arrest came after a warrant was issued by a judge on July 30 over her failure to attend a previous hearing, where she was due to face questions about her finances in a specialist bankruptcy court.\n\nThe PA news agency understands Ms Price, who was declared bankrupt in November 2019 and again in March this year, was bailed by an out-of-hours magistrate on Thursday night.\n\nFriday's hearing before Deputy Insolvency and Companies Court Judge Daniel Schaffer will be held at the Rolls Building, but Ms Price is expected to attend by video link from an office of High Court enforcement staff at the Royal Courts of Justice nearby.\n\nAt the hearing last month, Insolvency and Companies Court Judge Catherine Burton issued an arrest warrant for Ms Price, claiming she received \"very clear warnings\" that she must attend court.\n\nJudge Burton said that an arrest warrant was not issued \"lightly\" but that Ms Price had offered only \"piecemeal co-operation\" and failed to provide the \"most basic information\" in relation to her bankruptcies.\n\nAt the same hearing, the judge ordered that Ms Price must deliver six of her vehicles to the trustee of her bankruptcies to help pay off money owed, including a pink Range Rover.\n\nFollowing her first bankruptcy in 2019, Ms Price was ordered at a hearing in February this year to pay 40% of her monthly income from the adult entertainment website OnlyFans to the trustee until February 2027.\n\nShe was then declared bankrupt for a second time in March due to an unpaid tax

I don't know what to do on this.\"\n\nShe added: \"I have been asking for legal representation for all of this and no one would do it.\"\n\nMs Price was first declared bankrupt in 2019, and in February this year was ordered to pay 40 per cent of her monthly income from the adult entertainment website OnlyFans to the trustee of her bankruptcy until February 2027.\n\nShe was then made bankrupt for a second time in March due to an unpaid tax bill worth more than \u00a3750,000 owed to the British tax authority, HM Revenue & Customs.\n\nMs Price was due to face questions over her finances from barristers representing the trustee of both bankruptcies last month but did not attend the hearing.\n\nInsolvency and Companies Court Judge Catherine Burton issued an arrest warrant for Ms Price, claiming she received \"very clear warnings\" that she must attend court.\n\nThe court was told that it had been reported that Ms Price had travelled to Turkey, with Judge Burton describing the reason for her absence as \"irrelevant\" and claiming that she had \"no real excuse\" for failing to attend.\n\nShe said that while a warrant was not issued \"lightly\", Ms Price had offered only \"piecemeal co-operation\" and failed to provide the \"most basic information\" in relation to her bankruptcies.\n\nAt the same hearing, the judge ordered that Ms Price must deliver six of her vehicles to the trustee of her bankruptcies to help pay off money owed, including a pink Range Rover.\n\nRSS Syndicated Content Published: Fri 9 Aug 2024, 4:07 PM Last updated: Fri 9 Aug 2024, 4:27

She had been on her way home from Turkey and is expected to appear in court on Friday.\n\nThe holiday goer wrote on the review platform on August 4: \"We're here at the moment and couldn't fault this wonderful hotel until an infamous British 'celebrity' and her entourage arrived and our opinion changed dramatically.\n\n\"Who wants to relax and dine at a hotel looking at someone with blood all over their face, staples holding their scalp on and incisions weeping with puss? Oh and she used the swimming pool as well...\"\n\nLeaving just two stars, the tourist added: \"I'm not sure this hotel should be used as a recovery facility for plastic surgery. It's certainly put me off both visiting again and recommending it to anyone.\"\n\nCem Yal\u00e7\u0131n, the hotel's owner, responded to the feedback diplomatically: 'Thank you for taking the time to let us know about your experience while staying with us. Your experience of your stay is below our standard.\n\n\"Providing the highest level of hospitality is our number one priority and I sincerely apologise for failing to meet your expectations.\n\n\"I have shared your feedback with the whole leadership team to ensure the necessary guidelines are in place and reviewed to prevent from occurring in the future.\n\n\"I hope you choose to stay with us again when your travels bring you back to the area.\"\n\nThe report comes as Price was bailed just hours after she was arrested at Heathrow Airport.\n\nThe PA news agency reported that the TV personality was bailed by an out-of-hours magistrate on Thursday evening.\n\nIt comes after an arrest warrant was issued by a judge after she failed to attend a hearing relating to her bankruptcies.\n\nPrice previously said she was \"not running from matters\", but was \"away working for a documentary on corrective surgeries\" during the court hearing.\n\nIn a now-deleted statement on Instagram, Price wrote: \"I am aware that I am about to be detained at the airport which is obviously what the courts feel is necessary.\n\n\"I do hope of course for my sons sake who is with me that they will allow some dignity and protection for at least his sake as this will be extremely disturbing for him to see.\n\n\"Whilst I understand the importance and severity of the matter I do feel like I am being treated like a criminal.\"\n\nPrice was declared bankrupt in November 2019 and again in March this year.\n\nAt a hearing in February, Price was ordered to pay 40% of her monthly income from the adult entertainment website OnlyFans to the trustee for the next three years, in relation to her first bankruptcy.\n\nShe was then declared bankrupt for a second time in March due to an unpaid tax bill worth more than \u00a3750,000 owed to HM Revenue and Customs.\n\nInsolvency and Companies Court Judge Catherine Burton said Price had received \"very clear warnings\" that she must attend the hearing on July 30.\n\nPrice was due to face questions about her finances in the specialist bankruptcy court in London from barristers representing the trustee of her two bankruptcies.\n\nA judge at a previous hearing said the former glamour model risked arrest if she did not attend further court dates, adding that evidence must be provided if she could not appear.\n\nBut the court heard it had been reported that Price had travelled to Turkey.\n\nIssuing the arrest warrant, Judge Burton said that Price had provided no explanation for her absence from the court hearing.\n\nJudge Burton added that an arrest warrant was not issued \"lightly\", but that Price had offered only \"piecemeal co-operation\" and failed to provide the \"most basic information\" in relation to her bankruptcies.", "source": {"uri": "yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Katie_Price", "type": "person", "score": 5,

The star was arrested in front of her eldest son Harvey Price.\n\nThe 46-year-old glamour model and reality TV star is set to appear at the Royal Courts of Justice today after she was arrested at Heathrow Airport on Thursday. Katie, who recently underwent a \u00a310,000 facelift in Turkey, sported a protective head wrap to keep her stitches in place post-surgery as she was seen speaking with officers in the back of a police van at Heathrow Airport.\n\nHer boyfriend, Married At First Sight star JJ Slater, was also seen arriving back in London last night. The arrest comes after a warrant was issued by a judge after the former glamour model failed to attend a hearing relating to her financial difficulties.\n\nKatie was due to face questions about her finances in the specialist bankruptcy court in London from barristers representing the trustee of her two bankruptcies.\n\nA judge at a previous hearing said the former glamour model risked arrest if she did not attend further court dates, adding that evidence must be provided if she could not appear.

Whilst I understand the importance and severity of the matter I do feel like I am being treated like a criminal.'\n\nPrice's head is currently covered in bandages and black tape following the facelift - her sixth - which she is understood to have had at the Trio Clinic in Istanbul.\n\nPhotographs from last night show the former model being taken away by police after landing at about 7.45pm with her son Harvey, 22, and boyfriend JJ Slater, 31, who was left to pick up her bags.\n\nMembers of the airport's assistance team were seen pushing Harvey in a wheelchair through a corridor in the terminal as he watched his mother being arrested.\n\nPrice, whose head was covered in bandages, was later seen sitting on the edge of a police van before applying lipstick and taking a few puffs of her vape.\n\nThe mother-of-five, who lives in Sussex, failed to appear in front of a judge on July 30 as a part her \u00a3760,000 bankruptcy court proceedings and instead flew to Turkey on holiday for her sixth facelift while staying at a \u00a3133-a-night five-star hotel.\n\nPrice was aware she would be detained at the airport but had asked police that they 'allow some dignity and protection' for Harvey, claiming it would be 'extremely disturbing for him to see'.\n\nIn a statement posted to Instagram earlier this week, Price claimed she had been in Turkey filming a documentary.\n\nShe said on return from work, she would be 'detained at the airport' which is what the 'courts feel is necessary.'\n\nDiscussing her son Harvey, Price asked that authorities 'allow some dignity and protection for at least his sake as this will be extremely disturbing for him to see'.\n\nWhile acknowledging the 'severity' of the matter, Price said she was being treated 'like a criminal' and declared the 'unfortunate financial circumstance' did not make her a 'criminal or bad person'.\n\nDefiantly, Price said she was 'not embarrassed or ashamed' regarding the arrest.\n\nShe explained that her bankruptcy was due to 'serious mental health issues and breakdowns from PTSD'.\n\nShe added that she would be paying back debtors and hoped for 'Harvey's sake it's handled with care and compassion'.\n\nHer statement came after she was ordered to pay \u00a325,000 after being declared bankrupt twice.\n\nA judge at a previous hearing said Price risked arrest if she did not attend further court dates, adding evidence must be provided if she could not appear.\n\nIssuing the arrest warrant , Judge Burton said she had 'failed to attend today's hearing' and had provided no explanation for her absence.\n\nShe said: 'It is in my judgment necessary that the court issue a warrant for Ms Price's arrest.\n\nShe continued: 'The reason for her absence today is irrelevant.'\n\nJudge Burton said that an arrest warrant was not issued 'lightly' but that Price had offered only 'piecemeal co-operation' and failed to provide the 'most basic information' in relation to her bankruptcies.\n\nConfirming Price's arrest yesterday, a Metropolitan Police spokesperson told MailOnline: 'A 46-year-old woman from Surrey was arrested at Heathrow Airport at 7.45hrs on Thursday, 8 August for failing to appear at court.\n\n'She has been remanded in custody at a west London police station to appear at the Royal Courts of Justice tomorrow, Friday, 9 August.'\n\nPreviously, she was served an eviction notice that ordered her to leave her 'Mucky Mansion' by the end of May and has since moved into a \u00a35,000 per month new Tudor-style property.\n\nPrice was declared bankrupt for a second time in March over an unpaid tax bill of \u00a3761,994.05 after first being declared bankrupt in 2019.\n\nHowever, at the end of July she claimed 'everything is sorted' with her second bankruptcy after being evicted from her Sussex bolthole.\n\nPrice flew to Turkey on July 29, sharing a snap of her on a plane just hours before her court hearing the day after.\n\nIt's believed Price - whose \u00a32million home was recently repossessed - was joined on the jaunt by her friend Lou Anderson.\n\nIn Turkey, Price had her sixth facelift, which cost \u00a310,000.\n\nShe is understood to have had the facelift at the Trio Clinic in Istanbul, with work being carried out on her eyes and under her chin.\n\nPrice is also underwent another dental procedure, sharing pictures of her new veneers on Wednesday.\n\nOn Instagram, she posted snaps of her new dental work, wearing sunglasses with the name of the dental surgery 'Dentica' on.\n\nPrice was also seen in Istanbul with Harvey, revealing her latest surgically enhanced looks in a pair of oversized sunglasses, which did little to hide the bandages, staples and surgical tape around her face.\n\nTaking on Instagram on Wednesday last week, Price dismissed recent claims that she has travelled to Turkey after being turned down by other cosmetic surgeons.\n\nShe said: 'I'm filming my new documentary. The reason I've chose the Trio Clinic is because I've had friends who have had surgery there and in my opinion they are the best for what I want doing.\n\n'I can't wait, they're amazing, and they're thorough here.'\n\nShe wrote: 'Whilst I'm currently aware of the severity of my current personal financial situation with my ongoing bankruptcy, I am today shocked that whilst away working for a documentary on corrective surgeries that I should find myself yet again headline news.\n\n'The media in my opinion once again are trying to cause continued humiliation to myself and family. There are far greater and more pressing issues going on around the world that are more important and I'm sure most people are bored reading stories that are constantly misrepresented.\n\n'I have I am continuing to to cooperate with the relevant people on matters to the best of my ability which will be addressed after my return from work.\n\n'Despite consistent stories trying to humiliate me on my personal misfortunes, I am neither embarrassed or ashamed. I own my situation and I am trying my best to work my out of it and put matters right.'\n\nPrice added that she was going through 'challenging times' and was doing 'the best I can' for the sake of her family.\n\nShe wrote: 'I have to continue in my work in order to satisfy these bankruptcy orders which is all I am trying to do right now. I am however not running from matters and will continue to take matters with great seriousness.\n\n'I am doing the best I cam to rectify things during extremely challenging times. Once again I would like to highlight there are far greater and more news worthy stories.\n\n'I will continue to work on my mental health disorders for the sake of my self and my family and do the best I can.'", "source": {"uri": "internewscast.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Internewscast Journal"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heathrow_Airport", "type":

She was then bailed by an out-of-hours magistrate on Thursday evening.\n\nShe had expressed worries that any arrest would be \"extremely disturbing\" for her son Harvey, who was travelling with her, to witness.\n\nDuring the hearing at the Royal Courts of Justice today, Katie told the judge she \"can't hear properly or see much\" and revealed she had no legal representation due to her money woes.\n\nThe judge told the star \"this is a serious matter\" as he read the conditions of her being released from custody and set a new date for her next appearance in court.\n\nKatie must attend a further hearing in relation to her bankruptcies later this month with \"no ifs or buts\", a judge has told her.\n\nThe former glamour model appeared remotely at the hearing at the Rolls Building wearing a beige outfit and a black head covering, to conceal her facelift she had in Turkey.\n\nAccording to The Mirror, Deputy Insolvency and Companies Court Judge Daniel Schaffer ordered Katie to give an \"undertaking\" to the court that she would attend a further hearing to face questions over her finances on August 27 at 10.30am.\n\nHe said: \"You have to attend that date, no ifs or buts, no going abroad, no holidays.\" Katie confirmed that she understood that she must attend and later added: \"I will move my diary for it.\"\n\nJudge Schaffer also discharged the arrest warrant issued against her on July 30 by a different judge after she failed to attend a previous hearing.\n\nPrice previously said she was \"not running from matters\" but was \"away working for a documentary on corrective surgeries\" when the court hearing was due to happen.\n\nShe wrote on a statement on Instagram, which has since been deleted: \"I am aware that I am about to be detained at the airport which is obviously what the courts feel is necessary.\n\n\"I do hope of course for my son's sake who is with me that they will allow some dignity and protection for at least his sake as this will be extremely disturbing for him to see.

Internewscast Journal", "body": "This is the moment Katie Price was arrested at Heathrow Airport last night for failing to appear at court after returning from undergoing a \u00a310,000 facelift in Turkey.\n\nThe 46-year-old former glamour model was remanded into custody at a police station in West London to appear at the Royal Courts of Justice for a hearing today.\n\nPhotographs showed her being taken away by police after landing at about 7.45pm with her son Harvey, 22, and boyfriend JJ Slater, 31, who was left to pick up her bags.\n\nMembers of the airport's assistance team were seen pushing Harvey in a wheelchair through a corridor in the terminal as he watched his mother being arrested.\n\nPrice, whose head was covered in bandages and black tape, was later seen sitting on the edge of a police van before applying lipstick and taking a few puffs of her vape.\n\nThe mother-of-five, who lives in Sussex, failed to appear in front of a judge on July 30 as a part her \u00a3760,000 bankruptcy court proceedings and instead flew to Turkey on holiday for her sixth facelift while staying at a \u00a3133-a-night five-star hotel.\n\nPrice was aware she would be detained at the airport but had asked police that they 'allow some dignity and protection' for Harvey, claiming it would be 'extremely disturbing for him to see'.\n\nIn a statement posted to Instagram earlier this week, Price claimed she had been in Turkey filming a documentary.\n\nShe said on return from work, she would be 'detained at the airport' which is what the 'courts feel is necessary.'\n\nDiscussing her son Harvey, Price asked that authorities 'allow some dignity and protection for at least his sake as this will be extremely disturbing for him to see'.\n\nWhile acknowledging the 'severity' of the matter, Price said she was being treated 'like a criminal' and declared the 'unfortunate financial circumstance' did not make her a 'criminal or bad person'.\n\nDefiantly, Price said she was 'not embarrassed or ashamed' regarding the arrest.\n\nShe explained that her bankruptcy was due to 'serious mental health issues and breakdowns from PTSD'.\n\nShe added that she would be paying back debtors and hoped for 'Harvey's sake it's handled with care and compassion'.\n\nHer statement came after she was ordered to pay \u00a325,000 after being declared bankrupt twice.\n\nA judge at a previous hearing said Price risked arrest if she did not attend further court dates, adding evidence must be provided if she could not appear.\n\nIssuing the arrest warrant , Judge Burton said she had 'failed to attend today's hearing' and had provided no explanation for her absence.\n\nShe said: 'It is in my judgment necessary that the court issue a warrant for Ms Price's arrest.\n\nShe continued: 'The reason for her absence today is irrelevant.'\n\nJudge Burton said that an arrest warrant was not issued 'lightly' but that Price had offered only 'piecemeal co-operation' and failed to provide the 'most basic information' in relation to her bankruptcies.\n\nConfirming Price's arrest yesterday, a Metropolitan Police spokesperson told MailOnline: 'A 46-year-old woman from Surrey was arrested at Heathrow Airport at 7.45hrs on Thursday, 8 August for failing to appear at court.\n\n'She has been remanded in custody at a west London police station to appear at the Royal Courts of Justice tomorrow, Friday, 9 August.'\n\nPreviously, she was served an eviction notice that ordered her to leave her 'Mucky Mansion' by the end of May and has since moved into a \u00a35,000 per month new Tudor-style property.\n\nPrice was declared bankrupt for a second time in March over an unpaid tax bill of \u00a3761,994.05 after first being declared bankrupt in 2019.\n\nHowever, at the end of July she claimed 'everything is sorted' with her second bankruptcy after being evicted from her Sussex bolthole.\n\nPrice flew to Turkey on July 29, sharing a snap of her on a plane just hours before her court hearing the day after.\n\nIt's believed Price - whose \u00a32million home was recently repossessed - was joined on the jaunt by her friend Lou Anderson.\n\nIn Turkey, Price had her sixth facelift, which cost \u00a310,000.\n\nShe is understood to have had the facelift at the Trio Clinic in Istanbul, with work being carried out on her eyes and under her chin.\n\nPrice is also underwent another dental procedure, sharing pictures of her new veneers on Wednesday.\n\nOn Instagram, she posted snaps of her new dental work, wearing sunglasses with the name of the dental surgery 'Dentica' on.\n\nPrice was also seen in Istanbul with Harvey, revealing her latest surgically enhanced looks in a pair of oversized sunglasses, which did little to hide the bandages, staples and surgical tape around her face.\n\nTaking on Instagram on Wednesday last week, Price dismissed recent claims that she has travelled to Turkey after being turned down by other cosmetic surgeons.\n\nShe said: 'I'm filming my new documentary. The reason I've chose the Trio Clinic is because I've had friends who have had surgery there and in my opinion they are the best for what I want doing.\n\n'I can't wait, they're amazing, and they're thorough here.'\n\nShe wrote: 'Whilst I'm currently aware of the severity of my current personal financial situation with my ongoing bankruptcy, I am today shocked that whilst away working for a documentary on corrective surgeries that I should find myself yet again headline news.\n\n'The media in my opinion once again are trying to cause continued humiliation to myself and family. There are far greater and more pressing issues going on around the world that are more important and I'm sure most people are bored reading stories that are constantly misrepresented.\n\n'I have I am continuing to to cooperate with the relevant people on matters to the best of my ability which will be addressed after my return from work.\n\n'Despite consistent stories trying to humiliate me on my personal misfortunes, I am neither embarrassed or ashamed. I own my situation and I am trying my best to work my out of it and put matters right.'\n\nPrice added that she was going through 'challenging times' and was doing 'the best I can' for the sake of her family.\n\nShe wrote: 'I have to continue in my work in order to satisfy these bankruptcy orders which is all I am trying to do right now. I am however not running from matters and will continue to take matters with great seriousness.\n\n'I am doing the best I cam to rectify things during extremely challenging times. Once again I would like to highlight there are far greater and more news worthy stories.\n\n'I will continue to work on my mental health disorders for the sake of my self and my family and do the best I can.'", "source": {"uri": "internewscast.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Internewscast Journal"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heathrow_Airport", "type":

I have been assessed by another high court.\"\n\nJudge Schaffer told her she must make an application to do so, and that she should seek legal advice.\n\nPrice responded: \"Now with the legal advice, I tried to get legal advice but I've been charged \u00a350,000 up front.\n\n\"Now being in a bankruptcy at the moment, the bankruptcy is taking 40 per cent.\n\n\"I'm finding it difficult to do that. I can't get even legal aid because I earn.\"\n\nThe judge told her she simply needed a solicitor which should cost no more than \u00a3500.\n\nHe then snapped: \"This is a discreet application. It doesn't take Einstein to do it.\"\n\nPrice had earlier arrived at court surrounded by photographers for the 2pm hearing.\n\nThe hearing was held at the Rolls Building, but Price attended via a video link from an office of High Court enforcement staff at the Royal Courts of Justice.\n\nShe had been remanded in custody to appear following her arrest last night.\n\nBut the Price was granted bail in the middle of the night by an out-of-hours magistrate.\n\nIt came just days after she had undergone \u00a310,000 worth of surgery on her eyes and under her chin in Istanbul after her usual surgeon refused to carry out the work for her.\n\nAnd despite being aware of the arrest warrant, Price was seen enjoying her holiday as she soaked up sun at a five-star hotel.\n\na source previously revealed Katie extended her trip over fears she would be arrested with staples in her face following the surgery.\n\nThey told The Sun: \"Katie's actually extending her holiday and plans to stay in Turkey longer.\n\n\"She's worried she'll be arrested at the airport when she lands back in the UK and will have to go to jail before the metal staples are taken out of her face.\n\n\"She's really worried she'll be arrested in front of Harvey, and that would upset her.\n\n\"She's better off hiding out in Turkey and recovering there.\"\n\nPrice herself acknowledged she would be arrested upon her return to the UK from holiday.\n\nIn a statement begging for son Harvey's \"protection\", she said: \"I am aware that I am about to be detained at the airport which is obviously what the courts feel is necessary.\n\n\"I do hope of course for my son's sake who is with me that they will allow some dignity and protection for at least his sake.\"\n\nPrice added: \"This will be extremely disturbing for him to see.\n\n\"Whilst I understand the importance and severity of the matter I do feel like I am being treated like a criminal.\"\n\nPrice was declared bankrupt in November 2019 and again in March this year.\n\nAt a hearing in February, she was ordered to pay 40 per cent of her monthly income from the adult entertainment website OnlyFans over the next three years in relation to her first bankruptcy.\n\nShe was then declared bankrupt for a second time in March over an unpaid tax bill worth more than \u00a3750,000.", "source": {"uri": "thesun.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "The

Katie Price was arrested at Heathrow Airport last night for failing to appear at court after returning from undergoing a \u00a310,000 facelift in Turkey.\n\nThe 46-year-old former glamour model was remanded into custody at a police station in West London to appear at the Royal Courts of Justice for a hearing today.\n\nPhotographs showed her being taken away by police after landing at about 7.45pm with her son Harvey, 22, and boyfriend JJ Slater, 31, who was left to pick up her bags.\n\nMembers of the airport's assistance team were seen pushing Harvey in a wheelchair through a corridor in the terminal as he watched his mother being arrested.\n\nPrice, whose head was covered in bandages and black tape, was later seen sitting on the edge of a police van before applying lipstick and taking a few puffs of her vape.\n\nThe mother-of-five, who lives in Sussex, failed to appear in front of a judge on July 30 as a part her \u00a3760,000 bankruptcy court proceedings and instead flew to Turkey on holiday for her sixth facelift while staying at a \u00a3133-a-night five-star hotel.\n\nKatie Price is arrested at Heathrow Airport last night after returning to the UK from Turkey\n\nKatie

at Heathrow Airport last night after returning to the UK from Turkey\n\nPrice was aware she would be detained at the airport but had asked police that they 'allow some dignity and protection' for Harvey, claiming it would be 'extremely disturbing for him to see'.\n\nIn a statement posted to Instagram earlier this week, Price claimed she had been in Turkey filming a documentary.\n\nShe said on return from work, she would be 'detained at the airport' which is what the 'courts feel is necessary.'\n\nDiscussing her son Harvey, Price asked that authorities 'allow some dignity and protection for at least his sake as this will be extremely disturbing for him to see'.\n\nWhile acknowledging the 'severity' of the matter, Price said she was being treated 'like a criminal' and declared the 'unfortunate financial circumstance' did not make her a 'criminal or bad person'.\n\nDefiantly, Price said she was 'not embarrassed or ashamed' regarding the arrest.\n\nKatie Price watches as her son

and breakdowns from PTSD'.\n\nShe added that she would be paying back debtors and hoped for 'Harvey's sake it's handled with care and compassion'.\n\nHer statement came after she was ordered to pay \u00a325,000 after being declared bankrupt twice.\n\nA judge at a previous hearing said Price risked arrest if she did not attend further court dates, adding evidence must be provided if she could not appear.\n\nIssuing the arrest warrant , Judge Burton said she had 'failed to attend today's hearing' and had provided no explanation for her absence.\n\nShe said: 'It is in my judgment necessary that the court issue a warrant for Ms Price's arrest.\n\nKatie Price is arrested at Heathrow Airport last night after returning to the UK from Turkey\n\nKatie Price watches as her son Harvey is helped by a

Burton said that an arrest warrant was not issued 'lightly' but that Price had offered only 'piecemeal co-operation' and failed to provide the 'most basic information' in relation to her bankruptcies.\n\nConfirming Price's arrest yesterday, a Metropolitan Police spokesperson told MailOnline: 'A 46-year-old woman from Surrey was arrested at Heathrow Airport at 7.45hrs on Thursday, 8 August for failing to appear at court.\n\n'She has been remanded in custody at a west London police station to appear at the Royal Courts of Justice tomorrow, Friday, 9 August.'\n\nPreviously, she was

Sussex bolthole.\n\nPrice flew to Turkey on July 29, sharing a snap of her on a plane just hours before her court hearing the day after.\n\nIt's believed Price - whose \u00a32million home was recently repossessed - was joined on the jaunt by her friend Lou Anderson.\n\nIn Turkey, Price had her sixth facelift, which cost \u00a310,000.\n\nShe is understood to have had the facelift at the Trio Clinic

on Instagram on Wednesday last week, Price dismissed recent claims that she has travelled to Turkey after being turned down by other cosmetic surgeons.\n\nShe said: 'I'm filming my new documentary.

The arrest, carried out on Thursday evening, has prompted a stern warning from the judge overseeing her case, emphasizing the seriousness of the matter and the legal obligations Price must now fulfill.\n\nPrice, who has been embroiled in legal and financial troubles for several years, was detained by Metropolitan Police officers at Heathrow Airport around 19:45 BST on Thursday. The arrest was in connection with her failure to attend a court hearing at the Royal Courts of Justice, which had been scheduled to address her bankruptcy issues. An arrest warrant had been issued on 30 July after her non-appearance, sparking concerns about her commitment to resolving her legal problems.\n\nThe former model, who rose to fame in the late 1990s and early 2000s, was held at a west London police station after her arrest. However, she was later bailed that same evening, allowing her to appear in court the following day. On Friday afternoon, Price arrived at the Royal Courts of Justice, where she faced Deputy Insolvency and Companies Court Judge Daniel Schaffer. The judge, clearly frustrated by her previous absence, set a further hearing date for 27 August and issued a stark warning.\n\nJudge Schaffer was unequivocal in his instructions to Price, stating: \"You have to attend that date, no ifs or buts, no going abroad, no holidays.\" His words underscored the seriousness of the situation, as Price's ongoing legal battles have far-reaching consequences for her financial future. The judge's insistence on her attendance reflects the court's determination to hold her accountable and ensure that the legal process is respected.\n\nIn response to the judge's orders, Price gave an \"undertaking\" to the court, pledging that she would attend the next hearing to answer questions about her finances. She reassured the judge by saying, \"I will move my diary for it,\" indicating her intention to comply with the court's demands. As a result of her promise to appear at the scheduled hearing, the arrest warrant issued against her was discharged.\n\nKatie Price's legal woes are not new; they are the latest developments in a long-standing series of financial difficulties. She was first declared bankrupt in November 2019 after failing to meet her financial obligations. Despite attempts to manage her debts, Price's financial situation deteriorated further, leading to a second bankruptcy declaration in March 2023. This second bankruptcy was primarily due to an unpaid tax bill exceeding \u00a3750,000, a significant sum that highlighted the severity of her financial mismanagement.\n\nIn February 2023, a court ordered Price to pay 40% of her monthly income from the adult entertainment website OnlyFans for the next three years. This arrangement was part of her first bankruptcy settlement and aimed to help repay her creditors. However, despite these efforts, Price's financial challenges have continued to mount, culminating in the recent arrest and court proceedings.\n\nPrice's absence from the 30 July hearing was initially explained by her involvement in a documentary project related to corrective surgeries. She claimed that her absence was not an attempt to evade her responsibilities but rather a result of her work commitments abroad. Reports indicate that she had traveled to Turkey during the time of the scheduled court appearance, further complicating her legal situation.\n\nHowever, Judge Schaffer and the court were not persuaded by her explanations, leading to the issuance of the arrest warrant. The judge had previously given Price \"very clear warnings\" about the necessity of attending court hearings, making her failure to appear all the more significant. Her recent assurances to the court, while a positive step, come after a period of concern over her commitment to resolving her financial issues.\n\nDuring her court appearance on Friday, Price arrived on foot, surrounded by photographers and media personnel. She wore a black head covering and bandages, a stark contrast to her usual glamorous public persona. The hearing itself was held at the Rolls Building, though Price participated remotely via video link from an office within the Royal Courts of Justice, accompanied by another woman she described as an \"appropriate adult.\"\n\nThe public and media reaction to Price's legal troubles has been mixed. Some view her as a celebrity who has fallen from grace, a cautionary tale about the dangers of mismanagement and the pressures of maintaining a public image. Others express sympathy for her, acknowledging the challenges she faces in balancing her personal, professional, and financial obligations.\n\nPrice's social media activity has also drawn attention. In a now-deleted Instagram statement, she acknowledged her impending detention at the airport, stating, \"I am aware that I am about to be detained at the airport which is obviously what the courts feel is necessary.\" This admission, coupled with her arrest and subsequent court appearance, paints a picture of a celebrity struggling to navigate a complex legal landscape.\n\nAs the 27 August court date approaches, all eyes will be on Katie Price to see if she fulfills her promise to attend. The hearing is expected to involve rigorous questioning by barristers representing the trustee of her bankruptcies, who will seek to uncover details about her finances and efforts to repay her debts.\n\nPrice's compliance with the court's orders is crucial, not only for her legal standing but also for her public image. Failure to attend could result in further legal consequences, including the possibility of additional arrest warrants or penalties. On the other hand, her cooperation could help mitigate some of the damage to her reputation and provide a path forward in resolving her financial difficulties.\n\nThe case serves as a stark reminder of the importance of legal accountability, even for high-profile individuals. Katie Price's journey through the legal system is a testament to the challenges of managing personal finances and the consequences of failing to meet legal obligations. As she prepares for her next court appearance, the outcome of this case will likely have significant implications for her future, both personally and professionally.\n\nIn conclusion, Katie Price's recent arrest and court appearance highlight the ongoing challenges she faces in managing her financial and legal affairs. With a new hearing date set and a stern warning from the judge, Price must now navigate the complexities of the legal system with careful attention. The coming weeks will be crucial in determining the next chapter of her life, as she seeks to resolve her bankruptcy issues and move forward from this tumultuous period.", "source": {"uri": "bbntimes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "bbntimes.com"}, "authors": [{"uri": "mihir_gadhvi@bbntimes.com", "name": "Mihir Gadhvi", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heathrow_Airport", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Heathrow Airport"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Katie_Price", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Katie Price"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Royal_Courts_of_Justice", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Royal Courts of Justice"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bankruptcy", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Bankruptcy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arrest_warrant", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Arrest warrant"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metropolitan_Police", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Metropolitan Police"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model_(person)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Model (person)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Insolvency", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Insolvency"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/British_Summer_Time", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "British Summer Time"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Police_station", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Police station"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Celebrity", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Celebrity"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/London", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "London"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "London"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Kingdom", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OnlyFans", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "OnlyFans"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Settlement_(litigation)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Settlement (litigation)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sex_industry", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Sex industry"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Creditor", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Creditor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Documentary_film", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Documentary film"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turkey", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Turkey"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Turkey"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rolls_Building", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Rolls Building"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standing_(law)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Standing (law)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trustee", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Trustee"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barrister", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Barrister"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Accountability", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Accountability"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Penalty_shoot-out_(association_football)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Penalty shoot-out (association football)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Instagram", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Instagram"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_media", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Social media"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Law", "label": "dmoz/Society/Law", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Law/Legal_Information", "label": "dmoz/Society/Law/Legal Information", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Law", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Law", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 94}], "image": "https://www.bbntimes.com/images/articles/society/Katie_Price_Warned_by_Judge_After_Failing_to_Appear_in_Court.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9802849", "eventUri": "eng-9802849", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-07-30", "textStart": 900, "textEnd": 907, "freq": 2}, {"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-08-27", "textStart": 1466, "textEnd": 1475, "freq": 2}, {"amb": false, "date": "2019-11-", "textStart": 2517, "textEnd": 2530}], "sentiment": -0.1215686274509804, "wgt": 154, "relevance": 1}

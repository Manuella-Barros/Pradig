The Liberal Democrats leader said his party agreed with Labour's pledge to allow 16 and 17-year-olds to vote. Sir Ed told the PA news agency: \u201cThe Liberal Democrats have long supported votes from 16 and I\u2019m glad other parties are now catching up with us. \u201cAll I\u2019d say is as political reforms go, it\u2019s an important one but it\u2019s quite small. We need to transform our politics. \u201cAs for this distraction of a policy by the Conservatives on national service, the hypocrisy is just breath-taking. \u201cWhat we need is full-time, professional, highly trained troops. We\u2019ve got the best army in the world and we should be backing it.\u201d On Saturday, while on the General Election campaign trail, Sir Ed said that the British political system was \"broken\". He added: \u201cI think we\u2019ve all seen the last few years that unless we transform our political system, we won\u2019t get the changes in our health service and our economy and the environment that we need.

The Polish superstar, ranked world No.1, has been an almost unstoppable force on the WTA Tour for years and is known for producing her best tennis on clay courts. Roland-Garros is the only major tournament played on the clay surface \u2013 and of the six times Swiatek has played in the main draw \u2013 she\u2019s now landed four titles. She beat 12th-seed Paolini 6-2 6-1 on court Philippe-Chatrier on Saturday, barely breaking a sweat as she wrapped up the victory to bag her fifth major title in total. It was Paolini who surprisingly produced the first break of the match in game three of the opening set \u2013 but Swiatek responded instantly with a break to love. Swiatek made it a double break and followed it up with a comfortable hold to lead 5-2, with her third break seeing her wrap up the first set in just 34 minutes. Her dominance flowed into the second set as an early break and two quick holds saw Swiatek go 3-0 up in a flash.

Swiatek\u2019s French Open debut saw her reach the fourth round in 2019 before she clinched the trophy in 2020, 2022, 2023 \u2013 and remarkably now again in 2024. She has only ever lost two matches at Roland-Garros and is firmly establishing herself as the \u2018Queen of Clay\u2019 in the women\u2019s singles. Iga Swiatek following in Rafael Nadal's footsteps \u2018Four French Opens by the age of 23 is exactly what Rafael Nadal did,\u2019 presenter and commentator Jonathan Overend told Sky Sports. \u2018I\u2019m not saying she\u2019s going to go on and win 14 \u2013 that would truly be something. But her domination on this surface has certainly appeared. This season she won Madrid, Rome and now Roland-Garros back-to-back. Phenomenal.\u2019 She still has some way to go to match Nadal\u2019s incredible haul of 14 French Open titles in the men\u2019s singles with the Spaniard famously dubbed the \u2018King of Clay\u2019. But comparisons have already been drawn between Swiatek and Nadal and she was asked about it ahead of Saturday\u2019s final. \u2018We\u2019ll see in 14 years if the journey is similar!\u2019 Swiatek said. \u2018I mean, that\u2019s obviously really nice for me. I would never expect anybody to compare me to Rafa because for me he\u2019s above everybody, and he\u2019s a total legend. Iga Swiatek wants to match Rafael Nadal\u2019s French Open legacy (Picture: Getty) \u2018Yeah, as I said, we\u2019ll see in couple of years, but I\u2019m proud of myself that I\u2019m playing consistently here and that I\u2019m mentioned in the same sentence as Rafa. That\u2019s cool.\u2019 Swiatek only dropped one set at the French Open in 2024, which came in her second-round win over four-time Grand Slam champion Naomi Osaka. She also comfortably eliminated Wimbledon champion Marketa Vondrousova in the last eight as well as US Open winner Coco Gauff in the semi-finals.", "summary": "Her third Roland-Garros trophy in a row!", "url": "https://metro.co.uk/2024/06/08/iga-swiatek-dominates-french-open-final-ramp-rafael-nadal-comparisons-20996890/", "image": "https://metro.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/GettyImages-2156559425.jpg?quality=90&strip=all", "video": null, "publish_date": "2024-06-08 14:21:18", "author": "Liam Grace", "authors": ["Liam Grace"], "language": "en", "catgory": "sports", "source_country": "gb", "sentiment": 0.106}

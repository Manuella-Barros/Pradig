Campbell was competing at Bicton International Horse Trials when her mount Global Quest came down at the log into water obstacle.\n\nImmediate assistance was provided by medical professionals at the Devon cross-country course, but sadly it was later confirmed to be a fatal accident. At the time, equestrian participants from across the world had been left devastated by the loss of Australian dressage rider Patterson.\n\nThe Grand Prix competitor suffered severe head trauma in a routine training session several weeks ago. Local reports state it left him in a coma and he unfortunately succumbed to his injuries on Saturday.\n\nTributes have been paid to both riders, with Shane Rose Evening posting on social media: \"We are absolutely devastated to hear about the tragic loss of two beautiful people in the past few days. Our thoughts, love and condolences are with all of Elliot Patterson and Georgina Campbell's family and friends.\"\n\nA representative for Sheridan Sport Horses wrote: \"Another bright light has been dimmed, so sad. Elliot Patterson along with Georgie Campbell this weekend. Both in separate tragic accidents doing what they love.. Georgie whilst evening at Bicton and Elliot while walking his dressage horse off on a long rein, after a training session in Sydney. So very very sad and sobering. Condolences to all connected.\"\n\nPatterson was described as a talented trainer who ran a performance centre in Queensland with his fiancee Alexis Hellyer.\n\n\"Elliot had an accident at the end of a routine session,\" she told Eurodressage. \"Whilst cooling the horse off on a long rein at walk, the horse spooked sideways and lost its back legs and landed on the right side. Elliot was wearing a helmet.\"\n\nA regular at the Australian Young Horse Championships, after switching to dressage in his teenage years, the horseman competed on the international stage. In 2023, Patterson showed the couple's Australian Hanoverian Del Piero ZF equine at Grand Prix level.\n\nCampbell, who also became in interest in her sport at a young age, competed on Global Quest throughout his time in eventing. They won a CCI4*-L event at Ligni\u00e8res in France and had multiple national and international accolades.\n\nInitially a top-level showing rider, Campbell represented Great Britain on Nations Cup teams and appeared at several five-star events. She was based in Kent with her husband, New Zealand horse rider Jesse Campbell - and also had links to other disciplines including horse racing.\n\nAccompanying a picture of her leading up a horse at a point-to-point, a Facebook post from Midlands Pointing said yesterday: \"We are devastated to hear of the death of Georgie Campbell (nee Strang) this afternoon at Bicton Horse Trials. Although known for her eventing Georgie also had pointing connections and will be sorely missed by many. RIP.\"\n\nBritish Eventing released a statement following the incident, which led to a delay and an abandonment of the Devon event.\n\n\"It is with deepest regret that we announce that Georgie Campbell (GBR) suffered a fatal accident whilst competing at the Bicton International Horse Trials in Devon, England on Sunday 26 May 2024. Medical professionals attended immediately following her fall at fence 5b however, unfortunately, she could not be saved,\" it read.\n\n\"The horse, Global Quest, was assessed by the on-site vets and walked back to the stable and is uninjured.

She had the honour of representing Great Britain multiple times in Nations Cup teams and took part in several five-star events, the highest level in eventing.\n\nIn December 2020, she tied the knot with fellow equestrian Jesse Campbell, who represented New Zealand at the Tokyo Olympics in 2021.

Her debut as a competitor was at the Land Rover Burghley Horse Trials in 2010, according to an equestrian blog out of the United Kingdom.\n\nFrom that moment on, she competed in over 200 events, according to the BBC, winning six. She married fellow equestrian, Jessie Campbell, in 2020. Jessie competed for New Zealand in the 2020 Tokyo Olympics and plans to return this summer in Paris.\n\nThe topic of rotational falls in horse riding is in the news after Campbell's death was announced, though it remains unclear if that is what happened here.\n\nA rotational fall is when a horse runs into the fence throwing it and the rider forward before landing on top of the rider.

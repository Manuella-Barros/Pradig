So, as we approach the last five days of Tory rule, here\u2019s a quick rundown of some of the highlights of the past decade and a half of self-serving, sleazy incompetence guising as the government of this country. In 2010, David Cameron and Nick Clegg announce the dawn of a new politics as they launch their coalition government. This leads to five years of the Conservatives totally ignoring the Lib Dems, and leaves Nick Clegg with lower popularity ratings than Harold Shipman. In 2014, Cameron launches Project Fear to terrify the Scottish electorate into voting to stay in the UK, claiming an independent Scotland would not be a member of the EU 2015, and Cameron sweeps to power on the back of the Lib Dems becoming politically toxic due to their association with David Cameron. He announces a referendum on membership of the EU and cranks Project Fear into action one more time. This time it doesn\u2019t work and Scotland finds itself no longer a member of the EU, due to David Cameron. Cameron resigns and Teresa May becomes Prime Minister. She vows that Brexit means Brexit, whatever that means. She calls a snap election in 2017 in which she only just manages to scrape past a Labour Party led by an unhinged zealot dressed like a geography teacher. Stage sets fall apart when she addresses conference. She poses for a photo opportunity sitting behind the wheel of a driverless car, a perfect metaphor of her three years in office. Heading blindly off to nowhere with no-one in control. Looking on aghast at this shambolic incompetence, we reckon we\u2019ll never get a worse Prime Minister than this. How wrong we were. Boris Johnson topples May and leads the Tories into the 2019 election after lying to the Queen and suspending parliament. During the campaign he hides in a fridge to avoid talking to journalists but still wins by a landslide. He then embarks on a three-year binge of bluster, buffoonery and bare-faced lying until even his own party have had enough and he\u2019s replaced by Liz Truss. Truss sets off on a whirlwind six weeks of unbridled insanity during which she manages to tank the economy, bring the pound down to itself lowest ever level on the currency markets and kill the Queen. As Truss is dragged out of Downing Street in a straitjacket, Rishi Sunak stands behind a lectern promising to \u201cunite the country\u201d and govern with \u201cintegrity, professionalism and accountability at every level.\u201d OK, there might not have been much integrity or professionalism on show for the past 18 months, but he\u2019s certainly united the country. Just not in the way he wanted. Nobody could have predicted these events fourteen years ago, let alone bet on them happening. The next five days are much more predictable. Vote wisely.", "summary": "A week from now we will have a new government, unless the polls have got it spectacularly wrong or unless the vote has been rigged by some gambling syndicate comprising the Conservatives\u2019 campaign leader, the Secretary of State for Scotland, various random Tory candidates and half of the Metropolitan Police.", "url": "https://www.edinburghnews.scotsman.com/news/opinion/columnists/youd-better-believe-sunaks-spin-on-14-years-of-tory-rule-isnt-working-vladimir-mctavish-4682644", "image": "https://www.edinburghnews.scotsman.com/webimg/b25lY21zOjE4NzFmMzJmLTc2NDktNDBmYy1hZGIyLTZkYWVlMzAwZWMxODozNGExODNiNS1mZjBjLTQ1NWMtOGQ5OC1iMTFiYmFmZDk4Yjk=.jpg?width=1200&enable=upscale", "video": null, "publish_date": "2024-06-29 06:00:00", "author": "Vladimir McTavish", "authors": ["Vladimir McTavish"], "language": "en", "source_country": "gb", "sentiment": -0.43}

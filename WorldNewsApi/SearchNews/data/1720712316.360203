But he doesn\u2019t fault Los Angeles third baseman Kik\u00e9 Hern\u00e1ndez for making an error Friday night as he was speaking with broadcasters on the Apple TV+ telecast in the second inning at Yankee Stadium. \u201cI understand it\u2019s part of sports now. And so unfortunately, Kik\u00e9 made an error. It\u2019s not the only error he\u2019s ever made,\u201d Roberts said Saturday. \u201cIt\u2019s part of sports, so I\u2019m not going to \u2014 I pick my battles.\u201d Hern\u00e1ndez had a microphone and earpiece in his left ear as he spoke with Wayne Randazzo and former big pitcher Dontrelle Willis on the broadcast. After talking about Hern\u00e1ndez\u2019s decision to wear colorful cleats and the atmosphere in the ballpark, there was one out, no one on and a 1-2 count on Gleyber Torres when Willis asked: \u201cYou guys are (a) very close-knit ballclub. Where does that come from?\u201d Torres hit a grounder to third, prompting Willis to say: \u201cAfter this play.\u201d The ball hit Hern\u00e1ndez on his bare right hand and ricocheted off his groin. By the time he recovered and threw to first, Torres had crossed the bag. Roberts initially wasn\u2019t aware Hern\u00e1ndez was being interviewed while in the field. Asked if he went back and watched the exchange afterward, Roberts said: \u201cNo. God no. Hearing about it was plenty.\u201d And he has no plans to talk to Hern\u00e1ndez about it. \u201cHe prepares. I know he likes the limelight. He\u2019s into the social media thing,\u201d Roberts said. \u201cHe still plays hard, practices hard, but he also likes to build his brand, so I get it. I\u2019m OK with it. He plays his butt off.\u201d Asked after the game whether the interview impacted him on the play, Hern\u00e1ndez responded: \u201cMaybe a little bit, but I think I let the ball eat me up. It had a weird hop.\u201d Hern\u00e1ndez said he wouldn\u2019t reconsider whether to do in-game interviews in the future. \u201cNo, because we\u2019re getting paid,\u201d he said. \u201cI like money.\u201d Baseball\u2019s collective bargaining agreement calls for a player to receive a $10,000 stipend for wearing a two-way microphone for at least one inning of a regular-season game. The amount rises to $15,000 in the postseason. Roberts said even that wouldn\u2019t sway him if he were playing. \u201cTo each his own,\u201d he said with a smile. Torres reached third on Trent Grisham\u2019s two-out single but was stranded when Jose Trevino struck out. Los Angeles won 2-1 in 11 innings. Hern\u00e1ndez was back in the lineup Saturday night, batting eighth. He homered off New York Yankees starter Nestor Cortes and made a nice defensive play at third base in the Dodgers\u2019 11-3 victory.", "summary": "<p>During his playing days, Dodgers manager Dave Roberts says, he would not have volunteered to be interviewed on live television in the middle of a major league game</p>\n<p>The post <a href=\"https://www.boston.com/sports/mlb/2024/06/09/dodgers-manager-dave-roberts-gives-kike-hernndez-pass-fielding-error-tv-interview/\">Dodgers manager Dave Roberts gives 3B Kik&eacute; Hern&aacute;ndez a pass on fielding error during TV interview</a> appeared first on <a href=\"https://www.boston.com\">Boston.com</a>.</p>", "url": "https://www.boston.com/sports/mlb/2024/06/09/dodgers-manager-dave-roberts-gives-kike-hernndez-pass-fielding-error-tv-interview/", "image": "https://bdc2020.o0bc.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Kike-Hernandez-6665b3dd9630f-768x432.jpg", "video": null, "publish_date": "2024-06-09 13:40:00", "author": "Associated Press", "authors": ["Associated Press"], "language": "en", "source_country": "US", "sentiment": -0.081}

Soon after that, as authorities began investigating what had happened, Peters and her attorney advised Brown and another employee to buy disposable cellphones known as burner phones so their conversations with her and lawyers could not be discovered by investigators and urged them not to talk to law enforcement, Brown said.\n\nAfter Brown was indicted and turned herself in, Peters came to visit her at jail the same day, she said.\n\n\"She came in and she said, 'I love you, you have support, and don't say anything,'\" said Brown, who said Peters also gave her the number of an attorney who could represent her in court for her bail hearing. Brown eventually got another attorney and pleaded guilty under a plea deal that required her to testify against Peters.\n\nPeters' attorneys argue she only wanted to preserve election data before the system got a software update and did not want that information shared with the world. They say she was acting under her authority as clerk and did not break any laws.\n\nProsecutors, meanwhile, have portrayed Peters as someone who had become \"fixated\" on voting problems after becoming involved with activists who had questioned the accuracy of the 2020 presidential election results, including Douglas Frank, an Ohio math teacher who worked for MyPillow founder Mike Lindell. The defense says she was a responsive public official who wanted to be able to answer questions about the election in her community in western Colorado's Mesa County, a Republican stronghold that voted for Donald Trump in the election.\n\nProsecutors allege the plan to take an image of the voting system's hard drive was hatched during an April 2021 meeting with Frank, Peters and others in her office when he was in town to give a presentation on voting fraud. On a secret recording made by another elections employee, Frank told Peters that uncovering corruption in her voting system and cleaning it up would be \"a feather in your cap.\" Peters invited Frank to come back the following month for the software update for the county's voting machines. Frank said he could instead send a team that's \"the best in the country.\"\n\nAccording to prosecutors, Frank sent a retired surfer from California and fellow Lindell associate, Conan Hayes, to take an image of the hard drive before and after the software update. Peters is accused of passing Hayes off as an elections employee using another person's badge, a person she allegedly pretended to hire only so she could use the badge to get Hayes in to also observe the update. The Colorado Secretary of State's office, which facilitated the update being done with Dominion, had denied Peters' requests to have an outside computer expert to be in the room.\n\nHayes has not been charged with a crime. He did not respond messages left at telephone numbers listed for him and to an email seeking comment about the allegations.\n\nThe defense claims that Peters thought Hayes was working as a government informant and that he only agreed to help her if his identity was concealed. Judge Matthew Barrett has barred the defense from discussing that claim in front of jurors. Prosecutors say there's no evidence to support that Hayes was an informant. Barrett has also ruled that, even if Peters believed he was, it is not an excuse for what she is accused of doing.\n\nAfter lawyer Amy Jones, a former Ohio judge, suggested that Peters believed Hayes was an informant during opening statements, Barrett told jurors to \"put that out of your minds.\" After the jury left, he scolded the defense for bringing it up despite his prior order not to introduce it.\n\nPeters is charged with three counts of attempting to influence a public servant, criminal impersonation, two counts of conspiracy to commit criminal impersonation, one count of identity theft, first-degree official misconduct, violation of duty and failing to comply with the secretary of state.\n\nThe trial is expected to continue through early next week.\n\nCopyright 2024 The Associated Press.

Soon after that, as authorities began investigating what had happened, Peters and her attorney advised Brown and another employee to buy disposable cellphones known as burner phones so their conversations with her and lawyers could not be discovered by investigators and urged them not to talk to law enforcement, Brown said.\n\nAfter Brown was indicted and turned herself in, Peters came to visit her at jail the same day, she said.\n\n\"She came in and she said, 'I love you, you have support, and don't say anything,'\" said Brown, who said Peters also gave her the number of an attorney who could represent her in court for her bail hearing. Brown eventually got another attorney and pleaded guilty under a plea deal that required her to testify against Peters.\n\nPeters' attorneys argue she only wanted to preserve election data before the system got a software update and did not want that information shared with the world. They say she was acting under her authority as clerk and did not break any laws.\n\nProsecutors, meanwhile, have portrayed Peters as someone who had become \"fixated\" on voting problems after becoming involved with activists who had questioned the accuracy of the 2020 presidential election results, including Douglas Frank, an Ohio math teacher who worked for MyPillow founder Mike Lindell. The defense says she was a responsive public official who wanted to be able to answer questions about the election in her community in western Colorado's Mesa County, a Republican stronghold that voted for Donald Trump in the election.\n\nProsecutors allege the plan to take an image of the voting system's hard drive was hatched during an April 2021 meeting with Frank, Peters and others in her office when he was in town to give a presentation on voting fraud. On a secret recording made by another elections employee, Frank told Peters that uncovering corruption in her voting system and cleaning it up would be \"a feather in your cap.\" Peters invited Frank to come back the following month for the software update for the county's voting machines. Frank said he could instead send a team that's \"the best in the country.\"\n\nAccording to prosecutors, Frank sent a retired surfer from California and fellow Lindell associate, Conan Hayes, to take an image of the hard drive before and after the software update. Peters is accused of passing Hayes off as an elections employee using another person's badge, a person she allegedly pretended to hire only so she could use the badge to get Hayes in to also observe the update. The Colorado Secretary of State's office, which facilitated the update being done with Dominion, had denied Peters' requests to have an outside computer expert to be in the room.\n\nHayes has not been charged with a crime. He did not respond messages left at telephone numbers listed for him and to an email seeking comment about the allegations.\n\nThe defense claims that Peters thought Hayes was working as a government informant and that he only agreed to help her if his identity was concealed. Judge Matthew Barrett has barred the defense from discussing that claim in front of jurors. Prosecutors say there's no evidence to support that Hayes was an informant.

Shortly afterward, as authorities began investigating what had happened, Peters and her attorney advised Brown and another employee to buy disposable phones, known as burner phones, so their conversations with her and attorneys couldn't be discovered by investigators and urged them not to talk to police, Brown said.\n\nAfter Brown was accused and turned himself inPeters came to visit her in prison that same day, she said.\n\n\"She came in and said, 'I love you, you've got support, and don't say anything,'\" said Brown, who said Peters also gave her the number of an attorney who could represent her in court for her bail hearing. Brown eventually got a different attorney and pleaded guilty under a plea agreement that required her to testify against Peters.\n\nPeters' attorneys argue that she only wanted to preserve election data before the system received a software update and did not want that information shared with the world. They say she was acting under her authority as clerk and did not violate any laws.\n\nMeanwhile, prosecutors have portrayed Peters as someone who became \"fixated\" on voting issues after she became involved with activists who questioned the accuracy of the 2020 presidential election results, including Douglas Frank, an Ohio math teacher who worked for MyPillow founder Mike Lindell. The defense says she was a responsive public servant who wanted to be able to answer questions about the election in her community in western Colorado's Mesa County, a Republican stronghold that voted for Donald Trump in the election.\n\nProsecutors allege the plan to image the voting system's hard drive was hatched during an April 2021 meeting with Frank, Peters and others in her office while he was in town to give a presentation on voter fraud. In a secret recording made by another election worker, Frank told Peters that discovering corruption in her voting system and cleaning it up would be \"a feather in your cap.\" Peters invited Frank to return the following month to update the software for the county's voting machines. Frank said he could instead send in a team that was \"the best in the country.\"\n\nProsecutors say Frank sent a retired California surfer and colleague of Lindell's, Conan Hayes, to take an image of the hard drive before and after the software update. Peters is accused of impersonating Hayes as a poll worker using another person's badge, a person she allegedly hired solely so she could use the badge to get Hayes in to observe the update as well. The Colorado Secretary of State's office, which facilitated the update with Dominion, had denied Peters' requests to have an outside computer expert in the room.\n\nHayes has not been charged with a crime. He did not respond to messages left at phone numbers listed for him and to an email seeking comment on the allegations.\n\nThe defense claims that Peters believed Hayes was working as a government informant and that he only agreed to help her if his identity remained secret. Judge Matthew Barrett has barred the defense from discussing that claim before the jury. Prosecutors say there is no evidence to support Hayes being an informant. Barrett has also ruled that even if Peters believed he was, it does not excuse what she is accused of doing.\n\nAfter defense attorney Amy Jones, a former Ohio judge, suggested during opening statements that Peters believed Hayes was an informant, Barrett told jurors to \"put that out of your mind.\" After the jury left, he chided the defense for bringing it up despite his earlier orders not to.\n\nPeters is charged with three counts of attempted influence over a public servant, criminal identity fraud, two counts of conspiracy to commit criminal identity fraud, one count of identity fraud, misconduct of a public servant in the first degree, neglect of duty and failure to comply with the directives of the Secretary of State.\n\nThe trial is expected to last until early next week.", "source": {"uri": "nybreaking.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "NY Breaking News"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wilhelm_Peters", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Wilhelm Peters"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lawyer", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Lawyer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brown_County,_Wisconsin", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Brown County, Wisconsin"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Brown County, Wisconsin"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hard_disk_drive", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Hard disk drive"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colorado", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Colorado"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Colorado"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tina_Peters_(field_hockey)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Tina Peters (field hockey)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crime_boss", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Crime boss"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dominion_Voting_Systems", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Dominion Voting Systems"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sandra_Brown", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Sandra Brown"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rutherford_B._Hayes", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Rutherford B.

Knisley said Peters told her she needed to save the confidential materials because she was afraid the Colorado Secretary of State's office was going to remove them.\n\nPeters told Knisley she believed there might be proof of \"phantom voters\" in the computer files.\n\nPeters doubled down on her legal jeopardy when she had copies of the election-system files and hardware sent to the mystery man, who has been identified several times during the trial as Conan Hayes. Hayes, a former professional surfer, had been recommended by national level stolen-election conspiracy theorists as \"the best in the country\" for hacking into a voting system. Knisley said Peters told her Hayes was a highly qualified consultant.\n\nThe effort to copy election materials and make Mesa County an example of stopping voter fraud collapsed into a saga that included a criminal investigation, national headlines, and a missing clerk after Hayes -- or someone he was associated with -- released Mesa County's information on a website that trafficks in right-wing conspiracy theories.\n\nAll that broke open in August 2021 when Peters flew to a South Dakota cybersecurity symposium put on by MyPillow CEO and election denier Mike Lindell. When Peters learned the Mesa County information was on the internet, she phoned Knisley, who was running the office in Peters' absence, and said she was in big trouble.\n\n\"I'm f -- ked,\" Knisley said Peters told her.\n\nShe said Peters repeatedly told her over the following weeks that she was going to go to jail for what she had done.\n\nA Mesa County grand jury agreed that Peters had committed suspected crimes. She was indicted on seven felony and three misdemeanor counts that allege she participated in identity theft, criminal impersonation, official misconduct, and violating her duties as a county clerk.\n\nAfter several years of delayed trials, Peters, 68, now faces the possibility of decades in prison if she is found guilty of all the charges.\n\nKnisley's damning insider information about Peters' actions in the spring and summer of 2021 was tempered with compliments for her former boss.\n\nUnder cross examination by defense attorney Michael Edminster, Knisley called Peters \"a faithful public servant.\"\n\nShe described her as a stickler for detail and a clerk who followed protocol.\n\nKnisley testified that in 2021, Peters told her she had no recourse but to use outside help to protect her election system -- a scheme that has been detailed by prosecution witnesses in a jury trial that entered its fifth day Tuesday.\n\nKnisley followed her boss's instructions to put her plan into motion. She helped with the scheme to acquire an access badge for a local software engineer named Gerald Wood.\n\nDifferent witnesses in the trial testified that Peters told differing accounts about Wood's role in the county elections office -- stories that were used to obtain an access badge and credentials in his name. Witnesses said Peters told some of them that he was a temporary hire, others that he was a state employee, and some that he was an employee of the motor vehicle division who was transitioning to elections.\n\nWood never served in any role once he had passed the background check and obtained the badge that would provide access to the secure election tabulation room.\n\nWood testified last week that he turned over that badge to Knisley at her request and did not hear from Peters or Knisley again. He testified that he did not know what had happened with his badge until he heard the news about the stolen election files.\n\nKnisley also was indicted in the case. She pleaded guilty to the misdemeanor charges against her in August 2022 and agreed to testify against Peters. She was sentenced to two years of unsupervised probation and the felony charges she faced were dropped.\n\nIn between hours of dry, detailed information about how elections and election equipment work, another former employee of Peters' -- elections manager Stephanie Wenholz -- brought emotion into the courtroom Monday\n\nShe broke down in tears when prosecutor Robert Shapiro with the Colorado Attorney General's office, asked her what happened in the elections office on Aug. 9, 2021. That was the day that Colorado Secretary of State Jena Griswold issued a press release stating that the Mesa County office was under investigation.\n\n\"That day was extremely emotional for all of us,\" Wenholz said. \"It was absolutely heartbreaking when we found out our passwords were leaked.\"\n\nWenholz had evidence related to that. She had recorded a meeting in May when Peters invited stolen-election conspiracists to her office to discuss how to prove voter fraud.\n\nEight people were in that meeting, including Peters' friend Sherronna Bishop, a conspiracy theorist who had been U.S. Rep Lauren Boebert's campaign manager; Douglas Frank, a mathematician on Lindell's payroll who was traveling around the country searching for voter fraud; Maurice Emmer, an Aspen attorney who was friends with Bishop; and four Mesa County election officials. Two of the elections officials were on board with the idea the 2020 election had been stolen. Two did not believe their system contained proof of \"phantom voters.\"\n\n\"That was not correct,\" Wenholz told the court about the theory Frank was promoting.\n\nWenholz turned her recording over to 21st Judicial District Attorney's office investigator James Cannon. That recording helped to move along a case that was already underway and stacking up methodically obtained evidence.\n\nTuesday morning, Dominion Voting Systems' customer success manager David Stah testified about his attendance at the software installation called a trusted build that is at the heart of the case. He said he attended the trusted build because he had heard there was a clerk questioning his company's machines. Stahl attended trusted builds at only two of 62 Colorado counties with Dominion equipment -- Mesa and Delta.\n\nThe remainder performed the routine software upgrades without question.\n\nWhile the step-by-step testimony played out in the courtroom and around 600 people watched the live stream of the trial at any given time on YouTube, Peters' crowd of supporters grew this week with some nationally known voter-fraud figures.\n\nProminent election denier Mark Finchem showed up Monday and Tuesday. He is currently running for a senate seat in Arizona and was recently sanctioned for filing a frivolous lawsuit there. He has ties to Trump's core of stolen-election conspiracists including Rudy Guliani and Michael Flynn.\n\nFinchem showed up with two bodyguards. He said he spoke to a fundraising gathering Sunday at a private home in Mesa County.\n\nA friend of Finchem's said the party attracted about 90 people, most from out of the Mesa County area. Another attendee estimated there were 40 to 50 people there.\n\n\"We have to pay for this circus somehow,\" Finchem's friend said as she pointed towards the courtroom.\n\nFormer Arizona sheriff Richard Mack also attended the trial Monday and Tuesday. Mack is the founder of the Constitutional Sheriffs and Peace Officers Association. He wore shirts promoting the group and pinned a whistle and a plastic medallion to the front. The medallion was inscribed \"Tina Peters Whistleblower.\"\n\n\"Our position is that wrath is raining down on the clerk for doing her job,\" he said outside the courtroom.\n\nMack spoke to a second gathering of Peters' supporters Monday night.\n\n\"I hate injustice,\" Mack said while he waited outside the courtroom during a break.\n\nMarty Waldman, a member of the Constitutional Sheriffs group, called the Peters' trial \"the apex of civilization.\"\n\nHe explained that, in his view, Mesa County's election system is akin to the voting machines currently embroiled in elections in Venezuela that are being called corrupt.\n\n\"Everything that happened in Venezuela is happening in this courtroom here,\" he said. \"If you look at the graphs, they are the same. The algorithms are the same.\"\n\nDefense attorney Daniel Hartman brought some of those conspiracy theories into the courtroom Monday and Tuesday even though 21st Judicial District Judge Matthew Barrett has ruled that topic is not admissible.\n\nWith the jury out of the courtroom, Hartman spent 40 minutes trying to convince Barrett that testimony about Dominion Voting Systems should be allowed and that Peters should be found innocent because she was trying to protect Hayes who he claims is a federal informant. He said it was necessary that Peters protect his identity and that led to the subterfuge with Gerald Wood.\n\nHartman referred to articles in the Gateway Pundit and to elections in Serbia and called the case against Peters \"a mob hit,\" before Barrett ruled again that Peters' trial has nothing to do with the functionality of voting equipment.\" Hartman promised to cite cases to back up his claims but did not offer any cases.\n\n\"You can't engage in a crime to expose a crime,\" Barrett said about Hartman's argument that Peters covered up an unauthorized person's identity only to try to show there were errors in voting machines.\n\nHe called Hartman's arguments, \"irrelevant, misleading, confusing and a waste of time.\"\n\nOutside the courtroom there was another bit of drama when Peters grabbed the arm of a reporter who was trying to snap a photo of her on a cell phone. The reporter for the Colorado Newsline was called to the Mesa County Sheriff's Office Tuesday afternoon for an investigation.While Peters' trial continues, with the prosecution expected to wrap up its case Wednesday or Thursday, the Colorado County Clerks Association is meeting just two blocks away in a city convention center - by coincidence. None of those clerks have shown up to observe the trial in person.", "source": {"uri": "coloradosun.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Colorado Sun"}, "authors": [{"uri": "nancy_lofholm@coloradosun.com", "name": "Nancy Lofholm", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Municipal_clerk", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Municipal clerk"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wilhelm_Peters", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Wilhelm Peters"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rutherford_B._Hayes", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Rutherford B.

As the Grand Junction Sentinel's Charles Ashby reports, Knisley's testimony described the reaction from Peters when she realized that the voting system data she had allowed to be copied and distributed to election conspiracy theorists was now publicly available online-a reaction that makes it painfully clear that Peters knew what she had done was a crime:\n\nBelinda Knisely, who had been Peters' chief deputy during that time, testified at the former clerk's criminal trial Tuesday that Peters knew she had done something wrong when she helped to make copies of election computers and sent them via mail to the election denier she had used to make those copies, Conan Hayes.\n\n\"I'm [f -- -d], I'm going to jail. It's on the internet; it's not supposed to be,\" Knisley said Peters told her just before she boarded a private jet to an election denier symposium the same day her office was being searched by law enforcement.\n\n\"She told me she was going to go to jail in just about every conversation,\" Knisley added. \"She said it to me many times, 'I'm going to go to jail over this.'\"\n\nZeroing in on the identity theft and criminal impersonation charges against Peters, Knisley described the process by which Gerald Wood, a Fruita-based \"computer consultant,\" was issued a county identity card to access the secure area where voting machines were stored-a card that was immediately taken back from Wood and later given to another person, election conspiracy theorist Conan Hayes:\n\n\"I was told she was going to bring someone else in instead of Gerald Wood,\" Knisley said. \"I did question it when I was told. I was told by Peters that no one is going to look at the badge that close. [Pols emphasis] She did not give me any information about the individual other than it was somebody that knew computers and software.\"\n\nKnisley also testified that Peters' close friend and far-right political activist Sherronna Bishop \"ordered\" Knisley to remove an affected computer before the cops could get it, which Knisley wisely refused to do in part because Sherronna Bishop was never at any point her boss. Knisley says that Peters even told her to buy a \"burner\" cell phone to ensure her conversations weren't using official subpoenable channels. In Knisley's sworn affidavit accompanying her testimony, she says Peters asked her to lie to Mesa County human resources about Wood's ID card. Knisley's testimony further underscores that from misusing Wood's access card to allowing outside actors to copy the voting system data, Peters fully understood what she was doing was wrong. This was not the proper way for a public official to \"investigate\" any reasonable suspicion of impropriety. This testimony effectively shatters the contention by the defense that Peters believed she was acting in good faith in accordance with her official responsibilities.\n\nBefore Knisley's testimony, it might have been possible for jurors to form the opinion that Peters was duped by irresponsible actors like Mike \"MyPillow Guy\" Lindell and former Overstock.com CEO Patrick Byrne, not to mention Donald Trump himself, into believing she was committing an act of superseding patriotism that would prove the 2020 presidential election had been stolen-thus vindicating any \"minor\" criminal transgressions that might have occurred along the way. But with Knisley's side of the story, it's clear now that Peters was very much the lucid conspirator in this plot that (once again) failed to produce any redemptive evidence of election fraud.\n\nIt's the testimony we've been waiting for ever since Knisley copped a plea all the way back in August of 2022, and it's as devastating as we've predicted through all these years of delay and denial it would be. It's harder than ever to see how this ends well for Peters, who had every opportunity instead of employing every trick in the book to delay justice to make a plea agreement to reduced charges of her own: in exchange for the simple admission that what she did was wrong.\n\nBut that would have spelled the end of Peters' MAGA election conspiracy circuit stardom. Instead, Peters invites the full weight of punishment by the court in the hope that her criminally bad judgment will be remembered as heroic.\n\nThis will not be the first career that Donald Trump's \"Big Lie\" has ruined, but Peters also made choices that brought her to this moment.", "source": {"uri": "coloradopols.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Colorado Pols"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wilhelm_Peters", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Wilhelm Peters"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conan_(talk_show)", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Conan (talk show)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Climate_change_denial", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Climate change denial"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rutherford_B._Hayes", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Rutherford B.

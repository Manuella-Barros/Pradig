The rescues come after a morning of strikes in Central Gaza. Videos show dozens of people in the emergency department at Al Aqsa Martyrs hospital, the region's only functioning hospital. Hamas called it an \"unprecedented brutal attack\" and said there are \"dozens of martyrs and wounded in the streets\" although they do not yet know how many people were killed and injured in the attack. The rescued hostages have been transferred to the 'Sheba' Tel-HaShomer Medical Center and are in good condition, the IDF said. -ABC News\u2019 Victoria Beaule", "summary": "More than seven months after Hamas terrorists invaded Israel on Oct. 7, the Israeli military continues its bombardment of the neighboring Gaza Strip.", "url": "https://abcnews.go.com/US/live-updates/israel-hamas-war-gaza-cease-fire-talks/?id=110759922", "image": "https://s.abcnews.com/images/International/israel-gaza-16-gty-gmh-240606_1717699316917_hpMain_16x9_1600.jpg", "video": null, "publish_date": "2024-06-08 13:16:34", "author": "Nadine El-Bawab", "authors": ["Nadine El-Bawab"], "language": "en", "catgory": "politics", "source_country": "US", "sentiment": -0.215}

The German announced his decision to step down after nine years at Anfield in January, with the intention of taking a sabbatical from football.\n\nWhile Klopp was adamant that he not make a premature return to the dugout after leaving the Reds, that hasn't stopped him from being linked with a number of jobs so far - including the England manager's job after Gareth Southgate's resignation.\n\nHowever, he has reiterated that he has no intention of cutting short his sabbatical to return to management anytime soon.\n\n\"Nothing at all. Job-wise, nothing at all,\" the former Liverpool boss said at the International Coaches' Congress in Wurzburg when asked if his advisor, Marc Kosicke, had presented any offers to him. \"No club, no country.

eight and a half years at Anfield.\n\nMeanwhile, he would win every major honour with the Reds, including leading them to the first English title in 30 years, a sixth European Cup, and being crowned champions of the world for the first time in the club's history.\n\nBut while Liverpool managed to lure Klopp out of his last sabbatical after just five months nine years ago, the 57-year-old remains adamant that history will not repeat itself as he continues to enjoy life after the Reds.\n\nHe has enjoyed a busy summer since leaving Liverpool, with highlights including Klopp attending a Taylor Swift concert at Anfield, the Champions League final at Wembley and the final of the tennis Mallorca Championships after moving to the Spanish island.\n\nArne Slot was confirmed as Klopp's replacement at Liverpool earlier this summer and will lead the Reds against Premier League opposition for the first time on Wednesday night when his side lock horns with Arsenal in their second friendly of their

When he does, it'll be on his own terms, and whichever club/federation hires him will be incredibly fortunate to have him.", "source": {"uri": "empireofthekop.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Empire of The Kop"}, "authors": [{"uri": "liam_togher@empireofthekop.com", "name": "Liam Togher", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [], "categories": [], "image": "https://icdn.empireofthekop.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/liverpool-fc-training-session-and-press-conference-uefa-europa-league-2023-24.jpg?w=640", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9778919", "eventUri": "eng-9778919", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.03529411764705881, "wgt": 141, "relevance": 1}

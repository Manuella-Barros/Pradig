Swfities have been queuing outside Murrayfield Stadium in Scotland's capital for the second of three epic shows. Last night, the US mega-star delivered a flawless three-and-a-half-hour showstopper of a performance in which she told screaming fans: 'What a way to welcome a lass to Scotland.' Over the course of 46 songs, Taylor shook off a cramp in her hand, witnessed a live proposal, gifted a fan her hat and even suspended a tune so fans could receive medical aid - and in between those events found time for 12 costume changes. As with yesterday, fans have been queuing for hours - some as early as 3am - in order to be the first inside for the gig, which will kick off with an impressive set from Paramore. Fans have turned out in style to the stadium dressed to the nines in colourful costumes, feather bowers and glitter and hoping to dance the night away in the warm sunshine. Many super fans showed off their friendship bracelets which have become a major part of the singer's shows. Swifties make and trade colourful bracelets often with names or special messages on and it's famously the method Swift's current boyfriend used to sweep her off her feet almost a year ago. While some concert-goers were dressed in glittery leotards and sparkly mini skirts, others went one step further and dressed up as their idol. Young fans copied the singer's outfits down to the last detail, matching their makeup and jewellery to the Cruel Summer singer. As fans have been waiting to take their places for the sell-out show, they've made the most of the Scottish sun and some were pictured lying out on the grass in the queue and sunbathing. The sunny weather today comes after showers yesterday, soaking fans who were lining up to get into the stadium. And the classic Scottish weather doesn't seem to have put fans off as they have been flocking to the second show all day. Fans will tonight be treated to a three-and-a-half hour show which charts Swift's 20-year professional music career, from aspiring country singer to pop star and now global cultural juggernaut. The Swifty fandom is unrivalled by almost any other musical act on the planet - and has a reported net worth of $1.3billion (\u00a31.02billion). The show features countless costume changes, with Swift moving from bodysuits to sequined suit jackets, a t-shirt reading 'this is not Taylor's version' and even a flowing lavender gown she wears to sing Enchanted. While many fans will have learned the set list off by heart and already watched the show in snippets over TikTok there could still be some surprises in store. Last night the crowd shared in a magical moment with a couple who get engaged during the hit song 'Cardigan'. Footage posted online shows the two women hugging and kissing each other with beaming smiles after the proposal. After finishing the song, Swift says to the audience: 'I love performing this entire show in the sunlight, because I'm pretty sure I just, like, saw somebody getting engaged over here,' as the crowd cheered. She then asked the couple, 'Did it happen?' and then said, 'Yes!' as she balled her fists in the air in excitement after it was apparently confirmed that the proposal had indeed taken place. 'You have no idea, I never get to see that, right? Because it's, like, dark usually at night,' she explained to the crowd. 'But it's not right now so congratulations. Wow, I just saw that whole thing! Uh, man, that's amazing. Thanks for doing that at my concert, that's a big moment \u2014 huge!' Last night Swift told the crowd that they had made history. She said: 'I had someone pull me aside and say, \"Hey, we've checked this 20 times and we swear... tonight's concert is the most highly attended stadium show in Scottish history\".' She added: 'I have not been in Scotland for almost a decade now. And I was wondering what it was going to be like when we go back to visit there, how are they going to be as a crowd and, do you know what, you kind of answered me before I even got on stage.", "summary": "As with yesterday, fans have been queuing for hours - some as early as 3am - in order to be the first inside for the gig, which will kick off with an impressive set from Paramore.", "url": "https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-13509051/taylor-swift-fans-enjoy-excitement-second-gig-uk-eras-tour.html?ns_mchannel=rss&ns_campaign=1490&ito=1490", "image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2024/06/08/18/85877329-0-image-a-29_1717866572432.jpg", "video": null, "publish_date": "2024-06-08 17:17:21", "author": "Editor,Poppy Atkinson Gibson", "authors": ["Editor", "Poppy Atkinson Gibson"], "language": "en", "source_country": "GB", "sentiment": 0.277}

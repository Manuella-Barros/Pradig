He was \"ashamed\" at what he saw.\n\n\"I laid in a prone position to evaluate his [Crooks] line of sight. What I saw made me ashamed,\"said Rowe.\n\nThe testimony from Rowe amounted to the most detailed catalogue to date of law enforcement failings and miscommunications, with the Secret Service boss accepting blame for his own agency's mistakes while also criticizing local law enforcement for not sharing information that a gunman had been spotted on a roof near the rally site in the minutes before the July 13 shooting in Butler, Pennsylvania.\n\nThat information, he said, had been kept \"siloed\" among the local officers on the scene.\n\n\"It is troubling to me that we did not get that information as quickly as we should have,\" Rowe said. \"We didn't know that there was this incident going on.\"\n\nRowe became acting director of the Secret Service last week after Kimberly Cheatle resigned in the aftermath of a House hearing in which she was berated by lawmakers of both major political parties and failed to answer specific questions about the communication failures preceding the Trump rally shooting.\n\nSen. Lindsey Graham, the top Republican on the Senate Judiciary Committee, said if something like this happened in the military, \"a lot of people would be fired.

The bureau said last week that the former president had been struck in the ear by a bullet or a bullet fragment. Trump, who appeared at events over the next few days with a bandage on his right ear, said he expects the interview to take place on Thursday.\n\nMost of the questions Tuesday were expected to be directed at Rowe as lawmakers demand answers about how Crooks was able to get so close to Trump. Investigators believe Crooks fired eight shots in Trump's direction from an AR-style rifle after scaling the roof of a building of some 135 meters (147 yards) from where Trump was speaking.\n\nOne rallygoer was killed, and two others were injured.

Rand Paul, R-Ky., right, asks questions of U.S. Secret Service Acting Director Ronald Rowe and FBI Deputy Director Paul Abbate during a Joint Senate Committee on Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs and Senate Committee on the Judiciary hearing examining the security failures leading to the assassination attempt on Republican presidential candidate former President Donald Trump, Tuesday, July 30, 2024 in Washington.\n\nWASHINGTON (AP) -- The Secret Service's acting director told lawmakers on Tuesday that he considered it indefensible that the roof used by the gunman in the attempted assassination of former President Donald Trump was unsecured, faulting local law enforcement for not circulating urgent information ahead of the shooting and for not adequately protecting the scene.\n\nHe also testified that he recently visited the shooting site and said, \"What I saw made me ashamed.\" He said that the shooting amounted to a \"failure on multiple levels,\" including a failure of imagination.\n\nThe testimony was the most detailed catalogue to date by the Secret Service of law enforcement failings and miscommunications, with Rowe accepting blame for his own agency's mistakes while also repeatedly lacing into local law enforcement for not sharing information that a gunman, later identified as 20-year-old Thomas Matthew Crooks, had been spotted on a roof near the rally site in the minutes before the July 13 shooting in Butler, Pennsylvania.\n\n\"We assumed that the state and locals had it,\" Rowe said. \"We made an assumption that there was going to be uniformed presence out there, that there would be sufficient eyes to cover that, that there was going to be counter-sniper teams\" in the building from whose roof Crooks fired shots, less than 150 yards (135 meters) from the rally stage where Trump was speaking.\n\n\"And I can assure you,\" Rowe added, \"that we're not going to make that mistake again.\"\n\nTrump, the 2024 Republican presidential nominee, was struck in the ear by a bullet or a bullet fragment in the assassination attempt, one rallygoer was killed and two others were injured before the gunman was killed by a Secret Service counter-sniper.\n\nThe blunt and at times emotional testimony Tuesday, featuring combative exchanges with lawmakers, ensured that an already simmering blame game between federal and local authorities will continue. It also suggested that Rowe, with ready and detailed answers, was determined to strike a different posture than that of his predecessor, Kimberly Cheatle, who resigned last week after facing intense criticism from lawmakers from both major political parties after responses that were seen as evasive and lacking in specifics.\n\nMuch of Tuesday's hearing before the Senate Judiciary and Homeland Security committees focused on what Rowe suggested was inadequate information received by Secret Service personnel in the hour before the shooting, including that Crooks had been spotted on the roof.\n\nLocal law enforcement officers had spotted a suspicious-looking man pacing near the metal detectors and circulated but ultimately lost track of Crooks before he scaled the roof of a building at AGR International Inc. Shortly before the shooting, a local officer climbed up to the roof to investigate. Crooks turned and pointed his rifle at the officer, who retreated.\n\n\"No information regarding a weapon on a roof was ever passed to our personnel,\" Rowe said. At another point, he noted, \"It is troubling to me that we did not get that information as quickly as we should have. We didn't know that there was this incident going on.\"\n\nBut Rowe's willingness to assign blame to local law enforcement opened him up to harsh criticism from Senate Republicans, who saw him as failing to take responsibility.\n\n\"Isn't it the fact that the former president was shot, that a good American is dead, that other Americans were critically wounded -- isn't that enough mission failure for you to say to the person who decided that that building should not be the security perimeter, probably ought to be stepped down?\" said Sen. Josh Hawley, a Missouri Republican.\n\nRowe, raising his voice, responded that he has \"lost sleep over this for the last 17 days\" and that he would not be rushed \"to judgment\" by Congress, but he assured lawmakers that \"people will be held accountable.\"\n\nSen. Lindsey Graham, the top Republican on the Senate Judiciary Committee, said if something like this happened in the military, \"a lot of people would be fired. And if a lot of people are not fired, the system failed yet again.\"\n\nHe added: \"Nothing's going to change until somebody loses their job.\"\n\nThe FBI, meanwhile, disclosed new details about Crooks, with Deputy Director Paul Abbate saying a social media account believed to be associated with the gunman suspected in the assassination attempt espoused political violence and included antisemitic and anti-immigrant sentiment. The posts were from the 2019 and 2020 timeframe, when Crooks would have been in high school.\n\nOn Monday, the FBI revealed that Crooks had looked online for information about mass shootings, power plants, improvised explosive devices and the May assassination attempt of the Slovakian prime minister.\n\nThe FBI also said that Trump has agreed to be interviewed by agents as a crime victim. Trump, who appeared at events in the days after the shooting with a bandage on his right ear, said he expects the interview to take place on Thursday.\n\nAt Cheatle's hearing last week, she said the Secret Service had \"failed\" in its mission to protect Trump.

Rowe says he recently traveled to the Pennsylvania shooting site and says what he saw made him ashamed.\n\nThe FBI's No. 2 official is also testifying.\n\nTHIS IS A BREAKING NEWS UPDATE. AP's earlier story follows below.\n\nWASHINGTON (AP) -- Senate lawmakers are expected Tuesday to grill the acting director of the Secret Service about law enforcement lapses in the hours before the attempted assassination of former President Donald Trump in the latest in a series of congressional hearings dedicated to the shooting.\n\nRonald Rowe became acting director of the agency last week after Kimberly Cheatle resigned in the aftermath of a House hearing in which she was berated by lawmakers and failed to answer specific questions about the communication failures preceding the July 13 shooting.\n\nRowe will be joined by FBI Deputy Director Paul Abbate at a joint hearing of the Senate committees on the Judiciary and Homeland Security.\n\n\"If this happened in the military, a lot of people would be fired,\" said Sen. Lindsey Graham, the top Republican on the Senate Judiciary Committee. \"And if a lot of people are not fired, the system failed yet again.\n\nHe added: \"Nothing's going to change until somebody loses their job.\"\n\nThe hearing comes one day after the FBI released new details about its investigation into the shooting, revealing that the gunman, 20-year-old Thomas Matthew Crooks, had looked online for information about mass shootings, power plants, improvised explosive devices and the May assassination attempt of the Slovakian prime minister.\n\nThe FBI also said that Trump, the 2024 Republican presidential nominee, has agreed to be interviewed by agents as a crime victim. The bureau said last week that the former president had been struck in the ear by a bullet or fragment of one. Trump said Monday evening that he expected that interview to take place on Thursday.\n\nBut most of the questions Tuesday are expected to be directed at Rowe as lawmakers demand answers about how Crooks was able to get so close to Trump. Investigators believe Crooks fired eight shots in Trump's direction from an AR-style rifle after scaling the roof of a building of some 135 meters (147 yards) from where Trump was speaking in Butler, Pennsylvania.\n\nOne rallygoer was killed, and two others were injured. Crooks was shot dead by a Secret Service counter-sniper.\n\nAt her hearing last week, Cheatle said the Secret Service had \"failed\" in its mission to protect Trump. She called the attempt on Trump's life the Secret Service's \"most significant operational failure\" in decades and vowed to \"move heaven and earth\" to get to the bottom of what went wrong and make sure there's no repeat of it.\n\nCheatle acknowledged that the Secret Service was told about a suspicious person two to five times before the shooting at the rally.

The posts were from the 2019 and 2020 timeframe, when the shooter, Thomas Matthew Crooks, would have been in high school.\n\nSenate lawmakers are grilling the officials about law enforcement lapses in the hours before the attempted assassination of Trump in the latest in a series of congressional hearings dedicated to the shooting.\n\nRowe became acting director of the agency last week after Kimberly Cheatle resigned in the aftermath of a House hearing in which she was berated by lawmakers and failed to answer specific questions about the communication failures preceding the July 13 shooting.\n\nRowe is being joined by FBI Deputy Director Paul Abbate at a joint hearing of the Senate committees on the Judiciary and Homeland Security.\n\n\"If this happened in the military, a lot of people would be fired,\" said Sen. Lindsey Graham, the top Republican on the Senate Judiciary Committee. \"And if a lot of people are not fired, the system failed yet again.\n\nHe added: \"Nothing's going to change until somebody loses their job.\"\n\nThe hearing comes one day after the FBI released new details about its investigation into the shooting, revealing that the gunman had looked online for information about mass shootings, power plants, improvised explosive devices and the May assassination attempt of the Slovakian prime minister.\n\nThe FBI also said that Trump, the 2024 Republican presidential nominee, has agreed to be interviewed by agents as a crime victim. The bureau said last week that the former president had been struck in the ear by a bullet or fragment of one. Trump said Monday evening that he expected that interview to take place on Thursday.\n\nBut most of the questions Tuesday are expected to be directed at Rowe as lawmakers demand answers about how Crooks was able to get so close to Trump. Investigators believe Crooks fired eight shots in Trump's direction from an AR-style rifle after scaling the roof of a building of some 135 meters (147 yards) from where Trump was speaking in Butler, Pennsylvania.\n\nOne rallygoer was killed, and two others were injured. Crooks was shot dead by a Secret Service counter-sniper.\n\nAt her hearing last week, Cheatle said the Secret Service had \"failed\" in its mission to protect Trump. She called the attempt on Trump's life the Secret Service's \"most significant operational failure\" in decades and vowed to \"move heaven and earth\" to get to the bottom of what went wrong and make sure there's no repeat of it.\n\nCheatle acknowledged that the Secret Service was told about a suspicious person two to five times before the shooting at the rally. She also revealed that the roof from which Crooks opened fire had been identified as a potential vulnerability days before the rally.\n\nCheatle said she apologized to Trump in a phone call after the assassination attempt.\n\nIn a Monday night interview on Fox News Channel, Trump defended the Secret Service agents who protected him from the shooting but said that someone should have been on the roof with Crooks and that there should have been better communication with local police.\n\n\"They didn't speak to each other,\" he said.\n\nHe praised the sniper who killed Crooks with what he said

He added: \"Nothing's going to change until somebody loses their job.\"\u009d The hearing comes one day after the FBI released new details about its investigation into the shooting, revealing that the gunman, 20-year-old Thomas Matthew Crooks, had looked online for information about mass shootings, power plants, improvised explosive devices and the May assassination attempt of the Slovakian prime minister. The FBI also said that Trump, the 2024 Republican presidential nominee, has agreed to be interviewed by agents as a crime victim. The bureau said last week that the former president had been struck in the ear by a bullet or fragment of one. Trump said Monday evening that he expected that interview to take place on Thursday. But most of the questions Tuesday are expected to be directed at Rowe as lawmakers demand answers about how Crooks was able to get so close to Trump. Investigators believe Crooks fired eight shots in Trump's direction from an AR-style rifle after scaling the roof of a building of some 135 meters (147 yards) from where Trump was speaking in Butler, Pennsylvania. One rallygoer was killed, and two others were injured. Crooks was shot dead by a Secret Service counter-sniper. At her hearing last week, Cheatle said the Secret Service had \"failed\"\u009d in its mission to protect Trump. She called the attempt on Trump's life the Secret Service's \"most significant operational failure\"\u009d in decades and vowed to \"move heaven and earth\"\u009d to get to the bottom of what went wrong and make sure there's no repeat of it. Cheatle acknowledged that the Secret Service was told about a suspicious person two to five times before the shooting at the rally. She also revealed that the roof from which Crooks opened fire had been identified as a potential vulnerability days before the rally. Cheatle said she apologized to Trump in a phone call after the assassination attempt. In a Monday night interview on Fox News Channel, Trump defended the Secret Service agents who protected him from the shooting but said that someone should have been on the roof with Crooks and that there should have been better communication with local police. \"They didn't speak to each other,\" he said. He praised the sniper who killed Crooks with what he said was an amazing shot but noted: \"It would have been good if it was nine seconds sooner.\"\u009d", "source": {"uri": "medicinehatnews.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Medicine Hat News"}, "authors": [{"uri": "canadian_press@medicinehatnews.com", "name": "Canadian Press", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Attempted_assassination_of_Ronald_Reagan", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Attempted assassination of Ronald Reagan"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Senate", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "United States Senate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Secret_Service", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "United States Secret Service"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Bureau_of_Investigation", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Federal Bureau of Investigation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pennsylvania", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Pennsylvania"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Pennsylvania"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kimberly_Cheatle", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Kimberly Cheatle"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jim_Jordan_(American_politician)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Jim Jordan (American politician)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Senate_Committee_on_the_Judiciary", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States Senate Committee on the Judiciary"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Capitol", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States Capitol"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Law_enforcement", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Law enforcement"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republican_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Republican Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Washington,_D.C.", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Washington, D.C."}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Washington, D.C."}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_Abbate", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Paul Abbate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mass_shooting", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Mass shooting"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Improvised_explosive_device", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Improvised explosive device"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lindsey_Graham", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Lindsey Graham"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prime_Minister_of_the_United_Kingdom", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Prime Minister of the United Kingdom"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Department_of_Homeland_Security", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United States Department of Homeland Security"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fox_News", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Fox News"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sniper", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Sniper"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Associated_Press", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Associated Press"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Butler,_Pennsylvania", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Butler, Pennsylvania"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Butler, Pennsylvania"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Terrorism", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Terrorism", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Warfare_and_Conflict", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Warfare and Conflict", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Crime_and_Justice", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Crime and Justice", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Theft", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Theft", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 95}], "image": "https://medicinehatnews.com/wp-content/uploads/cp/20240722140728-669ea50d60536bd2ab348933jpeg.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9772518", "eventUri": "eng-9772518", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-07-13", "textStart": 1195, "textEnd": 1202}], "sentiment": -0.2313725490196078, "wgt": 216, "relevance": 1}

Jim Jordan, R-Ohio, listens as U.S. Secret Service Director Kimberly Cheatle testifies before the House Oversight and Accountability Committee about the attempted assassination of former President Donald Trump at a campaign event in Pennsylvania, at the Capitol in Washington, Monday, July 22, 2024. (AP Photo/Rod Lamkey, Jr.)WASHINGTON (AP) - The Secret Service's acting director told lawmakers on Tuesday that he considered it indefensible that the roof used by the gunman in the attempted assassination of former President Donald Trump was unsecured, faulting local law enforcement for not circulating vital information to federal authorities. Ronald Rowe testified that he recently visited the shooting site and said, \"What I saw made me ashamed.\"\u009d The testimony from Rowe amounted to the most detailed catalogue to date of law enforcement failings and miscommunications, with the Secret Service boss accepting blame for his own agency's mistakes while also criticizing local law enforcement for not sharing information that a gunman, later identified as 20-year-old Thomas Matthew Crooks, had been spotted on a roof near the rally site in the minutes before the July 13 shooting in Butler, Pennsylvania. That information, he said, had been kept \"siloed\"\u009d among the local officers on the scene. \"It is troubling to me that we did not get that information as quickly as we should have,\" Rowe said. \"We didn't know that there was this incident going on.\"\u009d The FBI, meanwhile, disclosed new details about Crooks, with Deputy Director Paul Abbate saying a social media account believed to be associated with the gunman suspected in the assassination attempt espoused political violence and included antisemitic and anti-immigrant sentiment. The posts were from the 2019 and 2020 timeframe, when Crooks would have been in high school. Rowe became acting director of the Secret Service last week after Kimberly Cheatle resigned in the aftermath of a House hearing in which she was berated by lawmakers of both major political parties and failed to answer specific questions about the communication failures preceding the Trump rally shooting. Sen. Lindsey Graham, the top Republican on the Senate Judiciary Committee, said if something like this happened in the military, \"a lot of people would be fired. And if a lot of people are not fired, the system failed yet again.\"\u009d He added: \"Nothing's going to change until somebody loses their job.\"\u009d The hearing came a day after the FBI released new details about its investigation into the shooting, revealing that the gunman had looked online for information about mass shootings, power plants, improvised explosive devices and the May assassination attempt of the Slovakian prime minister. The FBI also said that Trump, the 2024 Republican presidential nominee, has agreed to be interviewed by agents as a crime victim. The bureau said last week that the former president had been struck in the ear by a bullet or a bullet fragment. Trump, who appeared at events over the next few days with a bandage on his right ear, said he expects the interview to take place on Thursday. Most of the questions Tuesday were expected to be directed at Rowe as lawmakers demand answers about how Crooks was able to get so close to Trump. Investigators believe Crooks fired eight shots in Trump's direction from an AR-style rifle after scaling the roof of a building of some 135 meters (147 yards) from where Trump was speaking. One rallygoer was killed, and two others were injured. Crooks was shot dead by a Secret Service counter-sniper. At Cheatle's hearing last week, she said the Secret Service had \"failed\"\u009d in its mission to protect Trump. She called the attempt on Trump's life the Secret Service's \"most significant operational failure\"\u009d in decades and vowed to \"move heaven and earth\"\u009d to get to the bottom of what went wrong and make sure there's no repeat of it. Cheatle acknowledged that the Secret Service was told about a suspicious person two to five times before the shooting at the rally. She also revealed that the roof from which Crooks opened fire had been identified as a potential vulnerability days before the rally.

It also suggested that Rowe, with ready and detailed answers, was determined to strike a different posture than that of his predecessor, Kimberly Cheatle, who resigned last week after facing intense criticism from lawmakers from both major political parties after responses that were seen as evasive and lacking in specifics.\n\nMuch of Tuesday's hearing before the Senate Judiciary and Homeland Security committees focused on what Rowe suggested was inadequate information received by Secret Service personnel in the hour before the shooting, including that Crooks had been spotted on the roof.\n\nLocal law enforcement officers had spotted a suspicious-looking man pacing near the metal detectors and circulated but ultimately lost track of Crooks before he scaled the roof of a building at AGR International Inc. Shortly before the shooting, a local officer climbed up to the roof to investigate. Crooks turned and pointed his rifle at the officer, who retreated.\n\n\"No information regarding a weapon on a roof was ever passed to our personnel,\" Rowe said. At another point, he noted, \"It is troubling to me that we did not get that information as quickly as we should have. We didn't know that there was this incident going on.\"\n\nBut Rowe's willingness to assign blame to local law enforcement opened him up to harsh criticism from Senate Republicans, who saw him as failing to take responsibility.\n\nListen now and subscribe: Apple Podcasts | Google Podcasts | Spotify | RSS Feed | SoundStack | All Of Our Podcasts\n\n\"Isn't it the fact that the former president was shot, that a good American is dead, that other Americans were critically wounded -- isn't that enough mission failure for you to say to the person who decided that that building should not be the security perimeter, probably ought to be stepped down?\" said Sen. Josh Hawley, a Missouri Republican.\n\nRowe, raising his voice, responded that he has \"lost sleep over this for the last 17 days\" and that he would not be rushed \"to judgment\" by Congress, but he assured lawmakers that \"people will be held accountable.\"\n\nSen. Lindsey Graham, the top Republican on the Senate Judiciary Committee, said if something like this happened in the military, \"a lot of people would be fired. And if a lot of people are not fired, the system failed yet again.\"\n\nHe added: \"Nothing's going to change until somebody loses their job.\"\n\nThe FBI, meanwhile, disclosed new details about Crooks, with Deputy Director Paul Abbate saying a social media account believed to be associated with the gunman suspected in the assassination attempt espoused political violence and included antisemitic and anti-immigrant sentiment. The posts were from the 2019 and 2020 timeframe, when Crooks would have been in high school.\n\nOn Monday, the FBI revealed that Crooks had looked online for information about mass shootings, power plants, improvised explosive devices and the May assassination attempt of the Slovakian prime minister.\n\nThe FBI also said that Trump has agreed to be interviewed by agents as a crime victim. Trump, who appeared at events in the days after the shooting with a bandage on his right ear, said he expects the interview to take place on Thursday.\n\nAt Cheatle's hearing last week, she said the Secret Service had \"failed\" in its mission to protect Trump. She called the attempt on Trump's life the Secret Service's \"most significant operational failure\" in decades and vowed to \"move heaven and earth\" to get to the bottom of what went wrong and make sure there's no repeat of it.\n\nCheatle acknowledged that the Secret Service was told about a suspicious person two to five times before the shooting at the rally. She also revealed that the roof from which Crooks opened fire had been identified as a potential vulnerability days before the rally.\n\nIn a Monday night interview on Fox News Channel, Trump defended the Secret Service agents who protected him from the shooting but said that someone should have been on the roof with Crooks and that there should have been better communication with local police.\n\n\"They didn't speak to each other,\" he said.\n\nHe praised the sniper who killed Crooks with what he said was an amazing shot but noted: \"It would have been good if it was nine seconds

Rowe says he recently traveled to the Pennsylvania shooting site and says what he saw made him ashamed.\n\nThe FBI's No. 2 official says a social media account believed to be associated with the gunman suspected in the assassination attempt espoused political violence and included antisemitic and anti-immigrant sentiment. The posts were from the 2019 and 2020 timeframe, when the shooter, Thomas Matthew Crooks, would have been in high school.\n\nSenate lawmakers are grilling the officials about law enforcement lapses in the hours before the attempted assassination of Trump in the latest in a series of congressional hearings dedicated to the shooting.\n\nRowe became acting director of the agency last week after Kimberly Cheatle resigned in the aftermath of a House hearing in which she was berated by lawmakers and failed to answer specific questions about the communication failures preceding the July 13 shooting.\n\nRowe is being joined by FBI Deputy Director Paul Abbate at a joint hearing of the Senate committees on the Judiciary and Homeland Security.\n\n\"If this happened in the military, a lot of people would be fired,\" said Sen. Lindsey Graham, the top Republican on the Senate Judiciary Committee. \"And if a lot of people are not fired, the system failed yet again.\n\nHe added: \"Nothing's going to change until somebody loses their job.\"\n\nThe hearing comes one day after the FBI released new details about its investigation into the shooting, revealing that the gunman had looked online for information about mass shootings, power plants, improvised explosive devices and the May assassination attempt of the Slovakian prime minister.\n\nThe FBI also said that Trump, the 2024 Republican presidential nominee, has agreed to be interviewed by agents as a crime victim. The bureau said last week that the former president had been struck in the ear by a bullet or fragment of one. Trump said Monday evening that he expected that interview to take place on Thursday.\n\nBut most of the questions Tuesday are expected to be directed at Rowe as lawmakers demand answers about how Crooks was able to get so close to Trump. Investigators believe Crooks fired eight shots in Trump's direction from an AR-style rifle after scaling the roof of a building of some 135 meters (147 yards) from where Trump was speaking in Butler, Pennsylvania.\n\nOne rallygoer was killed, and two others were injured. Crooks was shot dead by a Secret Service counter-sniper.\n\nAt her hearing last week, Cheatle said the Secret Service had \"failed\" in its mission to protect Trump. She called the attempt on Trump's life the Secret Service's \"most significant operational failure\" in decades and vowed to \"move heaven and earth\" to get to the bottom of what went wrong and make sure there's no repeat of it.\n\nCheatle acknowledged that the Secret Service was told about a suspicious person two to five times before the shooting at the rally. She also revealed that the roof from which Crooks opened fire had been identified as a potential vulnerability days before the rally.\n\nCheatle said she apologized to Trump in a phone call after the assassination attempt.\n\nIn a Monday night interview on Fox News Channel, Trump defended the Secret Service agents who protected him from the shooting but said that someone should have been on the roof with Crooks and that there should have been better communication with local police.\n\n\"They didn't speak to each other,\" he said.\n\nHe praised the sniper who killed Crooks with what he said

It also suggested that Rowe, with ready and detailed answers, was determined to strike a different posture than that of his predecessor, Kimberly Cheatle, who resigned last week after facing intense criticism from lawmakers from both major political parties after responses that were seen as evasive and lacking in specifics.\n\nMuch of Tuesday's hearing before the Senate Judiciary and Homeland Security committees focused on what Rowe suggested was inadequate information received by Secret Service personnel in the hour before the shooting, including that Crooks had been spotted on the roof.\n\nLocal law enforcement officers had spotted a suspicious-looking man pacing near the metal detectors and circulated but ultimately lost track of Crooks before he scaled the roof of a building at AGR International Inc. Shortly before the shooting, a local officer climbed up to the roof to investigate. Crooks turned and pointed his rifle at the officer, who retreated.\n\n\"No information regarding a weapon on a roof was ever passed to our personnel,\" Rowe said. At another point, he noted, \"It is troubling to me that we did not get that information as quickly as we should have. We didn't know that there was this incident going on.\"\n\nBut Rowe's willingness to assign blame to local law enforcement opened him up to harsh criticism from Senate Republicans, who saw him as failing to take responsibility.\n\nListen now and subscribe: Apple Podcasts | Google Podcasts | Spotify | RSS Feed | SoundStack | All Of Our Podcasts\n\n\"Isn't it the fact that the former president was shot, that a good American is dead, that other Americans were critically wounded -- isn't that enough mission failure for you to say to the person who decided that that building should not be the security perimeter, probably ought to be stepped down?\" said Sen.

Rowe, Jr. appears before a Senate Judiciary Committee hearing on the attempted assassination of Republican presidential nominee and former President Donald Trump, on Capitol Hill in Washington, today.\n\nWASHINGTON >> The U.S. Secret Service's new acting director said today that he was \"ashamed\" of a security lapse that led to the July 13 attempted assassination of Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump, but blamed the shortfall on local law enforcement.\n\nIn testimony before two Senate committees, Acting Secret Service Director Ronald Rowe said he visited the outdoor rally site in Butler, Pennsylvania, and climbed onto the roof of a nearby building from which 20-year-old Thomas Crooks fired shots that wounded Trump's right ear, killed one rally attendee and wounded two others with an AR-15-style rifle.\n\n\"What I saw made me ashamed,\" Rowe told a joint hearing of the Senate Homeland Security and Judiciary Committees. \"As a career law enforcement officer, and a 25-year veteran with the Secret Service, I cannot defend why that roof was not better secured.\"\n\nThe first shooting of a U.S. president or major party candidate in more than four decades was a glaring security lapse that led last week to former Secret Service Director Kimberly Cheatle's resignation under bipartisan congressional pressure.\n\nBut Rowe went on to tell lawmakers that the Secret Service erred by assuming that local officials would cover the building and its roof, not the Secret Service.\n\nRepublican Senator John Cornyn pushed back on the notion that the responsibility should have been left to others.\n\n\"Isn't that something that Secret Service should have covered, as opposed to delegating it to local law enforcement?\" Cornyn asked.\n\n\"We assumed that the state and locals had it,\" Rowe replied. \"I can assure you that we're not going to make that mistake again.\"\n\nDemocratic Senator Richard Blumenthal asked Rowe: \"Ultimately, doesn't the buck stop with the Secret Service?\"\n\n\"It stops with us, sir,\" Rowe said. But Rowe added: \"If they'd just held their post and looked left.\"\n\nRowe's comments came days after a local SWAT team assigned to help protect Trump told ABC News that it had no contact with Secret Service agents in charge of security at the rally before the shooting, and that an anticipated face-to-face briefing with Secret Service officials never happened.\n\nRowe said he has already taken steps to prevent similar lapses from occurring amid concerns among both Democrats and Republicans about further political violence as the campaign intensifies ahead of the Nov. 5 U.S. election.\n\nFBI Deputy Director Paul Abbate, who also testified before the panels, said Crooks appears to have posted violent antisemitic and anti-immigration content online as a teenager.\n\nIt is some of the first evidence of Crooks' possible inclination toward extremism and political violence found by investigators, who have yet to identify a motive.\n\nAbbate said investigators found a social media account dating to 2019-2020, when Crooks would have been 15 or 16 years old, adding that the account had posted more than 700 comments.\n\n\"Some of these comments, if ultimately attributable to the shooter, appear to reflect antisemitic and anti-immigration themes, to espouse political violence, and are described as extreme in nature,\" Abbate told lawmakers.\n\nCrooks flew a drone near the rally site ahead of the shooting, a flight that Secret Service officials failed to notice because a system for detecting drones was not working properly due to problems with the local cellular network, Rowe said.\n\nLawmakers sought to learn why the Secret Service did not delay the rally or prevent Trump from taking the stage, noting that local police saw Crooks with a rangefinder device for measuring distances about an hour before the shooting.\n\nRowe said Crooks was only one among a number of individuals to draw local law enforcement attention, and added that the Secret Service was not informed when local police saw Crooks on the roof with the rife, just before he opened fire.\n\n\"They were in the midst of dealing with a very critical situation and they articulated that over the radio, as I understand it. However, it was never relayed over to us,\" Rowe said.\n\nThe proceedings grew heated when Republican Senator Josh Hawley pushed Rowe to begin expelling agency employees immediately.\n\n\"I will tell you, senator ... that people will be held accountable, and I will do so with integrity and not rush to judgment and let people be unfairly persecuted,\" Rowe told Hawley with a raised voice.",

until shots fired: Secret Service", "body": "Acting US Secret Service Director Ronald Rowe (L) and FBI Deputy Director Paul Abbate (R) being sworn in before testifying at a joint Senate hearing about the assassination attempt against former president Donald Trump\n\nDonald Trump's security detail and a sniper team were not aware there was a gunman on a roof until he opened fire on the former president, the acting Secret Service director said Tuesday.\n\nLocal law enforcement identified the gunman, Thomas Matthew Crooks, as a \"suspicious person\" about 90 minutes before the July 13 attack at a Trump campaign rally in Butler, Pennsylvania, according to FBI officials.\n\nSince the assassination attempt, questions have been raised about when the Secret Service became aware of the presence of the gunman on the roof of a building that overlooked the campaign event.\n\n\"Based on what I know right now, neither the Secret Service counter-sniper teams nor members of the former president's security detail had any knowledge that there was a man on the AGR roof with a firearm,\" acting Secret Service chief Ronald Rowe told a joint Senate committee.\n\n\"The only thing we had was that locals were working an issue at the three o'clock, which would have been the former president's right-hand side, which is where the shots came from,\" Rowe said.\n\n\"Nothing about man on the roof, nothing about man with a gun,\" he said.\n\nFBI special agent Kevin Rojek said Monday that a police officer was boosted on to the roof by another officer at 6:11 pm.\n\nCrooks pointed his rifle at the officer, who \"immediately dropped to the ground.\"\n\n\"Approximately 25 to 30 seconds after this encounter, the subject fired eight rounds before being successfully neutralized,\" Rojek said.\n\nRowe said Crooks was shot dead by a Secret Service sniper \"within 15.5 seconds\" of firing the first shot.\n\nThe Republican presidential candidate was wounded in the right ear, while two rally attendees were injured and a Pennsylvania firefighter was killed.\n\n- 'Ashamed' -\n\nRowe said he \"cannot defend\" why the rooftop where Crooks fired from was not better secured, and said he was \"ashamed\" about the security lapses.\n\nRepublican presidential candidate Donald Trump is evacuated from a rally by Secret Service agents after an assassination attempt in Butler, Pennsylvania, on July 13, 2024\n\nHe said local law enforcement had been tasked with securing the rooftop. \"We assumed that the state and locals had it,\" he said.\n\nAsked why Trump was allowed to take the stage, Rowe said Crooks had not been identified as a threat but only as suspicious.\n\n\"We did not have anything beyond suspicious person that was communicated to us,\" he said. \"Suspicion had not risen to the level of threat or imminent harm.\"\n\nRowe said communications failures between local law enforcement and the Secret Service contributed to what he called a \"failure on multiple levels.\"\n\nThe Secret Service had \"technical difficulties\" with its counter-drone capabilities on the day of the attack and they were not \"operational until after five o'clock,\" he said.\n\nCrooks flew a drone near the rally site for 11 minutes about two hours before the attack, according to the FBI.\n\nFBI deputy director Paul Abbate also addressed the committee hearing and said the authorities still have not established a motive.\n\nHe said they have identified a social media account believed to be associated with Crooks.\n\n\"In about the 2019, 2020 timeframe there were over 700 comments posted from this account,\" Abbate said. \"Some of these comments, if ultimately attributable to the shooter, appear to reflect anti-Semitic and anti-immigration themes, to espouse political violence and are described as extreme in nature.\"\n\nSecret Service Director Kimberly Cheatle resigned last week after acknowledging that the agency had failed in its mission to prevent the assassination attempt.",

Ronald Rowe's admission of a glaring security lapse came a week after the former Director Kimberly Cheatle resigned.\n\nThe US Secret Service's new acting director said on Tuesday that he was \"ashamed\" of a security lapse that led to the July 13 attempted assassination of Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump, but blamed the shortfall on local law enforcement.\n\nIn testimony before two Senate committees, Acting Secret Service Director Ronald Rowe said he visited the outdoor rally site in Butler, Pennsylvania, and climbed onto the roof of a nearby building from which 20-year-old Thomas Crooks fired shots that wounded Trump's right ear, killed one rally attendee and wounded two others with an AR-15-style rifle.\n\n\"What I saw made me ashamed,\" Rowe told a joint hearing of the Senate Homeland Security and Judiciary Committees. \"As a career law enforcement officer, and a 25-year veteran with the Secret Service, I cannot defend why that roof was not better secured.\"\n\nThe first shooting of a US president or major party candidate in more than four decades was a glaring security lapse that led last week to former Secret Service Director Kimberly Cheatle's resignation under bipartisan congressional pressure.\n\nBut Rowe went on to tell lawmakers that the Secret Service erred by assuming that a local officials would cover the building and its roof, not the Secret Service.\n\nRepublican Senator John Cornyn pushed back on the notion that the responsibility should have been left to others.\n\n\"Isn't that something that Secret Service should have covered, as opposed to delegating it to local law enforcement?\" Cornyn asked.\n\n\"We assumed that the state and locals had it,\" Rowe replied. \"I can assure you that we're not going to make that mistake again.\"\n\nDemocratic Senator Richard Blumenthal asked Rowe: \"Ultimately, doesn't the buck stop with the Secret Service?\"\n\n\"It stops with us, sir,\" Rowe said. But Rowe added: \"If they'd just held their post and looked left.\"\n\nRowe's comments came days after a local SWAT team assigned to help protect Trump told ABC News that it had no contact with Secret Service agents in charge of security at the rally before the shooting, and that an anticipated face-to-face briefing with Secret Service officials never happened.\n\nRowe said he has already taken steps to prevent similar lapses from occurring amid concerns among both Democrats and Republicans about further political violence as the campaign intensifies ahead of the Nov. 5 US election.\n\nFBI Deputy Director Paul Abbate, who also testified before the panels, said Crooks appears to have posted violent antisemitic and anti-immigration content online as a teenager.\n\nIt is some of the first evidence of Crooks' possible inclination towards extremism and political violence found by investigators, who have yet to identify a motive.\n\nAbbate said investigators found a social media account dating to 2019-2020, when Crooks would have been 15 or 16 years old, adding that the account had posted more than 700 comments.\n\n\"Some of these comments, if ultimately attributable to the shooter, appear to reflect antisemitic and anti-immigration themes, to espouse political violence, and are described as extreme in nature,\" Abbate told lawmakers.\n\nCrooks flew a drone near the rally site ahead of the shooting, a flight that Secret Service officials failed to notice because a system for detecting drones was not working properly due to problems with the local cellular network, Rowe said.\n\nLawmakers sought to learn why the Secret Service did not delay the rally or prevent Trump from taking the stage, noting that local police saw Crooks with a rangefinder device for measuring distances about an hour before the shooting.\n\nRowe said Crooks was only one among a number of individuals to draw local law enforcement attention, and added that the Secret Service was not informed when local police saw Crooks on the roof with the rife, just before he opened fire.\n\n\"They were in the midst of dealing with a very critical situation and they articulated that over the radio, as I understand it. However, it was never relayed over to us,\" Rowe said.\n\nThe proceedings grew heated when Republican Senator Josh Hawley pushed Rowe to begin expelling agency employees immediately.\n\n\"I will tell you, senator ... that people will be held accountable, and I will do so with integrity and not rush to judgment and let people be unfairly persecuted,\" Rowe told Hawley with a raised voice.",

This hearing marks the latest in a series of congressional inquiries focused on the incident.\n\nUS Senate lawmakers, on Tuesday, are expected to grill the acting director of the Secret Service about law enforcement lapses in the hours before the attempted assassination of former President Donald Trump in the latest in a series of congressional hearings dedicated to the shooting. Ronald Rowe became acting director of the agency last week after his predecessor, Kimberly Cheatle, resigned in the aftermath of a House hearing in which she was berated by lawmakers from both parties and failed to answer specific questions about the communication failures preceding the July 13 shooting.\n\nRowe will be joined by FBI Deputy Director Paul Abbate at a joint hearing of the Senate committees on the Judiciary and Homeland Security. The hearing comes one day after the FBI released new details about its investigation into the shooting, revealing that the gunman, 20-year-old Thomas Matthew Crooks, had looked online for information about mass shootings, power plants, improvised explosive devices and the May assassination attempt of the Slovakian prime minister.\n\nThe FBI also said that Trump has agreed to be interviewed by agents as a crime victim; the bureau said last week that the former president had been struck in the ear by a bullet or fragment of one. Trump said Monday evening that he expected that interview to take place on Thursday. But the bulk of the questions on Tuesday are expected to be directed at Rowe as lawmakers demand answers about how Crooks was able to get so close to Trump.\n\nInvestigators believe Crooks fired eight shots in Trump's direction from an AR-style rifle after scaling the roof of a building some 135 meters from where Trump was speaking in Butler, Pennsylvania. One rallygoer was killed and two others were injured. Crooks was shot dead by a Secret Service countersniper. At her hearing last week, Cheatle said the Secret Service had \"failed\" in its mission to protect Trump. She called the attempt on Trump's life the Secret Service's \"most significant operational failure\" in decades and vowed to \"move heaven and earth\" to get to the bottom of what went wrong and make sure there's no repeat of it.\n\nCheatle acknowledged that the Secret Service was told about a suspicious person two to five times before the shooting at the rally. She also revealed that the roof from which Crooks opened fire had been identified as a potential vulnerability days before the rally. Cheatle said she apologised to Trump in a phone call after the assassination attempt.\n\nIn a Monday night interview on Fox News, Trump defended the Secret Service agents who protected him from the shooting but said someone should have been on the roof with Crooks and that there should have been better communication with local police. \"They didn't speak to each other,\" he said. He praised the sniper who killed Crooks with what he said was an amazing shot but noted: \"It would have been good if it was nine seconds sooner.\"\n\n(With inputs from agency)", "source": {"uri": "indiatvnews.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "India TV News"}, "authors": [{"uri": "ajit_kumar@indiatvnews.com", "name": "Ajit Kumar", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Director_of_the_United_States_Secret_Service", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Director of the United States Secret Service"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Attempted_assassination_of_Ronald_Reagan", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Attempted assassination of Ronald Reagan"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Law_enforcement", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Law enforcement"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Senate", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "United States Senate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kimberly_Cheatle", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Kimberly Cheatle"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Bureau_of_Investigation", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Federal Bureau of Investigation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_Abbate", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Paul Abbate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mass_shooting", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Mass shooting"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deputy_Director_of_the_Federal_Bureau_of_Investigation", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Deputy Director of the Federal Bureau of Investigation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Improvised_explosive_device", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Improvised explosive device"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prime_Minister_of_the_United_Kingdom", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Prime Minister of the United Kingdom"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Judiciary", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Judiciary"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Secret_Service", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United States Secret Service"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Department_of_Homeland_Security", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United States Department of Homeland Security"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slovakia", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Slovakia"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Slovakia"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fox_News", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Fox News"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sniper", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Sniper"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Butler,_Pennsylvania", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Butler, Pennsylvania"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Butler, Pennsylvania"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Terrorism", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Terrorism", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Crime_and_Justice", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Crime and Justice", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Theft", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Theft", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Murder", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Murder", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 79}], "image": "https://resize.indiatvnews.com/en/resize/newbucket/1200_-/2024/07/attempted-assassination-of-former-president-donald-trump-at-a-campaign-event-in-pennsylvania-1722334300.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9772518", "eventUri": "eng-9772518", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-07-13", "textStart": 862, "textEnd": 869}], "sentiment": -0.3019607843137255, "wgt": 210, "relevance": 1}

It also suggested that Rowe, with ready and detailed answers, was determined to strike a different posture than that of his predecessor, Kimberly Cheatle, who resigned last week after facing intense criticism from lawmakers from both major political parties after responses that were seen as evasive and lacking in specifics.\n\nMuch of Tuesday's hearing before the Senate Judiciary and Homeland Security committees focused on what Rowe suggested was inadequate information received by Secret Service personnel in the hour before the shooting, including that Crooks had been spotted on the roof.\n\nLocal law enforcement officers had spotted a suspicious-looking man pacing near the metal detectors and circulated but ultimately lost track of Crooks before he scaled the roof of a building at AGR International Inc. Shortly before the shooting, a local officer climbed up to the roof to investigate. Crooks turned and pointed his rifle at the officer, who retreated.\n\n\"No information regarding a weapon on a roof was ever passed to our personnel,\" Rowe said. At another point, he noted, \"It is troubling to me that we did not get that information as quickly as we should have. We didn't know that there was this incident going on.\"\n\nBut Rowe's willingness to assign blame to local law enforcement opened him up to harsh criticism from Senate Republicans, who saw him as failing to take responsibility.\n\n\"Isn't it the fact that the former president was shot, that a good American is dead, that other Americans were critically wounded -- isn't that enough mission failure for you to say to the person who decided that that building should not be the security perimeter, probably ought to be stepped down?\" said Sen. Josh Hawley, a Missouri Republican.\n\nRowe, raising his voice, responded that he has \"lost sleep over this for the last 17 days\" and that he would not be rushed \"to judgment\" by Congress, but he assured lawmakers that \"people will be held accountable.\"\n\nSen. Lindsey Graham, the top Republican on the Senate Judiciary Committee, said if something like this happened in the military, \"a lot of people would be fired. And if a lot of people are not fired, the system failed yet again.\"\n\nHe added: \"Nothing's going to change until somebody loses their job.\"\n\nThe FBI, meanwhile, disclosed new details about Crooks, with Deputy Director Paul Abbate saying a social media account believed to be associated with the gunman suspected in the assassination attempt espoused political violence and included antisemitic and anti-immigrant sentiment. The posts were from the 2019 and 2020 timeframe, when Crooks would have been in high school.\n\nOn Monday, the FBI revealed that Crooks had looked online for information about mass shootings, power plants, improvised explosive devices and the May assassination attempt of the Slovakian prime minister.\n\nThe FBI also said that Trump has agreed to be interviewed by agents as a crime victim. Trump, who appeared at events in the days after the shooting with a bandage on his right ear, said he expects the interview to take place on Thursday.\n\nAt Cheatle's hearing last week, she said the Secret Service had \"failed\" in its mission to protect Trump. She called the attempt on Trump's life the Secret Service's \"most significant operational failure\" in decades and vowed to \"move heaven and earth\" to get to the bottom of what went wrong and make sure there's no repeat of it.\n\nCheatle acknowledged that the Secret Service was told about a suspicious person two to five times before the shooting at the rally.

Kevin Wolf/Associated Press\n\nWASHINGTON -- The Secret Service's acting director on Tuesday told lawmakers he considered it indefensible that the roof used by the gunman in the attempted assassination of former President Donald Trump was unsecured and said it was regrettable that local law enforcement had not communicated to his agency that a gunman had been spotted on a nearby roof.\n\nRonald Rowe also testified that he recently visited the shooting site and laid down on the roof of the building where shots were fired in order to evaluate the gunman's line of sight during the July 13 shooting in Butler, Pennsylvania.\n\n\"What I saw made me ashamed. As a career law enforcement officer and a 25-year Secret Service veteran, I cannot defend why that roof was not better secured,\" he said.\n\nThe testimony was the most detailed catalog to date by the Secret Service of law enforcement failings and miscommunications, with Rowe accepting blame for his own agency's mistakes while also pointedly criticizing local law enforcement for communication breakdowns that resulted in his agency not sharing information that a gunman, later identified as 20-year-old Thomas Matthew Crooks, had been spotted on the roof of a building less than 150 yards from the rally stage where Trump was speaking.\n\n\"Neither the Secret Service counter sniper teams nor members of the former president's security detail had any knowledge that there was a man on the roof of the building with a firearm,\" Rowe said. \"It is my understanding those personnel were not aware the assailant had a firearm until they heard gunshots.\"\n\nHe said that the shooting amounted to a \"failure on multiple levels,\" including a failure of imagination and a \"failure to challenge our assumptions.\"\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\"We assumed that the state and locals had it,\" Rowe said. \"We made an assumption that there was going to be uniformed presence out there, that there would be sufficient eyes to cover that, that there was going to be counter-sniper teams\" in the building from whose roof Crooks fired shots.\n\n\"And I can assure you,\" Rowe added, \"that we're not going to make that mistake again.\"\n\nHe said he had implemented multiple reforms since taking over as acting director last week, including mandating that every event security plan is vetted by multiple experienced supervisors before being implemented, expanding the use of aerial drones to improve visibility of roofs and dedicating more resources to improve communications at events where the Secret Service is operating.\n\nTrump, the 2024 Republican presidential nominee, was struck in the ear by a bullet or a bullet fragment in the assassination attempt, one rallygoer was killed and two others were injured before the gunman was killed by a Secret Service counter-sniper.\n\nThe blunt and at times emotional testimony Tuesday, featuring combative exchanges with lawmakers, ensured that an already simmering blame game between federal and local authorities will continue. It also suggested that Rowe, with ready and generally detailed answers, was determined to strike a different posture than that of his predecessor, Kimberly Cheatle, who resigned last week after facing intense criticism from lawmakers from both major political parties following responses at a congressional hearing that were seen as evasive and lacking in specifics.\n\nTuesday's hearing before the Senate Judiciary and Homeland Security committees was the latest in a series of congressional sessions dedicated to the law enforcement lapses and missed communications that preceded the shooting.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nLocal law enforcement officers had first observed a suspicious-looking man at the rally site more than an hour before the event and circulated that information, including photographs of a man who turned out to be Crooks. But the officers ultimately lost track of Crooks, who was able to scale the roof of a building at AGR International Inc., a supplier of automation equipment for the glass and plastic packaging industry, and fire an estimated eight shots with an AR-15-style rife.\n\nShortly before the shooting, a local officer climbed up to the roof to investigate. Crooks turned and pointed his rifle at the officer, who retreated.\n\nEven though text messages among local snipers revealed anxiety about the man, Rowe said the only thing the Secret Service knew at the time of the shooting was that law enforcement was contending with a suspicious-looking man.\n\n\"No information regarding a weapon on a roof was ever passed to our personnel,\" Rowe said. At another point, he noted, \"It is troubling to me that we did not get that information as quickly as we should have. We didn't know that there was this incident going on.\"\n\nBut Rowe's willingness to assign blame to local law enforcement opened him up to harsh criticism from Senate Republicans, who saw him as failing to take sufficient responsibility.\n\n\"Isn't the fact that a former president was shot, that a good American is dead, that other Americans were critically wounded - isn't that enough mission failure for you to say to the person who decided that that building should not be in the security perimeter, probably ought to be stepped down?\" said Sen.

The posts were from the 2019-2020 timeframe, when Crooks would have been in high school.\n\nAbbate did not identify the social media platform, saying investigators were still trying to definitively determine that it belonged to Crooks. However, he indicated that it was separate from an account on a different platform called Gab that was active in 2021.\n\nThe chief executive of Gab posted on X, formerly known as Twitter, during the Senate hearing that Crooks's presence on that platform was consistent with being \"pro-Biden and in particular pro-Biden's immigration policy.\"\n\nOn Monday, the FBI revealed that Crooks had looked online for information about mass shootings, power plants, improvised explosive devices and the May assassination attempt of the Slovakian prime minister Robert Fico.\n\nThe FBI also said that Trump

The posts were from the 2019 and 2020 timeframe, when Crooks would have been in high school.\n\nRowe became acting director of the Secret Service last week after Kimberly Cheatle resigned in the aftermath of a House hearing in which she was berated by lawmakers of both major political parties and failed to answer specific questions about the communication failures preceding the Trump rally shooting.\n\nSen.

And if a lot of people are not fired, the system failed yet again.\"\n\nHe added: \"Nothing's going to change until somebody loses their job.\"\n\nRelated Story: FBI Reveals Trump Gunman Wanted to Mimic Lee Harvey Oswald\n\nThe hearing came a day after the FBI released new details about its investigation into the shooting, revealing that the gunman had looked online for information about mass shootings, power plants, improvised explosive devices and the May assassination attempt of the Slovakian prime minister.\n\nThe FBI also said that Trump, the 2024 Republican presidential nominee, has agreed to be interviewed by agents as a crime victim. The bureau said last week that the former president had been struck in the ear by a bullet or a bullet fragment. Trump, who appeared at events over the next few days with a bandage on his right ear, said he expects the interview to take place on Thursday.\n\nMost of the questions Tuesday were expected to be directed at Rowe as lawmakers demand answers about how Crooks was able to get so close to Trump.

(AP Photo/Kevin Wolf)\n\nRonald Rowe Jr. also testified that he recently visited the shooting site and laid down on the roof of the building where shots were fired in order to evaluate the gunman's line of sight during the July 13 shooting in Butler, Pennsylvania.\n\n\"What I saw made me ashamed. As a career law enforcement officer and a 25-year Secret Service veteran, I cannot defend why that roof was not better secured,\" he said.\n\nThe testimony was the most detailed catalog to date by the Secret Service of law enforcement failings and miscommunications, with Rowe accepting blame for his own agency's mistakes while also pointedly criticizing local law enforcement for communication breakdowns that resulted in his agency not receiving information that a gunman, later identified as 20-year-old Thomas Matthew Crooks, had been seen on the roof of a building less than 150 yards (135 meters) from the rally stage where Trump was speaking.\n\n\"Neither the Secret Service counter sniper teams nor members of the former president's security detail had any knowledge that there was a man on the roof of the building with a firearm,\" Rowe said. \"It is my understanding those personnel were not aware the assailant had a firearm until they heard gunshots.\"\n\nHe said that the shooting amounted to a \"failure on multiple levels,\" including a failure of imagination and a \"failure to challenge our assumptions.\"\n\n\"We assumed that the state and locals had it,\" Rowe said. \"We made an assumption that there was going to be uniformed presence out there, that there would be sufficient eyes to cover that, that there was going to be counter-sniper teams\" in the building from whose roof Crooks fired shots.\n\n\"And I can assure you,\" Rowe added, \"that we're not going to make that mistake again.\"\n\nHe said he had implemented multiple reforms since taking over as acting director last week, including mandating that every event security plan is vetted by multiple experienced supervisors before being implemented, expanding the use of aerial drones to improve visibility of roofs, dedicating more resources to improve communications at events where the Secret Service is operating. He said he's also directed that federal and local counter snipers work together on roofs.\n\nTrump, the 2024 Republican presidential nominee, was struck in the ear by a bullet or a bullet fragment in the assassination attempt, one rallygoer was killed and two others were injured before the gunman was killed by a Secret Service counter-sniper.\n\nThe blunt and at times emotional testimony Tuesday, featuring combative exchanges with lawmakers, ensured that an already simmering blame game between federal and local authorities will continue. It also suggested that Rowe, with ready and generally detailed answers, was determined to strike a different posture than that of his predecessor, Kimberly Cheatle, who resigned last week after facing intense criticism from lawmakers from both major political parties following responses at a congressional hearing that were seen as evasive and lacking in specifics.\n\nTuesday's hearing before the Senate Judiciary and Homeland Security committees was the latest in a series of congressional sessions dedicated to the law enforcement lapses and missed communications that preceded the shooting.\n\nLocal law enforcement officers had first observed a suspicious-looking man at the rally site more than an hour before the event and circulated that information, including photographs of a man who turned out to be Crooks. But the officers ultimately lost track of Crooks, who was able to scale the roof of a building at AGR International Inc., a supplier of automation equipment for the glass and plastic packaging industry, and fire an estimated eight shots with an AR-15-style rife.\n\nShortly before the shooting, a local officer climbed up to the roof to investigate. Crooks turned and pointed his rifle at the officer, who retreated.\n\nEven though text messages among local snipers revealed anxiety about the man, Rowe said the only thing the Secret Service knew at the time of the shooting was that law enforcement was contending with a suspicious-looking man.\n\n\"No information regarding a weapon on a roof was ever passed to our personnel,\" Rowe said. At another point, he noted, \"It is troubling to me that we did not get that information as quickly as we should have. We didn't know that there was this incident going on.\"\n\nBut Rowe's willingness to assign blame to local law enforcement opened him up to harsh criticism from Senate Republicans, who saw him as failing to take sufficient responsibility.\n\n\"Isn't the fact that a former president was shot, that a good American is dead, that other Americans were critically wounded -- isn't that enough mission failure for you to say to the person who decided that that building should not be in the security perimeter, probably ought to be stepped down?\" said Sen. Josh Hawley, a Missouri Republican.\n\nRowe, raising his voice, responded that he has \"lost sleep over this for the last 17 days\" and that he would not be rushed \"to judgment\" by Congress. He assured lawmakers that \"people will be held accountable.\"\n\nSen. Lindsey Graham, the top Republican on the Senate Judiciary Committee, said if something like this happened in the military, \"a lot of people would be fired. And if a lot of people are not fired, the system failed yet again.\"\n\nHe added: \"Nothing's going to change until somebody loses their job.\"\n\nThe FBI, meanwhile, disclosed new details about Crooks, with Deputy Director Paul Abbate saying a social media account believed to be associated with the gunman suspected in the assassination attempt espoused political violence and included antisemitic and anti-immigrant sentiment. The posts were from the 2019-2020 timeframe, when Crooks would have been in high school.\n\nAbbate did not identify the social media platform, saying investigators were still trying to definitively determine that it belonged to Crooks. However, he indicated that it was separate from an account on a different platform called Gab that was active in 2021.\n\nThe chief executive of Gab posted on X, formerly known as Twitter, during the Senate hearing that Crooks's presence on that platform was consistent with being \"pro-Biden and in particular pro-Biden's immigration policy.\"\n\nOn Monday, the FBI revealed that Crooks had looked online for information about mass shootings, power plants, improvised explosive devices and the May assassination attempt of the Slovakian prime minister Robert Fico.\n\nThe FBI also said that Trump has agreed to be interviewed by agents as a crime victim.", "source": {"uri": "mb.com.ph", "dataType": "news", "title": "Manila Bulletin"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

The posts were from the 2019 and 2020 timeframe, when the shooter, Thomas Matthew Crooks, would have been in high school.\n\nSenate lawmakers are grilling the officials about law enforcement lapses in the hours before the attempted assassination of Trump in the latest in a series of congressional hearings dedicated to the shooting.\n\nRowe is being joined by FBI Deputy Director Paul Abbate at a joint hearing of the Senate committees on the Judiciary and Homeland Security.\n\n\"If this happened in the military, a lot of people would be fired,\" said Sen. Lindsey Graham, the top Republican on the Senate Judiciary Committee. \"And if a lot of people are not fired, the system failed yet again.\n\nThe hearing comes one day after the FBI released new details about its investigation into the shooting, revealing that the gunman had looked online for information about mass shootings, power plants, improvised explosive devices and the May assassination attempt of the Slovakian prime minister.\n\nThe FBI also said that Trump, the 2024 Republican presidential nominee, has agreed to be interviewed by agents as a crime victim. The bureau said last week that the former president had been struck in the ear by a bullet or fragment of one. Trump said Monday evening that he expected that interview to take place on Thursday.\n\nBut most of the questions Tuesday are expected to be directed at Rowe as lawmakers demand answers about how Crooks was able to get so close to Trump. Investigators believe Crooks fired eight shots in Trump's direction from an AR-style rifle after scaling the roof of a building of some 135 meters (147 yards) from where Trump was speaking in Butler, Pennsylvania.\n\nOne rallygoer was killed, and two others were injured.

sure there's no repeat of it.\n\nCheatle said she apologized to Trump in a phone call after the assassination attempt.\n\nIn a Monday night interview on Fox News Channel, Trump defended the Secret Service agents who protected him from the shooting but said that someone should have been on the roof with Crooks and that there should have been better communication with local police.\n\n\"They didn't speak to each other,\" he said.\n\nHe praised the sniper who killed Crooks with what he said was an amazing shot but noted: \"It would have been good if it was nine seconds sooner.\"",

But Rowe added: \"If they'd just held their post and looked left.\"\n\nRowe's comments came days after a local SWAT team assigned to help protect Trump told ABC News that it had no contact with Secret Service agents in charge of security at the rally before the shooting, and that an anticipated face-to-face briefing with Secret Service officials never happened.\n\nRowe said he has already taken steps to prevent similar lapses from occurring amid concerns among both Democrats and Republicans about further political violence as the campaign intensifies ahead of the Nov. 5 U.S. election.\n\nFBI Deputy Director Paul Abbate, who also testified before the panels, said Crooks appears to have posted violent antisemitic and anti-immigration content online as a teenager.\n\nIt is some of the first evidence of Crooks' possible inclination toward extremism and political violence found by investigators, who have yet to identify a motive.\n\nAbbate said investigators found a social media account dating to 2019-2020, when Crooks would have been 15 or 16 years old, adding that the account had posted more than 700 comments.\n\n\"Some of these comments, if ultimately attributable to the shooter, appear to reflect antisemitic and anti-immigration themes, to espouse political violence, and are described as extreme in nature,\" Abbate told lawmakers.\n\nCrooks flew a drone near the rally site ahead of the shooting, a flight that Secret Service officials failed to notice because a system for detecting drones was not working properly due to problems with the local cellular network, Rowe said.\n\nLawmakers sought to learn why the Secret Service did not delay the rally or prevent Trump from taking the stage, noting that local police saw Crooks with a rangefinder device for measuring distances about an hour before the shooting.\n\nRowe said Crooks was only one among a number of individuals to draw local law enforcement attention, and added that the Secret Service was not informed when local police saw Crooks on the roof with the rife, just before he opened fire.\n\n\"They were in the midst of dealing with a very critical situation and they articulated that over the radio, as I understand it. However, it was never relayed over to us,\" Rowe said.\n\nThe proceedings grew heated when Republican Senator Josh Hawley pushed Rowe to begin expelling agency employees immediately.\n\n\"I will tell you, senator ... that people will be held accountable, and I will do so with integrity and not rush to judgment and let people be unfairly persecuted,\" Rowe told Hawley with a raised voice.\n\n\u00a9

"'Nothing About Man On The Roof': US Secret Service Says Trump Security Unaware Of Gunman Until Shots Fired - News18", "body": "Acting Secret Service chief Ronald Rowe told a joint Senate committee that they became aware of Thomas Matthew Crooks' presence after he fired the shots.\n\nDonald Trump's security detail and a sniper team were not aware there was a gunman on a roof until he opened fire on the former president, the acting Secret Service director said Tuesday.\n\nLocal law enforcement identified the gunman, Thomas Matthew Crooks, as a \"suspicious person\" about 90 minutes before the July 13 attack at a Trump campaign rally in Butler, Pennsylvania, according to FBI officials.\n\nSince the assassination attempt, questions have been raised about when the Secret Service became aware of the presence of the gunman on the roof of a building that overlooked the campaign event.\n\n\"Based on what I know right now, neither the Secret Service counter-sniper teams nor members of the former president's security detail had any knowledge that there was a man on the AGR roof with a firearm,\" acting Secret Service chief Ronald Rowe told a joint Senate committee.\n\n\"The only thing we had was that locals were working an issue at the three o'clock, which would have been the former president's right-hand side, which is where the shots came from,\" Rowe said.\n\n\"Nothing about man on the roof, nothing about man with a gun,\" he said.\n\nFBI special agent Kevin Rojek said Monday that a police officer was boosted on to the roof by another officer at 6:11 pm.\n\nCrooks pointed his rifle at the officer, who \"immediately dropped to the ground.\"\n\n\"Approximately 25 to 30 seconds after this encounter, the subject fired eight rounds before being successfully neutralized,\" Rojek said.\n\nRowe said Crooks was shot dead by a Secret Service sniper \"within 15.5 seconds\" of firing the first shot.\n\nThe Republican presidential candidate was wounded in the right ear, while two rally attendees were injured and a Pennsylvania firefighter was killed.\n\nRowe said he \"cannot defend\" why the rooftop where Crooks fired from was not better secured, and said he was \"ashamed\" about the security lapses.\n\nHe said local law enforcement had been tasked with securing the rooftop. \"We assumed that the state and locals had it,\" he said.\n\nAsked why Trump was allowed to take the stage, Rowe said Crooks had not been identified as a threat but only as suspicious.\n\n\"We did not have anything beyond suspicious person that was communicated to us,\" he said. \"Suspicion had not risen to the level of threat or imminent harm.\"\n\nRowe said communications failures between local law enforcement and the Secret Service contributed to what he called a \"failure on multiple levels.\"\n\nThe Secret Service had \"technical difficulties\" with its counter-drone capabilities on the day of the attack and they were not \"operational until after five o'clock,\" he said.\n\nCrooks flew a drone near the rally site for 11 minutes about two hours before the attack, according to the FBI.\n\nFBI deputy director Paul Abbate also addressed the committee hearing and said the authorities still have not established a motive.\n\nHe said they have identified a social media account believed to be associated with Crooks.\n\n\"In about the 2019, 2020 timeframe there were over 700 comments posted from this account,\" Abbate said. \"Some of these comments, if ultimately attributable to the shooter, appear to reflect anti-Semitic and anti-immigration themes, to espouse political violence and are described as extreme in nature.\"\n\nSecret Service Director Kimberly Cheatle resigned last week after acknowledging that the agency had failed in its mission to prevent the assassination attempt.", "source": {"uri": "news18.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "News18"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

Jim Jordan, R-Ohio, listens as U.S. Secret Service Director Kimberly Cheatle testifies before the House Oversight and Accountability Committee about the attempted assassination of former President Donald Trump at a campaign event in Pennsylvania, at the Capitol in Washington, Monday, July 22, 2024.\n\nBy Eric Tucker, Associated Press\n\nMonday, July 29, 2024 | 9:57 p.m.\n\nWASHINGTON -- Senate lawmakers are expected Tuesday to grill the acting director of the Secret Service about law enforcement lapses in the hours before the attempted assassination of former President Donald Trump in the latest in a series of congressional hearings dedicated to the shooting.\n\nRonald Rowe became acting director of the agency last week after his predecessor, Kimberly Cheatle, resigned in the aftermath of a House hearing in which she was berated by lawmakers from both parties and failed to answer specific questions about the communication failures preceding the July 13 shooting.\n\nRowe will be joined by FBI Deputy Director Paul Abbate at a joint hearing of the Senate committees on the Judiciary and Homeland Security.\n\nThe hearing comes one day after the FBI released new details about its investigation into the shooting, revealing that the gunman, 20-year-old Thomas Matthew Crooks, had looked online for information about mass shootings, power plants, improvised explosive devices and the May assassination attempt of the Slovakian prime minister.\n\nThe FBI also said that Trump has agreed to be interviewed by agents as a crime victim; the bureau said last week that the former president had been struck in the ear by a bullet or fragment of one. Trump said Monday evening that he expected that interview to take place on Thursday.\n\nBut the bulk of the questions Tuesday are expected to be directed at Rowe as lawmakers demand answers about how Crooks was able to get so close to Trump. Investigators believe Crooks fired eight shots in Trump's direction from an AR-style rifle after scaling the roof of a building of some 135 meters (147 yards) from where Trump was speaking in Butler, Pennsylvania.\n\nOne rallygoer was killed and two others were injured. Crooks was shot dead by a Secret Service countersniper.\n\nAt her hearing last week, Cheatle said the Secret Service had \"failed\" in its mission to protect Trump. She called the attempt on Trump's life the Secret Service's \"most significant operational failure\" in decades and vowed to \"move heaven and earth\" to get to the bottom of what went wrong and make sure there's no repeat of it.\n\nCheatle acknowledged that the Secret Service was told about a suspicious person two to five times before the shooting at the rally. She also revealed that the roof from which Crooks opened fire had been identified as a potential vulnerability days before the rally.\n\nCheatle said she apologized to Trump in a phone call after the assassination attempt.\n\nIn a Monday night interview on Fox News, Trump defended the Secret Service agents who protected him from the shooting but said someone should have been on the roof with Crooks and that there should have been better communication with local police.\n\n\"They didn't speak to each other,\" he said.\n\nHe praised the sniper who killed Crooks with what he said was an amazing shot but noted: \"It would have been good if it was nine seconds sooner.\"", "source": {"uri": "lasvegassun.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Las Vegas Sun"}, "authors": [{"uri":

It also suggested that Rowe, with ready and detailed answers, was determined to strike a different posture than that of his predecessor, Kimberly Cheatle, who resigned last week after facing intense criticism from lawmakers from both major political parties after responses that were seen as evasive and lacking in specifics.\n\nMuch of Tuesday's hearing before the Senate Judiciary and Homeland Security committees focused on what Rowe suggested was inadequate information received by Secret Service personnel in the hour before the shooting, including that Crooks had been spotted on the roof.\n\nLocal law enforcement officers had spotted a suspicious-looking man pacing near the metal detectors and circulated but ultimately lost track of Crooks before he scaled the roof of a building at AGR International Inc. Shortly before the shooting, a local officer climbed up to the roof to investigate. Crooks turned and pointed his rifle at the officer, who retreated.\n\n\"No information regarding a weapon on a roof was ever passed to our personnel,\" Rowe said. At another point, he noted, \"It is troubling to me that we did not get that information as quickly as we should have. We didn't know that there was this incident going on.\"\n\nBut Rowe's willingness to assign blame to local law enforcement opened him up to harsh criticism from Senate Republicans, who saw him as failing to take responsibility.\n\n\"Isn't it the fact that the former president was shot, that a good American is dead, that other Americans were critically wounded -- isn't that enough mission failure for you to say to the person who decided that that building should not be the security perimeter, probably ought to be stepped down?\" said Sen. Josh Hawley, a Missouri Republican.\n\nRowe, raising his voice, responded that he has \"lost sleep over this for the last 17 days\" and that he would not be rushed \"to judgment\" by Congress, but he assured lawmakers that \"people will be held accountable.\"\n\nSen. Lindsey Graham, the top Republican on the Senate Judiciary Committee, said if something like this happened in the military, \"a lot of people would be fired. And if a lot of people are not fired, the system failed yet again.\"\n\nHe added: \"Nothing's going to change until somebody loses their job.\"\n\nThe FBI, meanwhile, disclosed new details about Crooks, with Deputy Director Paul Abbate saying a social media account believed to be associated with the gunman suspected in the assassination attempt espoused political violence and included antisemitic and anti-immigrant sentiment. The posts were from the 2019 and 2020 timeframe, when Crooks would have been in high school.\n\nOn Monday, the FBI revealed that Crooks had looked online for information about mass shootings, power plants, improvised explosive devices and the May assassination attempt of the Slovakian prime minister.\n\nThe FBI also said that Trump has agreed to be interviewed by agents as a crime victim. Trump, who appeared at events in the days after the shooting with a bandage on his right ear, said he expects the interview to take place on Thursday.\n\nAt Cheatle's hearing last week, she said the Secret Service had \"failed\" in its mission to protect Trump. She called the attempt on Trump's life the Secret Service's \"most significant operational failure\" in decades and vowed to \"move heaven and earth\" to get to the bottom of what went wrong and make sure there's no repeat of it.\n\nCheatle acknowledged that the Secret Service was told about a suspicious person two to five times before the shooting at the rally. She also revealed that the roof from which Crooks opened fire had been identified as a potential vulnerability days before the rally.\n\nIn a Monday night interview on Fox News Channel, Trump defended the Secret Service agents who protected him from the shooting but said that someone should have been on the roof with Crooks and that there should have been better communication with local police.\n\n\"They didn't speak to each other,\" he said.\n\nHe praised the sniper who killed Crooks with what he said was an amazing shot but noted: \"It would have been good if it was nine seconds

Trump said Monday evening that he expected that interview to take place on Thursday.\n\nBut the bulk of the questions Tuesday are expected to be directed at Rowe as lawmakers demand answers about how Crooks was able to get so close to Trump. Investigators believe Crooks fired eight shots in Trump's direction from an AR-style rifle after scaling the roof of a building of some 135 meters (147 yards) from where Trump was speaking in Butler, Pennsylvania.\n\nRep.

(AP Photo/Rod Lamkey, Jr.)\n\nOne rallygoer was killed and two others were injured. Crooks was shot dead by a Secret Service countersniper.\n\nAt her hearing last week, Cheatle said the Secret Service had \"failed\" in its mission to protect Trump. She called the attempt on Trump\u00b4s life the Secret Service\u00b4s \"most significant operational failure\" in decades and vowed to \"move heaven and earth\" to get to the bottom of what went wrong and make sure there\u00b4s no repeat of it.\n\nCheatle acknowledged that the Secret Service was told about a suspicious person two to five times before the shooting at the rally. She also revealed that the roof from which Crooks opened fire had been identified as a potential vulnerability days before the rally.\n\nCheatle said she apologized to Trump in a phone call after the assassination attempt.\n\nIn a Monday night interview on Fox News, Trump defended the Secret Service agents who protected him from the shooting but said someone should have been on the roof with Crooks and that there should have been better communication with local police.\n\n\"They didn\u00b4t speak to each other,\" he said.\n\nHe praised the sniper who killed Crooks with what he said was an amazing shot but noted: \"It would have been good if it was nine seconds sooner.\"", "source": {"uri": "dailymail.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "Daily Mail Online"}, "authors": [], "concepts":

Rowe, Jr. appears before a Senate Judiciary Committee hearing on the attempted assassination of Republican presidential nominee and former U.S. President Donald Trump, on Capitol Hill in Washington.\n\nWASHINGTON >> The man who tried to assassinate Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump appears to have posted violent antisemitic and anti-immigration content online as a teenager, a senior FBI official told a U.S. Senate hearing on Tuesday.\n\nFBI Deputy Director Paul Abbate at the hearing revealed the existence of the social media account, which dated to 2019-2020 ' when Thomas Crooks, who authorities have identified as the shooter, would have been 15 or 16 years old. It is some of the first evidence to become public about a potential motive in the July 13 attack at a campaign rally in western Pennsylvania.\n\n\"Something just very recently uncovered that I want to share is a social media account which is believed to be associated with the shooter in about the 2019-2020 time frame,\" Abbate told lawmakers, adding that more than 700 comments were posted by the account.\n\n\"Some of these comments, if ultimately attributable to the shooter, appear to reflect antisemitic and anti-immigration themes to espouse political violence and are described as extreme in nature,\" Abbate said.\n\nCrooks, who was 20, shot at Trump with an AR-15-style rifle during the rally in Butler, Pennsylvania, wounding the former president's ear, killing one rally attendee and wounding two others. Secret Service snipers killed Crooks after he opened fire.\n\nInvestigators have described Crooks as a loner with no close friends and a social network limited mainly to immediate family members.\n\nThe first shooting of a U.S. president or major party candidate in more than four decades was a glaring security lapse that led last week to former Secret Service Director Kimberly Cheatle's resignation under bipartisan congressional pressure.\n\nHer immediate successor, Acting Secret Service Director Ronald Rowe, told lawmakers that he visited the outdoor rally site in Butler and climbed onto the roof of a nearby building from which Crooks fired.\n\n\"What I saw made me ashamed,\" Rowe told a joint hearing of the Senate Homeland Security and Judiciary Committees. \"As a career law enforcement officer and a 25-year veteran with the Secret Service, I cannot defend why that roof was not better secured.\"\n\nRowe sought to assure lawmakers that he has since taken steps to prevent similar lapses from occurring amid concerns among both Democrats and Republicans about further political violence as the campaign intensifies ahead of the Nov. 5 U.S. election.\n\nCrooks flew a drone near the rally site ahead of his assassination attempt, a flight that officials failed to detect because a system designed to detect drones was not working properly due to problems with cellular network bandwidth, Rowe said.\n\nThe Secret Service, a federal law enforcement agency whose duties include protecting the president and certain other top political figures, has added six people to its protection list since July 13, including Republican vice presidential candidate JD Vance and his family and independent presidential candidate Robert F. Kennedy, while reinforcing security details, Rowe said.\n\n\"This attack was a shocking reminder that the threat of political violence is alive and well in our country. By all accounts, this was inexcusable security, and planning failure,\" Democratic Senate Homeland Security Chairman Gary Peters said, adding that his panel is working on reforms to strengthen security protocols for the Secret Service.\n\nSen. Rand Paul, the committee's top Republican, said his staff had found communication gaps between local police who first noticed Crooks and the Secret Service.\n\nRowe said that Secret Service counter snipers and members of the Trump security detail had no knowledge that there was a man with a firearm on the roof of a nearby building.\n\nThe attempted assassination is the topic of multiple investigations by House and Senate committees, as well as a new bipartisan task force.", "source": {"uri": "staradvertiser.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Honolulu Star Advertiser"}, "authors": [{"uri": "reuters@staradvertiser.com", "name": "Reuters", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Secret_Service", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "United States Secret Service"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Bureau_of_Investigation", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Federal Bureau of Investigation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republican_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Republican Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Opposition_to_immigration", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Opposition to immigration"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Senate_Committee_on_the_Judiciary", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "United States Senate Committee on the Judiciary"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antisemitism", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Antisemitism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_media", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Social media"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_Abbate", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Paul Abbate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Director_of_the_United_States_Secret_Service", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Director of the United States Secret Service"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Attempted_assassination_of_Ronald_Reagan", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Attempted assassination of Ronald Reagan"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Political_violence", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Political violence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capitol_Hill", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Capitol Hill"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Senate", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States Senate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pennsylvania", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Pennsylvania"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Pennsylvania"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Butler,_Pennsylvania", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Butler, Pennsylvania"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Butler, Pennsylvania"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Washington,_D.C.", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Washington, D.C."}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Washington, D.C."}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kimberly_Cheatle", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Kimberly Cheatle"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sniper", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Sniper"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unmanned_aerial_vehicle", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Unmanned aerial vehicle"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Department_of_Homeland_Security", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United States Department of Homeland Security"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gary_Peters", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Gary Peters"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Law_enforcement_officer", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Law enforcement officer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Independent_politician", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Independent politician"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assassination_of_John_F._Kennedy", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Assassination of John F.

She also revealed that the roof from which Crooks opened fire had been identified as a potential vulnerability days before the rally.\n\nCheatle said she apologized to Trump in a phone call after the assassination attempt.\n\nIn a Monday night interview on Fox News Channel, Trump defended the Secret Service agents who protected him from the shooting but said that someone should have been on the roof with Crooks and that there should have been better communication with local police.\n\n\"They didn't speak to each other,\" he said.\n\nHe praised the sniper who killed Crooks with what he said was an amazing shot but noted: \"It would have been good if it was nine seconds sooner.\"", "source": {"uri": "washingtontimes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Washington Times"}, "authors": [{"uri": "eric_tucker@washingtontimes.com", "name": "Eric Tucker", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Attempted_assassination_of_Ronald_Reagan", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Attempted assassination of Ronald Reagan"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Bureau_of_Investigation", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Federal Bureau of Investigation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Senate", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "United States Senate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kimberly_Cheatle", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Kimberly Cheatle"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Director_of_the_United_States_Secret_Service", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Director of the United States Secret Service"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Law_enforcement", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Law enforcement"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Secret_Service", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States Secret Service"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Associated_Press", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Associated Press"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_Abbate", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Paul Abbate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mass_shooting", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Mass shooting"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deputy_Director_of_the_Federal_Bureau_of_Investigation", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Deputy Director of the Federal Bureau of Investigation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Improvised_explosive_device", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Improvised explosive device"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prime_Minister_of_the_United_Kingdom", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Prime Minister of the United Kingdom"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Judiciary", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Judiciary"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Department_of_Homeland_Security", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United States Department of Homeland Security"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republican_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Republican Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fox_News", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Fox News"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sniper", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Sniper"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Butler,_Pennsylvania", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Butler, Pennsylvania"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Butler, Pennsylvania"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Guns", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Guns", "wgt": 16}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Guns/Competition_Shooting", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Guns/Competition Shooting", "wgt": 18}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Conditions_and_Diseases/Communication_Disorders", "label": "dmoz/Health/Conditions and Diseases/Communication Disorders", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Senses/Hearing", "label": "dmoz/Health/Senses/Hearing", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Guns/Organizations", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Guns/Organizations", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 88}], "image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2024/07/22/Election_2024_Trump_Shooting_Congress_27007_c0-407-4928-3280_s1770x1032.jpg?c63f2524447f4b9cf8c38e7c163d49718ce2fe41", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9772518", "eventUri": "eng-9772518", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-07-13", "textStart": 550, "textEnd": 557}], "sentiment": -0.3803921568627451, "wgt": 203, "relevance": 1}

What I saw made me ashamed as a career law enforcement officer and a 25 year veteran with the Secret Service. I cannot defend why that roof was not better secured,' he told Congress on Tuesday.\n\n'When I laid in that position I could not, will not understand why there was not better coverage or at least somebody looking at that roof line when that's where they were posted,' Rowe said, noting that Crooks' head would have been clearly visible from the unmanned rooftop.\n\nFormer Secret Service Director Kimberly Cheatle had been criticized for not visiting the rally site prior to her hearing on Capitol Hill last week, which prompted her resignation.\n\nRowe said when he traveled to Butler he reenacted the shooting to see how well a sniper should have been able to spot Crooks based on the sloping of the roof.\n\nReenactment of shooter on roof by Secret Service\n\nActing Director Rowe and Deputy FBI Director Paul Abbate testified in a rare joint Senate hearing on Tuesday.\n\nThirty seconds before Crooks fired his shots, local law enforcement had radioed to Secret Service warning about a man with a rifle on the roof. Around three and a half minutes before that, he'd been 'observed on the roof.'\n\nLaw enforcement 'should've been on that roof and the fact that they were in the building is something that I'm still trying to understand,' Rowe said when Sen. Josh Hawley, R-Mo., pressed him on whistleblower reports that law enforcement was supposed to be stationed on the roof but was not up there because it was 'too hot.'\n\nActing Director Rowe and Deputy Secret Service Director Paul Abbate testified in a rare joint Senate hearing on Tuesday\n\nAbbate revealed that the FBI had identified a social media account they believed belonged to the shooter.\n\n'In about the 2019, 2020 time frame, there were over 700 comments posted from this account. Some of these comments, if ultimately attributable to the shooter, appear to reflect anti-Semitic and anti-immigrant themes to espouse political violence and are described as extreme in nature,' Abbate said.\n\nRowe said that since the shooting he'd implemented a number of changes at the Secret Service, including having security plans go through multiple supervisors before implementation, expanded use of drones, more resources for protective site communications and 'expeditious' approval of requests for personnel at protective sites with heightened security environments.\n\nRowe and Abbate spoke to the Judiciary and Homeland Security committees after their boss, Cheatle submitted her resignation last week after a six-hour-long hearing where Republicans and Democrats accused her of stonewalling.\n\nTrump assassination attempt timeline, according to Secret Service acting director\n\nJuly 7: Crooks travels to rally site to spend 20 minutes doing reconnaissance\n\nJuly 12: Shooter visits Clairton Sportsmen's Club to practice shooting\n\nJuly 13, 10 a.m.: Shooter visits rally site again\n\n90 minutes before shooting: local law enforcement 'suspicious' of Crooks\n\n20 minutes before Trump takes stage, 30 minutes before shooting: Secret Service made aware of an individual with a rangefinder\n\n10 minutes before Trump takes stage, 20 minutes before shooting: Secret Service counter sniper team given photograph of the 'suspicious subject'\n\n3.5 minutes before shooting: Crooks spotted on the roof\n\n30 seconds before shooting: Crooks seen with a gun\n\nIn his opening statement the Homeland Security Committee's top Republican Rand Paul revealed that local law enforcement had told his office they'd warned the Secret Service about the vulnerabilities of the rooftop where Thomas Matthew Crooks fired shots at the president.\n\n'Local law enforcement told my staff that they specifically flagged the vulnerability of the building to the Secret Service, and were told that it would be taken care of. Clearly, these vulnerabilities were not addressed.'\n\nJudiciary Chairman Dick Durbin, D-Ill., asked why more action wasn't taken when Crooks was seen to be holding a range finder 30 minutes before the shooting.\n\n'I thought I had read that it was a golf range finder. Nonetheless, it still would have provided him the ability to provide the distance that he was away from his intended target.'\n\n'Wasn't that enough?' Durbin asked.\n\n'As far as raising suspicion, yes I think.'\n\nIn another heated moment, Sen. Josh Hawley, R-Mo., pressed Rowe on why no one had been fired for the security breach yet.\n\n'Has the Person who decided, who made the decision to send Donald Trump on stage knowing that you had a security situation. Has that person been relieved of duty?' Hawley asked.\n\n'No sir they haven't,' said Rowe.\n\n'Has the person who decided not to pull the former president off of stage when you knew that in your work the locals were working a serious security situation? Has that person been relieved of duty?'\n\n'No, sir. Again, I refer you back to my original answer that we are investigating this through a mission assurance -- ' Rowe said.\n\n' -- What more do you need to investigate? To know exactly what you need to investigate to know the failures that something ought to be held accountable? What more do you need to know?' Hawley interjected.\n\n'What I need to know is exactly what happened ... I will not rush to judgment. People will be held accountable and I will do so with integrity, and not rush to judgment and put people like unfairly persecuted.'\n\nOn Monday new text messages revealed local law enforcement officers working former President Donald Trump's Butler, Pennsylvania, rally were severely understaffed ahead of the attempted assassination.\n\nDuring the tragic rally, Trump was shot in the ear and a former volunteer firefighter lost his life after 20-year-old Thomas Matthew Crooks opened fire from the roof of a nearby building just outside the security perimeter.\n\nBombshell new text messages between the Beaver County emergency services team from the days leading up to the rally show that there was a staffing shortage.\n\nOn July 8, five days before the rally, an unnamed team leader officer wrote in a text chat that they had been 'requested by Butler to assist' with Trump's rally and needed six people to step up for the 12-hour detail. Two offered to do so for the whole time, and two more offered to split the Saturday shift.\n\nThe law enforcement leader wrote in the thread that he only had a few people available to work the event because 'everyone else is either working, on vacation or hurt.'\n\nThe never-seen-before messages also lay out a timeline of nearly 90 minutes from between the identification of Crooks and his deadly fire.\n\nNew messages, bodycam footage and law enforcement debrief were obtained by Sen. Chuck Grassley, R-Iowa, who is conducting oversight of the event.\n\nThe messages showed that law enforcement were aware of Crooks, whom they spotted more than an hour and a half before Trump took the stage.\n\nAt 4:26 p.m., a Beaver County sniper finished his shift and departed the AGR building, where Crooks was able to access and take his shots from.\n\nAs the sniper left the building, he texted a chain about a suspicious person he'd spotted - which turned out to be Crooks.\n\n'Someone followed our lead and snuck in and parked by our cars just so you know,' read one message.\n\n'I'm just letting you know because you see me go out with my rifle and put it in my car so he knows you guys are up there.'\n\nThe officer noted that he was sitting at a picnic table 'about 50 yards from the exit.'\n\n'That bike was not there when I pulled out. Maybe have them check that car,' they went on.\n\nLater on, officers exchanged photos of Crooks, who had then been marked a 'suspicious person,' at 5:38 p.m., over 30 minutes before Trump was shot.\n\n'Kid learning (sic) around building we are in. I did see him with a range finder looking towards stage. FYI. If you wanna notify SS snipers to look out.\n\nAnother officer asked what direction Crooks was headed, to which an unnamed officer replied, 'if I had to guess toward the back. Away from the event.'\n\nIt comes after a whistleblower last week revealed Secret Service stood in the way of using drone technology to survey the scene of the Butler rally where an assassin tried to shoot former President Donald Trump.\n\nSen. Josh Hawley, R-Mo., revealed last week that one whistleblower had told his office the night before the rally Secret Service 'repeatedly denied offers from a local law enforcement partner to utilize drone technology to secure the rally.'\n\nThe whistleblower alleged that after the shooting Secret Service 'changed course and asked the local partner to deploy the drone technology to surveil the site in the aftermath.'", "source": {"uri": "expressdigest.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "expressdigest.com"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matt_Crooks",

As a career law enforcement officer and a 25-year Secret Service veteran, I cannot defend why that roof was not better secured,\" he said.\n\nThe testimony was the most detailed catalog to date by the Secret Service of law enforcement failings and miscommunications, with Rowe accepting blame for his own agency's mistakes while also pointedly criticizing local law enforcement for communication breakdowns that resulted in his agency not receiving information that a gunman, later identified as 20-year-old Thomas Matthew Crooks, had been seen on the roof of a building less than 150 yards (135 meters) from the rally stage where Trump was speaking.\n\n\"Neither the Secret Service counter sniper teams nor members of the former president's security detail had any knowledge that there was a man on the roof of the building with a firearm,\" Rowe said. \"It is my understanding those personnel were not aware the assailant had a firearm until they heard gunshots.\"\n\nHe said that the shooting amounted to a \"failure on multiple levels,\" including a failure of imagination and a \"failure to challenge our assumptions.\"\n\n\"We assumed that the state and locals had it,\" Rowe said. \"We made an assumption that there was going to be uniformed presence out there, that there would be sufficient eyes to cover that, that there was going to be counter-sniper teams\" in the building from whose roof Crooks fired shots.\n\n\"And I can assure you,\" Rowe added, \"that we're not going to make that mistake again.\"\n\nHe said he had implemented multiple reforms since taking over as acting director last week, including mandating that every event security plan is vetted by multiple experienced supervisors before being implemented, expanding the use of aerial drones to improve visibility of roofs, dedicating more resources to improve communications at events where the Secret Service is operating. He said he's also directed that federal and local counter snipers work together on roofs.\n\nTrump, the 2024 Republican presidential nominee, was struck in the ear by a bullet or a bullet fragment in the assassination attempt, one rallygoer was killed and two others were injured before the gunman was killed by a Secret Service counter-sniper.\n\nThe blunt and at times emotional testimony Tuesday, featuring combative exchanges with lawmakers, ensured that an already simmering blame game between federal and local authorities will continue. It also suggested that Rowe, with ready and generally detailed answers, was determined to strike a different posture than that of his predecessor, Kimberly Cheatle, who resigned last week after facing intense criticism from lawmakers from both major political parties following responses at a congressional hearing that were seen as evasive and lacking in specifics.\n\nTuesday's hearing before the Senate Judiciary and Homeland Security committees was the latest in a series of congressional sessions dedicated to the law enforcement lapses and missed communications that preceded the shooting.\n\nLocal law enforcement officers had first observed a suspicious-looking man at the rally site more than an hour before the event and circulated that information, including photographs of a man who turned out to be Crooks. But the officers ultimately lost track of Crooks, who was able to scale the roof of a building at AGR International Inc., a supplier of automation equipment for the glass and plastic packaging industry, and fire an estimated eight shots with an AR-15-style rife.\n\nShortly before the shooting, a local officer climbed up to the roof to investigate. Crooks turned and pointed his rifle at the officer, who retreated.\n\nEven though text messages among local snipers revealed anxiety about the man, Rowe said the only thing the Secret Service knew at the time of the shooting was that law enforcement was contending with a suspicious-looking man.\n\n\"No information regarding a weapon on a roof was ever passed to our personnel,\" Rowe said. At another point, he noted, \"It is troubling to me that we did not get that information as quickly as we should have. We didn't know that there was this incident going on.\"\n\nBut Rowe's willingness to assign blame to local law enforcement opened him up to harsh criticism from Senate Republicans, who saw him as failing to take sufficient responsibility.\n\n\"Isn't the fact that a former president was shot, that a good American is dead, that other Americans were critically wounded -- isn't that enough mission failure for you to say to the person who decided that that building should not be in the security perimeter, probably ought to be stepped down?\" said Sen. Josh Hawley, a Missouri Republican.\n\nRowe, raising his voice, responded that he has \"lost sleep over this for the last 17 days\" and that he would not be rushed \"to judgment\" by Congress. He assured lawmakers that \"people will be held accountable.\"\n\nSen. Lindsey Graham, the top Republican on the Senate Judiciary Committee, said if something like this happened in the military, \"a lot of people would be fired. And if a lot of people are not fired, the system failed yet again.\"\n\nHe added: \"Nothing's going to change until somebody loses their job.\"\n\nThe FBI, meanwhile, disclosed new details about Crooks, with Deputy Director Paul Abbate saying a social media account believed to be associated with the gunman suspected in the assassination attempt espoused political violence and included antisemitic and anti-immigrant sentiment. The posts were from the 2019-2020 timeframe, when Crooks would have been in high school.\n\nAbbate did not identify the social media platform, saying investigators were still trying to definitively determine that it belonged to Crooks. However, he indicated that it was separate from an account on a different platform called Gab that was active in 2021.\n\nThe chief executive of Gab posted on X, formerly known as Twitter, during the Senate hearing that Crooks's presence on that platform was consistent with being \"pro-Biden and in particular pro-Biden's immigration policy.\"\n\nOn Monday, the FBI revealed that Crooks had looked online for information about mass shootings, power plants, improvised explosive devices and the May assassination attempt of the Slovakian prime minister Robert Fico.\n\nThe FBI also said that Trump has agreed to be interviewed by agents as a crime victim.", "source": {"uri": "fortune.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Fortune"}, "authors": [{"uri": "associated_press@fortune.com", "name":

Rowe says he recently traveled to the Pennsylvania shooting site and says what he saw made him ashamed.\n\nRowe is being joined by FBI Deputy Director Paul Abbate at a joint hearing of the Senate committees on the Judiciary and Homeland Security.\n\nThe FBI's No. 2 official says a social media account believed to be associated with the gunman suspected in the assassination attempt espoused political violence and included antisemitic and anti-immigrant sentiment. The posts were from the 2019 and 2020 timeframe, when the shooter, Thomas Matthew Crooks, would have been in high school.\n\nPeople are also reading...\n\nNew Lake City public charter school planned to open in August 2025 Bicyclist hurt in Florence crash with minivan One person dies in Tuesday Darlington County house fire SLED issues statement on July 22 fatal police shooting Florence County Animal Shelter offers adoption specials Jordan hosting third annual back-to-school drive in Marion Lake City search warrants turns up drugs, guns, arrests Florence's former Griffin Motors dealership up for sale New concept Bojangles set to open in downtown Florence Post 1 rallies for walk-off victory against Chapin/Newberry 1 dead after man fires shots at Florence officers Marion County Habitat for Humanity dedicates home in Mullins Richardson, Rogers help Post 1 shut out West Columbia Lake City man arrested in drug investigation Man wounded in Thursday night Florence shooting\n\nSenate lawmakers are grilling the officials about law enforcement lapses in the hours before the attempted assassination of Trump in the latest in a series of congressional hearings dedicated to the shooting.\n\nRowe became acting director of the agency last week after Kimberly Cheatle resigned in the aftermath of a House hearing in which she was berated by lawmakers and failed to answer specific questions about the communication failures preceding the July 13 shooting.\n\n\"If this happened in the military, a lot of people would be fired,\" said Sen. Lindsey Graham, the top Republican on the Senate Judiciary Committee. \"And if a lot of people are not fired, the system failed yet again.\n\nHe added: \"Nothing's going to change until somebody loses their job.\"\n\nThe hearing comes one day after the FBI released new details about its investigation into the shooting, revealing that the gunman had looked online for information about mass shootings, power plants, improvised explosive devices and the May assassination attempt of the Slovakian prime minister.\n\nListen now and subscribe: Apple Podcasts | Google Podcasts | Spotify | RSS Feed | SoundStack | All Of Our Podcasts\n\nThe FBI also said that Trump, the 2024 Republican presidential nominee, has agreed to be interviewed by agents as a crime victim. The bureau said last week that the former president had been struck in the ear by a bullet or fragment of one. Trump said Monday evening that he expected that interview to take place on Thursday.\n\nBut most of the questions Tuesday are expected to be directed at Rowe as lawmakers demand answers about how Crooks was able to get so close to Trump. Investigators believe Crooks fired eight shots in Trump's direction from an AR-style rifle after scaling the roof of a building of some 135 meters (147 yards) from where Trump was speaking in Butler, Pennsylvania.\n\nOne rallygoer was killed, and two others were injured. Crooks was shot dead by a Secret Service counter-sniper.\n\nAt her hearing last week, Cheatle said the Secret Service had \"failed\" in its mission to protect Trump. She called the attempt on Trump's life the Secret Service's \"most significant operational failure\" in decades and vowed to \"move heaven and earth\" to get to the bottom of what went wrong and make sure there's no repeat of it.\n\nPhotos: Trump injured, 2 killed in shooting at rally\n\nCheatle acknowledged that the Secret Service was told about a suspicious person two to five times before the shooting at the rally. She also revealed that the roof from which Crooks opened fire had been identified as a potential vulnerability days before the rally.\n\nCheatle said she apologized to Trump in a phone call after the assassination attempt.\n\nIn a Monday night interview on Fox News Channel, Trump defended the Secret Service agents who protected him from the shooting but said that someone should have been on the roof with Crooks and that there should have been better communication with local police.\n\n\"They didn't speak to each other,\" he said.\n\nHe praised the sniper who killed Crooks with what he said was an amazing shot but noted: \"It would have been good if it was nine seconds sooner.\"\n\nGet Government & Politics updates in your inbox!\n\nStay up-to-date on the latest in local and national

"Trump security was unaware of gunman until shots fired: Secret Service", "body": "Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump is evacuated from a rally by Secret Service agents after an assassination attempt in Butler, Pennsylvania, on July 13, 2024\n\nDonald Trump's security detail and a sniper team were not aware there was a gunman on a roof until he opened fire on the former president, the acting Secret Service director said Tuesday.\n\nLocal law enforcement identified the gunman, Thomas Matthew Crooks, as a \"suspicious person\" about 90 minutes before the July 13 attack at a Trump campaign rally in Butler, Pennsylvania, according to FBI officials.\n\nSince the assassination attempt, questions have been raised about when the Secret Service became aware of the presence of the gunman on the roof of a building that overlooked the campaign event.\n\n\"Based on what I know right now, neither the Secret Service counter-sniper teams nor members of the former president's security detail had any knowledge that there was a man on the AGR roof with a firearm,\" acting Secret Service chief Ronald Rowe told a joint Senate committee.\n\n\"The only thing we had was that locals were working an issue at the three o'clock, which would have been the former president's right-hand side, which is where the shots came from,\" Rowe said.\n\n\"Nothing about man on the roof, nothing about man with a gun,\" he said.\n\nFBI special agent Kevin Rojek said Monday that a police officer was boosted on to the roof by another officer at 6:11 pm.\n\nCrooks pointed his rifle at the officer, who \"immediately dropped to the ground.\"\n\n\"Approximately 25 to 30 seconds after this encounter, the subject fired eight rounds before being successfully neutralized,\" Rojek said.\n\nRowe said Crooks was shot dead by a Secret Service sniper \"within 15.5 seconds\" of firing the first shot.\n\nThe Republican presidential candidate was wounded in the right ear, while two rally attendees were injured and a Pennsylvania firefighter was killed.\n\n- 'Ashamed' -\n\nRowe said he \"cannot defend\" why the rooftop where Crooks fired from was not better secured, and said he was \"ashamed\" about the security lapses.\n\nHe said local law enforcement had been tasked with securing the rooftop. \"We assumed that the state and locals had it,\" he said.\n\nAsked why Trump was allowed to take the stage, Rowe said Crooks had not been identified as a threat but only as suspicious.\n\n\"We did not have anything beyond suspicious person that was communicated to us,\" he said. \"Suspicion had not risen to the level of threat or imminent harm.\"\n\nRowe said communications failures between local law enforcement and the Secret Service contributed to what he called a \"failure on multiple levels.\"\n\nThe Secret Service had \"technical difficulties\" with its counter-drone capabilities on the day of the attack and they were not \"operational until after five o'clock,\" he said.\n\nCrooks flew a drone near the rally site for 11 minutes about two hours before the attack, according to the FBI.\n\nFBI deputy director Paul Abbate also addressed the committee hearing and said the authorities still have not established a motive.\n\nHe said they have identified a social media account believed to be associated with Crooks.\n\n\"In about the 2019, 2020 timeframe there were over 700 comments posted from this account,\" Abbate said. \"Some of these comments, if ultimately attributable to the shooter, appear to reflect anti-Semitic and anti-immigration themes, to espouse political violence and are described as extreme in nature.\"\n\nSecret Service Director Kimberly Cheatle resigned last week after acknowledging that the agency had failed in its mission to prevent the assassination attempt.\n\ncl/bjt", "source": {"uri": "ktbs.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "KTBS"}, "authors": [{"uri": "chris_lefkow@ktbs.com", "name": "Chris Lefkow", "type":

Lynch\n\nWASHINGTON (Reuters) -The U.S. Secret Service's new acting director said on Tuesday that he was \"ashamed\" of a security lapse that led to the July 13 attempted assassination of Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump, but blamed the shortfall on local law enforcement.\n\nIn testimony before two Senate committees, Acting Secret Service Director Ronald Rowe said he visited the outdoor rally site in Butler, Pennsylvania, and climbed onto the roof of a nearby building from which 20-year-old Thomas Crooks fired shots that wounded Trump's right ear, killed one rally attendee and wounded two others with an AR-15-style rifle.\n\n\"What I saw made me ashamed,\" Rowe told a joint hearing of the Senate Homeland Security and Judiciary Committees. \"As a career law enforcement officer, and a 25-year veteran with the Secret Service, I cannot defend why that roof was not better secured.\"\n\nThe first shooting of a U.S. president or major party candidate in more than four decades was a glaring security lapse that led last week to former Secret Service Director Kimberly Cheatle's resignation under bipartisan congressional pressure.\n\nBut Rowe went on to tell lawmakers that the Secret Service erred by assuming that a local officials would cover the building and its roof, not the Secret Service.\n\nRepublican Senator John Cornyn pushed back on the notion that the responsibility should have been left to others.\n\n\"Isn't that something that Secret Service should have covered, as opposed to delegating it to local law enforcement?\" Cornyn asked.\n\n\"We assumed that the state and locals had it,\" Rowe replied. \"I can assure you that we're not going to make that mistake again.\"\n\nDemocratic Senator Richard Blumenthal asked Rowe: \"Ultimately, doesn't the buck stop with the Secret Service?\"\n\n\"It stops with us, sir,\" Rowe said. But Rowe added: \"If they'd just held their post and looked left.\"\n\nRowe's comments came days after a local SWAT team assigned to help protect Trump told ABC News that it had no contact with Secret Service agents in charge of security at the rally before the shooting, and that an anticipated face-to-face briefing with Secret Service officials never happened.\n\nRowe said he has already taken steps to prevent similar lapses from occurring amid concerns among both Democrats and Republicans about further political violence as the campaign intensifies ahead of the Nov. 5 U.S. election.\n\nFBI Deputy Director Paul Abbate, who also testified before the panels, said Crooks appears to have posted violent antisemitic and anti-immigration content online as a teenager.\n\nIt is some of the first evidence of Crooks' possible inclination toward extremism and political violence found by investigators, who have yet to identify a motive.\n\nAbbate said investigators found a social media account dating to 2019-2020, when Crooks would have been 15 or 16 years old, adding that the account had posted more than 700 comments.\n\n\"Some of these comments, if ultimately attributable to the shooter, appear to reflect antisemitic and anti-immigration themes, to espouse political violence, and are described as extreme in nature,\" Abbate told lawmakers.\n\nCrooks flew a drone near the rally site ahead of the shooting, a flight that Secret Service officials failed to notice because a system for detecting drones was not working properly due to problems with the local cellular network, Rowe said.\n\nLawmakers sought to learn why the Secret Service did not delay the rally or prevent Trump from taking the stage, noting that local police saw Crooks with a rangefinder device for measuring distances about an hour before the shooting.\n\nRowe said Crooks was only one among a number of individuals to draw local law enforcement attention, and added that the Secret Service was not informed when local police saw Crooks on the roof with the rife, just before he opened fire.\n\n\"They were in the midst of dealing with a very critical situation and they articulated that over the radio, as I understand it. However, it was never relayed over to us,\" Rowe said.\n\nThe proceedings grew heated when Republican Senator Josh Hawley pushed Rowe to begin expelling agency employees immediately.\n\n\"I will tell you, senator ... that people will be held accountable, and I will do so with integrity and not rush to judgment and let people be unfairly persecuted,\" Rowe told Hawley with a raised voice.\n\n(Reporting by David Morgan, Sarah N.

Allison Bailey/Middle East Images/AFP via Getty hide caption\n\nThe FBI has found a social media account featuring antisemitic and anti-immigration comments that investigators believe to be associated with the gunman who tried to assassinate former President Donald Trump, a senior bureau official said Tuesday.\n\nFBI Deputy Director Paul Abbate told members of Congress that the account could be linked to the shooter, Thomas Crooks, but he cautioned that officials are still working to verify the account's authenticity.\n\n\"There were over 700 comments posted; some of these comments, if ultimately attributable to the shooter, appear to reflect antisemitic and anti-immigration themes to espouse political violence and are described as extreme in nature,\" Abbate told a joint hearing of the Senate Judiciary and Homeland Security committees.\n\nThe note of caution about the account's authenticity stems, in part, from confusion about a gaming account that the FBI had at one point attributed to Crooks but later turned out to be a hoax.\n\nThe details about the account came as lawmakers questioned Abbate and the acting director of the Secret Service about security failures and other details of the July 13 shooting targeting Trump, the Republican presidential nominee, in Butler, Pa. Crooks was able to fire eight shots from the roof of a nearby building; a bullet or bullet fragment struck Trump, killed a person at the rally, and injured two others before Crooks was killed by a Secret Service sniper.\n\nAbbate said the account dates to the 2019-2020 time period, when Crooks would have been 15 or 16 years old. It could provide a glimpse into Crooks' thinking, which has proven elusive as the FBI said the shooter generally had few social contacts and little social media presence. It wasn't clear from Abbate's comment what social media account it was on.\n\nSen. Rick Scott, R-Fla., blamed federal officials for not talking more to the press and providing regular updates on their investigations.\n\n\"You're a black hole. You lose the support of the American public because people don't believe you're being direct with them,\" he said.\n\nIn addition to questions about the shooter, lawmakers also slammed the Secret Service's security gaps. The Secret Service's acting director, Ronald Rowe, said security at the July 13 rally was a failure on multiple levels, and he had implemented changes to security to ensure another shooting doesn't happen again.\n\nRowe said he retraced Crooks' steps on the roof to try to understand how he was able to get a shot at Trump and what went wrong.\n\n\"What I saw made me ashamed,\" Rowe told lawmakers. \"As a career law enforcement officer and a 25-year veteran with the Secret Service, I cannot defend why that roof was not better secured.\"\n\nRowe also blamed communication silos between Secret Service agents and local law enforcement. Reports being discussed on a text chain did not get shared with Secret Service agents on the scene: \"Nothing about man on the roof, nothing about man with a gun, none of that information ever made it over our net,\" he told the hearing.\n\nHe said changes to security procedures include using more drones to help detect threats on rooftops, and ensuring every security plan for events is vetted by multiple supervisors.\n\nRowe stepped in to run the Secret Service after the previous director, Kimberly Cheatle, resigned from her job last week after she faced withering criticism from both Democrats and Republicans for not being able to fully answer their questions about the attempted assassination.\n\nSome Republican senators at the hearing made it clear that Cheatle's resignation wasn't enough to assuage their concerns.\n\nSen. Josh Hawley, a Republican from Missouri, urged the agency to fire more people, while Sen. Roger Marshall, R-Kan., accused the Secret Secret of either \"incompetence or some type of a cultural problem\" -- something the acting director disputed.\n\n\"I think you would agree with me that there were multiple individual and institutional failures the day of this assassination attempt,\" Marshall told Rowe.", "source": {"uri": "npr.org", "dataType": "news", "title": "NPR"}, "authors":

Trump said Monday evening that he expected that interview to take place on Thursday.\n\nARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW ARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW\n\nBut most of the questions Tuesday are expected to be directed at Rowe as lawmakers demand answers about how Crooks was able to get so close to Trump.

Crooks was shot dead by a Secret Service counter-sniper.\n\nAt her hearing last week, Cheatle said the Secret Service had \"failed\" in its mission to protect Trump. She called the attempt on Trump's life the Secret Service's \"most significant operational failure\" in decades and vowed to \"move heaven and earth\" to get to the bottom of what went wrong and make sure there's no repeat of it.\n\nCheatle acknowledged that the Secret Service was told about a suspicious person two to five times before the shooting at the rally.

assassination attempt.\n\nARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW ARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW\n\nIn a Monday night interview on Fox News Channel, Trump defended the Secret Service agents who protected him from the shooting but said that someone should have been on the roof with Crooks and that there should have been better communication with local police.\n\n\"They didn't speak to each other,\" he said.\n\nHe praised the sniper who killed Crooks with what he said was an amazing shot but noted: \"It would have been good if it was nine seconds sooner.\"\n\nRead more on the U.S. Election at thestar.com",

As a career law enforcement officer and a 25-year Secret Service veteran, I cannot defend why that roof was not better secured,\" he said.\n\nThe testimony was the most detailed catalog to date by the Secret Service of law enforcement failings and miscommunications, with Rowe accepting blame for his own agency's mistakes while also pointedly criticizing local law enforcement for communication breakdowns that resulted in his agency not sharing information that a gunman, later identified as 20-year-old Thomas Matthew Crooks, had been spotted on the roof of a building less than 150 yards (135 meters) from the rally stage where Trump was speaking.\n\n\"Neither the Secret Service counter sniper teams nor members of the former president's security detail had any knowledge that there was a man on the roof of the building with a firearm,\" Rowe said. \"It is my understanding those personnel were not aware the assailant had a firearm until they heard gunshots.\"\n\nHe said that the shooting amounted to a \"failure on multiple levels,\" including a failure of imagination and a \"failure to challenge our assumptions.\"\n\n\"We assumed that the state and locals had it,\" Rowe said. \"We made an assumption that there was going to be uniformed presence out there, that there would be sufficient eyes to cover that, that there was going to be counter-sniper teams\" in the building from whose roof Crooks fired shots.\n\n\"And I can assure you,\" Rowe added, \"that we're not going to make that mistake again.\"\n\nHe said he had implemented multiple reforms since taking over as acting director last week, including mandating that every event security plan is vetted by multiple experienced supervisors before being implemented, expanding the use of aerial drones to improve visibility of roofs and dedicating more resources to improve communications at events where the Secret Service is operating.\n\nTrump, the 2024 Republican presidential nominee, was struck in the ear by a bullet or a bullet fragment in the assassination attempt, one rallygoer was killed and two others were injured before the gunman was killed by a Secret Service counter-sniper.\n\nThe blunt and at times emotional testimony Tuesday, featuring combative exchanges with lawmakers, ensured that an already simmering blame game between federal and local authorities will continue. It also suggested that Rowe, with ready and generally detailed answers, was determined to strike a different posture than that of his predecessor, Kimberly Cheatle, who resigned last week after facing intense criticism from lawmakers from both major political parties following responses at a congressional hearing that were seen as evasive and lacking in specifics.\n\nTuesday's hearing before the Senate Judiciary and Homeland Security committees was the latest in a series of congressional sessions dedicated to the law enforcement lapses and missed communications that preceded the shooting.\n\nLocal law enforcement officers had first observed a suspicious-looking man at the rally site more than an hour before the event and circulated that information, including photographs of a man who turned out to be Crooks. But the officers ultimately lost track of Crooks, who was able to scale the roof of a building at AGR International Inc., a supplier of automation equipment for the glass and plastic packaging industry, and fire an estimated eight shots with an AR-15-style rife.\n\nShortly before the shooting, a local officer climbed up to the roof to investigate. Crooks turned and pointed his rifle at the officer, who retreated.\n\nEven though text messages among local snipers revealed anxiety about the man, Rowe said the only thing the Secret Service knew at the time of the shooting was that law enforcement was contending with a suspicious-looking man.\n\n\"No information regarding a weapon on a roof was ever passed to our personnel,\" Rowe said. At another point, he noted, \"It is troubling to me that we did not get that information as quickly as we should have. We didn't know that there was this incident going on.\"\n\nBut Rowe's willingness to assign blame to local law enforcement opened him up to harsh criticism from Senate Republicans, who saw him as failing to take sufficient responsibility.\n\n\"Isn't the fact that a former president was shot, that a good American is dead, that other Americans were critically wounded -- isn't that enough mission failure for you to say to the person who decided that that building should not be in the security perimeter, probably ought to be stepped down?\" said Sen. Josh Hawley, a Missouri Republican.\n\nRowe, raising his voice, responded that he has \"lost sleep over this for the last 17 days\" and that he would not be rushed \"to judgment\" by Congress. He assured lawmakers that \"people will be held accountable.\"\n\nSen. Lindsey Graham, the top Republican on the Senate Judiciary Committee, said if something like this happened in the military, \"a lot of people would be fired. And if a lot of people are not fired, the system failed yet again.\"\n\nHe added: \"Nothing's going to change until somebody loses their job.\"\n\nThe FBI, meanwhile, disclosed new details about Crooks, with Deputy Director Paul Abbate saying a social media account believed to be associated with the gunman suspected in the assassination attempt espoused political violence and included antisemitic and anti-immigrant sentiment. The posts were from the 2019-2020 timeframe, when Crooks would have been in high school.\n\nAbbate did not identify the social media platform, saying investigators were still trying to definitively determine that it belonged to Crooks. However, he indicated that it was separate from an account on a different platform called Gab that was active in 2021.\n\nThe chief executive of Gab posted on X, formerly known as Twitter, during the Senate hearing that Crooks's presence on that platform was consistent with being \"pro-Biden and in particular pro-Biden's immigration policy.\"\n\nOn Monday, the FBI revealed that Crooks had looked online for information about mass shootings, power plants, improvised explosive devices and the May assassination attempt of the Slovakian prime minister Robert Fico.\n\nThe FBI also said that Trump has agreed to be interviewed by agents as a crime victim.", "source": {"uri": "sentinelcolorado.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Sentinel Colorado"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

deputy grilled in Senate over Trump assassination bid", "body": "The acting director of the Secret Service says he \"cannot defend\" why the roof used by the gunman in the assassination attempt of former US president Donald Trump was not secured.\n\nRonald Rowe is testifying on Tuesday before two Senate committees.\n\nMr Rowe says he recently travelled to the Pennsylvania shooting site and says what he saw made him ashamed.\n\nThe FBI's number two official is also testifying.\n\nSenate legislators are grilling the officials about law enforcement lapses in the hours before the attempted assassination of Mr Trump in the latest in a series of congressional hearings dedicated to the shooting.\n\nMr Rowe became acting director of the agency last week after Kimberly Cheatle resigned in the aftermath of a House hearing in which she was berated by legislators and failed to answer specific questions about the communication failures preceding the July 13 shooting.\n\nMr Rowe is being joined by FBI deputy director Paul Abbate at a joint hearing of the Senate committees on the Judiciary and Homeland Security.\n\n\"If this happened in the military, a lot of people would be fired,\" said senator Lindsey Graham, the top Republican on the Senate Judiciary Committee.\n\n\"And if a lot of people are not fired, the system failed yet again.\"\n\nHe added: \"Nothing's going to change

Crooks, had looked online for information about mass shootings, power plants, improvised explosive devices and the May assassination attempt of the Slovakian prime minister.\n\nThe FBI also said that Mr Trump, the 2024 Republican presidential nominee, has agreed to be interviewed by agents as a crime victim.\n\nThe bureau said last week that the former president had been struck in the ear by a bullet or fragment of one.\n\nMr Trump said on Monday evening that he expected that interview to take place on Thursday.\n\nBut most of the questions on Tuesday are expected to be directed at Mr Rowe as legislators demand answers about how Crooks was able to get so close to Mr Trump.\n\nInvestigators believe Crooks fired eight shots in Trump's direction from an AR-style rifle after scaling the roof of a building of some 135 metres (147 yards) from where Mr Trump was speaking in Butler, Pennsylvania.\n\nOne rallygoer was killed, and two others were injured.\n\nCrooks was shot dead by a Secret Service counter-sniper.\n\nAt her hearing last week, Ms Cheatle said the Secret Service had \"failed\" in its mission to protect Mr Trump.\n\nShe called the attempt on Mr Trump's life the Secret Service's \"most significant operational failure\" in decades and vowed to \"move heaven and earth\" to get to the bottom of what went wrong and make sure there's no repeat of it.\n\nMs Cheatle acknowledged that the Secret Service was told about a suspicious person two to five times before the shooting at the rally.\n\nShe also revealed that the roof from which Crooks opened fire had been identified as a potential vulnerability days before the rally.\n\nMs Cheatle said she apologised to Mr Trump in a phone call after the assassination attempt.\n\nIn a Monday night interview on Fox News Channel, Mr Trump defended the Secret Service agents who protected him from the shooting but said that someone should have been on the roof with Crooks and that there should have been better communication with local police.\n\n\"They didn't speak to each other,\" he said.\n\nHe praised the sniper who killed Crooks with what he said was an amazing shot but noted: \"It would have been good if it was nine seconds sooner.\"", "source": {"uri": "belfasttelegraph.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "Belfast Telegraph"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

As a career law enforcement officer and a 25-year Secret Service veteran, I cannot defend why that roof was not better secured,\" he said.\n\nThe testimony was the most detailed catalog to date by the Secret Service of law enforcement failings and miscommunications, with Rowe accepting blame for his own agency's mistakes while also pointedly criticizing local law enforcement for communication breakdowns that resulted in his agency not receiving information that a gunman, later identified as 20-year-old Thomas Matthew Crooks, had been seen on the roof of a building less than 450 feet from the rally stage where Trump was speaking.\n\n\"Neither the Secret Service counter sniper teams nor members of the former president's security detail had any knowledge that there was a man on the roof of the building with a firearm,\" Rowe said. \"It is my understanding those personnel were not aware the assailant had a firearm until they heard gunshots.\"\n\nHe said that the shooting amounted to a \"failure on multiple levels,\" including a failure of imagination and a \"failure to challenge our assumptions.\"\n\n\"We assumed that the state and locals had it,\" Rowe said. \"We made an assumption that there was going to be uniformed presence out there, that there would be sufficient eyes to cover that, that there was going to be counter-sniper teams\" in the building from where Crooks fired shots.\n\n\"And I can assure you,\" Rowe added, \"that we're not going to make that mistake again.\"\n\nHe said he had implemented multiple reforms since taking over as acting director last week, including mandating that every event security plan is vetted by multiple experienced supervisors before being implemented, expanding the use of aerial drones to improve visibility of roofs and dedicating more resources to improve communications at events where the Secret Service is operating. He said he's also directed that federal and local counter snipers work together on roofs.\n\nTrump, the 2024 Republican presidential nominee, was struck in the ear by a bullet or a bullet fragment in the assassination attempt, one rallygoer was killed and two others were injured before the gunman was killed by a Secret Service counter-sniper.\n\nThe blunt and at times emotional testimony Tuesday, featuring combative exchanges with lawmakers, ensured that an already simmering blame game between federal and local authorities will continue. It also suggested that Rowe, with ready and generally detailed answers, was determined to strike a different posture than that of his predecessor, Kimberly Cheatle, who resigned last week after facing intense criticism from lawmakers from both major political parties following responses at a congressional hearing that were seen as evasive and lacking in specifics.\n\nMISSED CHANCES\n\nTuesday's hearing before the Senate Judiciary and Homeland Security committees was the latest in a series of congressional sessions dedicated to the law enforcement lapses and missed communications that preceded the shooting.\n\nLocal law enforcement officers had first observed a suspicious-looking man at the rally site more than an hour before the event and circulated that information, including photographs of a man who turned out to be Crooks. But the officers ultimately lost track of Crooks, who was able to scale the roof of a building at AGR International Inc., a supplier of automation equipment for the glass and plastic packaging industry, and fire an estimated eight shots with an AR-15-style rife.\n\nShortly before the shooting, a local officer climbed up to the roof to investigate. Crooks turned and pointed his rifle at the officer, who retreated.\n\nEven though text messages among local snipers revealed anxiety about the man, Rowe said the only thing the Secret Service knew at the time of the shooting was that law enforcement was contending with a suspicious-looking man.\n\n\"No information regarding a weapon on a roof was ever passed to our personnel,\" Rowe said. At another point, he noted, \"It is troubling to me that we did not get that information as quickly as we should have. We didn't know that there was this incident going on.\"\n\nBut Rowe's willingness to assign blame to local law enforcement opened him up to harsh criticism from Senate Republicans, who saw him as failing to take sufficient responsibility.\n\n\"Isn't the fact that a former president was shot, that a good American is dead, that other Americans were critically wounded -- isn't that enough mission failure for you to say to the person who decided that that building should not be in the security perimeter, probably ought to be stepped down?\" said Sen. Josh Hawley, a Missouri Republican.\n\nRowe, raising his voice, responded that he has \"lost sleep over this for the last 17 days\" and that he would not be rushed \"to judgment\" by Congress. He assured lawmakers that \"people will be held accountable.\"\n\nSouth Carolina Sen. Lindsey Graham, the top Republican on the Senate Judiciary Committee, said if something like this happened in the military, \"a lot of people would be fired. And if a lot of people are not fired, the system failed yet again.\"\n\nHe added: \"Nothing's going to change until somebody loses their job.\"\n\nThe FBI, meanwhile, disclosed new details about Crooks, with Deputy Director Paul Abbate saying a social media account believed to be associated with the gunman suspected in the assassination attempt espoused political violence and included antisemitic and anti-immigrant sentiment. The posts were from the 2019-2020 timeframe, when Crooks would have been in high school.\n\nAbbate did not identify the social media platform, saying investigators were still trying to definitively determine that it belonged to Crooks. However, he indicated that it was separate from an account on a different platform called Gab that was active in 2021.\n\nThe chief executive of Gab, Andrew Torba, posted on the social media platform X during the Senate hearing that Crooks' presence on that platform was consistent with being \"pro-Biden and in particular pro-Biden's immigration policy.\"\n\nSen.

Trump said Monday evening that he expected that interview to take place on Thursday.\n\nBut the bulk of the questions Tuesday are expected to be directed at Rowe as lawmakers demand answers about how Crooks was able to get so close to Trump. Investigators believe Crooks fired eight shots in Trump's direction from an AR-style rifle after scaling the roof of a building of some 135 meters (147 yards) from where Trump was speaking in Butler, Pennsylvania.\n\nOne rallygoer was killed and two others were injured. Crooks was shot dead by a Secret Service countersniper.\n\nAt her hearing last week, Cheatle said the Secret Service had \"failed\" in its mission to protect Trump. She called the attempt on Trump's life the Secret Service's \"most significant operational failure\" in decades and vowed to \"move heaven and earth\" to get to the bottom of what went wrong and make sure there's no repeat of it.\n\nCheatle acknowledged that the Secret Service was told about a suspicious person two to five times before the shooting at the rally. She also revealed that the roof from which Crooks opened fire had been identified as a potential vulnerability days before the rally.\n\nCheatle said she apologized to Trump in a phone call after the assassination attempt.\n\nIn a Monday night interview on Fox News, Trump defended the Secret Service agents who protected him from the shooting but said someone should have been on the roof with Crooks and that there should have been better communication with local police.\n\n\"They didn't speak to each other,\" he said.\n\nHe praised the sniper who killed Crooks with what he said was an amazing shot but noted: \"It would have been good if it was nine seconds sooner.\"\n\nMore from this section\n\nInformative Research's Kelly Richards Receives MPA Elite Women Award\n\nRocking Out at a Drug-Free World Art and Music Festival at the Church of Scientology\n\nFix Support Apple Com/iPhone/Restore in 5 Minutes -

It also suggested that Rowe, with ready and generally detailed answers, was determined to strike a different posture than that of his predecessor, Kimberly Cheatle, who resigned last week after facing intense criticism from lawmakers from both major political parties following responses at a congressional hearing that were seen as evasive and lacking in specifics.\n\nTuesday's hearing before the Senate Judiciary and Homeland Security committees was the latest in a series of congressional sessions dedicated to the law enforcement lapses and missed communications that preceded the shooting.\n\nLocal law enforcement officers had first observed a suspicious-looking man at the rally site more than an hour before the event and circulated that information, including photographs of a man who turned out to be Crooks. But the officers ultimately lost track of Crooks, who was able to scale the roof of a building at AGR International Inc., a supplier of automation equipment for the glass and plastic packaging industry, and fire an estimated eight shots with an AR-15-style rife.\n\nShortly before the shooting, a local officer climbed up to the roof to investigate. Crooks turned and pointed his rifle at the officer, who retreated.\n\nEven though text messages among local snipers revealed anxiety about the man, Rowe said the only thing the Secret Service knew at the time of the shooting was that law enforcement was contending with a suspicious-looking man.\n\n\"No information regarding a weapon on a roof was ever passed to our personnel,\" Rowe said. At another point, he noted, \"It is troubling to me that we did not get that information as quickly as we should have. We didn't know that there was this incident going on.\"\n\nBut Rowe's willingness to assign blame to local law enforcement opened him up to harsh criticism from Senate Republicans, who saw him as failing to take sufficient responsibility.\n\n\"Isn't the fact that a former president was shot, that a good American is dead, that other Americans were critically wounded -- isn't that enough mission failure for you to say to the person who decided that that building should not be in the security perimeter, probably ought to be stepped down?\" said Sen. Josh Hawley, a Missouri Republican.\n\nRowe, raising his voice, responded that he has \"lost sleep over this for the last 17 days\" and that he would not be rushed \"to judgment\" by Congress. He assured lawmakers that \"people will be held accountable.\"\n\nSen. Lindsey Graham, the top Republican on the Senate Judiciary Committee, said if something like this happened in the military, \"a lot of people would be fired. And if a lot of people are not fired, the system failed yet again.\"\n\nHe added: \"Nothing's going to change until somebody loses their job.\"\n\nThe FBI, meanwhile, disclosed new details about Crooks, with Deputy Director Paul Abbate saying a social media account believed to be associated with the gunman suspected in the assassination attempt espoused political violence and included antisemitic and anti-immigrant sentiment. The posts were from the 2019-2020 timeframe, when Crooks would have been in high school.\n\nAbbate did not identify the social media platform, saying investigators were still trying to definitively determine that it belonged to Crooks. However, he indicated that it was separate from an account on a different platform called Gab that was active in 2021.\n\nThe chief executive of Gab posted on X, formerly known as Twitter, during the Senate hearing that Crooks's presence on that platform was consistent with being \"pro-Biden and in particular pro-Biden's immigration policy.\"\n\nOn Monday, the FBI revealed that Crooks had looked online for information about mass shootings, power plants, improvised explosive devices and the May assassination attempt of the Slovakian prime minister Robert Fico.\n\nThe FBI also said that Trump has agreed to be interviewed by agents as a crime victim.", "source": {"uri": "thenationalherald.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The National Herald"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

Crooks was shot dead by a secret service sniper.\n\nAt her hearing last week, Cheatle said the Secret Service failed in its mission to protect Trump. She called the attack on Trump the most significant operational failure by the Secret Service in decades and vowed to move heaven and earth to find out what happened and make sure it doesn't happen again.\n\nCheatle acknowledged that the Secret Service had been notified of a suspicious person two to five times before the shooting at the rally. She also revealed that the rooftop from which Crooks opened fire had been identified as a potential vulnerability days before the rally.\n\nCheatle said she apologized to Trump in a phone call after the assassination attempt.\n\nIn an interview Monday night on Fox News Channel, Trump defended the Secret Service agents who protected him from the shooting, but said someone should have been on the roof with Crooks and there should have been better communication with local police.\n\n\"They weren't talking to each other,\" he said.\n\nHe praised the sniper who killed Crooks with what he called an incredible shot, but noted: \"It would have been nice if it had happened nine seconds earlier.\"", "source": {"uri": "exbulletin.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "ExBulletin"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Attempted_assassination_of_Ronald_Reagan", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Attempted assassination of Ronald Reagan"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Secret_Service", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "United States Secret Service"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Bureau_of_Investigation", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Federal Bureau of Investigation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Senate", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "United States Senate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kimberly_Cheatle", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Kimberly Cheatle"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_Abbate", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Paul Abbate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deputy_Director_of_the_Federal_Bureau_of_Investigation", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Deputy Director of the Federal Bureau of Investigation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Law_enforcement", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Law enforcement"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Associated_Press", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Associated Press"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mass_shooting", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Mass shooting"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Improvised_explosive_device", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Improvised explosive device"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prime_Minister_of_the_United_Kingdom", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Prime Minister of the United Kingdom"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Judiciary", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Judiciary"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Department_of_Homeland_Security", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United States Department of Homeland Security"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republican_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Republican Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fox_News", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Fox News"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sniper", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Sniper"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Butler,_Pennsylvania", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Butler, Pennsylvania"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Butler, Pennsylvania"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Guns", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Guns", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Guns/Competition_Shooting", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Guns/Competition Shooting", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Conditions_and_Diseases/Communication_Disorders", "label": "dmoz/Health/Conditions and Diseases/Communication Disorders", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Senses/Hearing", "label": "dmoz/Health/Senses/Hearing", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Guns/Organizations", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Guns/Organizations", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 88}], "image": "https://i.imgur.com/AoyxWyw.png", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9772518", "eventUri": "eng-9772518", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-07-13", "textStart": 563, "textEnd": 570}], "sentiment": -0.2862745098039216, "wgt": 200, "relevance": 1}

That account posted over 700 comments between 2019 and 2020, he added.\n\n'Some of these comments ... appear to reflect anti-Semitic and anti-immigration themes to espouse political violence,' Abbate said.\n\nActing Director of the U.S. Secret Service, Ronald L. Rowe, Jr. and Deputy Director of the FBI Paul Abbate are sworn-in before a Senate Judiciary Committee hearing on the attempted assassination of Republican presidential nominee and former U.S. President Donald Trump, on Capitol Hill in Washington, U.S., July 30, 2024\n\nRead MoreBREAKING NEWS Acting Secret Service director says he's 'ashamed' gunman was able to get on the Trump rally roof\n\nHe wouldn't confirm the name of the social media platform until after his agents could prove with 100% certainty Crooks made the posts.\n\nAbbate said the posts were 'extreme in nature,' but that the FBI is still determining whether the account actually belonged to Crooks.\n\nHe also disclosed that the agency is still working to identify and infiltrate Crooks's various 'encrypted' accounts that could shine light on his motive.\n\nThat angered Sen. Lindsey Graham who wanted more information on his. motive.\n\n'So you're telling me, the guy that took eight shots at the president, former president, has apps that we can't get into, that may if you could get into [them] reveal some relevant information.'\n\n'That is correct, senator,' the officials responded.\n\nThis concerned Graham who later pushed for better methods to infiltrate encrypted accounts.\n\n'We need a solution that provides lawful access,' the officials noted, inferring current options only provide illegal entry into Crooks's suspected accounts.\n\nThomas Crooks shown in his high school yearbook from 2020. Little is known about the reclusive shooter\n\nImages show law enforcement approaching the building from where Crooks shot just minutes before he opened fire at the rally\n\nFormer President Donald Trump raises his fist after being shot in the ear by Crooks on July 13\n\nIn addition to the online account discoveries, the number two man at the FBI disclosed more about the timeline behind the assassination attempt.\n\n'Approximately 25 minutes prior to the shooting, the U.S. Secret Service command post was notified of a suspicious person,' Abbate testified.\n\nThe Secret Service acting director also admitted he had no defense as for why the rooftop where Crooks fired shots toward former President Trump was left open.\n\n'I went to the roof of the AGR building where the assailant fired shots, and I laid in a prone position to evaluate his line of sight.'\n\n'What I saw made me ashamed as a career law enforcement officer and a 25 year veteran with the Secret Service. I cannot defend why that roof was not better secured,' he told Congress on Tuesday.\n\nCrooks fired eight rounds toward Trump, grazing him with a bullet in his ear.\n\n'When I laid in that position I could not, will not understand why there was not better coverage or at least somebody looking at that roof line when that's where they were posted,' Rowe said, noting that Crooks' head would have been clearly visible from the unmanned rooftop.\n\nThirty seconds before Crooks fired his shots, local law enforcement had radioed to Secret Service warning about a man with a rifle on the roof. Around three and a half minutes before that, he'd been 'observed on the roof.'\n\nFormer Secret Service Director Kimberly Cheatle appears before the House Oversight and Accountability Committee hearing on oversight of the Secret Service on July 23, 2024. She resigned the day after the hearing\n\nTrump assassination attempt timeline, according to Secret Service acting director\n\nJuly 7: Crooks travels to rally site to spend 20 minutes doing reconnaissance\n\nJuly 12: Shooter visits Clairton Sportsmen's Club to practice shooting\n\nJuly 13, 10 a.m.: Shooter visits rally site again\n\n90 minutes before shooting: local law enforcement 'suspicious' of Crooks\n\n20 minutes before Trump takes stage, 30 minutes before shooting: Secret Service made aware of an individual with a rangefinder\n\n10 minutes before Trump takes stage, 20 minutes before shooting: Secret Service counter sniper team given photograph of the 'suspicious subject'\n\n3.5 minutes before shooting: Crooks spotted on the roof\n\n30 seconds before shooting: Crooks seen with a gun\n\nAdvertisement\n\nRowe said that since the shooting he'd implemented a number of changes at the Secret Service, including having security plans go through multiple supervisors before implementation, expanded use of drones, more resources for protective site communications and 'expeditious' approval of requests for personnel at protective sites with heightened security environments.\n\nRowe and Abbate spoke to the Judiciary and Homeland Security committees after their boss, former Secret Service Director Kimberly Cheatle submitted her resignation last week after a six-hour-long hearing where Republicans and Democrats accused her of stonewalling.\n\nThe FBI and Secret Service officials also disclosed a more accurate timeline of events leading up to the shooting.\n\nAlmost a week before the rally, Crooks scouted the site of the event, spending 20 minutes doing reconnaissance on the location, they shared.\n\nJust a day before the shooting Crooks went to a shooting range to practice his shot.\n\nThe morning of the July 13 rally, Crooks again visited the grounds, the officials said.\n\nAbbate and Rowe also disclosed Crooks's activity on the day of the shooting and what authorities did in response.\n\nLocal law enforcement marked Crooks as 'suspicious' 90 minutes before he opened fire, the officials shared.\n\nSecret Service was informed that the would-be assassin had a range finder 30 minutes before the shooting occurred.\n\nMinutes later, just 20 before the shooting, the Secret Service counter sniper team was given a photo of the 'suspicious suspect.'\n\nThen, 3.5 minutes before Crooks opened fire, he was spotted on the roof.\n\nThe officials also disclosed that Crooks was seen with a gun on the roof 30 seconds before firing his first shot.\n\n'Within 15.5 seconds of his first shot, he's neutralized,' Rowe testified about how quickly Crooks was killed after opening fire.\n\nDeputy Director of the FBI Paul Abbate testified that the agency is still working to crack encrypted online accounts related to Crooks\n\nBut prior to his first shot Secret Service was unaware of his location, the Secret Service acting chief added.\n\nHe noted that the counter snipers did not see him because he was initially hiding on the other side of the roof.\n\n'I believe he was obscured by that roof,' Rowe testified.", "source":

fired: Secret Service", "body": "Donald Trump's security detail and a sniper team were not aware there was a gunman on a roof until he opened fire on the former president, the acting Secret Service director said Tuesday.\n\nLocal law enforcement identified the gunman, Thomas Matthew Crooks, as a \"suspicious person\" about 90 minutes before the July 13 attack at a Trump campaign rally in Butler, Pennsylvania, according to FBI officials.\n\nSince the assassination attempt, questions have been raised about when the Secret Service became aware of the presence of the gunman on the roof of a building that overlooked the campaign event.\n\n\"Based on what I know right now, neither the Secret Service counter-sniper teams nor members of the former president's security detail had any knowledge that there was a man on the AGR roof with a firearm,\" acting Secret Service chief Ronald Rowe told a joint Senate committee.\n\n\"The only thing we had was that locals were working an issue at the three o'clock, which would have been the former president's right-hand side, which is where the shots came from,\" Rowe said.\n\n\"Nothing about man on the roof, nothing about man with a gun,\" he said.\n\nFBI special agent Kevin Rojek said Monday that a police officer was boosted on to the roof by another officer at 6:11 pm.\n\nCrooks pointed his rifle at the officer, who \"immediately dropped to the ground.\"\n\n\"Approximately 25 to 30 seconds after this encounter, the subject fired eight rounds before being successfully neutralized,\" Rojek said.\n\nRowe said Crooks was shot dead by a Secret Service sniper \"within 15.5 seconds\" of firing the first shot.\n\nThe Republican presidential candidate was wounded in the right ear, while two rally attendees were injured and a Pennsylvania firefighter was killed.\n\n- 'Ashamed' -\n\nRowe said he \"cannot defend\" why the rooftop where Crooks fired from was not better secured, and said he was \"ashamed\" about the security lapses.\n\nHe said local law enforcement had been tasked with securing the rooftop. \"We assumed that the state and locals had it,\" he said.\n\nAsked why Trump was allowed to take the stage, Rowe said Crooks had not been identified as a threat but only as suspicious.\n\n\"We did not have anything beyond suspicious person that was communicated to us,\" he said. \"Suspicion had not risen to the level of threat or imminent harm.\"\n\nRowe said communications failures between local law enforcement and the Secret Service contributed to what he called a \"failure on multiple levels.\"\n\nThe Secret Service had \"technical difficulties\" with its counter-drone capabilities on the day of the attack and they were not \"operational until after five o'clock,\" he said.\n\nCrooks flew a drone near the rally site for 11 minutes about two hours before the attack, according to the FBI.\n\nFBI deputy director Paul Abbate also addressed the committee hearing and said the authorities still have not established a motive.\n\nHe said they have identified a social media account believed to be associated with Crooks.\n\n\"In about the 2019, 2020 timeframe there were over 700 comments posted from this account,\" Abbate said. \"Some of these comments, if ultimately attributable to the shooter, appear to reflect anti-Semitic and anti-immigration themes, to espouse political violence and are

It is some of the first evidence to become public about a potential motive in the July 13 attack at a campaign rally in western Pennsylvania.\n\n\"Something just very recently uncovered that I want to share is a social media account which is believed to be associated with the shooter in about the 2019-2020 time frame,\" Abbate told lawmakers, adding that more than 700 comments were posted by the account.\n\n\"Some of these comments, if ultimately attributable to the shooter, appear to reflect antisemitic and anti-immigration themes to espouse political violence and are described as extreme in nature,\" Abbate said.\n\nCrooks, who was 20, shot at Trump with an AR-15-style rifle during the rally in Butler, Pennsylvania, wounding the former president's ear, killing one rally attendee and wounding two others. Secret Service snipers killed Crooks after he opened fire.\n\nInvestigators have described Crooks as a loner with no close friends and a social network limited mainly to immediate family members.\n\nThe first shooting of a US president or major party candidate in more than four decades was a glaring security lapse that led last week to former Secret Service Director Kimberly Cheatle's resignation under bipartisan congressional pressure.\n\nHer immediate successor, Acting Secret Service Director Ronald Rowe, told lawmakers that he visited the outdoor rally site in Butler and climbed onto the roof of a nearby building from which Crooks fired.\n\n\"What I saw made me ashamed,\" Rowe told a joint hearing of the Senate Homeland Security and Judiciary Committees. \"As a career law enforcement officer, and a 25-year veteran with the Secret Service, I cannot defend why that roof was not better secured.\"\n\nRowe sought to assure lawmakers that he has since taken steps to prevent similar lapses from occurring amid concerns among both Democrats and Republicans about further political violence as the campaign intensifies ahead of the Nov. 5 US election.\n\nCrooks flew a drone near the rally site ahead of his assassination attempt, a flight that officials failed to detect because a system designed to detect drones was not working properly due to problems with cellular network bandwidth, Rowe said.\n\nThe Secret Service, a federal law enforcement agency whose duties including protecting the president and certain other top political figures, has added six people to its protection list since July 13, including Republican vice presidential candidate JD Vance and his family and independent presidential candidate Robert F. Kennedy, while reinforcing security details, Rowe said.\n\n\"This attack was a shocking reminder that the threat of political violence is alive and well in our country. By all accounts, this was inexcusable security, and planning failure,\" Democratic Senate Homeland Security Chairman Gary Peters said, adding that his panel is working on reforms to strengthen security protocols for the Secret Service.\n\nSenator Rand Paul, the committee's top Republican, said his staff had found communication gaps between local police who first noticed Crooks and the Secret Service.\n\nRowe said that Secret Service counter snipers and members of the Trump security detail had no knowledge that there was a man with a firearm on the roof of a nearby building.\n\nThe attempted assassination is the topic of multiple investigations by House and Senate committees, as well as a new bipartisan task force.", "source": {"uri": "tribune.com.pk", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Express Tribune"}, "authors": [{"uri": "reuters@tribune.com.pk", "name": "Reuters", "type": "author", "isAgency": true}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thomas_Crooks", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Thomas Crooks"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Secret_Service", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "United States Secret Service"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Bureau_of_Investigation", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Federal Bureau of Investigation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Opposition_to_immigration", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Opposition to immigration"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antisemitism", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Antisemitism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republican_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Republican Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_media", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Social media"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_Abbate", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Paul Abbate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Political_violence", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Political violence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Senate", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States Senate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pennsylvania", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Pennsylvania"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Pennsylvania"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Butler,_Pennsylvania", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Butler, Pennsylvania"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Butler, Pennsylvania"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kimberly_Cheatle", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Kimberly Cheatle"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Law_enforcement_officer", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Law enforcement officer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Senate_Committee_on_the_Judiciary", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United States Senate Committee on the Judiciary"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sniper", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Sniper"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unmanned_aerial_vehicle", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Unmanned aerial vehicle"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Department_of_Homeland_Security", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United States Department of Homeland Security"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gary_Peters", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Gary Peters"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Independent_politician", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Independent politician"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Attempted_assassination_of_Ronald_Reagan", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Attempted assassination of Ronald Reagan"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assassination_of_John_F._Kennedy", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Assassination of John F.

The bureau said last week that the former president had been struck in the ear by a bullet or fragment of one. Trump said Monday evening that he expected that interview to take place on Thursday.\n\nBut most of the questions Tuesday are expected to be directed at Rowe as lawmakers demand answers about how Crooks was able to get so close to Trump. Investigators believe Crooks fired eight shots in Trump's direction from an AR-style rifle after scaling the roof of a building of some 135 meters (147 yards) from where Trump was speaking in Butler, Pennsylvania.\n\nOne rallygoer was killed, and two others were injured. Crooks was shot dead by a Secret Service counter-sniper.\n\nAt her hearing last week, Cheatle said the Secret Service had \"failed\" in its mission to protect Trump. She called the attempt on Trump's life the Secret Service's \"most significant operational failure\" in decades and vowed to \"move heaven and earth\" to get to the bottom of what went wrong and make sure there's no repeat of it.\n\nCheatle acknowledged that the Secret Service was told about a suspicious person two to five times before the shooting at the rally. She also revealed that the roof from which Crooks opened fire had been identified as a potential vulnerability days before the rally.\n\nCheatle said she apologized to Trump in a phone call after the assassination attempt.\n\nIn a Monday night interview on Fox News Channel, Trump defended the Secret Service agents who protected him from the shooting but said that someone should have been on the roof with Crooks and that there should have been better communication with local police.\n\n\"They didn't speak to each other,\" he said.\n\nHe praised the sniper who killed Crooks with what he said was an amazing shot but noted: \"It would have been good if it was nine seconds sooner.\"\n\nMore from this section\n\nPIC's WooSOS Plugin Streamlines Ecommerce Through WooCommerce and SOS Inventory

As a career law enforcement officer and a 25-year Secret Service veteran, I cannot defend why that roof was not better secured,\" he said.\n\nThe testimony was the most detailed catalog to date by the Secret Service of law enforcement failings and miscommunications, with Ronald Rowe accepting blame for his own agency's mistakes while also criticizing local law enforcement for not sharing information that a gunman, later identified as Thomas Matthew Crooks, 20, was spotted on a roof of a building less than 150 yards from the rally stage where Trump spoke.\n\n\"Neither the Secret Service counter-sniper teams nor members of the former president's security detail had any knowledge that there was a man on the roof of the building with a firearm,\" Rowe said. \"It is my understanding those personnel were not aware the assailant had a firearm until they heard gunshots.\"\n\nHe said the shooting amounted to a \"failure on multiple levels,\" including a failure of imagination and a \"failure to challenge our assumptions.\"\n\n\"We assumed that the state and locals had it,\" Rowe said. \"We made an assumption that there was going to be uniformed presence out there, that there would be sufficient eyes to cover that, that there was going to be counter-sniper teams\" in the building from whose roof Crooks fired shots.\n\n\"And I can assure you,\" Rowe added, \"that we're not going to make that mistake again.\"\n\nHe said he implemented reforms since taking over as acting director last week, including mandating that every event security plan is vetted by multiple experienced supervisors before being implemented, expanding the use of aerial drones to improve visibility of roofs and dedicating more resources to improve communications at events where the Secret Service operates.\n\nTrump, now the 2024 Republican presidential nominee, was struck in the ear by a bullet or a bullet fragment in the assassination attempt, one rallygoer was killed and two others were injured before a Secret Service counter-sniper shot and killed the gunman.\n\nThe blunt and at times emotional testimony Tuesday, featuring combative exchanges with lawmakers, ensured that an already simmering blame game between federal and local authorities will continue.\n\nIt also suggested that Rowe, with ready and generally detailed answers, was determined to strike a different posture than that of his predecessor, Kimberly Cheatle, who resigned last week after facing intense criticism from lawmakers after responses at a congressional hearing that were seen as evasive and lacking in specifics.\n\nTuesday's hearing before the Senate Judiciary and Homeland Security Committees was the latest in a series of congressional sessions dedicated to the law enforcement lapses and missed communications that preceded the shooting.\n\nLocal law enforcement officers first observed a suspicious-looking man at the rally site more than an hour before the event and circulated that information, including photographs of a man who turned out to be Crooks.\n\nThe officers ultimately lost track of Crooks, who scaled the roof of a building at AGR International Inc., a supplier of automation equipment for the glass and plastic packaging industry, and fire an estimated eight shots with an AR-15-style rife.\n\nShortly before the shooting, a local officer climbed up to the roof to investigate. Crooks turned and pointed his rifle at the officer, who retreated.\n\nEven though text messages among local snipers revealed anxiety about the man, Rowe said the only thing the Secret Service knew at the time of the shooting was that law enforcement was contending with a suspicious-looking man.\n\n\"No information regarding a weapon on a roof was ever passed to our personnel,\" Rowe said. At another point, he noted, \"It is troubling to me that we did not get that information as quickly as we should have. We didn't know that there was this incident going on.\"\n\nBut Rowe's willingness to assign blame to local law enforcement opened him up to harsh criticism from Senate Republicans, who saw him as failing to take sufficient responsibility.\n\n\"Isn't the fact that a former president was shot, that a good American is dead, that other Americans were critically wounded -- isn't that enough mission failure for you to say to the person who decided that that building should not be in the security perimeter, probably ought to be stepped down?\" said Sen. Josh Hawley, a Missouri Republican.\n\nRowe, raising his voice, responded that he has \"lost sleep over this for the last 17 days\" and that he would not be rushed \"to judgment\" by Congress. He assured lawmakers that \"people will be held accountable.\"\n\nThe FBI, meanwhile, disclosed new details about Crooks, with Deputy Director Paul Abbate saying a social media account believed to be associated with the gunman suspected in the assassination attempt espoused political violence and included antisemitic and anti-immigrant sentiment.\n\nThe posts were from the 20192020 time frame, when Crooks would have been in high school.\n\nAbbate did not identify the social media platform, saying investigators were still trying to definitively determine that it belonged to Crooks. However, he indicated that it was separate from an account on a different platform called Gab that was active in 2021.", "source": {"uri": "omaha.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Omaha.com"},

Rowe says he recently traveled to the Pennsylvania shooting site and says what he saw made him ashamed.\n\nRowe is being joined by FBI Deputy Director Paul Abbate at a joint hearing of the Senate committees on the Judiciary and Homeland Security.\n\nThe FBI's No. 2 official says a social media account believed to be associated with the gunman suspected in the assassination attempt espoused political violence and included antisemitic and anti-immigrant sentiment.

Lindsey Graham, the top Republican on the Senate Judiciary Committee. \"And if a lot of people are not fired, the system failed yet again.\n\nHe added: \"Nothing's going to change until somebody loses their job.\"\n\nThe hearing comes one day after the FBI released new details about its investigation into the shooting, revealing that the gunman had looked online for information about mass shootings, power plants, improvised explosive devices and the May assassination attempt of the Slovakian prime minister.\n\nListen now and subscribe: Apple Podcasts | Google Podcasts | Spotify | RSS Feed | SoundStack | All Of Our Podcasts\n\nThe FBI also said that Trump, the 2024 Republican presidential nominee, has agreed to be interviewed by agents as a crime victim. The bureau said last week that the former president had been struck in the ear by a bullet or fragment of one. Trump said Monday evening that he expected that interview to take place on Thursday.\n\nBut most of the questions Tuesday are expected to be directed at Rowe as lawmakers demand answers about how Crooks was able to get so close to Trump. Investigators believe Crooks fired eight shots in Trump's direction from an AR-style rifle after scaling the roof of a building of some 135 meters (147 yards) from where Trump was speaking in Butler, Pennsylvania.\n\nOne rallygoer was killed, and two others were injured. Crooks was shot dead by a Secret Service counter-sniper.\n\nAt her hearing last week, Cheatle said the Secret Service had \"failed\" in its mission to protect Trump. She called the attempt on Trump's life the Secret Service's \"most significant operational failure\" in decades and vowed to \"move heaven and earth\" to get to the bottom of what went wrong and make sure there's no repeat of it.\n\nPhotos: Trump injured, 2 killed in shooting at rally\n\nCheatle acknowledged that the Secret Service was told about a suspicious person two to five times before the shooting at the rally. She also revealed that the roof from which Crooks opened fire had been identified as a potential vulnerability days before the rally.\n\nCheatle said she apologized to Trump in a phone call after the assassination attempt.\n\nIn a Monday night interview on Fox News Channel, Trump defended the Secret Service agents who protected him from the shooting but said that someone should have been on the roof with Crooks and that there should have been better communication with local police.\n\n\"They didn't speak to each other,\" he said.\n\nHe praised the sniper who killed Crooks with what he said was an amazing shot but noted: \"It would have been good if it was nine seconds sooner.\"", "source": {"uri": "richmond.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Richmond Times-Dispatch"}, "authors":

Deputy FBI Director Paul Abbate described the account but did not reveal the platform at the hearing.\n\nRELATED: Homeland Security Secretary Mayorkas announces independent review of Trump assassination plot\n\nThe hearing was the fourth such one held on Capitol Hill since the assassination attempt, and though it grew testy at times, especially during some exchanges with Republican senators, lawmakers appeared largely satisfied with the information provided by Rowe and Abbate during their more than three hours of testimony.\n\nOverall, it stood in stark contrast with a House hearing held last week in which lawmakers grilled then-Secret Service Director Kimberly Cheatle over what went wrong earlier this month, with several members demanding she resign over the lapses. A day later, she did just that.\n\nHere are the takeaways from Tuesday's joint hearing:\n\nDuring Tuesday's hearing, Rowe highlighted the failures of communications during the rally, in Butler, saying that information about Crooks was \"siloed\" and \"stuck\" in local law enforcement channels.\n\n\"The only thing we had was that locals were working an issue at the three o'clock - which would have been the former president's right-hand side - which is where the shot came,\" Rowe said. \"Nothing about man on the roof, nothing about man with a gun. None of that information ever made it over our net.\"\n\nHomeland Security Committee Chairman Gary Peters said that local law enforcement has claimed they were \"only able to call in to a state command center\" and not able to easily communicate threats to the Secret Service.\n\nBut Peters also noted that Abbate testified during the hearing that \"there was about 30 seconds between when the local law enforcement reported that there was a man on the roof with a gun\" and when the shooter began firing.\n\n\"If it's communicated directly to a counter-sniper team, would that be enough time to react prior to the firing of those shots?\" Peters asked.\n\n\"If we'd had that information, they would have been able to address it more quickly,\" Rowe replied. \"It appears that that information was stuck or siloed in that local channel.\"\n\n\"It is troubling to me that we did not get that information as quickly as we should have,\" he said. \"We didn't know that there was this incident going on.\"\n\nCrooks was killed within 15.5 seconds of the first shot, Rowe said.\n\nRowe confirmed that the reason a counter-drone system was not deployed at the Butler rally earlier in the day was because of connectivity issues.\n\n\"On this day in particular, because of the connectivity challenge ... there was a delay,\" he said. Crooks flew his own drone around the area two hours before Trump took the stage.\n\nThe issue has \"cost me a lot of sleep,\" Rowe said. \"What if we would have geolocated him because that counter (unmanned aircraft system) platform would have been up.\"\n\nRowe said that had the system been up, law enforcement may have been able to see Crooks' use of his own drone and approached him well before the shooting.\n\nRELATED: Failure of communication: Beaver County SWAT team details account of Trump assassination attempt\n\nMoving forward, Rowe said, his agency will use drones to help better secure future events.\n\n\"It is clear to me that other protective enhancements could have strengthened our security at the Butler event,\" he told lawmakers. \"As such, I have directed the expanded use of unmanned aerial systems at protective sites to help detect threats on roofs and other elevated threats.\"\n\nThe acting director also said that the Secret Service will now work with the Department of Homeland Security to set up their own, private connection and not rely on public domain connections.\n\nThe rally also did not deploy a Secret Service counter surveillance unit that would be dedicated to observing and tracking suspicious people like Crooks, according to multiple sources familiar with the operation.\n\nA law enforcement source told CNN the counter surveillance units were not requested as part of the plan put together by the Secret Service. The source said the units are not typically used for protection of former presidents.\n\nAs lawmakers pressed Rowe for answers on what went wrong earlier this month, the interim Secret Service director sought to shirk some of the responsibility for the security lapses, partially blaming the issues on the local law enforcement officers with whom they were working.\n\nMoving forward, Rowe told the committees, his agency will avoid assuming local law enforcement agencies are fully capable of fulfilling their role in protecting an event.\n\n\"We assumed that the state and locals had it,\" Rowe said of the area where Crooks climbed up the side of a building near the rally with his rifle.\n\n\"We made an assumption,\" he said, explaining that the Secret Service believed there would be sufficient eyes to cover the area and that local law enforcement would have a counter sniper in the AGR building where Crooks took his position.\n\nRowe told the lawmakers that local law enforcement was positioned in a nearby building and should have had a clear line of sight of Crooks on the roof.\n\n\"I cannot understand why there was not better coverage or at least somebody looking at that roofline when that's where they were posted,\" Rowe said, noting that a local sniper team could have looked from their post and seen the would-be assassin.\n\n\"Looking left, why was the assailant not seen?\" Rowe asked of the local team, as he showed lawmakers photographs of the roofs snipers were positioned on.\n\n\"I'm not saying that they should have neutralized him, but if they'd have held their post and looked left maybe...\" Rowe said later, though he was quickly cut off by an unrelated comment.\n\nSeveral senators lambasted Rowe for not firing any members in his agency and over the amount of security provided to former President Trump compared to President Joe Biden.\n\nIn one such exchange, Rowe loudly objected to Sen. Josh Hawley's persistent questions about why individuals weren't fired in recent weeks.\n\n\"I will not rush to judgment. People will be held accountable,\" Rowe said, adding that investigations into the failures that day are ongoing.\n\nThe Missouri Republican responded: \"Is it not prima facie that somebody has failed? The former president was shot.\"\n\n\"Sir, this could have been our Texas School Book Depository,\" Rowe responded, referring to the 1963 assassination of President John F. Kennedy in Dallas. \"I have lost sleep over that for the last 17 days, just like you have.\"\n\n\"Then fire somebody,\" Hawley shouted, to which Rowe replied: \"We have to be able to have a proper investigation into this.\"\n\nAt another point during Tuesday's hearing, Republican Sen.

Crooks was shot dead by a Secret Service counter-sniper.\n\nAt her hearing last week, Ms Cheatle said the Secret Service had \"failed\" in its mission to protect Mr Trump.\n\nShe called the attempt on Mr Trump's life the Secret Service's \"most significant operational failure\" in decades and vowed to \"move heaven and earth\" to get to the bottom of what went wrong and make sure there is no repeat of it.\n\nMs Cheatle acknowledged that the Secret Service was told about a suspicious person up to five times before the shooting at the rally.\n\nShe also revealed that the roof from which Crooks opened fire had been identified as a potential vulnerability days before the rally.\n\nMs Cheatle said she apologised to Mr Trump in a phone call after the assassination attempt.\n\nIn a Monday night interview on Fox News, Mr Trump defended the Secret Service agents who protected him from the shooting but said someone should have been on the roof with Crooks and that there should have been better communication with local police.\n\n\"They didn't speak to each other,\" he said.\n\nHe praised the sniper who killed Crooks with what he said was an amazing shot but noted: \"It would have been good if it was nine seconds sooner.\"", "source": {"uri": "shropshirestar.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Shropshire Star"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

"title": "Trump security was unaware of gunman until shots fired: Secret Service", "body": "Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump is evacuated from a rally by Secret Service agents after an assassination attempt in Butler, Pennsylvania, on July 13, 2024\n\nDonald Trump's security detail and a sniper team were not aware there was a gunman on a roof until he opened fire on the former president, the acting Secret Service director said Tuesday.\n\nLocal law enforcement identified the gunman, Thomas Matthew Crooks, as a \"suspicious person\" about 90 minutes before the July 13 attack at a Trump campaign rally in Butler, Pennsylvania, according to FBI officials.\n\nSince the assassination attempt, questions have been raised about when the Secret Service became aware of the presence of the gunman on the roof of a building that overlooked the campaign event.\n\n\"Based on what I know right now, neither the Secret Service counter-sniper teams nor members of the former president's security detail had any knowledge that there was a man on the AGR roof with a firearm,\" acting Secret Service chief Ronald Rowe told a joint Senate committee.\n\n\"The only thing we had was that locals were working an issue at the three o'clock, which would have been the former president's right-hand side, which is where the shots came from,\" Rowe said.\n\n\"Nothing about man on the roof, nothing about man with a gun,\" he said.\n\nFBI special agent Kevin Rojek said Monday that a police officer was boosted on to the roof by another officer at 6:11 pm.\n\nCrooks pointed his rifle at the officer, who \"immediately dropped to the ground.\"\n\n\"Approximately 25 to 30 seconds after this encounter, the subject fired eight rounds before being successfully neutralized,\" Rojek said.\n\nRowe said Crooks was shot dead by a Secret Service sniper \"within 15.5 seconds\" of firing the first shot.\n\nThe Republican presidential candidate was wounded in the right ear, while two rally attendees were injured and a Pennsylvania firefighter was killed.\n\n- 'Ashamed' - More from this section Israel targets Hezbollah commander in south Beirut strike Old Rajinder Nagar Horror: Students Organise Candle March to Protest Against the Authorities Study claims eating fruit can reduce risk of depression\n\nRowe said he \"cannot defend\" why the rooftop where Crooks fired from was not better secured, and said he was \"ashamed\" about the security lapses.\n\nHe said local law enforcement had been tasked with securing the rooftop. \"We assumed that the state and locals had it,\" he said.\n\nAsked why Trump was allowed to take the stage, Rowe said Crooks had not been identified as a threat but only as suspicious.\n\n\"We did not have anything beyond suspicious person that was communicated to us,\" he said. \"Suspicion had not risen to the level of threat or imminent harm.\"\n\nRowe said communications failures between local law enforcement and the Secret Service contributed to what he called a \"failure on multiple levels.\"\n\nThe Secret Service had \"technical difficulties\" with its counter-drone capabilities on the day of the attack and they were not \"operational until after five o'clock,\" he said.\n\nCrooks flew a drone near the rally site for 11 minutes about two hours before the attack, according to the FBI.\n\nFBI deputy director Paul Abbate also addressed the committee hearing and said the authorities still have not established a motive.\n\nHe said they have identified a social media account believed to be associated with Crooks.\n\n\"In about the 2019, 2020 timeframe there were over 700 comments posted from this account,\" Abbate said. \"Some of these comments, if ultimately attributable to the shooter, appear to reflect anti-Semitic and anti-immigration themes, to espouse political violence and are described as extreme in nature.\"\n\nSecret Service Director Kimberly Cheatle resigned last week after acknowledging that the agency had failed in its mission to prevent the assassination attempt.\n\ncl/bjt", "source": {"uri": "reformer.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Brattleboro Reformer"}, "authors": [{"uri":

Within approximately the next 30 seconds, the shots were fired.\"\n\nThe acting director testified that in those 30 or so seconds, radio communication between local law enforcement and federal agents got \"stuck\" and that information about the shooter on the roof never made it to the Secret Service.\n\nRowe said that problems with Wi-Fi connectivity impacted the Secret Service's counter-drone operations, which weren't working when Crooks flew a drone over the rally site earlier in the day.\n\nHe also said that the Secret Service's radio communications from the day of the shooting were not recorded because the agency typically does not record them during events not involving the president or vice president outside of Washington. Rowe said that he has directed that the agency will be recording radio communications from all campaign events moving forward.\n\nDuring the hearing, Republican Sens. Lindsey Graham of South Carolina and Josh Hawley of Missouri demanded that heads roll over the security failures that led to Trump's shooting.\n\n\"If this happened in the military, a lot of people will be fired,\" Graham said. \"And if a lot of people are not fired, the system failed yet again.\"\n\n\"We need to learn what happened, make corrective action,\" he added. \"But somebody's gotta be fired. Nothing's gonna change until somebody loses their job.\"\n\nLater, during a tense exchange with Hawley, Rowe said he \"will not rush to judgment\" amid the Secret Service's ongoing internal investigations into the failures that day.\n\n\"Sir, this could have been our Texas School Book Depository,\" Rowe explained, referring to the assassination of President John F. Kennedy in 1963. \"I have lost sleep over that for the last 17 days, just like you have.\"", "source": {"uri": "yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Secret_Service", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "United States Secret Service"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ronald_Rowe", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Ronald Rowe"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kimberly_Cheatle", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Kimberly Cheatle"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_Abbate", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Paul Abbate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assassination_of_John_F._Kennedy", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Assassination of John F.

Crooks was able to fire eight shots from the roof of a nearby building; a bullet or bullet fragment struck Trump, killed a person at the rally, and injured two others before Crooks was killed by a Secret Service sniper.\n\nAbbate said the account dates to the 2019-2020 time period, when Crooks would have been 15 or 16 years old. It could provide a glimpse into Crooks' thinking, which has proven elusive as the FBI said the shooter generally had few social contacts and little social media presence. It wasn't clear from Abbate's comment what social media account it was on.\n\nSen. Rick Scott, R-Fla., blamed federal officials for not talking more to the press and providing regular updates on their investigations.\n\n\"You're a black hole. You lose the support of the American public because people don't believe you're being direct with them,\" he said.\n\nIn addition to questions about the shooter, lawmakers also slammed the Secret Service's security gaps. The Secret Service's acting director, Ronald Rowe, said security at the July 13 rally was a failure on multiple levels, and he had implemented changes to security to ensure another shooting doesn't happen again.\n\nRowe said he retraced Crooks' steps on the roof to try to understand how he was able to get a shot at Trump and what went wrong.\n\n\"What I saw made me ashamed,\" Rowe told lawmakers. \"As a career law enforcement officer and a 25-year veteran with the Secret Service, I cannot defend why that roof was not better secured.\"\n\nRowe also blamed communication silos between Secret Service agents and local law enforcement. Reports being discussed on a text chain did not get shared with Secret Service agents on the scene: \"Nothing about man on the roof, nothing about man with a gun, none of that information ever made it over our net,\" he told the hearing.\n\nHe said changes to security procedures include using more drones to help detect threats on rooftops, and ensuring every security plan for events is vetted by multiple supervisors.\n\nRowe stepped in to run the Secret Service after the previous director, Kimberly Cheatle, resigned from her job last week after she faced withering criticism from both Democrats and Republicans for not being able to fully answer their questions about the attempted assassination.\n\nSome Republican senators at the hearing made it clear that Cheatle's resignation wasn't enough to assuage their concerns.\n\nSen. Josh Hawley, a Republican from Missouri, urged the agency to fire more people, while Sen. Roger Marshall, R-Kan., accused the Secret Secret of either \"incompetence or some type of a cultural problem\" -- something the acting director disputed.\n\n\"I think you would agree with me that there were multiple individual and institutional failures the day of this assassination attempt,\" Marshall told Rowe.", "source": {"uri": "kgou.org", "dataType": "news", "title": "KGOU 106.3"},

It is some of the first evidence to become public about a potential motive in the July 13 attack at a campaign rally in western Pennsylvania.\n\n\"Something just very recently uncovered that I want to share is a social media account which is believed to be associated with the shooter in about the 2019-2020 time frame,\" Abbate told lawmakers, adding that more than 700 comments were posted by the account.\n\n\"Some of these comments, if ultimately attributable to the shooter, appear to reflect antisemitic and anti-immigration themes to espouse political violence and are described as extreme in nature,\" Abbate said.\n\nCrooks, who was 20, shot at Trump with an AR-15-style rifle during the rally in Butler, Pennsylvania, wounding the former president's ear, killing one rally attendee and wounding two others. Secret Service snipers killed Crooks after he opened fire.\n\nInvestigators have described Crooks as a loner with no close friends and a social network limited mainly to immediate family members.\n\nThe first shooting of a U.S. president or major party candidate in more than four decades was a glaring security lapse that led last week to former Secret Service Director Kimberly Cheatle's resignation under bipartisan congressional pressure.\n\nHer immediate successor, Acting Secret Service Director Ronald Rowe, told lawmakers that he visited the outdoor rally site in Butler and climbed onto the roof of a nearby building from which Crooks fired.\n\n\"What I saw made me ashamed,\" Rowe told a joint hearing of the Senate Homeland Security and Judiciary Committees. \"As a career law enforcement officer, and a 25-year veteran with the Secret Service, I cannot defend why that roof was not better secured.\"\n\nRowe sought to assure lawmakers that he has since taken steps to prevent similar lapses from occurring amid concerns among both Democrats and Republicans about further political violence as the campaign intensifies ahead of the Nov. 5 U.S. election.\n\nCrooks flew a drone near the rally site ahead of his assassination attempt, a flight that officials failed to detect because a system designed to detect drones was not working properly due to problems with cellular network bandwidth, Rowe said.\n\nThe Secret Service, a federal law enforcement agency whose duties including protecting the president and certain other top political figures, has added six people to its protection list since July 13, including Republican vice presidential candidate JD Vance and his family and independent presidential candidate Robert F. Kennedy, while reinforcing security details, Rowe said.\n\n\"This attack was a shocking reminder that the threat of political violence is alive and well in our country. By all accounts, this was inexcusable security, and planning failure,\" Democratic Senate Homeland Security Chairman Gary Peters said, adding that his panel is working on reforms to strengthen security protocols for the Secret Service.\n\nSenator Rand Paul, the committee's top Republican, said his staff had found communication gaps between local police who first noticed Crooks and the Secret Service.\n\nRowe said that Secret Service counter snipers and members of the Trump security detail had no knowledge that there was a man with a firearm on the roof of a nearby building.\n\nPromotedListen to the latest songs, only on JioSaavn.com\n\nThe attempted assassination is the topic of multiple investigations by House and Senate committees, as well as a new bipartisan

As a career law enforcement officer and a 25-year Secret Service veteran, I cannot defend why that roof was not better secured,\" he said.\n\nThe testimony was the most detailed catalog to date by the Secret Service of law enforcement failings and miscommunications, with Rowe accepting blame for his own agency's mistakes while also pointedly criticizing local law enforcement for communication breakdowns that resulted in his agency not sharing information that a gunman, later identified as 20-year-old Thomas Matthew Crooks, had been spotted on the roof of a building less than 150 yards (135 meters) from the rally stage where Trump was speaking.\n\n\"Neither the Secret Service counter sniper teams nor members of the former president's security detail had any knowledge that there was a man on the roof of the building with a firearm,\" Rowe said. \"It is my understanding those personnel were not aware the assailant had a firearm until they heard gunshots.\"\n\nHe said that the shooting amounted to a \"failure on multiple levels,\" including a failure of imagination and a \"failure to challenge our assumptions.\"\n\n\"We assumed that the state and locals had it,\" Rowe said. \"We made an assumption that there was going to be uniformed presence out there, that there would be sufficient eyes to cover that, that there was going to be counter-sniper teams\" in the building from whose roof Crooks fired shots.\n\n\"And I can assure you,\" Rowe added, \"that we're not going to make that mistake again.\"\n\nHe said he had implemented multiple reforms since taking over as acting director last week, including mandating that every event security plan is vetted by multiple experienced supervisors before being implemented, expanding the use of aerial drones to improve visibility of roofs and dedicating more resources to improve communications at events where the Secret Service is operating.\n\nTrump, the 2024 Republican presidential nominee, was struck in the ear by a bullet or a bullet fragment in the assassination attempt, one rallygoer was killed and two others were injured before the gunman was killed by a Secret Service counter-sniper.\n\nThe blunt and at times emotional testimony Tuesday, featuring combative exchanges with lawmakers, ensured that an already simmering blame game between federal and local authorities will continue. It also suggested that Rowe, with ready and generally detailed answers, was determined to strike a different posture than that of his predecessor, Kimberly Cheatle, who resigned last week after facing intense criticism from lawmakers from both major political parties following responses at a congressional hearing that were seen as evasive and lacking in specifics.\n\nTuesday's hearing before the Senate Judiciary and Homeland Security committees was the latest in a series of congressional sessions dedicated to the law enforcement lapses and missed communications that preceded the shooting.\n\nLocal law enforcement officers had first observed a suspicious-looking man at the rally site more than an hour before the event and circulated that information, including photographs of a man who turned out to be Crooks. But the officers ultimately lost track of Crooks, who was able to scale the roof of a building at AGR International Inc., a supplier of automation equipment for the glass and plastic packaging industry, and fire an estimated eight shots with an AR-15-style rife.\n\nShortly before the shooting, a local officer climbed up to the roof to investigate. Crooks turned and pointed his rifle at the officer, who retreated.\n\nEven though text messages among local snipers revealed anxiety about the man, Rowe said the only thing the Secret Service knew at the time of the shooting was that law enforcement was contending with a suspicious-looking man.\n\n\"No information regarding a weapon on a roof was ever passed to our personnel,\" Rowe said. At another point, he noted, \"It is troubling to me that we did not get that information as quickly as we should have. We didn't know that there was this incident going on.\"\n\nBut Rowe's willingness to assign blame to local law enforcement opened him up to harsh criticism from Senate Republicans, who saw him as failing to take sufficient responsibility.\n\n\"Isn't the fact that a former president was shot, that a good American is dead, that other Americans were critically wounded -- isn't that enough mission failure for you to say to the person who decided that that building should not be in the security perimeter, probably ought to be stepped down?\" said Sen. Josh Hawley, a Missouri Republican.\n\nRowe, raising his voice, responded that he has \"lost sleep over this for the last 17 days\" and that he would not be rushed \"to judgment\" by Congress. He assured lawmakers that \"people will be held accountable.\"\n\nSen. Lindsey Graham, the top Republican on the Senate Judiciary Committee, said if something like this happened in the military, \"a lot of people would be fired. And if a lot of people are not fired, the system failed yet again.\"\n\nHe added: \"Nothing's going to change until somebody loses their job.\"\n\nThe FBI, meanwhile, disclosed new details about Crooks, with Deputy Director Paul Abbate saying a social media account believed to be associated with the gunman suspected in the assassination attempt espoused political violence and included antisemitic and anti-immigrant sentiment. The posts were from the 2019-2020 timeframe, when Crooks would have been in high school.\n\nAbbate did not identify the social media platform, saying investigators were still trying to definitively determine that it belonged to Crooks. However, he indicated that it was separate from an account on a different platform called Gab that was active in 2021.\n\nThe chief executive of Gab posted on X, formerly known as Twitter, during the Senate hearing that Crooks's presence on that platform was consistent with being \"pro-Biden and in particular pro-Biden's immigration policy.\"\n\nOn Monday, the FBI revealed that Crooks had looked online for information about mass shootings, power plants, improvised explosive devices and the May assassination attempt of the Slovakian prime minister Robert Fico.\n\nThe FBI also said that Trump has agreed to be interviewed by agents as a crime victim.", "source": {"uri": "wuky.org", "dataType": "news", "title": "WUKY-FM 91.3 Radio"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

It is some of the first evidence to become public about a potential motive in the July 13 attack at a campaign rally in western Pennsylvania.\n\n\"Something just very recently uncovered that I want to share is a social media account which is believed to be associated with the shooter in about the 2019-2020 time frame,\" Abbate told lawmakers, adding that more than 700 comments were posted by the account.\n\n\"Some of these comments, if ultimately attributable to the shooter, appear to reflect antisemitic and anti-immigration themes to espouse political violence and are described as extreme in nature,\" Abbate said.\n\nCrooks, who was 20, shot at Trump with an AR-15-style rifle during the rally in Butler, Pennsylvania, wounding the former president's ear, killing one rally attendee and wounding two others. Secret Service snipers killed Crooks after he opened fire.\n\nInvestigators have described Crooks as a loner with no close friends and a social network limited mainly to immediate family members.\n\nThe first shooting of a US president or major party candidate in more than four decades was a glaring security lapse that led last week to former Secret Service Director Kimberly Cheatle's resignation under bipartisan congressional pressure.\n\nHer immediate successor, Acting Secret Service Director Ronald Rowe, told lawmakers that he visited the outdoor rally site in Butler and climbed onto the roof of a nearby building from which Crooks fired.\n\n\"What I saw made me ashamed,\" Rowe told a joint hearing of the Senate Homeland Security and Judiciary Committees.\n\n\"As a career law enforcement officer, and a 25-year veteran with the Secret Service, I cannot defend why that roof was not better secured.\"\n\nRowe sought to assure lawmakers that he has since taken steps to prevent similar lapses from occurring amid concerns among both Democrats and Republicans about further political violence as the campaign intensifies ahead of the November 5 US election.\n\nCrooks flew a drone near the rally site ahead of his assassination attempt, a flight that officials failed to detect because a system designed to detect drones was not working properly due to problems with cellular network bandwidth, Rowe said.\n\nThe Secret Service, a federal law enforcement agency whose duties include protecting the president and certain other top political figures, has added six people to its protection list since July 13, including Republican vice presidential candidate JD Vance and his family, and independent presidential candidate Robert F. Kennedy, while reinforcing security details, Rowe said.\n\n\"This attack was a shocking reminder that the threat of political violence is alive and well in our country. By all accounts, this was inexcusable security and planning failure,\" Democratic Senate Homeland Security Chairman Gary Peters said, adding that his panel is working on reforms to strengthen security protocols for the Secret Service.\n\nSenator Rand Paul, the committee's top Republican, said his staff had found communication gaps between local police who first noticed Crooks and the Secret Service.\n\nRowe said that Secret Service counter snipers and members of the Trump security detail had no knowledge that there was a man with a firearm on the roof of a nearby building.", "source": {"uri": "timesofisrael.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "timesofisrael.com"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thomas_Crooks", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Thomas Crooks"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Opposition_to_immigration", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Opposition to immigration"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antisemitism", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Antisemitism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Secret_Service", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "United States Secret Service"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Bureau_of_Investigation", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Federal Bureau of Investigation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_media", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Social media"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_Abbate", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Paul Abbate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Political_violence", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Political violence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Senate", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States Senate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republican_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Republican Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reuters", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Reuters"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pennsylvania", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Pennsylvania"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Pennsylvania"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Butler,_Pennsylvania", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Butler, Pennsylvania"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Butler, Pennsylvania"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kimberly_Cheatle", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Kimberly Cheatle"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sniper", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Sniper"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bipartisanship", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Bipartisanship"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unmanned_aerial_vehicle", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Unmanned aerial vehicle"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gary_Peters", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Gary Peters"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Law_enforcement_officer", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Law enforcement officer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Independent_politician", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Independent politician"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assassination_of_John_F._Kennedy", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Assassination of John F.

It is some of the first evidence to become public about a potential motive in the July 13 attack at a campaign rally in western Pennsylvania.\n\n\"Something just very recently uncovered that I want to share is a social media account which is believed to be associated with the shooter in about the 2019-2020 time frame,\" Abbate told lawmakers, adding that more than 700 comments were posted by the account.\n\n\"Some of these comments, if ultimately attributable to the shooter, appear to reflect antisemitic and anti-immigration themes to espouse political violence and are described as extreme in nature,\" Abbate said.\n\nCrooks, who was 20, shot at Trump with an AR-15-style rifle during the rally in Butler, Pennsylvania, wounding the former president's ear, killing one rally attendee and wounding two others. Secret Service snipers killed Crooks after he opened fire.\n\nLoner with no friends\n\nInvestigators have described Crooks as a loner with no close friends and a social network limited mainly to immediate family members.\n\nThe first shooting of a US president or major party candidate in more than four decades was a glaring security lapse that led last week to former Secret Service Director Kimberly Cheatle's resignation under bipartisan congressional pressure.\n\nHer immediate successor, Acting Secret Service Director Ronald Rowe, told lawmakers that he visited the outdoor rally site in Butler and climbed onto the roof of a nearby building from which Crooks fired.\n\n\"What I saw made me ashamed,\" Rowe told a joint hearing of the Senate Homeland Security and Judiciary Committees. \"As a career law enforcement officer and a 25-year veteran with the Secret Service, I cannot defend why that roof was not better secured.\"\n\nRowe sought to assure lawmakers that he has since taken steps to prevent similar lapses from occurring amid concerns among both Democrats and Republicans about further political violence as the campaign intensifies ahead of the November 5 US election.\n\nCrooks flew a drone near the rally site ahead of his assassination attempt, a flight that officials failed to detect because a system designed to detect drones was not working properly due to problems with cellular network bandwidth, Rowe said.\n\nThe Secret Service, a federal law enforcement agency whose duties include protecting the president and certain other top political figures, has added six people to its protection list since July 13, including Republican vice presidential candidate JD Vance and his family and independent presidential candidate Robert F. Kennedy, while reinforcing security details, Rowe said.\n\n\"This attack was a shocking reminder that the threat of political violence is alive and well in our country. By all accounts, this was inexcusable security and planning failure,\" Democratic Senate Homeland Security Chairman Gary Peters said, adding that his panel is working on reforms to strengthen security protocols for the Secret Service.\n\nSenator Rand Paul, the committee's top Republican, said his staff had found communication gaps between local police who first noticed Crooks and the Secret Service.\n\nRowe said that Secret Service counter snipers and members of the Trump security detail had no knowledge that there was a man with a firearm on the roof of a nearby building.\n\nThe attempted assassination is the topic of multiple investigations by House and Senate committees, as well as a new bipartisan task force.", "source": {"uri": "jpost.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Jerusalem Post"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thomas_Crooks", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Thomas Crooks"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Secret_Service", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "United States Secret Service"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Opposition_to_immigration", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Opposition to immigration"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antisemitism", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Antisemitism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republican_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Republican Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_media", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Social media"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_Abbate", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Paul Abbate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deputy_Director_of_the_Federal_Bureau_of_Investigation", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Deputy Director of the Federal Bureau of Investigation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Political_violence", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Political violence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Senate", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States Senate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Bureau_of_Investigation", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Federal Bureau of Investigation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pennsylvania", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Pennsylvania"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Pennsylvania"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Butler,_Pennsylvania", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Butler, Pennsylvania"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Butler, Pennsylvania"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kimberly_Cheatle", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Kimberly Cheatle"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Law_enforcement_officer", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Law enforcement officer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Senate_Committee_on_the_Judiciary", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United States Senate Committee on the Judiciary"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sniper", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Sniper"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unmanned_aerial_vehicle", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Unmanned aerial vehicle"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Department_of_Homeland_Security", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United States Department of Homeland Security"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gary_Peters", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Gary Peters"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Independent_politician", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Independent politician"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Attempted_assassination_of_Ronald_Reagan", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Attempted assassination of Ronald Reagan"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assassination_of_John_F._Kennedy", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Assassination of John F.

Deputy FBI Director Paul Abbate described the account but did not reveal the platform at the hearing.\n\nThe hearing was the fourth such one held on Capitol Hill since the assassination attempt, and though it grew testy at times, especially during some exchanges with Republican senators, lawmakers appeared largely satisfied with the information provided by Rowe and Abbate during their more than three hours of testimony.\n\nOverall, it stood in stark contrast with a House hearing held last week in which lawmakers grilled then-Secret Service Director Kimberly Cheatle over what went wrong earlier this month, with several members demanding she resign over the lapses. A day later, she did just that.\n\nHere are the takeaways from Tuesday's joint hearing:\n\nDuring Tuesday's hearing, Rowe highlighted the failures of communications during the rally, in Butler, saying that information about Crooks was \"siloed\" and \"stuck\" in local law enforcement channels.\n\n\"The only thing we had was that locals were working an issue at the three o'clock - which would have been the former president's right-hand side - which is where the shot came,\" Rowe said. \"Nothing about man on the roof, nothing about man with a gun. None of that information ever made it over our net.\"\n\nHomeland Security Committee Chairman Gary Peters said that local law enforcement has claimed they were \"only able to call in to a state command center\" and not able to easily communicate threats to the Secret Service.\n\nBut Peters also noted that Abbate testified during the hearing that \"there was about 30 seconds between when the local law enforcement reported that there was a man on the roof with a gun\" and when the shooter began firing.\n\n\"If it's communicated directly to a counter-sniper team, would that be enough time to react prior to the firing of those shots?\" Peters asked.\n\n\"If we'd had that information, they would have been able to address it more quickly,\" Rowe replied. \"It appears that that information was stuck or siloed in that local channel.\"\n\n\"It is troubling to me that we did not get that information as quickly as we should have,\" he said. \"We didn't know that there was this incident going on.\"\n\nCrooks was killed within 15.5 seconds of the first shot, Rowe said.\n\nRowe confirmed that the reason a counter-drone system was not deployed at the Butler rally earlier in the day was because of connectivity issues.\n\n\"On this day in particular, because of the connectivity challenge ... there was a delay,\" he said. Crooks flew his own drone around the area two hours before Trump took the stage.\n\nThe issue has \"cost me a lot of sleep,\" Rowe said. \"What if we would have geolocated him because that counter (unmanned aircraft system) platform would have been up.\"\n\nRowe said that had the system been up, law enforcement may have been able to see Crooks' use of his own drone and approached him well before the shooting.\n\nMoving forward, Rowe said, his agency will use drones to help better secure future events.\n\n\"It is clear to me that other protective enhancements could have strengthened our security at the Butler event,\" he told lawmakers. \"As such, I have directed the expanded use of unmanned aerial systems at protective sites to help detect threats on roofs and other elevated threats.\"\n\nThe acting director also said that the Secret Service will now work with the Department of Homeland Security to set up their own, private connection and not rely on public domain connections.\n\nThe rally also did not deploy a Secret Service counter surveillance unit that would be dedicated to observing and tracking suspicious people like Crooks, according to multiple sources familiar with the operation.\n\nA law enforcement source told CNN the counter surveillance units were not requested as part of the plan put together by the Secret Service. The source said the units are not typically used for protection of former presidents.\n\nAs lawmakers pressed Rowe for answers on what went wrong earlier this month, the interim Secret Service director sought to shirk some of the responsibility for the security lapses, partially blaming the issues on the local law enforcement officers with whom they were working.\n\nMoving forward, Rowe told the committees, his agency will avoid assuming local law enforcement agencies are fully capable of fulfilling their role in protecting an event.\n\n\"We assumed that the state and locals had it,\" Rowe said of the area where Crooks climbed up the side of a building near the rally with his rifle.\n\n\"We made an assumption,\" he said, explaining that the Secret Service believed there would be sufficient eyes to cover the area and that local law enforcement would have a counter sniper in the AGR building where Crooks took his position.\n\nRowe told the lawmakers that local law enforcement was positioned in a nearby building and should have had a clear line of sight of Crooks on the roof.\n\n\"I cannot understand why there was not better coverage or at least somebody looking at that roofline when that's where they were posted,\" Rowe said, noting that a local sniper team could have looked from their post and seen the would-be assassin.\n\n\"Looking left, why was the assailant not seen?\" Rowe asked of the local team, as he showed lawmakers photographs of the roofs snipers were positioned on.\n\n\"I'm not saying that they should have neutralized him, but if they'd have held their post and looked left maybe...\" Rowe said later, though he was quickly cut off by an unrelated comment.\n\nSeveral senators lambasted Rowe for not firing any members in his agency and over the amount of security provided to former President Trump compared to President Joe Biden.\n\nIn one such exchange, Rowe loudly objected to Sen. Josh Hawley's persistent questions about why individuals weren't fired in recent weeks.\n\n\"I will not rush to judgment. People will be held accountable,\" Rowe said, adding that investigations into the failures that day are ongoing.\n\nThe Missouri Republican responded: \"Is it not prima facie that somebody has failed? The former president was shot.\"\n\n\"Sir, this could have been our Texas School Book Depository,\" Rowe responded, referring to the 1963 assassination of President John F. Kennedy in Dallas. \"I have lost sleep over that for the last 17 days, just like you have.\"\n\n\"Then fire somebody,\" Hawley shouted, to which Rowe replied: \"We have to be able to have a proper investigation into this.\"\n\nAt another point during Tuesday's hearing, Republican Sen. Ted Cruz repeatedly pressed Rowe on why Trump doesn't receive the same security level as Biden.\n\n\"There is a difference between the sitting president of the United States,\" Rowe said.\n\n\"Then what's the difference,\" Cruz yelled, cutting Rowe off.\n\n\"The difference - national command authority to launch a nuclear strike, sir,\" Rowe responded. \"There are other assets that travel with the president that the former president will not get.\"\n\nInvestigators have uncovered a social media account with posts espousing political violence that may be connected to the would-be Trump assassin, Abbate said.\n\nOfficials have repeatedly said that they have struggled to understand what the 20-year-old shooter's motive was, and that they are combing his online presence for more information.\n\n\"Something just very recently uncovered that I want to share is a social media account, which is believed to be associated with this with the shooter - in about the 2019, 2020 timeframe,\" Abbate said.\n\nOn that account, \"there were over 700 comments,\" Abbate said, which, \"if ultimately attributable to the shooter, appear to reflect antisemitic and anti-immigration themes, to espouse political violence, and are described as extreme in nature.\"\n\nCNN has learned the account is on the YouTube platform.\n\nA separate account on the platform Gab - which was made years earlier - appears to have \"differing points of view,\" Abbate added.\n\nGab CEO Andrew Tobra revealed last week that the would-be assassin may have had an account on the site, which is an alternative social media network popular with conservatives, the alt-right and some extremists. Tobra claimed that the account in question was \"pro-Biden.\"\n\nThe Gab account has also not been conclusively connected to Crooks.", "source": {"uri": "abc7news.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "ABC7 News"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gary_Peters", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Gary Peters"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assassination_of_John_F._Kennedy", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Assassination of John F.

Secret Service snipers killed Crooks after he opened fire.\n\nThe man who tried to assassinate Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump appears to have posted violent antisemitic and anti-immigration content online as a teenager, a senior FBI official told a US Senate hearing on Tuesday.\n\nFBI Deputy Director Paul Abbate at the hearing revealed the existence of the social media account, which dated to 2019-2020 - when Thomas Crooks, who authorities have identified as the shooter, would have been 15 or 16 years old. It is some of the first evidence to become public about a potential motive in the July 13 attack at a campaign rally in western Pennsylvania.\n\n\"Something just very recently uncovered that I want to share is a social media account which is believed to be associated with the shooter in about the 2019-2020 time frame,\" Abbate told lawmakers, adding that more than 700 comments were posted by the account.\n\n\"Some of these comments, if ultimately attributable to the shooter, appear to reflect antisemitic and anti-immigration themes to espouse political violence and are described as extreme in nature,\" Abbate said.\n\nCrooks, who was 20, shot at Trump with an AR-15-style rifle during the rally in Butler, Pennsylvania, wounding the former president's ear, killing one rally attendee and wounding two others. Secret Service snipers killed Crooks after he opened fire.\n\nInvestigators have described Crooks as a loner with no close friends and a social network limited mainly to immediate family members.\n\nThe first shooting of a U.S. president or major party candidate in more than four decades was a glaring security lapse that led last week to former Secret Service Director Kimberly Cheatle's resignation under bipartisan congressional pressure.\n\nHer immediate successor, Acting Secret Service Director Ronald Rowe, told lawmakers that he visited the outdoor rally site in Butler and climbed onto the roof of a nearby building from which Crooks fired.\n\n\"What I saw made me ashamed,\" Rowe told a joint hearing of the Senate Homeland Security and Judiciary Committees. \"As a career law enforcement officer, and a 25-year veteran with the Secret Service, I cannot defend why that roof was not better secured.\"\n\nRowe sought to assure lawmakers that he has since taken steps to prevent similar lapses from occurring amid concerns among both Democrats and Republicans about further political violence as the campaign intensifies ahead of the Nov. 5 U.S. election.\n\nCrooks flew a drone near the rally site ahead of his assassination attempt, a flight that officials failed to detect because a system designed to detect drones was not working properly due to problems with cellular network bandwidth, Rowe said.\n\nThe Secret Service, a federal law enforcement agency whose duties including protecting the president and certain other top political figures, has added six people to its protection list since July 13, including Republican vice presidential candidate JD Vance and his family and independent presidential candidate Robert F. Kennedy, while reinforcing security details, Rowe said.\n\n\"This attack was a shocking reminder that the threat of political violence is alive and well in our country.

Lindsey Graham, the top Republican on the Senate Judiciary Committee. \"And if a lot of people are not fired, the system failed yet again.\n\nHe added: \"Nothing's going to change until somebody loses their job.\"\n\nThe hearing comes one day after the FBI released new details about its investigation into the shooting, revealing that the gunman had looked online for information about mass shootings, power plants, improvised explosive devices and the May assassination attempt of the Slovakian prime minister.\n\nListen now and subscribe: Apple Podcasts | Google Podcasts | Spotify | RSS Feed | SoundStack | All Of Our Podcasts\n\nThe FBI also said that Trump, the 2024 Republican presidential nominee, has agreed to be interviewed by agents as a crime victim. The bureau said last week that the former president had been struck in the ear by a bullet or fragment of one. Trump said Monday evening that he expected that interview to take place on Thursday.\n\nBut most of the questions Tuesday are expected to be directed at Rowe as lawmakers demand answers about how Crooks was able to get so close to Trump. Investigators believe Crooks fired eight shots in Trump's direction from an AR-style rifle after scaling the roof of a building of some 135 meters (147 yards) from where Trump was speaking in Butler, Pennsylvania.\n\nOne rallygoer was killed, and two others were injured. Crooks was shot dead by a Secret Service counter-sniper.\n\nAt her hearing last week, Cheatle said the Secret Service had \"failed\" in its mission to protect Trump. She called the attempt on Trump's life the Secret Service's \"most significant operational failure\" in decades and vowed to \"move heaven and earth\" to get to the bottom of what went wrong and make sure there's no repeat of it.\n\nPhotos: Trump injured, 2 killed in shooting at rally\n\nCheatle acknowledged that the Secret Service was told about a suspicious person two to five times before the shooting at the rally. She also revealed that the roof from which Crooks opened fire had been identified as a potential vulnerability days before the rally.\n\nCheatle said she apologized to Trump in a phone call after the assassination attempt.\n\nIn a Monday night interview on Fox News Channel, Trump defended the Secret Service agents who protected him from the shooting but said that someone should have been on the roof with Crooks and that there should have been better communication with local police.\n\n\"They didn't speak to each other,\" he said.\n\nHe praised the sniper who killed Crooks with what he said was an amazing shot but noted: \"It would have been good if it was nine seconds sooner.\"", "source": {"uri": "richmond.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Richmond Times-Dispatch"}, "authors":

A day later, she did just that.\n\nHere are the takeaways from Tuesday's joint hearing:\n\n'Siloed' information about Crooks' presence\n\nDuring Tuesday's hearing, Rowe highlighted the failures of communications during the rally, in Butler, saying that information about Crooks was \"siloed\" and \"stuck\" in local law enforcement channels.\n\n\"The only thing we had was that locals were working an issue at the three o'clock - which would have been the former president's right-hand side - which is where the shot came,\" Rowe said. \"Nothing about man on the roof, nothing about man with a gun. None of that information ever made it over our net.\"\n\nHomeland Security Committee Chairman Gary Peters said that local law enforcement has claimed they were \"only able to call in to a state command center\" and not able to easily communicate threats to the Secret Service.\n\nVideo Ad Feedback\n\nHawley has tense exchange with Secret Service official\n\n01:30 - Source: CNN\n\nBut Peters also noted that Abbate testified during the hearing that \"there was about 30 seconds between when the local law enforcement reported that there was a man on the roof with a gun\" and when the shooter began firing.\n\n\"If it's communicated directly to a counter-sniper team, would that be enough time to react prior to the firing of those shots?\" Peters asked.\n\n\"If we'd had that information, they would have been able to address it more quickly,\" Rowe replied. \"It appears that that information was stuck or siloed in that local channel.\"\n\n\"It is troubling to me that we did not get that information as quickly as we should have,\" he said. \"We didn't know that there was this incident going on.\"\n\nCrooks was killed within 15.5 seconds of the first shot, Rowe said.\n\nCounter-drone system could have prevented the attack\n\nRowe confirmed that the reason a counter-drone system was not deployed at the Butler rally earlier in the day was because of connectivity issues.\n\n\"On this day in particular, because of the connectivity challenge ... there was a delay,\" he said. Crooks flew his own drone around the area two hours before Trump took the stage.\n\nThe issue has \"cost me a lot of sleep,\" Rowe said. \"What if we would have geolocated him because that counter (unmanned aircraft system) platform would have been up.\"\n\nRowe said that had the system been up, law enforcement may have been able to see Crooks' use of his own drone and approached him well before the shooting.\n\nMoving forward, Rowe said, his agency will use drones to help better secure future events.\n\n\"It is clear to me that other protective enhancements could have strengthened our security at the Butler event,\" he told lawmakers. \"As such, I have directed the expanded use of unmanned aerial systems at protective sites to help detect threats on roofs and other elevated threats.\"\n\nThe acting director also said that the Secret Service will now work with the Department of Homeland Security to set up their own, private connection and not rely on public domain connections.\n\nRowe points fingers at local law enforcement\n\nAs lawmakers pressed Rowe for answers on what went wrong earlier this month, the interim Secret Service director sought to shirk some of the responsibility for the security lapses, partially blaming the issues on the local law enforcement officers with whom they were working.\n\nMoving forward, Rowe told the committees, his agency will avoid assuming local law enforcement agencies are fully capable of fulfilling their role in protecting an event.\n\n\"We assumed that the state and locals had it,\" Rowe said of the area where Crooks climbed up the side of a building near the rally with his rifle.\n\n\"We made an assumption,\" he said, explaining that the Secret Service believed there would be sufficient eyes to cover the area and that local law enforcement would have a counter sniper in the AGR building where Crooks took his position.\n\nRowe told the lawmakers that local law enforcement was positioned in a nearby building and should have had a clear line of sight of Crooks on the roof.\n\n\"I cannot understand why there was not better coverage or at least somebody looking at that roofline when that's where they were posted,\" Rowe said, noting that a local sniper team could have looked from their post and seen the would-be assassin.\n\n\"Looking left, why was the assailant not seen?\" Rowe asked of the local team, as he showed lawmakers photographs of the roofs snipers were positioned on.\n\n\"I'm not saying that they should have neutralized him, but if they'd have held their post and looked left maybe...\" Rowe said later, though he was quickly cut off by an unrelated comment.\n\nShouting matches over firings and Biden v. Trump resources\n\nSeveral senators lambasted Rowe for not firing any members in his agency and over the amount of security provided to former President Trump compared to President Joe Biden.\n\nIn one such exchange, Rowe loudly objected to Sen. Josh Hawley's persistent questions about why individuals weren't fired in recent weeks.\n\n\"I will not rush to judgment. People will be held accountable,\" Rowe said, adding that investigations into the failures that day are ongoing.\n\nThe Missouri Republican responded: \"Is it not prima facie that somebody has failed?

Ronald Rowe, testifying before two Senate committees, said he recently traveled to the Pennsylvania shooting site and \"What I saw made me ashamed.\" The FBI's No. 2 official, Paul Abbate, said a social media account associated with the gunman espoused political violence and included antisemitic and anti-immigrant sentiment, reports the AP. The posts were from the 2019 and 2020 timeframe, when Thomas Matthew Crooks would have been in high school.\n\nSenate lawmakers are grilling the officials about law enforcement lapses in the hours before the attempted assassination of Trump in the latest in a series of congressional hearings. Rowe became acting director last week after Kimberly Cheatle resigned in the aftermath of a House hearing in which she was berated by lawmakers and failed to answer specific questions about the July 13 shooting. Rowe is being joined by Abbate at a joint hearing of the Senate committees on the Judiciary and Homeland Security. \"If this happened in the military, a lot of people would be fired,\" said Sen. Lindsey Graham, the top Republican on the Senate Judiciary Committee. \"And if a lot of people are not fired, the system failed yet again. Nothing's going to change until somebody loses their job.\"\n\nBut most of the questions Tuesday are expected to be directed at Rowe as lawmakers demand answers about how Crooks was able to get so close to Trump. In a Monday interview on Fox News, Trump defended the Secret Service agents who protected him from the shooting but said that someone should have been on the roof with Crooks. \"They didn't speak to each other,\" he said. He praised the sniper who killed Crooks with what he said was an amazing shot but noted: \"It would have been good if it was nine seconds sooner.\" (More Trump rally shooting stories.)", "source": {"uri": "newser.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Newser"}, "authors": [{"uri": "polly_davis_doig@newser.com", "name": "Polly Davis Doig", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Senate", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "United States Senate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Attempted_assassination_of_Ronald_Reagan", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Attempted assassination of Ronald Reagan"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_Abbate", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Paul Abbate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Opposition_to_immigration", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Opposition to immigration"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Political_violence", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Political violence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antisemitism", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Antisemitism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Secret_Service", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States Secret Service"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Bureau_of_Investigation", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Federal Bureau of Investigation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_media", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Social media"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pennsylvania", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Pennsylvania"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Pennsylvania"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kimberly_Cheatle", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Kimberly Cheatle"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Senate_Committee_on_the_Judiciary", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United States Senate Committee on the Judiciary"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Law_enforcement", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Law enforcement"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fox_News", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Fox News"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lindsey_Graham", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Lindsey Graham"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sniper", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Sniper"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Associated_Press", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Associated Press"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Department_of_Homeland_Security", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "United States Department of Homeland Security"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republican_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Republican Party (United States)"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Terrorism", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Terrorism", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Crime_and_Justice", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Crime and Justice", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Theft", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Theft", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Job-Related", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Job-Related", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 87}], "image": "https://img1-azrcdn.newser.com/image/1549342-12-20240730115825.jpeg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9772518", "eventUri": "eng-9772518", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-07-13", "textStart": 1005, "textEnd": 1012}], "sentiment": -0.2156862745098039, "wgt": 195, "relevance": 1}

Josh Hawley pressed acting Secret Service director Ronald Rowe on why no one had been fired for the security breach yet.\n\n'Has the person who decided, who made the decision to send Donald Trump on stage knowing that you had a security situation. Has that person been relieved of duty?' Hawley, R-Mo., asked.\n\n'No sir they haven't,' said Rowe.\n\n'Has the person who decided not to pull the former president off of stage when you knew that in your words, the locals were working a serious security situation? Has that person been relieved of duty?'\n\nA high-profile hearing descended into chaos when Sen. Josh Hawley pressed acting Secret Service director Ronald Rowe on why no one had been fired for the security breach yet\n\n'Has the person who decided, who made the decision to send Donald Trump on stage knowing that you had a security situation. Has that person been relieved of duty?' Hawley, R-Mo., asked. 'No sir they haven't,' said Rowe\n\n'No, sir. Again, I refer you back to my original answer that we are investigating this through a mission assurance -- ' Rowe said.\n\n' -- What more do you need to investigate? To know exactly what you need to investigate to know the failures that something ought to be held accountable? What more do you need to know?' Hawley interjected.\n\n'You're asking me, Senator, to completely make a rush to judgment about somebody failing. I acknowledge this was a failure,' Rowe went on.\n\n'Sir, this could have been our Texas School Book Depository,' he said, in reference to the building from which Lee Harvey Oswald fatally shot President John F. Kennedy.\n\n'I have lost sleep over that for the last 17 days. I will tell you Senator, that I will not rush a judgment, that people will be held accountable, and I will do so with integrity and not rush to judgment and put people unfairly persecuted. We have to be able to have a proper investigation into this.'\n\nIn another fraught moment Sen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas, asked Rowe whether Trump's team had been given the same amount of protection resources as a comparable Biden event.\n\n'You're using president a way that it's not clear. Is it your testimony that in Butler Pennsylvania, Donald Trump had the same number of agents protecting him that Joe Biden has at a comparable event?\n\n'You asked me senator and I'm trying to answer it.'\n\n'You are not answering it. Is it the same number of agents or not?' Cruz went on.\n\n'There is a difference between the sitting President of the United States,' Rowe shot back. 'What's the difference?'\n\n'The difference is an actual authority to launch a nuclear strike,' said Rowe.\n\nBut Rowe confusingly also said that Trump had the same number of agents surrounding him as Joe Biden has, a 'full shift.'\n\nRowe admitted he had no defense as for why the rooftop where Thomas Matthew Crooks fired shots toward former President Trump was left open.\n\nCrooks fired eight rounds toward Trump from a nearby unsecured rooftop, killing firefighter veteran Corey Comperatore, critically injuring two and grazing Trump with a bullet in his ear.\n\n'I went to the roof of the AGR building where the assailant fired shots, and I laid in a prone position to evaluate his line of sight. What I saw made me ashamed as a career law enforcement officer and a 25 year veteran with the Secret Service. I cannot defend why that roof was not better secured,' he told Congress on Tuesday.\n\n'When I laid in that position I could not, will not understand why there was not better coverage or at least somebody looking at that roof line when that's where they were posted,' Rowe said, noting that Crooks' head would have been clearly visible from the unmanned rooftop.\n\nFormer Secret Service Director Kimberly Cheatle had been criticized for not visiting the rally site prior to her hearing on Capitol Hill last week, which prompted her resignation.\n\nActing Director Rowe and Deputy FBI Director Paul Abbate testified in a rare joint Senate hearing on Tuesday.\n\nThirty seconds before Crooks fired his shots, local law enforcement had radioed to Secret Service warning about a man with a rifle on the roof. Around three and a half minutes before that, he'd been 'observed on the roof.'\n\nActing Director Rowe and Deputy Secret Service Director Paul Abbate testified in a rare joint Senate hearing on Tuesday\n\nLaw enforcement 'should've been on that roof and the fact that they were in the building is something that I'm still trying to understand,' Rowe said when Sen. Josh Hawley, R-Mo., pressed him on whistleblower reports that law enforcement was supposed to be stationed on the roof but was not up there because it was 'too hot.'\n\nAbbate revealed that the FBI had identified a social media account they believed belonged to the shooter\n\n'In about the 2019, 2020 time frame, there were over 700 comments posted from this account. Some of these comments, if ultimately attributable to the shooter, appear to reflect anti-Semitic and anti-immigrant themes to espouse political violence and are described as extreme in nature,' Abbate said.\n\nRowe said that since the shooting he'd implemented a number of changes at the Secret Service, including having security plans go through multiple supervisors before implementation, expanded use of drones, more resources for protective site communications and 'expeditious' approval of requests for personnel at protective sites with heightened security environments.\n\nRowe and Abbate spoke to the Judiciary and Homeland Security committees after their boss, Cheatle submitted her resignation last week after a six-hour-long hearing where Republicans and Democrats accused her of stonewalling.\n\nTrump assassination attempt timeline, according to Secret Service acting director\n\nJuly 7: Crooks travels to rally site to spend 20 minutes doing reconnaissance\n\nJuly 12: Shooter visits Clairton Sportsmen's Club to practice shooting\n\nJuly 13, 10 a.m.: Shooter visits rally site again\n\n90 minutes before shooting: local law enforcement 'suspicious' of Crooks\n\n20 minutes before Trump takes stage, 30 minutes before shooting: Secret Service made aware of an individual with a rangefinder\n\n10 minutes before Trump takes stage, 20 minutes before shooting: Secret Service counter sniper team given photograph of the 'suspicious subject'\n\n3.5 minutes before shooting: Crooks spotted on the roof\n\n30 seconds before shooting: Crooks seen with a gun\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn his opening statement the Homeland Security Committee's top Republican Rand Paul revealed that local law enforcement had told his office they'd warned the Secret Service about the vulnerabilities of the rooftop where Thomas Matthew Crooks fired shots at the president.\n\n'Local law enforcement told my staff that they specifically flagged the vulnerability of the building to the Secret Service, and were told that it would be taken care of. Clearly, these vulnerabilities were not addressed.'\n\nJudiciary Chairman Dick Durbin, D-Ill., asked why more action wasn't taken when Crooks was seen to be holding a range finder 30 minutes before the shooting.\n\n'I thought I had read that it was a golf range finder. Nonetheless, it still would have provided him the ability to provide the distance that he was away from his intended target.'\n\n'Wasn't that enough?' Durbin asked.\n\n'As far as raising suspicion, yes I think.'\n\nIn another heated moment, Sen. Josh Hawley, R-Mo., pressed Rowe on why no one had been fired for the security breach yet.\n\n'Has the Person who decided, who made the decision to send Donald Trump on stage knowing that you had a security situation. Has that person been relieved of duty?' Hawley asked.\n\n'No sir they haven't,' said Rowe.\n\n'Has the person who decided not to pull the former president off of stage when you knew that in your work the locals were working a serious security situation? Has that person been relieved of duty?'\n\n'No, sir. Again, I refer you back to my original answer that we are investigating this through a mission assurance -- ' Rowe said.\n\n' -- What more do you need to investigate? To know exactly what you need to investigate to know the failures that something ought to be held accountable? What more do you need to know?' Hawley interjected.\n\n'What I need to know is exactly what happened ... I will not rush to judgment. People will be held accountable and I will do so with integrity, and not rush to judgment and put people like unfairly persecuted.'\n\nOn Monday new text messages revealed local law enforcement officers working former President Donald Trump's Butler, Pennsylvania, rally were severely understaffed ahead of the attempted assassination.\n\nDuring the tragic rally, Trump was shot in the ear and a former volunteer firefighter lost his life after 20-year-old Thomas Matthew Crooks opened fire from the roof of a nearby building just outside the security perimeter.\n\nBombshell new text messages between the Beaver County emergency services team from the days leading up to the rally show that there was a staffing shortage.\n\nOn July 8, five days before the rally, an unnamed team leader officer wrote in a text chat that they had been 'requested by Butler to assist' with Trump's rally and needed six people to step up for the 12-hour detail. Two offered to do so for the whole time, and two more offered to split the Saturday shift.\n\nThe law enforcement leader wrote in the thread that he only had a few people available to work the event because 'everyone else is either working, on vacation or hurt.'\n\nThe never-seen-before messages also lay out a timeline of nearly 90 minutes from between the identification of Crooks and his deadly fire.\n\nNew messages, bodycam footage and law enforcement debrief were obtained by Sen. Chuck Grassley, R-Iowa, who is conducting oversight of the event.\n\nThe messages showed that law enforcement were aware of Crooks, whom they spotted more than an hour and a half before Trump took the stage.\n\nAt 4:26 p.m., a Beaver County sniper finished his shift and departed the AGR building, where Crooks was able to access and take his shots from.\n\nAs the sniper left the building, he texted a chain about a suspicious person he'd spotted - which turned out to be Crooks.\n\n'Someone followed our lead and snuck in and parked by our cars just so you know,' read one message.\n\n'I'm just letting you know because you see me go out with my rifle and put it in my car so he knows you guys are up there.'\n\nThe officer noted that he was sitting at a picnic table 'about 50 yards from the exit.'\n\n'That bike was not there when I pulled out. Maybe have them check that car,' they went on.\n\nLater on, officers exchanged photos of Crooks, who had then been marked a 'suspicious person,' at 5:38 p.m., over 30 minutes before Trump was shot.\n\n'Kid learning (sic) around building we are in.

Rowe says he recently traveled to the Pennsylvania shooting site and says what he saw made him ashamed.\n\nRowe is being joined by FBI Deputy Director Paul Abbate at a joint hearing of the Senate committees on the Judiciary and Homeland Security.\n\nThe FBI's No. 2 official says a social media account believed to be associated with the gunman suspected in the assassination attempt espoused political violence and included antisemitic and anti-immigrant sentiment.

Lindsey Graham, the top Republican on the Senate Judiciary Committee. \"And if a lot of people are not fired, the system failed yet again.\n\nHe added: \"Nothing's going to change until somebody loses their job.\"\n\nThe hearing comes one day after the FBI released new details about its investigation into the shooting, revealing that the gunman had looked online for information about mass shootings, power plants, improvised explosive devices and the May assassination attempt of the Slovakian prime minister.\n\nListen now and subscribe: Apple Podcasts | Google Podcasts | Spotify | RSS Feed | SoundStack | All Of Our Podcasts\n\nThe FBI also said that Trump, the 2024 Republican presidential nominee, has agreed to be interviewed by agents as a crime victim. The bureau said last week that the former president had been struck in the ear by a bullet or fragment of one. Trump said Monday evening that he expected that interview to take place on Thursday.\n\nBut most of the questions Tuesday are expected to be directed at Rowe as lawmakers demand answers about how Crooks was able to get so close to Trump. Investigators believe Crooks fired eight shots in Trump's direction from an AR-style rifle after scaling the roof of a building of some 135 meters (147 yards) from where Trump was speaking in Butler, Pennsylvania.\n\nOne rallygoer was killed, and two others were injured. Crooks was shot dead by a Secret Service counter-sniper.\n\nAt her hearing last week, Cheatle said the Secret Service had \"failed\" in its mission to protect Trump. She called the attempt on Trump's life the Secret Service's \"most significant operational failure\" in decades and vowed to \"move heaven and earth\" to get to the bottom of what went wrong and make sure there's no repeat of it.\n\nPhotos: Trump injured, 2 killed in shooting at rally\n\nCheatle acknowledged that the Secret Service was told about a suspicious person two to five times before the shooting at the rally. She also revealed that the roof from which Crooks opened fire had been identified as a potential vulnerability days before the rally.\n\nCheatle said she apologized to Trump in a phone call after the assassination attempt.\n\nIn a Monday night interview on Fox News Channel, Trump defended the Secret Service agents who protected him from the shooting but said that someone should have been on the roof with Crooks and that there should have been better communication with local police.\n\n\"They didn't speak to each other,\" he said.\n\nHe praised the sniper who killed Crooks with what he said was an amazing shot but noted: \"It would have been good if it was nine seconds sooner.\"\n\nGet Government & Politics updates in your inbox!\n\nStay up-to-date on the latest in local and national

She stepped down as the head of the agency the following day.\n\nRowe said he and his investigators traveled to the Pennsylvania rally site and lay prone on the same roof where Crooks was when he shot at Trump on July 13.\n\n\"What I saw made me ashamed,\" Rowe said at the hearing about the clear line of sight to the rally stage. \"I cannot defend why that roof was not better secured.\"\n\nRowe stressed that the Secret Service has been reviewing its actions leading up to the day of the attack. Since the shooting, Rowe said, the agency has identified gaps in the security detail on the day of the rally and implemented corrective actions.\n\n\"I do not believe that inadequate time to plan for this event was a factor in the failure,\" Rowe said.\n\nAccording to Abbate, who provided a comprehensive timeline of events leading up to the shooting, the FBI has conducted over 460 interviews as part of their investigation.\n\nEvidence of the security failures included a text message thread among local police countersnipers who said they saw a suspicious person around the rally site but failed to approach him, according to reporting from the New York Times.\n\nCrooks was spotted by law enforcement up to 90 minutes before he climbed onto the roof and fired what investigators believe were eight shots at Trump.\n\nRowe emphasized that the Secret Service countersniper teams and members of Trump's security detail did not have any inkling that there was a man on the roof of the American Glass Research building armed with a gun.\n\n\"It is my understanding those personnel were not aware the assailant had a firearm until they heard gunshots,\" Rowe said.\n\nOne of the gunman's bullets grazed the former president's ear, and in the barrage of gunfire from Crooks a spectator was killed and two others were wounded.

That account posted over 700 comments between 2019 and 2020, he added.\n\n'Some of these comments ... appear to reflect anti-Semitic and anti-immigration themes to espouse political violence,' Abbate said.\n\nHe wouldn't confirm the name of the social media platform until after his agents could prove with 100% certainty Crooks made the posts.\n\nAbbate said the posts were 'extreme in nature,' but that the FBI is still determining whether the account actually belonged to Crooks.\n\nHe also disclosed that the agency is still working to identify and infiltrate Crooks's various 'encrypted' accounts that could shine light on his motive.\n\nThat angered Sen. Lindsey Graham who wanted more information on his. motive.\n\n'So you're telling me, the guy that took eight shots at the president, former president, has apps that we can't get into, that may if you could get into [them] reveal some relevant information.'\n\n'That is correct, senator,' the officials responded.\n\nThis concerned Graham who later pushed for better methods to infiltrate encrypted accounts.\n\n'We need a solution that provides lawful access,' the officials noted, inferring current options only provide illegal entry into Crooks's suspected accounts.\n\nIn addition to the online account discoveries, the number two man at the FBI disclosed more about the timeline behind the assassination attempt.\n\n'Approximately 25 minutes prior to the shooting, the U.S. Secret Service command post was notified of a suspicious person,' Abbate testified.\n\nThe Secret Service acting director also admitted he had no defense as for why the rooftop where Crooks fired shots toward former President Trump was left open.\n\n'I went to the roof of the AGR building where the assailant fired shots, and I laid in a prone position to evaluate his line of sight.'\n\n'What I saw made me ashamed as a career law enforcement officer and a 25 year veteran with the Secret Service. I cannot defend why that roof was not better secured,' he told Congress on Tuesday.\n\nCrooks fired eight rounds toward Trump, grazing him with a bullet in his ear.\n\n'When I laid in that position I could not, will not understand why there was not better coverage or at least somebody looking at that roof line when that's where they were posted,' Rowe said, noting that Crooks' head would have been clearly visible from the unmanned rooftop.\n\nThirty seconds before Crooks fired his shots, local law enforcement had radioed to Secret Service warning about a man with a rifle on the roof. Around three and a half minutes before that, he'd been 'observed on the roof.'\n\nRowe said that since the shooting he'd implemented a number of changes at the Secret Service, including having security plans go through multiple supervisors before implementation, expanded use of drones, more resources for protective site communications and 'expeditious' approval of requests for personnel at protective sites with heightened security environments.\n\nRowe and Abbate spoke to the Judiciary and Homeland Security committees after their boss, former Secret Service Director Kimberly Cheatle submitted her resignation last week after a six-hour-long hearing where Republicans and Democrats accused her of stonewalling.\n\nThe FBI and Secret Service officials also disclosed a more accurate timeline of events leading up to the shooting.\n\nAlmost a week before the rally, Crooks scouted the site of the event, spending 20 minutes doing reconnaissance on the location, they shared.\n\nJust a day before the shooting Crooks went to a shooting range to practice his shot.\n\nThe morning of the July 13 rally, Crooks again visited the grounds, the officials said.\n\nAbbate and Rowe also disclosed Crooks's activity on the day of the shooting and what authorities did in response.\n\nLocal law enforcement marked Crooks as 'suspicious' 90 minutes before he opened fire, the officials shared.\n\nSecret Service was informed that the would-be assassin had a range finder 30 minutes before the shooting occurred.\n\nMinutes later, just 20 before the shooting, the Secret Service counter sniper team was given a photo of the 'suspicious suspect.'\n\nThen, 3.5 minutes before Crooks opened fire, he was spotted on the roof.\n\nThe officials also disclosed that Crooks was seen with a gun on the roof 30 seconds before firing his first shot.\n\n'Within 15.5 seconds of his first shot, he's neutralized,' Rowe testified about how quickly Crooks was killed after opening fire.\n\nBut prior to his first shot Secret Service was unaware of his location, the Secret Service acting chief added.\n\nHe noted that the counter snipers did not see him because he was initially hiding on the other side of the roof.\n\n'I believe he was obscured by that roof,' Rowe testified.", "source": {"uri": "internewscast.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Internewscast Journal"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thomas_Crooks", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Thomas Crooks"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matt_Crooks", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Matt Crooks"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Secret_Service", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "United States Secret Service"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Bureau_of_Investigation", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Federal Bureau of Investigation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_media", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Social media"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assassination", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Assassination"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Senate", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "United States Senate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Encryption", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Encryption"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_Abbate", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Paul Abbate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assassination_of_John_F._Kennedy", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Assassination of John F.

Crooks turned and pointed his rifle at the officer, who retreated.\n\nEven though text messages among local snipers revealed anxiety about the man, Mr Rowe said the only thing the Secret Service knew at the time of the shooting was that law enforcement was contending with a suspicious-looking man.\n\nMr Rowe, raising his voice, responded that he has \"lost sleep over this for the last 17 days\" and that he would not be rushed \"to judgment\" by Congress.\n\nHe assured legislators that \"people will be held accountable\".\n\nThe FBI, meanwhile, disclosed new details about Crooks, with deputy director Paul Abbate saying a social media account believed to be associated with the gunman suspected in the assassination attempt espoused political violence and included antisemitic and anti-immigrant sentiment.\n\nThe posts were from the 2019-2020 timeframe, when Crooks would have been in high school.\n\nMr Abbate did not identify the social media platform, saying investigators were still trying to definitively determine that it belonged to Crooks.\n\nHowever, he indicated that it was separate from an account on a different platform called Gab that was active in 2021.\n\nThe chief executive of Gab posted on X, formerly known as Twitter, during the Senate hearing that Crooks's presence on that platform was consistent with being \"pro-Biden and in particular pro-Biden's immigration policy\".\n\nOn Monday, the FBI revealed that Crooks had looked online for information about mass shootings, power plants, improvised explosive devices and the May assassination attempt of the Slovakian prime minister Robert Fico.\n\nThe FBI also said that Mr Trump has agreed to be interviewed by agents as a crime victim.", "source": {"uri": "eadt.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title":

Those employees, Rowe said, would be held accountable through the agency's disciplinary process and face penalties that could include termination.\n\n\"That roof should have had better coverage,\" he said, \"and we will get to the bottom of if there were any policy violations.\"\n\nRowe displayed bursts of anger early in his testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee and the Senate Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee as he discussed what went wrong during Trump's presidential campaign rally in Butler, Pennsylvania.\n\nRowe said he traveled to the site of the shooting and went up on the roof to evaluate the gunman's line of sight and laid in the prone position.\n\n\"What I saw made me ashamed,\" he said. \"As a career law enforcement officer, and a 25-year veteran with the Secret Service, I cannot defend why that roof was not better secured.\"\n\nAt a minimum, Rowe said, somebody should have been looking at the roof, but there was a \"failure of imagination.\"\n\nRowe raised his voice again as Sen. Tom Cotton, R-Ark., pressured him to make immediate terminations. Rowe said he would not do so, or rush judgement, until a proper investigation is completed.\n\n\"You're asking me, senator, to completely make a rush to judgment about somebody failing,\" Rowe said.\n\nRowe said he would take disciplinary action as warranted and \"with integrity.\"\n\n\"This was a failure and we will get to the bottom of it,\" he said.\n\nTuesday's hearing is the latest in a series that lawmakers have held to investigate how Thomas Crooks, 20, was able to evade law enforcement and open fire at Trump.\n\nTrump was shot in the ear, one rallygoer was killed and two others were wounded before Crooks was fatally shot by a counter-sniper with the Secret Service.\n\nRowe said an inability for all the agencies to directly communicate with each other hindered the Secret Service.\n\nLocal law enforcement confirmed Crooks was armed at about 6:11 p.m. The local officers called out the threat through a radio, but that information was not relayed to the Secret Service, Rowe said.\n\nThe Secret Service countersnipers did not have any knowledge that Crooks was armed on the roof \"until they heard gunshots,\" Rowe said.\n\nOnly about 30 seconds had passed from the time the local officer confirmed Crooks was armed to when Crooks opened fire.\n\nRowe said there was a \"delay in reporting\" and that authorities had not set up a way for all the agencies to directly communicate with each other. That process would have taken months of planning and would require \"a lot,\" he said.\n\n\"Technically you could do it, but it would take a long time to get it done,\" Rowe said.\n\nRowe was appointed acting director last week after Kimberly Cheatle resigned, following a blistering House Oversight Committee hearing in which legislators skewered her over her lack of cooperation.\n\n\"I've heard your calls for accountability, and I take them very seriously,\" Rowe said.\n\nFBI deputy director Paul Abbate, who is also testifying, said investigators found a social media account that may have belonged to Crooks, which espoused anti-Semitic and anti-immigrant views and had posts about political violence.\n\nAbbate said the FBI has not yet confirmed the account belonged to Crooks. The agency still does not know a motive.\n\nLast week, FBI Director Christopher Wray testified that Crooks may have had a firearm with a collapsible stock, making it easier for him to carry and conceal the weapon.\n\nThe gunman had researched President John F. Kennedy's assassination and had previously traveled to the rally site.\n\nOn the morning of the rally, he went back to the campaign site, where he stayed for about an hour, and left that afternoon to buy 50 rounds of ammunition.\n\nWray said Crooks was back at the rally site shortly before 4 p.m., when he flew a drone about 200 yards from the main stage area.\n\nTwo hours later, witnesses began to shout about a suspicious man on the roof of a nearby building.\n\nCrooks began firing at least eight gunshots seconds after he noticed a law enforcement officer on the ground had spotted him, Wray said.\n\nThe officer had gotten a boost from a colleague and pulled his head up over the roof.

However, it was never relayed over to us,\" Rowe said.\n\nThe proceedings grew heated when Republican Senator Josh Hawley pushed Rowe to begin expelling agency employees immediately.\n\n\"I will tell you, senator ... that people will be held accountable, and I will do so with integrity and not rush to judgment and let people be unfairly persecuted,\" Rowe told Hawley with a raised voice.\n\n(Reporting by David Morgan, Sarah N.

Rowe says he recently traveled to the Pennsylvania shooting site and says what he saw made him ashamed.\n\nRowe is being joined by FBI Deputy Director Paul Abbate at a joint hearing of the Senate committees on the Judiciary and Homeland Security.\n\nThe FBI's No. 2 official says a social media account believed to be associated with the gunman suspected in the assassination attempt espoused political violence and included antisemitic and anti-immigrant sentiment.

The bureau said last week that the former president had been struck in the ear by a bullet or fragment of one. Trump said Monday evening that he expected that interview to take place on Thursday.\n\nBut most of the questions Tuesday are expected to be directed at Rowe as lawmakers demand answers about how Crooks was able to get so close to Trump. Investigators believe Crooks fired eight shots in Trump's direction from an AR-style rifle after scaling the roof of a building of some 135 meters (147 yards) from where Trump was speaking in Butler, Pennsylvania.\n\nOne rallygoer was killed, and two others were injured. Crooks was shot dead by a Secret Service counter-sniper.\n\nAt her hearing last week, Cheatle said the Secret Service had \"failed\" in its mission to protect Trump. She called the attempt on Trump's life the Secret Service's \"most significant operational failure\" in decades and vowed to \"move heaven and earth\" to get to the bottom of what went wrong and make sure there's no repeat of it.\n\nPhotos: Trump injured, 2 killed in shooting at rally\n\nCheatle acknowledged that the Secret Service was told about a suspicious person two to five times before the shooting at the rally.

Secret Service snipers killed Crooks after he opened fire.\n\nInvestigators have described Crooks as a loner with no close friends and a social network limited mainly to immediate family members.\n\nThe first shooting of a U.S. president or major party candidate in more than four decades was a glaring security lapse that led last week to former Secret Service Director Kimberly Cheatle's resignation under bipartisan congressional pressure.\n\nHer immediate successor, Acting Secret Service Director Ronald Rowe, told lawmakers that he visited the outdoor rally site in Butler and climbed onto the roof of a nearby building from which Crooks fired.\n\n\"What I saw made me ashamed,\" Rowe told a joint hearing of the Senate Homeland Security and Judiciary Committees. \"As a career law enforcement officer, and a 25-year veteran with the Secret Service, I cannot defend why that roof was not better secured.\"\n\nRowe sought to assure lawmakers that he has since taken steps to prevent similar lapses from occurring amid concerns among both Democrats and Republicans about further political violence as the campaign intensifies ahead of the Nov. 5 U.S. election.\n\nCrooks flew a drone near the rally site ahead of his assassination attempt, a flight that officials failed to detect because a system designed to detect drones was not working properly due to problems with cellular network bandwidth, Rowe said.\n\nThe Secret Service, a federal law enforcement agency whose duties including protecting the president and certain other top political figures, has added six people to its protection list since July 13, including Republican vice presidential candidate JD Vance and his family and independent presidential candidate Robert F. Kennedy, while reinforcing security details, Rowe said.\n\n\"This attack was a shocking reminder that the threat of political violence is alive and well in our country.

Lindsey Graham, the top Republican on the Senate Judiciary Committee. \"And if a lot of people are not fired, the system failed yet again.\n\nHe added: \"Nothing's going to change until somebody loses their job.\"\n\nThe hearing comes one day after the FBI released new details about its investigation into the shooting, revealing that the gunman had looked online for information about mass shootings, power plants, improvised explosive devices and the May assassination attempt of the Slovakian prime minister.\n\nThe FBI also said that Trump, the 2024 Republican presidential nominee, has agreed to be interviewed by agents as a crime victim. The bureau said last week that the former president had been struck in the ear by a bullet or fragment of one. Trump said Monday evening that he expected that interview to take place on Thursday.\n\nBut most of the questions Tuesday are expected to be directed at Rowe as lawmakers demand answers about how Crooks was able to get so close to Trump. Investigators believe Crooks fired eight shots in Trump's direction from an AR-style rifle after scaling the roof of a building of some 135 meters (147 yards) from where Trump was speaking in Butler, Pennsylvania.\n\nOne rallygoer was killed, and two others were injured. Crooks was shot dead by a Secret Service counter-sniper.\n\nAt her hearing last week, Cheatle said the Secret Service had \"failed\" in its mission to protect Trump. She called the attempt on Trump's life the Secret Service's \"most significant operational failure\" in decades and vowed to \"move heaven and earth\" to get to the bottom of what went wrong and make sure there's no repeat of it.\n\nPhotos: Trump injured, 2 killed in shooting at rally\n\nCheatle acknowledged that the Secret Service was told about a suspicious person two to five times before the shooting at the rally. She also revealed that the roof from which Crooks opened fire had been identified as a potential vulnerability days before the rally.\n\nCheatle said she apologized to Trump in a phone call after the assassination attempt.\n\nIn a Monday night interview on Fox News Channel, Trump defended the Secret Service agents who protected him from the shooting but said that someone should have been on the roof with Crooks and that there should have been better communication with local police.\n\n\"They didn't speak to each other,\" he said.\n\nHe praised the sniper who killed Crooks with what he said was an amazing shot but noted: \"It would have been good if it was nine seconds sooner.\"\n\nGet Government & Politics updates in your inbox!\n\nStay up-to-date on the latest in local and national

Prior to that, they were operating with the knowledge that local law enforcement was working on an issue of a suspicious individual prior to the shots being fired.\"\n\nHe said the Secret Service counter sniper killed Crooks within seconds after he fired his first shot and had \"full discretion to use deadly force to stop an attacker and did not need to seek authorization to fire.\"\n\nFederal Bureau of Investigation Deputy Director Paul Abbate told the Senate committee the agency has conducted more than 460 interviews, searched the shooter's residence and seized electronic media including phones, laptops hard drives and thumb drives to determine Crooks' motive, potential co-conspirators, other people who may have had knowledge of the attack and to build a timeline of the shooter before and during the shooting.\n\nHe said the FBI had recently discovered a social media account that may have belonged to the shooter with 700 comments that \"appear to reflect antisemitic and anti-immigration themes to espouse political violence and are described as extreme in nature.\"\n\nThe FBI is working to verify the account. The agency has also found email accounts for Crooks but has not been able to access them because the information is encrypted. Abbate said the FBI is investigating the attack as both an assassination attempt and an act of domestic terrorism.\n\nAbbate said Crooks flew a drone approximately 200 yards from the farm show grounds where the rally was scheduled to take place for about 11 minutes at 3:51 p.m. -- a little more than two hours before the rally began. The drone and its controller were found in Crooks' car after the shooting, but no photos or video were captured.\n\nThe Secret Service was supposed to deploy a counter drone that day at 3 p.m. but it wasn't operational until about 5:20 because of cellular bandwidth problems. Rowe said he had no explanation for why there was no backup plan for its dependence on local cell service in a rural area.\n\n\"We could've maybe stopped him,\" Rowe said, adding that he had lost sleep over the issue. \"Maybe on that particular day, he would've decided this isn't the day to do it because law enforcement just found me flying my drone.\"\n\nAccording to the FBI, the first time law enforcement reported seeing Crooks was at 4:26 p.m., who reported him as a suspicious person at 5:10 p.m. At 5:14 a local SWAT officer took a photo of Crooks. Aat 5:32, the SWAT officer saw the shooter with a rangefinder next to the building he would later climb to get on the roof.\n\nAt 5:38, the photo of the shooter was sent to a SWAT text message group, and the Secret Service command post was notified of a suspicious person. Abbate said officers lost sight of Crooks between 6:02 and 6:08 pm. At 6:11 p.m., a local police officer was lifted onto the roof by another officer, saw the shooter and radioed that he was armed. Crooks began firing within the next 30 seconds.\n\nAbbate said the agency had no definitive evidence for how Crooks got the rifle on the roof.\n\n\"We do believe he likely had it in the backpack. We don't have anyone who observed him with the backpack,\" Abbate said, adding that the rifle would not have fully fit in the backpack Crooks was wearing unless it was broken down and reassembled on the roof. The FBI is investigating that theory.\n\nRefuting a conspiracy theory that Trump had been hit by shrapnel, Abbate said, \"There is absolutely no doubt in the FBI's mind whether former President Trump was hit with a bullet and wounded in the ear. There never has been.\"\n\nSeveral Senators, including Lindsay Graham, R-S.C.., and Josh Hawley, R-Mo., called for the Secret Service to dismiss whomever failed to intervene before Crooks began shooting.\n\nThe assassination attempt \"could and should have been prevented,\" Sen. Gary Peters, D-Mich., said. \"The American people deserve to know what went wrong, and they deserve accountability for the security failures that day.\"\n\nHe demanded that the Secret Service make its agents available for interviews within a matter of days, to which Rowe agreed.\n\nThe acting Secret Service director said the agency has already initiated a disciplinary investigation and a policy review.\n\nRowe said he has taken multiple steps since his appointment as acting director to prevent similar lapses from occurring in the future, including ensuring that every security plan is vetted by multiple experienced supervisors, expanding the use of drones to help detect threats and improving radio communications between federal, state and local law enforcement.", "source": {"uri": "baynews9.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Spectrum News Bay News 9"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matt_Crooks", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Matt Crooks"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Law_enforcement", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Law enforcement"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Secret_Service", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "United States Secret Service"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Bureau_of_Investigation", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Federal Bureau of Investigation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assassination", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Assassination"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Firearm", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Firearm"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Senate", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "United States Senate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unmanned_aerial_vehicle", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Unmanned aerial vehicle"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kimberly_Cheatle", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Kimberly Cheatle"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rifle", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Rifle"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_Abbate", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Paul Abbate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domestic_terrorism", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Domestic terrorism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Opposition_to_immigration", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Opposition to immigration"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SWAT", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "SWAT"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Political_violence", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Political violence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antisemitism", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Antisemitism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sniper", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Sniper"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/USB_flash_drive", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "USB flash drive"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laptop", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Laptop"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radio", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Radio"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Encryption", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Encryption"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gary_Peters", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Gary Peters"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Josh_Hawley", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Josh Hawley"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Terrorism", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Terrorism", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Warfare_and_Conflict", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Warfare and Conflict", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Crime_and_Justice", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Crime and Justice", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Theft", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Theft", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 49}, {"uri": "news/Technology", "label": "news/Technology", "wgt": 50}], "image": "https://s7d2.scene7.com/is/image/TWCNews/sized-PresTrump_shooting_AP_24195849934046_HI_071324_crop_crop", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9772518", "eventUri": "eng-9772518", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-07-13", "textStart": 675, "textEnd": 682}], "sentiment": -0.4196078431372549, "wgt": 192, "relevance": 1}

Woman from Valley Park drowns in Big River trying to help another canoeist\n\nSenate lawmakers are grilling the officials about law enforcement lapses in the hours before the attempted assassination of Trump in the latest in a series of congressional hearings dedicated to the shooting.\n\nRowe became acting director of the agency last week after Kimberly Cheatle resigned in the aftermath of a House hearing in which she was berated by lawmakers and failed to answer specific questions about the communication failures preceding the July 13 shooting.\n\n\"If this happened in the military, a lot of people would be fired,\" said Sen. Lindsey Graham, the top Republican on the Senate Judiciary Committee. \"And if a lot of people are not fired, the system failed yet again.\n\nHe added: \"Nothing's going to change until somebody loses their job.\"\n\nThe hearing comes one day after the FBI released new details about its investigation into the shooting, revealing that the gunman had looked online for information about mass shootings, power plants, improvised explosive devices and the May assassination attempt of the Slovakian prime minister.\n\nThe FBI also said that Trump, the 2024 Republican presidential nominee, has agreed to be interviewed by agents as a crime victim. The bureau said last week that the former president had been struck in the ear by a bullet or fragment of one. Trump said Monday evening that he expected that interview to take place on Thursday.\n\nBut most of the questions Tuesday are expected to be directed at Rowe as lawmakers demand answers about how Crooks was able to get so close to Trump. Investigators believe Crooks fired eight shots in Trump's direction from an AR-style rifle after scaling the roof of a building of some 135 meters (147 yards) from where Trump was speaking in Butler, Pennsylvania.\n\nOne rallygoer was killed, and two others were injured. Crooks was shot dead by a Secret Service counter-sniper.\n\nAt her hearing last week, Cheatle said the Secret Service had \"failed\" in its mission to protect Trump. She called the attempt on Trump's life the Secret Service's \"most significant operational failure\" in decades and vowed to \"move heaven and earth\" to get to the bottom of what went wrong and make sure there's no repeat of it.\n\nCheatle acknowledged that the Secret Service was told about a suspicious person two to five times before the shooting at the rally. She also revealed that the roof from which Crooks opened fire had been identified as a potential vulnerability days before the rally.\n\nCheatle said she apologized to Trump in a phone call after the assassination attempt.\n\nIn a Monday night interview on Fox News Channel, Trump defended the Secret Service agents who protected him from the shooting but said that someone should have been on the roof with Crooks and that there should have been better communication with local police.\n\n\"They didn't speak to each other,\" he said.\n\nHe praised the sniper who killed Crooks with what he said was an amazing shot but noted: \"It would have been good if it was nine seconds sooner.\"\n\n0 Comments", "source": {"uri": "stltoday.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "St. Louis Post-Dispatch"},

So far very little has been uncovered about Crooks and what led to his shooting of Trump, which injured others and fatally wounded former firefighter Corey Comperatore on July 13. The bombshell developments in the investigation into the assassination attempt at Trump's Butler, Pennsylvania , rally came during a Senate hearing Tuesday. Congress dragged in the Secret Service's new acting head Ronald Rowe and the number two at the FBI, Deputy Director Paul Abbate, to testify on the shooting.\n\nAbbate revealed that at least one social media account on an unnamed platform believed to be associated with Crooks was discovered by the FBI. That account posted over 700 comments between 2019 and 2020, he added. 'Some of these comments ... appear to reflect anti-Semitic and anti-immigration themes to espouse political violence,' Abbate said. He wouldn't confirm the name of the social media platform until after his agents could prove with 100% certainty Crooks made the posts. Abbate said the posts were 'extreme in nature,' but that the FBI is still determining whether the account actually belonged to Crooks.\n\nHe also disclosed that the agency is still working to identify and infiltrate Crooks's various 'encrypted' accounts that could shine light on his motive. That angered Sen. Lindsey Graham who wanted more information on his. motive. 'So you're telling me, the guy that took eight shots at the president, former president, has apps that we can't get into, that may if you could get into [them] reveal some relevant information.' 'That is correct, senator,' the officials responded. This concerned Graham who later pushed for better methods to infiltrate encrypted accounts.\n\n'We need a solution that provides lawful access,' the officials noted, inferring current options only provide illegal entry into Crooks's suspected accounts. In addition to the online account discoveries, the number two man at the FBI disclosed more about the timeline behind the assassination attempt. 'Approximately 25 minutes prior to the shooting, the U.S. Secret Service command post was notified of a suspicious person,' Abbate testified. The Secret Service acting director also admitted he had no defense as for why the rooftop where Crooks fired shots toward former President Trump was left open.\n\n'I went to the roof of the AGR building where the assailant fired shots, and I laid in a prone position to evaluate his line of sight.' 'What I saw made me ashamed as a career law enforcement officer and a 25 year veteran with the Secret Service. I cannot defend why that roof was not better secured,' he told Congress on Tuesday. Crooks fired eight rounds toward Trump, grazing him with a bullet in his ear. 'When I laid in that position I could not, will not understand why there was not better coverage or at least somebody looking at that roof line when that's where they were posted,' Rowe said, noting that Crooks' head would have been clearly visible from the unmanned rooftop.\n\nThirty seconds before Crooks fired his shots, local law enforcement had radioed to Secret Service warning about a man with a rifle on the roof. Around three and a half minutes before that, he'd been 'observed on the roof.' Rowe said that since the shooting he'd implemented a number of changes at the Secret Service, including having security plans go through multiple supervisors before implementation, expanded use of drones, more resources for protective site communications and 'expeditious' approval of requests for personnel at protective sites with heightened security environments. Rowe and Abbate spoke to the Judiciary and Homeland Security committees after their boss, former Secret Service Director Kimberly Cheatle submitted her resignation last week after a six-hour-long hearing where Republicans and Democrats accused her of stonewalling.\n\nThe FBI and Secret Service officials also disclosed a more accurate timeline of events leading up to the shooting. Almost a week before the rally, Crooks scouted the site of the event, spending 20 minutes doing reconnaissance on the location, they shared. Just a day before the shooting Crooks went to a shooting range to practice his shot. The morning of the July 13 rally, Crooks again visited the grounds, the officials said. Abbate and Rowe also disclosed Crooks's activity on the day of the shooting and what authorities did in response.\n\nLocal law enforcement marked Crooks as 'suspicious' 90 minutes before he opened fire, the officials shared. Secret Service was informed that the would-be assassin had a range finder 30 minutes before the shooting occurred. Minutes later, just 20 before the shooting, the Secret Service counter sniper team was given a photo of the 'suspicious suspect.' Then, 3.5 minutes before Crooks opened fire, he was spotted on the roof. The officials also disclosed that Crooks was seen with a gun on the roof 30 seconds before firing his first shot.\n\n'Within 15.5 seconds of his first shot, he's neutralized,' Rowe testified about how quickly Crooks was killed after opening fire. But prior to his first shot Secret Service was unaware of his location, the Secret Service acting chief added. He noted that the counter snipers did not see him because he was initially hiding on the other side of the roof. 'I believe he was obscured by that roof,' Rowe testified.\n\nWant more stories like this from the Daily Mail?

Crooks turned and pointed his rifle at the officer, who retreated.\n\nEven though text messages among local snipers revealed anxiety about the man, Mr Rowe said the only thing the Secret Service knew at the time of the shooting was that law enforcement was contending with a suspicious-looking man.\n\nMr Rowe, raising his voice, responded that he has \"lost sleep over this for the last 17 days\" and that he would not be rushed \"to judgment\" by Congress.\n\nHe assured legislators that \"people will be held accountable\".\n\nThe FBI, meanwhile, disclosed new details about Crooks, with deputy director Paul Abbate saying a social media account believed to be associated with the gunman suspected in the assassination attempt espoused political violence and included antisemitic and anti-immigrant sentiment.\n\nThe posts were from the 2019-2020 timeframe, when Crooks would have been in high school.\n\nMr Abbate did not identify the social media platform, saying investigators were still trying to definitively determine that it belonged to Crooks.\n\nHowever, he indicated that it was separate from an account on a different platform called Gab that was active in 2021.\n\nThe chief executive of Gab posted on X, formerly known as Twitter, during the Senate hearing that Crooks's presence on that platform was consistent with being \"pro-Biden and in particular pro-Biden's immigration policy\".\n\nOn Monday, the FBI revealed that Crooks had looked online for information about mass shootings, power plants, improvised explosive devices and the May assassination attempt of the Slovakian prime minister Robert Fico.\n\nThe FBI also said that Mr Trump has agreed to be interviewed by agents as a crime victim.", "source": {"uri": "ayradvertiser.com", "dataType": "news",

The bureau said last week that the former president had been struck in the ear by a bullet or fragment of one. Trump said Monday evening that he expected that interview to take place on Thursday.\n\nBut most of the questions Tuesday are expected to be directed at Rowe as lawmakers demand answers about how Crooks was able to get so close to Trump. Investigators believe Crooks fired eight shots in Trump's direction from an AR-style rifle after scaling the roof of a building of some 135 meters (147 yards) from where Trump was speaking in Butler, Pennsylvania.\n\nOne rallygoer was killed, and two others were injured. Crooks was shot dead by a Secret Service counter-sniper.\n\nAt her hearing last week, Cheatle said the Secret Service had \"failed\" in its mission to protect Trump. She called the attempt on Trump's life the Secret Service's \"most significant operational failure\" in decades and vowed to \"move heaven and earth\" to get to the bottom of what went wrong and make sure there's no repeat of it.\n\nPhotos: Trump injured, 2 killed in shooting at rally\n\nCheatle acknowledged that the Secret Service was told about a suspicious person two to five times before the shooting at the rally. She also revealed that the roof from which Crooks opened fire had been identified as a potential vulnerability days before the rally.\n\nCheatle said she apologized to Trump in a phone call after the assassination attempt.\n\nIn a Monday night interview on Fox News Channel, Trump defended the Secret Service agents who protected him from the shooting but said that someone should have been on the roof with Crooks and that there should have been better communication with local police.\n\n\"They didn't speak to each other,\" he said.\n\nHe praised the sniper who killed Crooks with what he said was an amazing shot but noted: \"It would have been good if it was nine seconds sooner.\"\n\nGet Government & Politics updates in your inbox!\n\nStay up-to-date on the latest in local and national

She stepped down as the head of the agency the following da\n\nRowe said he and his investigators traveled to the Pennsylvania rally site and lay prone on the same roof where Crooks was when he shot at Trump.\n\n\"What I saw made me ashamed,\" Rowe said at the hearing about the clear line of sight to the rally stage. \"I cannot defend why that roof was not better secured.\"\n\nRowe stressed that the Secret Service has been reviewing its actions leading up to the day of the attack. Since the shooting, Rowe said, the agency has identified gaps in the security detail on the day of the rally and implemented corrective actions.\n\n\"I do not believe that inadequate time to plan for this event was a factor in the failure,\" Rowe said.\n\nA Secret Service drone was meant to go up around 3 p.m. on the day of the rally but was not operational until around 5:20 because of cellular bandwidth problems.\n\nSen. Chuck Grassley (R-Iowa) asked, \"Why is the Secret Service dependent on local cellular network? Does the Secret Service have a backup plan in place?\"\n\nRowe said questions about whether the Secret Service had got their drone up sooner is \"something that has cost me a lot of sleep because of the eventual outcome of the assailant.\"\n\n\"I have no explanation for it,\" Rowe said about why the drone was not operational sooner. \"It is something that I feel as though we could have perhaps found him. We could have maybe stopped him. Maybe on that particular day, he would have decided this isn't the day to do it, because law enforcement just found me flying my drone.\"\n\nAccording to Abbate, who provided a comprehensive timeline of events leading up to the shooting, the FBI has conducted over 460 interviews as part of their investigation.\n\nEvidence of the security failures included a text message thread among local police countersnipers who said they saw a suspicious person around the rally site but failed to approach him, according to reporting from the New York Times.\n\nRowe emphasized that the Secret Service countersniper teams and members of Trump's security detail did not know there was a man on the roof of the American Glass Research building armed with a gun.\n\n\"It is my understanding those personnel were not aware the assailant had a firearm until they heard gunshots,\" Rowe said.\n\nOne of the gunman's bullets grazed the former president's ear, Abbate confirmed, and in the barrage of gunfire from Crooks, a spectator was killed and two others were wounded. Within seconds of the first shot, Crooks was killed by a Secret Service sniper.\n\nAbbate provided a general timeline leading up to the shooting and some of the factors that led to the security failures.\n\nCrooks registered to attend the rally on July 6, three days after it was announced by the Trump campaign. At that time, he also searched online: \"How far was Oswald from Kennedy?\"\n\nThe following day, he traveled to the Butler venue and walked around for about 20 minutes in what the FBI says was a reconnaissance trip.\n\nA day before the rally, he went to a shooting range at a local gun club.\n\nHe arrived at the farm show site around 10 a.m. on the day of the shooting and remained there for about 70 minutes before returning home. While at his home, Crooks' father gave him a rifle for the purpose he believed of going back to the gun club sometime around 1:30 p.m., Abbate said.\n\nAbout 25 minutes later, Crooks purchased ammunition on his way back to Butler. He was later spotted walking near the American Glass Research building from which he ultimately committed the attack.\n\nShortly before 4 p.m., Crooks flew a drone approximately 200 yards from the farm show grounds for about 11 minutes, according to Abbate. The drone and controller were later found in his car.\n\nInvestigators say their analysis shows there were no photos or videos taken by the drone, but it was confirmed that Crooks livestreamed from the drone to his controller.\n\nCrooks was first spotted by local law enforcement personnel at 4:26 p.m., and shortly after 5 p.m., he was identified as a suspicious person.\n\nLess than 10 minutes later, a local SWAT officer working the security detail took a photo of Crooks, Abbate said. Crooks was observed next to the AGR building using his phone and holding a range-finder.\n\nBy 5:30 p.m., his photo was sent to SWAT members in a group text message.\n\nApproximately 25 minutes before the shooting, the Secret Service command post was notified of a suspicious person, but officers lost sight of Crooks from 6:02 to 6:08 p.m. Law enforcement continued to communicate with each other to try and find him during that span.\n\nVideo from a local business shows Crooks pulling himself up onto the AGR building rooftop around 6:06 p.m., and two minutes later, he was spotted by local law enforcement.\n\nA local police officer lifted himself up to the roof where Crooks was positioned at 6:11 p.m. He was able to radio that Crooks was armed with a long gun. Authorities have not been able to determine how the rifle was brought up to the roof and whether it was stored, broken down, in a backpack and put back together on the roof.\n\nLawmakers repeatedly asked Rowe why Trump was allowed to take the stage if a suspicious person was being pursued by law enforcement.\n\nThere was roughly half a minute between when local law enforcement radioed that Crooks had a gun and shots were fired, according to Rowe.\n\n\"My understanding is it was not relayed to\" Secret Service, Rowe said.\n\nSen. Josh Hawley (R-Mo.) said that span would still leave time for information to make its way to Trump's security detail.\n\nHawley repeatedly pressed Rowe to provide names of Secret Service personnel and whether they have been fired. Rowe said there is an ongoing investigation and he is not \"zeroing in on one or two individuals.\"\n\n\"What more do you need to know that there were critical enough failures that some individuals ought to be held accountable? What more do you need to know?\" Hawley asked.\n\n\"I need to know is exactly what happened, and I need my investigators to do their job,\" Rowe said. \"You're asking me, Senator, to completely make a rush to judgment about somebody failing. I acknowledge this was a failure.\"\n\n\"A former president was shot,\" Hawley said.\n\n\"Sir, this could have been our Texas School Book Depository. I have lost sleep over that for the last 17 days,\" Rowe said, referring to the 1963 assassination of John F. Kennedy in Dallas.\n\n\"Then fire somebody,\" Hawley said.\n\n\"I will tell you, Senator, that I will not rush to judgment, that people will be held accountable, and I will do so with integrity,\" Rowe said.", "source": {"uri": "m.arcamax.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "m.arcamax.com"}, "authors": [{"uri": "arcamax_publishing@m.arcamax.com", "name": "ArcaMax Publishing", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matt_Crooks", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Matt Crooks"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Secret_Service", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "United States Secret Service"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Bureau_of_Investigation", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Federal Bureau of Investigation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unmanned_aerial_vehicle", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Unmanned aerial vehicle"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Senate", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "United States Senate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kimberly_Cheatle", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Kimberly Cheatle"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_Abbate", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Paul Abbate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Opposition_to_immigration", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Opposition to immigration"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Senate_Committee_on_the_Judiciary", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States Senate Committee on the Judiciary"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Law_enforcement", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Law enforcement"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Political_violence", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Political violence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shooting_range", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Shooting range"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antisemitism", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Antisemitism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bipartisanship", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Bipartisanship"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Department_of_Homeland_Security", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States Department of Homeland Security"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_media", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Social media"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pennsylvania", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Pennsylvania"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Pennsylvania"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump_2016_presidential_campaign", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump 2016 presidential campaign"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reconnaissance", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Reconnaissance"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chuck_Grassley", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Chuck Grassley"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SWAT", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "SWAT"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cellular_network", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Cellular network"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sniper", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Sniper"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_F._Kennedy", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "John F.

Lynch\n\nWASHINGTON (Reuters) -The U.S. Secret Service's new acting director said on Tuesday he is \"ashamed\" of a major security lapse that preceded the July 13 attempted assassination of Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump at a Pennsylvania campaign rally.\n\nIn testimony before two Senate committees, Acting Secret Service Director Ronald Rowe said he visited the outdoor rally site in Butler and climbed onto the roof of a nearby building from which 20-year-old Thomas Crooks fired shots that wounded Trump's right ear, killed one rally attendee and wounded two others, with an AR-15-style rifle.\n\n\"What I saw made me ashamed,\" Rowe told a joint hearing of the Senate Homeland Security and Judiciary Committees. \"As a career law enforcement officer, and a 25-year veteran with the Secret Service, I cannot defend why that roof was not better secured.\"\n\nInvestigators have still not discovered Crooks' motive, but FBI Deputy Director Paul Abbate testified that they have newly found a social media account dating to 2019-2020 that appeared to be linked to the shooter.\n\n\"There were over 700 comments posted from this account,\" Abbate said. \"Some of these comments appear to reflect antisemitic and anti-immigration themes to espouse political violence and are described as extreme in nature.\"\n\nRowe's admission of a glaring security lapse came a week after former Secret Service Director Kimberly Cheatle resigned under bipartisan congressional pressure after refusing to detail security shortfalls in testimony before a House of Representatives panel.\n\nRowe sought to assure lawmakers that he has since taken steps to prevent similar lapses from occurring amid concerns among both Democrats and Republicans about further political violence as the campaign intensifies ahead of the Nov. 5 U.S. election.\n\nThe Secret Service, a federal law enforcement agency whose duties including protecting the president and certain other top political figures, has added six people to its protection list since July 13, including Republican vice presidential candidate JD (NASDAQ:JD) Vance and his family and independent presidential candidate Robert F. Kennedy, while reinforcing security details, Rowe said.\n\n\"This attack was a shocking reminder that the threat of political violence is alive and well in our country. By all accounts, this was inexcusable security, and planning failure,\" Democratic Senate Homeland Security Chairman Gary Peters said, adding that his panel is working on reforms to strengthen security protocols for the Secret Service.\n\nSenator Rand Paul, the committee's top Republican, said his staff had found communication gaps between local police who first noticed Crooks and the Secret Service.\n\nRowe said that Secret Service counter snipers and members of the Trump security detail had no knowledge that there was a man with a firearm on the roof of a nearby building.\n\nThe attempted assassination is the topic of multiple investigations by House and Senate committees, as well as a new bipartisan task force established by Republican House Speaker Mike Johnson and House Democratic leader Hakeem Jeffries.\n\nInvestigators have been unable to determine a clear motive for Crooks, who they have described as a loner with no close friends and a social network limited mainly to immediate family members. Much interest revolves around the timeline from when law enforcement officials first noticed Crooks to when Secret Service snipers killed him after he opened fire.", "source": {"uri": "investing.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Investing.com"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Secret_Service", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "United States Secret Service"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reuters", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Reuters"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thomas_Crooks", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Thomas Crooks"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Senate", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "United States Senate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republican_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Republican Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Law_enforcement_officer", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Law enforcement officer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Attempted_assassination_of_Ronald_Reagan", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Attempted assassination of Ronald Reagan"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Political_violence", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Political violence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salvador_Allende", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Salvador Allende"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Judiciary", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Judiciary"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Department_of_Homeland_Security", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States Department of Homeland Security"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pennsylvania", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Pennsylvania"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Pennsylvania"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kimberly_Cheatle", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Kimberly Cheatle"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_Abbate", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Paul Abbate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Opposition_to_immigration", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Opposition to immigration"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elections_in_the_United_States", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Elections in the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Law_enforcement_agency", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Law enforcement agency"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antisemitism", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Antisemitism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bipartisanship", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Bipartisanship"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_House_of_Representatives", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United States House of Representatives"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Bureau_of_Investigation", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Federal Bureau of Investigation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Democratic Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_media", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Social media"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gary_Peters", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Gary Peters"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Independent_politician", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Independent politician"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hakeem_Jeffries", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Hakeem Jeffries"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rand_Paul", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Rand Paul"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_F._Kennedy", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Robert F.

Lindsey Graham, the top Republican on the Senate Judiciary Committee. \"And if a lot of people are not fired, the system failed yet again.\n\nHe added: \"Nothing's going to change until somebody loses their job.\"\n\nThe hearing comes one day after the FBI released new details about its investigation into the shooting, revealing that the gunman had looked online for information about mass shootings, power plants, improvised explosive devices and the May assassination attempt of the Slovakian prime minister.\n\nListen now and subscribe: Apple Podcasts | Google Podcasts | Spotify | RSS Feed | SoundStack | All Of Our Podcasts\n\nThe FBI also said that Trump, the 2024 Republican presidential nominee, has agreed to be interviewed by agents as a crime victim. The bureau said last week that the former president had been struck in the ear by a bullet or fragment of one. Trump said Monday evening that he expected that interview to take place on Thursday.\n\nBut most of the questions Tuesday are expected to be directed at Rowe as lawmakers demand answers about how Crooks was able to get so close to Trump. Investigators believe Crooks fired eight shots in Trump's direction from an AR-style rifle after scaling the roof of a building of some 135 meters (147 yards) from where Trump was speaking in Butler, Pennsylvania.\n\nOne rallygoer was killed, and two others were injured. Crooks was shot dead by a Secret Service counter-sniper.\n\nAt her hearing last week, Cheatle said the Secret Service had \"failed\" in its mission to protect Trump. She called the attempt on Trump's life the Secret Service's \"most significant operational failure\" in decades and vowed to \"move heaven and earth\" to get to the bottom of what went wrong and make sure there's no repeat of it.\n\nPhotos: Trump injured, 2 killed in shooting at rally\n\nCheatle acknowledged that the Secret Service was told about a suspicious person two to five times before the shooting at the rally. She also revealed that the roof from which Crooks opened fire had been identified as a potential vulnerability days before the rally.\n\nCheatle said she apologized to Trump in a phone call after the assassination attempt.\n\nIn a Monday night interview on Fox News Channel, Trump defended the Secret Service agents who protected him from the shooting but said that someone should have been on the roof with Crooks and that there should have been better communication with local police.\n\n\"They didn't speak to each other,\" he said.\n\nHe praised the sniper who killed Crooks with what he said was an amazing shot but noted: \"It would have been good if it was nine seconds sooner.\"\n\nGet Government & Politics updates in your inbox!\n\nStay up-to-date on the latest in local and national

It also suggested that Rowe, with ready and detailed answers, was determined to strike a different posture than that of his predecessor, Kimberly Cheatle, who resigned last week after facing intense criticism from lawmakers from both major political parties after responses that were seen as evasive and lacking in specifics.\n\nMuch of Tuesday's hearing before the Senate Judiciary and Homeland Security committees focused on what Rowe suggested was inadequate information received by Secret Service personnel in the hour before the shooting, including that Crooks had been spotted on the roof.\n\nLocal law enforcement officers had spotted a suspicious-looking man pacing near the metal detectors and circulated but ultimately lost track of Crooks before he scaled the roof of a building at AGR International Inc. Shortly before the shooting, a local officer climbed up to the roof to investigate. Crooks turned and pointed his rifle at the officer, who retreated.\n\n\"No information regarding a weapon on a roof was ever passed to our personnel,\" Rowe said. At another point, he noted, \"It is troubling to me that we did not get that information as quickly as we should have. We didn't know that there was this incident going on.\"\n\nBut Rowe's willingness to assign blame to local law enforcement opened him up to harsh criticism from Senate Republicans, who saw him as failing to take responsibility.\n\nListen now and subscribe: Apple Podcasts | Google Podcasts | Spotify | RSS Feed | SoundStack | All Of Our Podcasts\n\n\"Isn't it the fact that the former president was shot, that a good American is dead, that other Americans were critically wounded -- isn't that enough mission failure for you to say to the person who decided that that building should not be the security perimeter, probably ought to be stepped down?\" said Sen. Josh Hawley, a Missouri Republican.\n\nRowe, raising his voice, responded that he has \"lost sleep over this for the last 17 days\" and that he would not be rushed \"to judgment\" by Congress, but he assured lawmakers that \"people will be held accountable.\"\n\nSen. Lindsey Graham, the top Republican on the Senate Judiciary Committee, said if something like this happened in the military, \"a lot of people would be fired. And if a lot of people are not fired, the system failed yet again.\"\n\nHe added: \"Nothing's going to change until somebody loses their job.\"\n\nThe FBI, meanwhile, disclosed new details about Crooks, with Deputy Director Paul Abbate saying a social media account believed to be associated with the gunman suspected in the assassination attempt espoused political violence and included antisemitic and anti-immigrant sentiment. The posts were from the 2019 and 2020 timeframe, when Crooks would have been in high school.\n\nOn Monday, the FBI revealed that Crooks had looked online for information about mass shootings, power plants, improvised explosive devices and the May assassination attempt of the Slovakian prime minister.\n\nThe FBI also said that Trump has agreed to be interviewed by agents as a crime victim. Trump, who appeared at events in the days after the shooting with a bandage on his right ear, said he expects the interview to take place on Thursday.\n\nAt Cheatle's hearing last week, she said the Secret Service had \"failed\" in its mission to protect Trump. She called the attempt on Trump's life the Secret Service's \"most significant operational failure\" in decades and vowed to \"move heaven and earth\" to get to the bottom of what went wrong and make sure there's no repeat of it.\n\nCheatle acknowledged that the Secret Service was told about a suspicious person two to five times before the shooting at the rally. She also revealed that the roof from which Crooks opened fire had been identified as a potential vulnerability days before the rally.\n\nIn a Monday night interview on Fox News Channel, Trump defended the Secret Service agents who protected him from the shooting but said that someone should have been on the roof with Crooks and that there should have been better communication with local police.\n\n\"They didn't speak to each other,\" he said.\n\nHe praised the sniper who killed Crooks with what he said was an amazing shot but noted: \"It would have been good if it was nine seconds sooner.\"\n\n0 Comments Love 0 Funny 0 Wow 0 Sad 0 Angry 0\n\nGet Government & Politics updates in your inbox!\n\nStay up-to-date on the latest in local and national government and political topics

Lynch\n\nWASHINGTON (Reuters) -The man who tried to assassinate Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump appears to have posted violent antisemitic and anti-immigration content online as a teenager, a senior FBI official told a U.S. Senate hearing on Tuesday.\n\nFBI Deputy Director Paul Abbate at the hearing revealed the existence of the social media account, which dated to 2019-2020 - when Thomas Crooks, who authorities have identified as the shooter, would have been 15 or 16 years old. It is some of the first evidence to become public about a potential motive in the July 13 attack at a campaign rally in western Pennsylvania.\n\n\"Something just very recently uncovered that I want to share is a social media account which is believed to be associated with the shooter in about the 2019-2020 time frame,\" Abbate told lawmakers, adding that more than 700 comments were posted by the account.\n\n\"Some of these comments, if ultimately attributable to the shooter, appear to reflect antisemitic and anti-immigration themes to espouse political violence and are described as extreme in nature,\" Abbate said.\n\nCrooks, who was 20, shot at Trump with an AR-15-style rifle during the rally in Butler, Pennsylvania, wounding the former president's ear, killing one rally attendee and wounding two others. Secret Service snipers killed Crooks after he opened fire.\n\nInvestigators have described Crooks as a loner with no close friends and a social network limited mainly to immediate family members.\n\nThe first shooting of a U.S. president or major party candidate in more than four decades was a glaring security lapse that led last week to former Secret Service Director Kimberly Cheatle's resignation under bipartisan congressional pressure.\n\nHer immediate successor, Acting Secret Service Director Ronald Rowe, told lawmakers that he visited the outdoor rally site in Butler and climbed onto the roof of a nearby building from which Crooks fired.\n\n\"What I saw made me ashamed,\" Rowe told a joint hearing of the Senate Homeland Security and Judiciary Committees. \"As a career law enforcement officer, and a 25-year veteran with the Secret Service, I cannot defend why that roof was not better secured.\"\n\nRowe sought to assure lawmakers that he has since taken steps to prevent similar lapses from occurring amid concerns among both Democrats and Republicans about further political violence as the campaign intensifies ahead of the Nov. 5 U.S. election.\n\nCrooks flew a drone near the rally site ahead of his assassination attempt, a flight that officials failed to detect because a system designed to detect drones was not working properly due to problems with cellular network bandwidth, Rowe said.\n\nThe Secret Service, a federal law enforcement agency whose duties including protecting the president and certain other top political figures, has added six people to its protection list since July 13, including Republican vice presidential candidate JD Vance and his family and independent presidential candidate Robert F. Kennedy, while reinforcing security details, Rowe said.\n\n\"This attack was a shocking reminder that the threat of political violence is alive and well in our country. By all accounts, this was inexcusable security, and planning failure,\" Democratic Senate Homeland Security Chairman Gary Peters said, adding that his panel is working on reforms to strengthen security protocols for the Secret Service.\n\nSenator Rand Paul, the committee's top Republican, said his staff had found communication gaps between local police who first noticed Crooks and the Secret Service.\n\nRowe said that Secret Service counter snipers and members of the Trump security detail had no knowledge that there was a man with a firearm on the roof of a nearby building.\n\nThe attempted assassination is the topic of multiple investigations by House and Senate committees, as well as a new bipartisan task force.\n\n(Reporting by David Morgan, Sarah N.

It also suggested that Rowe, with ready and detailed answers, was determined to strike a different posture than that of his predecessor, Kimberly Cheatle, who resigned last week after facing intense criticism from lawmakers from both major political parties after responses that were seen as evasive and lacking in specifics.\n\nMuch of Tuesday's hearing before the Senate Judiciary and Homeland Security committees focused on what Rowe suggested was inadequate information received by Secret Service personnel in the hour before the shooting, including that Crooks had been spotted on the roof.\n\nLocal law enforcement officers had spotted a suspicious-looking man pacing near the metal detectors and circulated but ultimately lost track of Crooks before he scaled the roof of a building at AGR International Inc. Shortly before the shooting, a local officer climbed up to the roof to investigate. Crooks turned and pointed his rifle at the officer, who retreated.\n\n\"No information regarding a weapon on a roof was ever passed to our personnel,\" Rowe said. At another point, he noted, \"It is troubling to me that we did not get that information as quickly as we should have. We didn't know that there was this incident going on.\"\n\nBut Rowe's willingness to assign blame to local law enforcement opened him up to harsh criticism from Senate Republicans, who saw him as failing to take responsibility.\n\nListen now and subscribe: Apple Podcasts | Google Podcasts | Spotify | RSS Feed | SoundStack | All Of Our Podcasts\n\n\"Isn't it the fact that the former president was shot, that a good American is dead, that other Americans were critically wounded -- isn't that enough mission failure for you to say to the person who decided that that building should not be the security perimeter, probably ought to be stepped down?\" said Sen. Josh Hawley, a Missouri Republican.\n\nRowe, raising his voice, responded that he has \"lost sleep over this for the last 17 days\" and that he would not be rushed \"to judgment\" by Congress, but he assured lawmakers that \"people will be held accountable.\"\n\nSen. Lindsey Graham, the top Republican on the Senate Judiciary Committee, said if something like this happened in the military, \"a lot of people would be fired. And if a lot of people are not fired, the system failed yet again.\"\n\nHe added: \"Nothing's going to change until somebody loses their job.\"\n\nThe FBI, meanwhile, disclosed new details about Crooks, with Deputy Director Paul Abbate saying a social media account believed to be associated with the gunman suspected in the assassination attempt espoused political violence and included antisemitic and anti-immigrant sentiment. The posts were from the 2019 and 2020 timeframe, when Crooks would have been in high school.\n\nOn Monday, the FBI revealed that Crooks had looked online for information about mass shootings, power plants, improvised explosive devices and the May assassination attempt of the Slovakian prime minister.\n\nThe FBI also said that Trump has agreed to be interviewed by agents as a crime victim. Trump, who appeared at events in the days after the shooting with a bandage on his right ear, said he expects the interview to take place on Thursday.\n\nAt Cheatle's hearing last week, she said the Secret Service had \"failed\" in its mission to protect Trump. She called the attempt on Trump's life the Secret Service's \"most significant operational failure\" in decades and vowed to \"move heaven and earth\" to get to the bottom of what went wrong and make sure there's no repeat of it.\n\nCheatle acknowledged that the Secret Service was told about a suspicious person two to five times before the shooting at the rally. She also revealed that the roof from which Crooks opened fire had been identified as a potential vulnerability days before the rally.\n\nIn a Monday night interview on Fox News Channel, Trump defended the Secret Service agents who protected him from the shooting but said that someone should have been on the roof with Crooks and that there should have been better communication with local police.\n\n\"They didn't speak to each other,\" he said.\n\nHe praised the sniper who killed Crooks with what he said was an amazing shot but noted: \"It would have been good if it was nine seconds sooner.\"\n\nGet Government & Politics updates in your inbox!\n\nStay up-to-date on the latest in local and national government and political topics with our newsletter.\n\nSign up! * I understand and

The bureau said last week that the former president had been struck in the ear by a bullet or fragment of one. Trump said Monday evening that he expected that interview to take place on Thursday.\n\nBut most of the questions Tuesday are expected to be directed at Rowe as lawmakers demand answers about how Crooks was able to get so close to Trump.

She also revealed that the roof from which Crooks opened fire had been identified as a potential vulnerability days before the rally.\n\nCheatle said she apologized to Trump in a phone call after the assassination attempt.\n\nIn a Monday night interview on Fox News Channel, Trump defended the Secret Service agents who protected him from the shooting but said that someone should have been on the roof with Crooks and that there should have been better communication with local police.\n\n\"They didn't speak to each other,\" he said.\n\nHe praised the sniper who killed Crooks with what he said

Kennedy, while reinforcing security details, Rowe said.\n\n\"This attack was a shocking reminder that the threat of political violence is alive and well in our country.

Deputy FBI Director Paul Abbate described the account but did not reveal the platform at the hearing.\n\nThe hearing was the fourth such one held on Capitol Hill since the assassination attempt, and though it grew testy at times, especially during some exchanges with Republican senators, lawmakers appeared largely satisfied with the information provided by Rowe and Abbate during their more than three hours of testimony.\n\nOverall, it stood in stark contrast with a House hearing held last week in which lawmakers grilled then-Secret Service Director Kimberly Cheatle over what went wrong earlier this month, with several members demanding she resign over the lapses. A day later, she did just that.\n\nHere are the takeaways from Tuesday's joint hearing:\n\nDuring Tuesday's hearing, Rowe highlighted the failures of communications during the rally, in Butler, saying that information about Crooks was \"siloed\" and \"stuck\" in local law enforcement channels.\n\n\"The only thing we had was that locals were working an issue at the three o'clock - which would have been the former president's right-hand side - which is where the shot came,\" Rowe said. \"Nothing about man on the roof, nothing about man with a gun. None of that information ever made it over our net.\"\n\nHomeland Security Committee Chairman Gary Peters said that local law enforcement has claimed they were \"only able to call in to a state command center\" and not able to easily communicate threats to the Secret Service.\n\nBut Peters also noted that Abbate testified during the hearing that \"there was about 30 seconds between when the local law enforcement reported that there was a man on the roof with a gun\" and when the shooter began firing.\n\n\"If it's communicated directly to a counter-sniper team, would that be enough time to react prior to the firing of those shots?\" Peters asked.\n\n\"If we'd had that information, they would have been able to address it more quickly,\" Rowe replied. \"It appears that that information was stuck or siloed in that local channel.\"\n\n\"It is troubling to me that we did not get that information as quickly as we should have,\" he said. \"We didn't know that there was this incident going on.\"\n\nCrooks was killed within 15.5 seconds of the first shot, Rowe said.\n\nRowe confirmed that the reason a counter-drone system was not deployed at the Butler rally earlier in the day was because of connectivity issues.\n\n\"On this day in particular, because of the connectivity challenge ... there was a delay,\" he said. Crooks flew his own drone around the area two hours before Trump took the stage.\n\nThe issue has \"cost me a lot of sleep,\" Rowe said. \"What if we would have geolocated him because that counter (unmanned aircraft system) platform would have been up.\"\n\nRowe said that had the system been up, law enforcement may have been able to see Crooks' use of his own drone and approached him well before the shooting.\n\nMoving forward, Rowe said, his agency will use drones to help better secure future events.\n\n\"It is clear to me that other protective enhancements could have strengthened our security at the Butler event,\" he told lawmakers. \"As such, I have directed the expanded use of unmanned aerial systems at protective sites to help detect threats on roofs and other elevated threats.\"\n\nThe acting director also said that the Secret Service will now work with the Department of Homeland Security to set up their own, private connection and not rely on public domain connections.\n\nAs lawmakers pressed Rowe for answers on what went wrong earlier this month, the interim Secret Service director sought to shirk some of the responsibility for the security lapses, partially blaming the issues on the local law enforcement officers with whom they were working.\n\nMoving forward, Rowe told the committees, his agency will avoid assuming local law enforcement agencies are fully capable of fulfilling their role in protecting an event.\n\n\"We assumed that the state and locals had it,\" Rowe said of the area where Crooks climbed up the side of a building near the rally with his rifle.\n\n\"We made an assumption,\" he said, explaining that the Secret Service believed there would be sufficient eyes to cover the area and that local law enforcement would have a counter sniper in the AGR building where Crooks took his position.\n\nRowe told the lawmakers that local law enforcement was positioned in a nearby building and should have had a clear line of sight of Crooks on the roof.\n\n\"I cannot understand why there was not better coverage or at least somebody looking at that roofline when that's where they were posted,\" Rowe said, noting that a local sniper team could have looked from their post and seen the would-be assassin.\n\n\"Looking left, why was the assailant not seen?\" Rowe asked of the local team, as he showed lawmakers photographs of the roofs snipers were positioned on.\n\n\"I'm not saying that they should have neutralized him, but if they'd have held their post and looked left maybe...\" Rowe said later, though he was quickly cut off by an unrelated comment.\n\nSeveral senators lambasted Rowe for not firing any members in his agency and over the amount of security provided to former President Trump compared to President Joe Biden.\n\nIn one such exchange, Rowe loudly objected to Sen. Josh Hawley's persistent questions about why individuals weren't fired in recent weeks.\n\n\"I will not rush to judgment. People will be held accountable,\" Rowe said, adding that investigations into the failures that day are ongoing.\n\nThe Missouri Republican responded: \"Is it not prima facie that somebody has failed? The former president was shot.\"\n\n\"Sir, this could have been our Texas School Book Depository,\" Rowe responded, referring to the 1963 assassination of President John F. Kennedy in Dallas. \"I have lost sleep over that for the last 17 days, just like you have.\"\n\n\"Then fire somebody,\" Hawley shouted, to which Rowe replied: \"We have to be able to have a proper investigation into this.\"\n\nAt another point during Tuesday's hearing, Republican Sen. Ted Cruz repeatedly pressed Rowe on why Trump doesn't receive the same security level as Biden.\n\n\"There is a difference between the sitting president of the United States,\" Rowe said.\n\n\"Then what's the difference,\" Cruz yelled, cutting Rowe off.\n\n\"The difference - national command authority to launch a nuclear strike, sir,\" Rowe responded. \"There are other assets that travel with the president that the former president will not get.\"\n\nInvestigators have uncovered a social media account with posts espousing political violence that may be connected to the would-be Trump assassin, Abbate said.\n\nOfficials have repeatedly said that they have struggled to understand what the 20-year-old shooter's motive was, and that they are combing his online presence for more information.\n\n\"Something just very recently uncovered that I want to share is a social media account, which is believed to be associated with this with the shooter - in about the 2019, 2020 timeframe,\" Abbate said.\n\nOn that account, \"there were over 700 comments,\" Abbate said, which, \"if ultimately attributable to the shooter, appear to reflect antisemitic and anti-immigration themes, to espouse political violence, and are described as extreme in nature.\"\n\nCNN has learned the account is on the YouTube platform.\n\nA separate account on the platform Gab - which was made years earlier - appears to have \"differing points of view,\" Abbate added.\n\nGab CEO Andrew Tobra revealed last week that the would-be assassin may have had an account on the site, which is an alternative social media network popular with conservatives, the alt-right and some extremists. Tobra claimed that the account in question was \"pro-Biden.\"\n\nThe Gab account has also not been conclusively connected to Crooks.\n\nThis story has been updated with additional developments.\n\nThe-CNN-Wire\n\n\u2122 & \u00a9 2024 Cable News Network, Inc., a Warner Bros.

Drone deployment was delayed due to cellular bandwidth issues, he said.\n\nWhile he acknowledged the Secret Service had been looped in on reports of a suspicious person with a rangefinder, Mr. Rowe said Secret Service agents were never told the person was later spotted on the roof of a nearby building with a gun until after he fired at Mr. Trump.\n\nMr. Rowe visited the site of the Butler rally, climbed onto the roof and lay in the spot where 20-year-old Matthew Thomas Crooks was positioned when he shot at least eight rounds from an AR-15, grazing Mr. Trump in the ear, killing one rallygoer and injuring two others.\n\n\"What I saw made me ashamed,\" Mr. Rowe said. \"I cannot defend why that roof was not better secured.\"\n\nMr. Rowe's testimony to the Senate Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs and Judiciary committees comes a week after he was appointed to temporarily lead the Secret Service.\n\nKimberly Cheatle, the former director, resigned last week a day after she testified in the House, dodging questions and drawing bipartisan condemnation and calls for her to resign.\n\n\"I regret that information was not passed to Congress and the public sooner with greater frequency,\" Mr. Rowe said.\n\nHe pledged his \"full support\" to the various investigations examining the assassination attempt and said he would hold a press conference as soon as this week to provide further updates to the public.\n\nMr. Rowe said he has begun assessing where the Secret Service failed and has already implemented \"corrective actions\" for security gaps that occurred on July 13. That includes directing agents to vet event site security plans with multiple experienced supervisors before implementation and expanding the use of drones at protected sites.\n\nFBI Deputy Director Paul Abbate also testified at the hearing, updating the committees on the bureau's ongoing criminal investigation into Crooks. He said the FBI has conducted more than 460 interviews to date and has received more than 2,000 tips.\n\nWhile Mr. Abbate revealed little new information, he did tell senators that the FBI recently uncovered a social media account they believe to be associated with Crooks containing more than 700 posts from 2019-2020. The FBI is still working to verify whether the account and posts belong to Crooks, but if they do, they contain some of the first major insights into his state of mind, he said.\n\n\"Some of these comments, if ultimately attributable to the shooter, appeared to reflect antisemitic and anti-immigration themes to espouse political violence and are described as extreme in nature,\" Mr. Abbate said.\n\nSenators spent the majority of their time questioning Mr. Rowe. While they welcomed news of the disciplinary investigation, some were surprised no one in the agency had been let go yet.\n\n\"Somebody's got to be fired,\" Sen. Lindsey Graham of South Carolina, the top Republican on the Judiciary Committee, said. \"Nothing is going to change until somebody loses their job.\"\n\nSen. Josh Hawley, Missouri Republican, got into a testy exchange with Mr. Rowe as he pressed him on why the agent in charge of security planning for the rally or other agents who may have failed in their roles still had their jobs.\n\n\"What more do you need to know?\" the senator asked.\n\nMr. Rowe committed to holding people accountable after the disciplinary review, but said he wouldn't rush to judgment because he doesn't want agents to be \"unfairly persecuted.\"\n\nIn a separate exchange, Mr. Rowe said the team planning security for the Democratic National Convention in Chicago next month is a separate set of agents from headquarters in Washington.\n\n\"Our Pittsburgh field office staff, they are wearing this harder than anybody right now in the Secret Service,\" he said. \"They feel completely demoralized.\"\n\nSenate Homeland Security Chairman Gary Peters, Michigan Democrat, said his panel wants to interview the Secret Service agents responsible for securing the Butler event, asking Mr. Rowe to make them available for depositions within days. Mr. Rowe committed to that.\n\nSome GOP senators said in a press conference after the hearing that Congress does not have the time or staff needed to uncover answers quickly enough and called for an independent commission to investigate the assassination attempt.\n\n\"I think that this is something that the president could appoint [or] if the House and Senate leadership got together they could do as well,\" Sen. Roger Marshall, Kansas Republican said.\n\nMost importantly, the commission should be apolitical, comprised of \"experts in the field\" not associated with Republicans or Democrats, he said.\n\nMr. Marshall also cited \"significant cultural breakdowns within the Secret Service\" and said he thinks President Biden should appoint a \"crisis management team\" to overhaul the agency.\n\n\"I think he's fine in his role right now as acting director,\" he said of Mr. Rowe. \"But I don't think that he has the skill set or the objective ability to turn this Secret Service around.\"\n\nA key revelation in the hearing came during questioning from Sen. Charles E. Grassley. The Iowa Republican said he received documents from local law enforcement showing the Secret Service had planned to have someone operate a counter-drone on July 13.\n\n\"According to the Secret Service, the drone system was supposed to be operational at 3 p.m.,\" Mr. Grassley said. \"That day, however, we've been told by Secret Service that because of the cellular bandwidth problems, it wasn't operational until about 5:20.\"\n\nMr. Rowe confirmed the drone system \"had operational difficulties and did not go operational until after 5 o'clock.\"\n\nCrooks flew his drone at 3:51 p.m. Had the Secret Service counter drone been operational at that point, it should have recognized Crooks' system.\n\n\"We could have perhaps found him. We could have perhaps stopped him,\" Mr. Rowe said, noting that the question \"has cost me a lot of sleep.\"\n\nMr. Grassley asked why the Secret Service's technology is dependent on cellular networks, and why there was no backup plan in place.\n\nMr. Rowe was reluctant to detail the technology in a public hearing so as not to provide tactical information to potential bad actors. But he admitted the failure to have a counter-drone in the air is something he has struggled to understand.\n\n\"Moving forward, we are leveraging resources from the Department of Homeland Security and others to make sure that we have dedicated connectivity so that we're not reliant on public domain -- so that we can ensure that whatever assets we have in place, those assets are operational,\" Mr. Rowe said.\n\nAnother issue senators honed in on was communication breakdowns that took place in the final few minutes before Mr. Trump was shot.\n\nWhile local law enforcement working the rally first identified Crooks as a suspicious person at 4:26 p.m., according to Mr. Abbate's timeline of events, it was not until 6:08 p.m. that they observed him on the roof.\n\nAt 6:11 p.m., one local officer hoisted another to get a visual on the roof and Crooks pointed a gun at the officer. That's the first time local law enforcement spotted Crooks with a weapon, and the officers immediately radioed in that the man on the roof was armed with a \"long gun,\" Mr. Abbate said.\n\nMr. Rowe said that radio communication never made it to the Secret Service.\n\n\"It appears that information was stuck or siloed in that state or local channel,\" he said. \"It is troubling to me that we did not get that information as quickly as we should have.\"\n\nBefore the shots were fired, the Secret Service was only told that local law enforcement was working on an issue in the general direction of the building. Had agents known someone was on the roof with a gun, they would have removed Mr. Trump from the stage, Mr. Rowe said.\n\n\"Not having that real-time information is what really hindered us,\" he said.\n\nMr. Rowe said he has directed resources to improving protective site communications, particularly with our state and local partners. But he also said it is not easy to set up direct communications with all law enforcement partners working a big event.\n\n\"For a one-day or an eight-hour operation, it requires a lot,\" Mr. Rowe said. \"It would be months of planning, of knowing that we are going to go to this particular jurisdiction and that we're going to need your frequencies, the keys, and we're going to need to load you into our radios.\"\n\nSenators said that is something the Homeland Security Committee should look at addressing.\n\n\"Not just in an executive protection context, but any complex incident response, any counterterrorism, any natural disaster context, the inability swiftly to link personnel from disparate jurisdictions at the local, state and federal level is a vulnerability for the nation,\" Sen. Jon Ossoff, Georgia Democrat, said.", "source": {"uri": "washingtontimes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Washington Times"}, "authors": [{"uri": "lindsey_mcpherson@washingtontimes.com", "name": "Lindsey McPherson", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matt_Crooks", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Matt Crooks"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tommy_Rowe", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Tommy Rowe"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Secret_Service", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "United States Secret Service"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Bureau_of_Investigation", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Federal Bureau of Investigation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unmanned_aerial_vehicle", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Unmanned aerial vehicle"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Congress", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "United States Congress"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republican_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Republican Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Butler,_Pennsylvania", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Butler, Pennsylvania"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Butler, Pennsylvania"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lindsey_Graham", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Lindsey Graham"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Senate_Committee_on_the_Judiciary", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "United States Senate Committee on the Judiciary"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Senate", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "United States Senate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thomas_Crooks", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Thomas Crooks"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kimberly_Cheatle", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Kimberly Cheatle"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Office_of_Professional_Responsibility", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Office of Professional Responsibility"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Attempted_assassination_of_Ronald_Reagan", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Attempted assassination of Ronald Reagan"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Senate_Committee_on_Homeland_Security_and_Governmental_Affairs", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States Senate Committee on Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assassination_of_John_F._Kennedy", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Assassination of John F.

Trump said Monday evening that he expected that interview to take place on Thursday.\n\nBut most of the questions Tuesday are expected to be directed at Rowe as lawmakers demand answers about how Crooks was able to get so close to Trump. Investigators believe Crooks fired eight shots in Trump's direction from an AR-style rifle after scaling the roof of a building of some 135 meters (147 yards) from where Trump was speaking in Butler, Pennsylvania.\n\nOne rallygoer was killed, and two others were injured. Crooks was shot dead by a Secret Service counter-sniper.\n\nAt her hearing last week, Cheatle said the Secret Service had \"failed\" in its mission to protect Trump. She called the attempt on Trump's life the Secret Service's \"most significant operational failure\" in decades and vowed to \"move heaven and earth\" to get to the bottom of what went wrong and make sure there's no repeat of it.\n\nPhotos: Trump injured, 2 killed in shooting at rally\n\nCheatle acknowledged that the Secret Service was told about a suspicious person two to five times before the shooting at the rally. She also revealed that the roof from which Crooks opened fire had been identified as a potential vulnerability days before the rally.\n\nCheatle said she apologized to Trump in a phone call after the assassination attempt.\n\nIn a Monday night interview on Fox News Channel, Trump defended the Secret Service agents who protected him from the shooting but said that someone should have been on the roof with Crooks and that there should have been better communication with local police.\n\n\"They didn't speak to each other,\" he said.\n\nHe praised the sniper who killed Crooks with what he said was an amazing shot but noted: \"It would have been good if it was nine seconds sooner.\"\n\nGet Government & Politics updates in your inbox!\n\nStay up-to-date on the latest in local and national

Deputy FBI Director Paul Abbate described the account but did not reveal the platform at the hearing.\n\nThe hearing was the fourth such one held on Capitol Hill since the assassination attempt, and though it grew testy at times, especially during some exchanges with Republican senators, lawmakers appeared largely satisfied with the information provided by Rowe and Abbate during their more than three hours of testimony.\n\nOverall, it stood in stark contrast with a House hearing held last week in which lawmakers grilled then-Secret Service Director Kimberly Cheatle over what went wrong earlier this month, with several members demanding she resign over the lapses. A day later, she did just that.\n\nHere are the takeaways from Tuesday's joint hearing:\n\n'Siloed' information about Crooks' presence\n\nDuring Tuesday's hearing, Rowe highlighted the failures of communications during the rally, in Butler, saying that information about Crooks was \"siloed\" and \"stuck\" in local law enforcement channels.\n\n\"The only thing we had was that locals were working an issue at the three o'clock - which would have been the former president's right-hand side - which is where the shot came,\" Rowe said. \"Nothing about man on the roof, nothing about man with a gun. None of that information ever made it over our net.\"\n\nHomeland Security Committee Chairman Gary Peters said that local law enforcement has claimed they were \"only able to call in to a state command center\" and not able to easily communicate threats to the Secret Service.\n\nBut Peters also noted that Abbate testified during the hearing that \"there was about 30 seconds between when the local law enforcement reported that there was a man on the roof with a gun\" and when the shooter began firing.\n\n\"If it's communicated directly to a counter-sniper team, would that be enough time to react prior to the firing of those shots?\" Peters asked.\n\n\"If we'd had that information, they would have been able to address it more quickly,\" Rowe replied. \"It appears that that information was stuck or siloed in that local channel.\"\n\n\"It is troubling to me that we did not get that information as quickly as we should have,\" he said. \"We didn't know that there was this incident going on.\"\n\nCrooks was killed within 15.5 seconds of the first shot, Rowe said.\n\nCounter-drone system could have prevented the attack\n\nRowe confirmed that the reason a counter-drone system was not deployed at the Butler rally earlier in the day was because of connectivity issues.\n\n\"On this day in particular, because of the connectivity challenge ... there was a delay,\" he said. Crooks flew his own drone around the area two hours before Trump took the stage.\n\nThe issue has \"cost me a lot of sleep,\" Rowe said. \"What if we would have geolocated him because that counter (unmanned aircraft system) platform would have been up.\"\n\nRowe said that had the system been up, law enforcement may have been able to see Crooks' use of his own drone and approached him well before the shooting.\n\nMoving forward, Rowe said, his agency will use drones to help better secure future events.\n\n\"It is clear to me that other protective enhancements could have strengthened our security at the Butler event,\" he told lawmakers. \"As such, I have directed the expanded use of unmanned aerial systems at protective sites to help detect threats on roofs and other elevated threats.\"\n\nThe acting director also said that the Secret Service will now work with the Department of Homeland Security to set up their own, private connection and not rely on public domain connections.\n\nRowe points fingers at local law enforcement\n\nAs lawmakers pressed Rowe for answers on what went wrong earlier this month, the interim Secret Service director sought to shirk some of the responsibility for the security lapses, partially blaming the issues on the local law enforcement officers with whom they were working.\n\nMoving forward, Rowe told the committees, his agency will avoid assuming local law enforcement agencies are fully capable of fulfilling their role in protecting an event.\n\n\"We assumed that the state and locals had it,\" Rowe said of the area where Crooks climbed up the side of a building near the rally with his rifle.\n\n\"We made an assumption,\" he said, explaining that the Secret Service believed there would be sufficient eyes to cover the area and that local law enforcement would have a counter sniper in the AGR building where Crooks took his position.\n\nRowe told the lawmakers that local law enforcement was positioned in a nearby building and should have had a clear line of sight of Crooks on the roof.\n\n\"I cannot understand why there was not better coverage or at least somebody looking at that roofline when that's where they were posted,\" Rowe said, noting that a local sniper team could have looked from their post and seen the would-be assassin.\n\n\"Looking left, why was the assailant not seen?\" Rowe asked of the local team, as he showed lawmakers photographs of the roofs snipers were positioned on.\n\n\"I'm not saying that they should have neutralized him, but if they'd have held their post and looked left maybe...\" Rowe said later, though he was quickly cut off by an unrelated comment.\n\nShouting matches over firings and Biden v. Trump resources\n\nSeveral senators lambasted Rowe for not firing any members in his agency and over the amount of security provided to former President Trump compared to President Joe Biden.\n\nIn one such exchange, Rowe loudly objected to Sen. Josh Hawley's persistent questions about why individuals weren't fired in recent weeks.\n\n\"I will not rush to judgment. People will be held accountable,\" Rowe said, adding that investigations into the failures that day are ongoing.\n\nThe Missouri Republican responded: \"Is it not prima facie that somebody has failed? The former president was shot.\"\n\n\"Sir, this could have been our Texas School Book Depository,\" Rowe responded, referring to the 1963 assassination of President John F. Kennedy in Dallas. \"I have lost sleep over that for the last 17 days, just like you have.\"\n\n\"Then fire somebody,\" Hawley shouted, to which Rowe replied: \"We have to be able to have a proper investigation into this.\"\n\nAt another point during Tuesday's hearing, Republican Sen. Ted Cruz repeatedly pressed Rowe on why Trump doesn't receive the same security level as Biden.\n\n\"There is a difference between the sitting president of the United States,\" Rowe said.\n\n\"Then what's the difference,\" Cruz yelled, cutting Rowe off.\n\n\"The difference - national command authority to launch a nuclear strike, sir,\" Rowe responded. \"There are other assets that travel with the president that the former president will not get.\"\n\nCrooks' online presence\n\nInvestigators have uncovered a social media account with posts espousing political violence that may be connected to the would-be Trump assassin, Abbate said.\n\nOfficials have repeatedly said that they have struggled to understand what the 20-year-old shooter's motive was, and that they are combing his online presence for more information.\n\n\"Something just very recently uncovered that I want to share is a social media account, which is believed to be associated with this with the shooter - in about the 2019, 2020 timeframe,\" Abbate said.\n\nOn that account, \"there were over 700 comments,\" Abbate said, which, \"if ultimately attributable to the shooter, appear to reflect antisemitic and anti-immigration themes, to espouse political violence, and are described as extreme in nature.\"\n\nCNN has learned the account is on the YouTube platform.\n\nA separate account on the platform Gab - which was made years earlier - appears to have \"differing points of view,\" Abbate added.\n\nGab CEO Andrew Tobra revealed last week that the would-be assassin may have had an account on the site, which is an alternative social media network popular with conservatives, the alt-right and some extremists. Tobra claimed that the account in question was \"pro-Biden.\"\n\nThe Gab account has also not been conclusively connected to Crooks.\n\nThis story has been updated with additional developments.\n\nThe-CNN-Wire\n\n\u2122 & \u00a9 2024 Cable News Network, Inc., a Warner Bros.

Rowe says he recently traveled to the Pennsylvania shooting site and says what he saw made him ashamed.\n\nRowe is being joined by FBI Deputy Director Paul Abbate at a joint hearing of the Senate committees on the Judiciary and Homeland Security.\n\nThe FBI's No. 2 official says a social media account believed to be associated with the gunman suspected in the assassination attempt espoused political violence and included antisemitic and anti-immigrant sentiment.

Lindsey Graham, the top Republican on the Senate Judiciary Committee. \"And if a lot of people are not fired, the system failed yet again.\n\nHe added: \"Nothing's going to change until somebody loses their job.\"\n\nThe hearing comes one day after the FBI released new details about its investigation into the shooting, revealing that the gunman had looked online for information about mass shootings, power plants, improvised explosive devices and the May assassination attempt of the Slovakian prime minister.\n\nListen now and subscribe: Apple Podcasts | Google Podcasts | Spotify | RSS Feed | SoundStack | All Of Our Podcasts\n\nThe FBI also said that Trump, the 2024 Republican presidential nominee, has agreed to be interviewed by agents as a crime victim. The bureau said last week that the former president had been struck in the ear by a bullet or fragment of one. Trump said Monday evening that he expected that interview to take place on Thursday.\n\nBut most of the questions Tuesday are expected to be directed at Rowe as lawmakers demand answers about how Crooks was able to get so close to Trump. Investigators believe Crooks fired eight shots in Trump's direction from an AR-style rifle after scaling the roof of a building of some 135 meters (147 yards) from where Trump was speaking in Butler, Pennsylvania.\n\nOne rallygoer was killed, and two others were injured. Crooks was shot dead by a Secret Service counter-sniper.\n\nAt her hearing last week, Cheatle said the Secret Service had \"failed\" in its mission to protect Trump. She called the attempt on Trump's life the Secret Service's \"most significant operational failure\" in decades and vowed to \"move heaven and earth\" to get to the bottom of what went wrong and make sure there's no repeat of it.\n\nPhotos: Trump injured, 2 killed in shooting at rally\n\nCheatle acknowledged that the Secret Service was told about a suspicious person two to five times before the shooting at the rally. She also revealed that the roof from which Crooks opened fire had been identified as a potential vulnerability days before the rally.\n\nCheatle said she apologized to Trump in a phone call after the assassination attempt.\n\nIn a Monday night interview on Fox News Channel, Trump defended the Secret Service agents who protected him from the shooting but said that someone should have been on the roof with Crooks and that there should have been better communication with local police.\n\n\"They didn't speak to each other,\" he said.\n\nHe praised the sniper who killed Crooks with what he said was an amazing shot but noted: \"It would have been good if it was nine seconds sooner.\"\n\n0 Comments Love 0 Funny 0 Wow 0 Sad 0 Angry 0\n\nGet Government & Politics updates in your inbox!\n\nStay

As a career law enforcement officer and a 25-year Secret Service veteran, I cannot defend why that roof was not better secured,\" he said.\n\nThe testimony was the most detailed catalog to date by the Secret Service of law enforcement failings and miscommunications, with Rowe accepting blame for his own agency's mistakes while also pointedly criticizing local law enforcement for communication breakdowns that resulted in his agency not receiving information that a gunman, later identified as 20-year-old Thomas Matthew Crooks, had been seen on the roof of a building less than 150 yards from the rally stage where Trump was speaking.\n\n\"Neither the Secret Service counter sniper teams nor members of the former president's security detail had any knowledge that there was a man on the roof of the building with a firearm,\" Rowe said. \"It is my understanding those personnel were not aware the assailant had a firearm until they heard gunshots.\"\n\nHe said that the shooting amounted to a \"failure on multiple levels,\" including a failure of imagination and a \"failure to challenge our assumptions.\"\n\n\"We assumed that the state and locals had it,\" Rowe said. \"We made an assumption that there was going to be uniformed presence out there, that there would be sufficient eyes to cover that, that there was going to be counter-sniper teams\" in the building from whose roof Crooks fired shots.\n\n\"And I can assure you,\" Rowe added, \"that we're not going to make that mistake again.\"\n\nHe said he had implemented multiple reforms since taking over as acting director last week, including mandating that every event security plan is vetted by multiple experienced supervisors before being implemented, expanding the use of aerial drones to improve visibility of roofs, dedicating more resources to improve communications at events where the Secret Service is operating. He said he's also directed that federal and local counter snipers work together on roofs.\n\nTrump, the 2024 Republican presidential nominee, was struck in the ear by a bullet or a bullet fragment in the assassination attempt, one rallygoer was killed and two others were injured before the gunman was killed by a Secret Service counter-sniper.\n\nThe blunt and at times emotional testimony Tuesday, featuring combative exchanges with lawmakers, ensured that an already simmering blame game between federal and local authorities will continue. It also suggested that Rowe, with ready and generally detailed answers, was determined to strike a different posture than that of his predecessor, Kimberly Cheatle, who resigned last week after facing intense criticism from lawmakers from both major political parties following responses at a congressional hearing that were seen as evasive and lacking in specifics.\n\nTuesday's hearing before the Senate Judiciary and Homeland Security committees was the latest in a series of congressional sessions dedicated to the law enforcement lapses and missed communications that preceded the shooting.\n\nLocal law enforcement officers had first observed a suspicious-looking man at the rally site more than an hour before the event and circulated that information, including photographs of a man who turned out to be Crooks. But the officers ultimately lost track of Crooks, who was able to scale the roof of a building at AGR International Inc., a supplier of automation equipment for the glass and plastic packaging industry, and fire an estimated eight shots with an AR-15-style rife.\n\nShortly before the shooting, a local officer climbed up to the roof to investigate. Crooks turned and pointed his rifle at the officer, who retreated.\n\nEven though text messages among local snipers revealed anxiety about the man, Rowe said the only thing the Secret Service knew at the time of the shooting was that law enforcement was contending with a suspicious-looking man.\n\n\"No information regarding a weapon on a roof was ever passed to our personnel,\" Rowe said. At another point, he noted, \"It is troubling to me that we did not get that information as quickly as we should have. We didn't know that there was this incident going on.\"\n\nBut Rowe's willingness to assign blame to local law enforcement opened him up to harsh criticism from Senate Republicans, who saw him as failing to take sufficient responsibility.\n\n\"Isn't the fact that a former president was shot, that a good American is dead, that other Americans were critically wounded -- isn't that enough mission failure for you to say to the person who decided that that building should not be in the security perimeter, probably ought to be stepped down?\" said Sen. Josh Hawley, a Missouri Republican.\n\nRowe, raising his voice, responded that he has \"lost sleep over this for the last 17 days\" and that he would not be rushed \"to judgment\" by Congress. He assured lawmakers that \"people will be held accountable.\"", "source": {"uri": "virginislandsdailynews.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Virgin Islands Daily News"}, "authors": [{"uri":

A day later, she did just that.\n\nHere are the takeaways from Tuesday's joint hearing:\n\n'Siloed' information about Crooks' presence\n\nDuring Tuesday's hearing, Rowe highlighted the failures of communications during the rally, in Butler, saying that information about Crooks was \"siloed\" and \"stuck\" in local law enforcement channels.\n\n\"The only thing we had was that locals were working an issue at the three o'clock - which would have been the former president's right-hand side - which is where the shot came,\" Rowe said. \"Nothing about man on the roof, nothing about man with a gun. None of that information ever made it over our net.\"\n\nHomeland Security Committee Chairman Gary Peters said that local law enforcement has claimed they were \"only able to call in to a state command center\" and not able to easily communicate threats to the Secret Service.\n\nBut Peters also noted that Abbate testified during the hearing that \"there was about 30 seconds between when the local law enforcement reported that there was a man on the roof with a gun\" and when the shooter began firing.\n\n\"If it's communicated directly to a counter-sniper team, would that be enough time to react prior to the firing of those shots?\" Peters asked.\n\n\"If we'd had that information, they would have been able to address it more quickly,\" Rowe replied. \"It appears that that information was stuck or siloed in that local channel.\"\n\n\"It is troubling to me that we did not get that information as quickly as we should have,\" he said. \"We didn't know that there was this incident going on.\"\n\nCrooks was killed within 15.5 seconds of the first shot, Rowe said.\n\nCounter-drone system could have prevented the attack\n\nRowe confirmed that the reason a counter-drone system was not deployed at the Butler rally earlier in the day was because of connectivity issues.\n\n\"On this day in particular, because of the connectivity challenge ... there was a delay,\" he said. Crooks flew his own drone around the area two hours before Trump took the stage.\n\nThe issue has \"cost me a lot of sleep,\" Rowe said. \"What if we would have geolocated him because that counter (unmanned aircraft system) platform would have been up.\"\n\nRowe said that had the system been up, law enforcement may have been able to see Crooks' use of his own drone and approached him well before the shooting.\n\nMoving forward, Rowe said, his agency will use drones to help better secure future events.\n\n\"It is clear to me that other protective enhancements could have strengthened our security at the Butler event,\" he told lawmakers. \"As such, I have directed the expanded use of unmanned aerial systems at protective sites to help detect threats on roofs and other elevated threats.\"\n\nThe acting director also said that the Secret Service will now work with the Department of Homeland Security to set up their own, private connection and not rely on public domain connections.\n\nRowe points fingers at local law enforcement\n\nAs lawmakers pressed Rowe for answers on what went wrong earlier this month, the interim Secret Service director sought to shirk some of the responsibility for the security lapses, partially blaming the issues on the local law enforcement officers with whom they were working.\n\nMoving forward, Rowe told the committees, his agency will avoid assuming local law enforcement agencies are fully capable of fulfilling their role in protecting an event.\n\n\"We assumed that the state and locals had it,\" Rowe said of the area where Crooks climbed up the side of a building near the rally with his rifle.\n\n\"We made an assumption,\" he said, explaining that the Secret Service believed there would be sufficient eyes to cover the area and that local law enforcement would have a counter sniper in the AGR building where Crooks took his position.\n\nRowe told the lawmakers that local law enforcement was positioned in a nearby building and should have had a clear line of sight of Crooks on the roof.\n\n\"I cannot understand why there was not better coverage or at least somebody looking at that roofline when that's where they were posted,\" Rowe said, noting that a local sniper team could have looked from their post and seen the would-be assassin.\n\n\"Looking left, why was the assailant not seen?\" Rowe asked of the local team, as he showed lawmakers photographs of the roofs snipers were positioned on.\n\n\"I'm not saying that they should have neutralized him, but if they'd have held their post and looked left maybe...\" Rowe said later, though he was quickly cut off by an unrelated comment.\n\nShouting matches over firings and Biden v. Trump resources\n\nSeveral senators lambasted Rowe for not firing any members in his agency and over the amount of security provided to former President Trump compared to President Joe Biden.\n\nIn one such exchange, Rowe loudly objected to Sen. Josh Hawley's persistent questions about why individuals weren't fired in recent weeks.\n\n\"I will not rush to judgment. People will be held accountable,\" Rowe said, adding that investigations into the failures that day are ongoing.\n\nThe Missouri Republican responded: \"Is it not prima facie that somebody has failed? The former president was shot.\"\n\n\"Sir, this could have been our Texas School Book Depository,\" Rowe responded, referring to the 1963 assassination of President John F. Kennedy in Dallas. \"I have lost sleep over that for the last 17 days, just like you have.\"\n\n\"Then fire somebody,\" Hawley shouted, to which Rowe replied: \"We have to be able to have a proper investigation into this.\"\n\nAt another point during Tuesday's hearing, Republican Sen. Ted Cruz repeatedly pressed Rowe on why Trump doesn't receive the same security level as Biden.\n\n\"There is a difference between the sitting president of the United States,\" Rowe said.\n\n\"Then what's the difference,\" Cruz yelled, cutting Rowe off.\n\n\"The difference - national command authority to launch a nuclear strike, sir,\" Rowe responded. \"There are other assets that travel with the president that the former president will not get.\"\n\nCrooks' online presence\n\nInvestigators have uncovered a social media account with posts espousing political violence that may be connected to the would-be Donald Trump assassin, Abbate said.\n\nOfficials have repeatedly said that they have struggled to understand what the 20-year-old shooter's motive was, and that they are combing his online presence for more information.\n\n\"Something just very recently uncovered that I want to share is a social media account, which is believed to be associated with this with the shooter - in about the 2019, 2020 timeframe,\" Abbate said.\n\nOn that account, \"there were over 700 comments,\" Abbate said, which, \"if ultimately attributable to the shooter, appear to reflect antisemitic and anti-immigration themes, to espouse political violence, and are described as extreme in nature.\"\n\nA separate account on the platform Gab - which was made years earlier - appears to have \"differing points of view,\" Abbate added.\n\nGab CEO Andrew Tobra revealed last week that the would-be assassin may have had an account on the site, which is an alternative social media network popular with conservatives, the alt-right and some extremists. Tobra claimed that the account in question was \"pro-Biden.\"\n\nThe Gab account has also not been conclusively connected to Crooks.\n\nThe-CNN-Wire\n\n\u2122 & \u00a9 2024 Cable News Network, Inc., a Warner Bros.

Lindsey Graham, the top Republican on the Senate Judiciary Committee. \"And if a lot of people are not fired, the system failed yet again.\n\nHe added: \"Nothing's going to change until somebody loses their job.\"\n\nThe hearing comes one day after the FBI released new details about its investigation into the shooting, revealing that the gunman had looked online for information about mass shootings, power plants, improvised explosive devices and the May assassination attempt of the Slovakian prime minister.\n\nThe FBI also said that Trump, the 2024 Republican presidential nominee, has agreed to be interviewed by agents as a crime victim. The bureau said last week that the former president had been struck in the ear by a bullet or fragment of one. Trump said Monday evening that he expected that interview to take place on Thursday.\n\nBut most of the questions Tuesday are expected to be directed at Rowe as lawmakers demand answers about how Crooks was able to get so close to Trump. Investigators believe Crooks fired eight shots in Trump's direction from an AR-style rifle after scaling the roof of a building of some 135 meters (147 yards) from where Trump was speaking in Butler, Pennsylvania.\n\nOne rallygoer was killed, and two others were injured. Crooks was shot dead by a Secret Service counter-sniper.\n\nAt her hearing last week, Cheatle said the Secret Service had \"failed\" in its mission to protect Trump. She called the attempt on Trump's life the Secret Service's \"most significant operational failure\" in decades and vowed to \"move heaven and earth\" to get to the bottom of what went wrong and make sure there's no repeat of it.\n\nPhotos: Trump injured, 2 killed in shooting at rally\n\nCheatle acknowledged that the Secret Service was told about a suspicious person two to five times before the shooting at the rally. She also revealed that the roof from which Crooks opened fire had been identified as a potential vulnerability days before the rally.\n\nCheatle said she apologized to Trump in a phone call after the assassination attempt.\n\nIn a Monday night interview on Fox News Channel, Trump defended the Secret Service agents who protected him from the shooting but said that someone should have been on the roof with Crooks and that there should have been better communication with local police.\n\n\"They didn't speak to each other,\" he said.\n\nHe praised the sniper who killed Crooks with what he said was an amazing shot but noted: \"It would have been good if it was nine seconds sooner.\"\n\n0 Comments Love 0 Funny 0 Wow 0 Sad 0 Angry 0\n\nBe the first to know\n\nGet local news delivered to your

Josh Hawley pressed acting Secret Service director Ronald Rowe on why no one had been fired for the security breach at Donald Trump's Butler, Pa. rally yet.\n\nOn July 13 Thomas Crooks fired eight rounds toward Trump from a nearby unsecured rooftop, killing firefighter veteran Corey Comperatore, critically injuring two and grazing Trump with a bullet in his ear.\n\nActing Director Rowe and Deputy FBI Director Paul Abbate testified in a rare joint Senate hearing on Tuesday, after a disastrous hearing last week with Secret Service Director Kimberly Cheatle prompted her resignation.\n\nThey faced rounds of questioning on why Trump had been allowed to take the stage despite Crooks being identified as a suspicious person a full 90 minutes before he fired any shots.\n\n'Has the person who decided, who made the decision to send Donald Trump on stage knowing that you had a security situation. Has that person been relieved of duty?' Hawley, R-Mo., asked.\n\n'No sir they haven't,' said Rowe.\n\n'Has the person who decided not to pull the former president off of stage when you knew that in your words, the locals were working a serious security situation? Has that person been relieved of duty?'\n\n'No, sir. Again, I refer you back to my original answer that we are investigating this through a mission assurance -- ' Rowe said.\n\n' -- What more do you need to investigate? To know exactly what you need to investigate to know the failures that something ought to be held accountable? What more do you need to know?' Hawley interjected.\n\n'You're asking me, Senator, to completely make a rush to judgment about somebody failing. I acknowledge this was a failure,' Rowe went on.\n\n'Sir, this could have been our Texas School Book Depository,' he said, in reference to the building from which Lee Harvey Oswald fatally shot President John F. Kennedy.\n\n'I have lost sleep over that for the last 17 days. I will tell you Senator, that I will not rush a judgment, that people will be held accountable, and I will do so with integrity and not rush to judgment and put people unfairly persecuted. We have to be able to have a proper investigation into this.'\n\nIn another fraught moment Sen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas, asked Rowe whether Trump's team had been given the same amount of protection resources as a comparable Biden event.\n\n'You're using president a way that it's not clear. Is it your testimony that in Butler Pennsylvania, Donald Trump had the same number of agents protecting him that Joe Biden has at a comparable event?\n\n'You asked me senator and I'm trying to answer it.'\n\n'You are not answering it. Is it the same number of agents or not?' Cruz went on.\n\n'There is a difference between the sitting President of the United States,' Rowe shot back. 'What's the difference?'\n\n'The difference is an actual authority to launch a nuclear strike,' said Rowe.\n\nBut Rowe confusingly also said that Trump had the same number of agents surrounding him as Joe Biden has, a 'full shift.'\n\nRowe admitted he had no defense as for why the rooftop where Thomas Matthew Crooks fired shots toward former President Trump was left open.\n\nCrooks fired eight rounds toward Trump from a nearby unsecured rooftop, killing firefighter veteran Corey Comperatore, critically injuring two and grazing Trump with a bullet in his ear.\n\n'I went to the roof of the AGR building where the assailant fired shots, and I laid in a prone position to evaluate his line of sight. What I saw made me ashamed as a career law enforcement officer and a 25 year veteran with the Secret Service. I cannot defend why that roof was not better secured,' he told Congress on Tuesday.\n\n'When I laid in that position I could not, will not understand why there was not better coverage or at least somebody looking at that roof line when that's where they were posted,' Rowe said, noting that Crooks' head would have been clearly visible from the unmanned rooftop.\n\nCheatle had been criticized for not visiting the rally site prior to her hearing on Capitol Hill last week, which prompted her resignation.\n\nThirty seconds before Crooks fired his shots, local law enforcement had radioed to Secret Service warning about a man with a rifle on the roof. Around three and a half minutes before that, he'd been 'observed on the roof.'\n\nLaw enforcement 'should've been on that roof and the fact that they were in the building is something that I'm still trying to understand,' Rowe said when Sen. Josh Hawley, R-Mo., pressed him on whistleblower reports that law enforcement was supposed to be stationed on the roof but was not up there because it was 'too hot.'\n\nAbbate revealed that the FBI had identified a social media account they believed belonged to the shooter\n\n'In about the 2019, 2020 time frame, there were over 700 comments posted from this account. Some of these comments, if ultimately attributable to the shooter, appear to reflect anti-Semitic and anti-immigrant themes to espouse political violence and are described as extreme in nature,' Abbate said.\n\nRowe said that since the shooting he'd implemented a number of changes at the Secret Service, including having security plans go through multiple supervisors before implementation, expanded use of drones, more resources for protective site communications and 'expeditious' approval of requests for personnel at protective sites with heightened security environments.\n\nRowe and Abbate spoke to the Judiciary and Homeland Security committees after their boss, Cheatle submitted her resignation last week after a six-hour-long hearing where Republicans and Democrats accused her of stonewalling.\n\nIn his opening statement the Homeland Security Committee's top Republican Rand Paul revealed that local law enforcement had told his office they'd warned the Secret Service about the vulnerabilities of the rooftop where Thomas Matthew Crooks fired shots at the president.\n\n'Local law enforcement told my staff that they specifically flagged the vulnerability of the building to the Secret Service, and were told that it would be taken care of. Clearly, these vulnerabilities were not addressed.'\n\nJudiciary Chairman Dick Durbin, D-Ill., asked why more action wasn't taken when Crooks was seen to be holding a range finder 30 minutes before the shooting.\n\n'I thought I had read that it was a golf range finder. Nonetheless, it still would have provided him the ability to provide the distance that he was away from his intended target.'\n\nIn another heated moment, Sen. Josh Hawley, R-Mo., pressed Rowe on why no one had been fired for the security breach yet.\n\n'Has the Person who decided, who made the decision to send Donald Trump on stage knowing that you had a security situation. Has that person been relieved of duty?' Hawley asked.\n\n'No sir they haven't,' said Rowe.\n\n'Has the person who decided not to pull the former president off of stage when you knew that in your work the locals were working a serious security situation? Has that person been relieved of duty?'\n\n'No, sir. Again, I refer you back to my original answer that we are investigating this through a mission assurance -- ' Rowe said.\n\n' -- What more do you need to investigate? To know exactly what you need to investigate to know the failures that something ought to be held accountable? What more do you need to know?' Hawley interjected.\n\n'What I need to know is exactly what happened ... I will not rush to judgment. People will be held accountable and I will do so with integrity, and not rush to judgment and put people like unfairly persecuted.'\n\nOn Monday new text messages revealed local law enforcement officers working former President Donald Trump's Butler, Pennsylvania, rally were severely understaffed ahead of the attempted assassination.\n\nDuring the tragic rally, Trump was shot in the ear and a former volunteer firefighter lost his life after 20-year-old Thomas Matthew Crooks opened fire from the roof of a nearby building just outside the security perimeter.\n\nBombshell new text messages between the Beaver County emergency services team from the days leading up to the rally show that there was a staffing shortage.\n\nOn July 8, five days before the rally, an unnamed team leader officer wrote in a text chat that they had been 'requested by Butler to assist' with Trump's rally and needed six people to step up for the 12-hour detail. Two offered to do so for the whole time, and two more offered to split the Saturday shift.\n\nThe law enforcement leader wrote in the thread that he only had a few people available to work the event because 'everyone else is either working, on vacation or hurt.'\n\nThe never-seen-before messages also lay out a timeline of nearly 90 minutes from between the identification of Crooks and his deadly fire.\n\nNew messages, bodycam footage and law enforcement debrief were obtained by Sen. Chuck Grassley, R-Iowa, who is conducting oversight of the event.\n\nThe messages showed that law enforcement were aware of Crooks, whom they spotted more than an hour and a half before Trump took the stage.\n\nAt 4:26 p.m., a Beaver County sniper finished his shift and departed the AGR building, where Crooks was able to access and take his shots from.\n\nAs the sniper left the building, he texted a chain about a suspicious person he'd spotted - which turned out to be Crooks.\n\n'Someone followed our lead and snuck in and parked by our cars just so you know,' read one message.\n\n'I'm just letting you know because you see me go out with my rifle and put it in my car so he knows you guys are up there.'\n\nThe officer noted that he was sitting at a picnic table 'about 50 yards from the exit.'\n\n'That bike was not there when I pulled out. Maybe have them check that car,' they went on.\n\nLater on, officers exchanged photos of Crooks, who had then been marked a 'suspicious person,' at 5:38 p.m., over 30 minutes before Trump was shot.\n\n'Kid learning (sic) around building we are in. I did see him with a range finder looking towards stage. FYI. If you wanna notify SS snipers to look out.\n\nAnother officer asked what direction Crooks was headed, to which an unnamed officer replied, 'if I had to guess toward the back. Away from the event.'\n\nIt comes after a whistleblower last week revealed Secret Service stood in the way of using drone technology to survey the scene of the Butler rally where an assassin tried to shoot former President Donald Trump.\n\nHawley revealed last week that one whistleblower had told his office the night before the rally Secret Service 'repeatedly denied offers from a local law enforcement partner to utilize drone technology to secure the rally.'\n\nThe whistleblower alleged that after the shooting Secret Service 'changed course and asked the local partner to deploy the drone technology to surveil the site in the aftermath.'", "source": {"uri": "internewscast.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Internewscast Journal"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Law_enforcement", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Law enforcement"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Biden", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ted_Cruz", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Ted Cruz"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Senate", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "United States Senate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Secret_Service", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "United States Secret Service"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Josh_Hawley", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Josh Hawley"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Butler,_Pennsylvania", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Butler, Pennsylvania"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Butler, Pennsylvania"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republican_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Republican Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Firefighter", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Firefighter"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kimberly_Cheatle", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Kimberly Cheatle"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_Abbate", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Paul Abbate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Texas_School_Book_Depository", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Texas School Book Depository"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lee_Harvey_Oswald", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Lee Harvey Oswald"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Director_of_the_Federal_Bureau_of_Investigation", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Director of the Federal Bureau of Investigation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_F._Kennedy", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "John F.

All the Secret Service knew was that local law enforcement was handling a \"suspicious\" person nearby, he said.\n\nNational Review details Rowe's testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee and Senate Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee alongside FBI deputy director Paul Abbate. In his opening statement, Rowe promised the Secret Service will increase vetting of event security plans, expand the use of unmanned drones, streamline law enforcement communications, maximize personnel at protective sites, and discipline the individuals who failed to secure the Trump rally after the mistakes have been thoroughly investigated.\n\nMore than 90 minutes before the shooting, local law enforcement first identified Crooks at a picnic table outside of the nearby American Glass Research building, according to newly released text messages. Crooks was deemed a \"suspicious\" person and law enforcement knew he had a rangefinder to assess his distance from the stage Trump stood on.\n\nOn July 13, Crooks fired eight shots into the crowd of the Trump rally in Butler, Pa., wounding Trump and two others, and killing former fire chief Corey Comperatore. A Secret Service counter-sniper killed Crooks seconds after he fired the shots.\n\nBefore Crooks fired eight shots into the crowd, the Secret Service did not know he was on the rooftop with a weapon, Rowe testified. All the Secret Service knew was that local law enforcement was handling a \"suspicious\" person nearby, he said.\n\nLocal law enforcement sent Secret Service a picture of Crooks a half hour before the shooting, but they did not receive any information about him possessing a weapon.\n\nAmong the information given in his testimony, Rowe said the communication breakdown between different law enforcement channels prevented the Secret Service from receiving the information sooner.\n\nIn the future, he said, Secret Service will gain access to the communications channels used by local law enforcement partners. Law enforcement used text message chats and radio to make decisions at the rally, and Secret Service failed to record agents's radio communications that day.\n\nAnother hinderance to the Secret Service's communications was the poor phone service at the Butler rally, Rowe said. The lack of bandwidth delayed the Secret Service's deployment of drones, and prevented them from detecting the drone Crooks flew around the perimeter of the rally at roughly 3:51 p.m. on the day of the shooting. Rowe said he will be trying to set up a wifi system to ensure the Secret Service will have a connection at future events.\n\nRowe could not explain how Crooks was able to fly his drone but the Secret Service could not, and he expressed regret for the agency's choice to decline local law enforcement's offer to fly drones overhead.", "source": {"uri": "saraacarter.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Sara A.

Josh Hawley (R-MO) and Ted Cruz (R-TX), the exchange of information between acting Secret Service Director Ronald Rowe and FBI Deputy Director Paul Abbate and senators was conversational and filled with details, a contrast to the lackluster testimony given by former Secret Service Director Kimberly Cheatle before the House Oversight Committee.\n\nA clear detail coming out of the hearing on Tuesday was a lack of communication between local and federal law enforcement agencies that allowed Thomas Matthew Crooks, 20, to access a nearby building with an AR-15 rifle and fire shots at the former president and rally attendees.\n\nSecret Service personnel were not aware of shooter until gunshots were heard\n\nRowe said on Tuesday that neither the Secret Service countersniper teams nor members of Trump's security detail had \"any knowledge\" there was a shooter with a gun on the roof.\n\n\"It is my understanding those personnel were not aware the assailant had a firearm until they heard gunshots,\" Rowe said.\n\nAbbate said that approximately 25 minutes prior to the shooting, the U.S. Secret Service command post was \"notified of a suspicious person.\"\n\nSen. Mike Lee (R-UT) took issue with the fact that there were several minutes during which Trump could have been removed from the stage or prevented from going on. Rowe explained that the Secret Service was only aware of a suspicious person and that the presence of a gun was not communicated to them, so there was not an immediate threat relayed to them that would have prevented the former president from taking the stage.\n\nRowe added that the Secret Service had no communication \"beyond suspicious person\" and that there were other suspicious people reports during the rally.\n\nAbbate said that at 6:11:03 p.m., local law enforcement had spotted Crooks with a gun. Rowe said that information did not make it over to the Secret Service.\n\nRowe said he regretted that information was not passed from the Secret Service to Congress and the public sooner. The lack of detail was the main reason that Cheatle's testimony before the House Oversight Committee was deemed \"unacceptable\" and a failure to hold the agency accountable.\n\nBoth agencies are still investigating how Crooks was able to access the roof with an AR-15. FBI footage found that Crooks had a backpack where they believe he kept the firearm, but Abbate could not say whether the rifle had been disassembled or not.\n\nRowe said he is also aware that two local Pennsylvania countersnipers were posted in a nearby building that would have assumingly given them a clear shot of Crooks.\n\n\"There were two-man kind of sniper teams from the locals that were in that AGR building,\" Rowe said, adding that he could not speak to reports that they \"deserted\" their post.\n\nHowever, the acting director said, \"It seems to me that if even one of them left, there should have been remaining -- some additional eyes left in that building.\"\n\nRowe said he would submit in writing once he learned the nature of the countersnipers leaving their post.\n\nHawley and Rowe argue over firings now or later\n\nHawley blasted Rowe for the fact that no one had been fired or relieved of duty due to the security failures and lack of coverage of the building where Crooks shot at the crowd.\n\nHawley said he had a problem with the idea that some Secret Service agents, including those who were in charge of placing personnel on buildings and sending Trump onto the stage to begin the rally, were still holding a job.\n\n\"Isn't the fact that a former president was shot, that a good American is dead, that other Americans were critically wounded, isn't that enough mission failure for you to say that the person who decided that that building should not be in a security perimeter probably ought to be stepped down?\" Hawley said.\n\n\"My question is, why don't you relieve everybody of duty who made bad judgment?\" Hawley added.\n\nRowe explained that he did not want to \"zero in\" and fire individual people without a full investigation taking place, which Hawley disagreed with.\n\n\"What more do you need to investigate to know that they were critical enough failures that some individuals ought to be held accountable?\" Hawley said heatedly. \"I mean, what more do you need to know?\"\n\n\"You're asking me, Senator, to completely make a rush to judgment about somebody failing,\" Rowe responded. \"I acknowledge this was a failure. ... I will tell you that I will not rush to judgment, that people will be held accountable, and I will do so with integrity and not rush to judgment and put people unfairly persecuted -- \"\n\n\"Unfairly persecuted? We have people that are dead,\" Hawley interrupted.\n\nOther senators more calmly suggested that personnel needed to be let go in response to the shooting.\n\n\"Somebody's gotta be fired,\" Senate Judiciary Committee ranking member Lindsey Graham (R-SC) said. \"Nothing's going to change until someone loses their job.\"\n\nSen. Richard Blumenthal (D-CT) agreed with Graham later in the hearing, arguing people need to lose their jobs \"to send a message that this massive intelligence and surveillance failure, as well as the enforcement failure, cries out for accountability.\"\n\nRowe explains changes to Secret Service protocol\n\nSeveral recommendations and changes have already been suggested or made in the 17 days since the shooting, Rowe said.\n\nRowe said the Secret Service is committed to changing its radio communication systems so that it can be connected to local and federal law enforcement. The task typically does not occur for one-day events, he said, as it takes several days to complete due to technical problems that make it hard to connect federal systems with local frequencies.\n\nHe also said the agency will be connecting with the Homeland Security Department to obtain more connectivity resources so the agents do not need to rely on public domains, another aspect that Rowe said led to communication problems.\n\nFeatured Local Savings\n\nRowe told the senators that typically, radio transmissions between agents are not recorded outside of Washington, D.C., and stops for the sitting president and vice president. He said he would make sure all communications are recorded from here out after some senators asked whether the discussions between law enforcement officers and agents regarding Crooks were preserved.\n\nHe said that when working with local law enforcement, both federal and local teams need to have their sniper teams working and standing by for any threats. Rowe said multiple times that while offering respect to the work of local police, there was a \"failure of imagination\" that the local law enforcement had handled security thoroughly at the Butler rally.\n\nRowe also said a laser range finder, which Crooks had in his possession when officials marked him as a suspicious person, would be added to the list of prohibited items.\n\nWhen speaking with Sen. Marsha Blackburn (R-TN) about disgruntled countersnipers and other agents, Rowe said he is \"committed to being a change agent\" regarding the culture of the Secret Service.\n\nRepublicans take issue with pushback on requests to interview Secret Service agents\n\nGraham, along with Sen. Ron Johnson (R-WI), pressed Rowe on why requests for the committee to interview 13 Secret Service agents have gone unfulfilled.\n\nRowe said the 13 people are in the process of, if not already, interviewing with the FBI regarding the events of the assassination attempt. Johnson asked for transcribed interviews.\n\n\"Because memories are short, they can be influenced by events,\" Johnson said. \"We need these transcribed interviews as soon as possible.\"\n\nHomeland Security Committee Chairman Gary Peters (D-MI) asked Rowe to commit to having the agents available for interviews in a matter of days, to which the acting director agreed.\n\n\"We now need to speak with Secret Service agents directly, who are directly involved, and I would say that you need to make them available as soon as possible,\" Peters said. \"Those interviews can't start weeks from now or months from now. Time is of the essence when memories are fresh and you can get the information that is most important to us.\"\n\nSecret Service dismisses claim that additional security for Trump was denied\n\nMany Republican senators focused on whether security details and other provisions were denied to Trump, a claim that several news outlets have reported on but the Secret Service has repeatedly said is false.\n\nCruz asked Rowe whether the Secret Service lied in its statement.\n\n\"If you're talking about Butler, Pennsylvania, all assets requested were approved,\" Rowe said. \"If you're talking about the media reporting of assets requested, there were times when assets were unavailable and not able to be filled, and those gaps were staffed with state and local law enforcement tactical assets.\"\n\nRowe also denied that security detail was transferred from Trump to first lady Jill Biden on the day of the assassination attempt. Cruz and Rowe got into a heated exchange when Rowe could not provide the number of agents assigned to Trump compared to those assigned to President Joe Biden and Jill Biden. Rowe attempted to tell Cruz that the numbers are different for a sitting administration but got cut off by Cruz.\n\n\"Stop interrupting me,\" Cruz said. \"You are refusing to answer clear and direct questions. I am asking the relative difference in the number of agents between those assigned to Donald Trump and those assigned to Joe Biden.\"\n\n\"Senator, I will get you that number so you can see it with your own eyes,\" Rowe responded.\n\nRowe confirmed to Sen. Thom Tillis (R-NC) that he would get a chronology of requests made and whether they were accepted or denied.\n\nFBI says shooter flip-flopped on political views on social media\n\nAbbate said a social media account that the agency believes may belong to Crooks reflected \"antisemitic and anti-immigration themes.\" This was a new piece of information revealed at the beginning of the hearing, and Abbate said he did not want to elaborate as the FBI continues its investigation.\n\nThe FBI deputy director told senators that over 700 comments were posted from an account the agency believes belonged to Crooks in the \"2019-2020 time frame.\"\n\n\"Some of these comments, if ultimately attributable to the shooter, appear to reflect antisemitic and anti-immigration themes to espouse political violence and are described as extreme in nature,\" Abbate said.\n\nBlackburn later pointed to a Gab account believed to belong to Crooks in 2021 that portrayed \"pro-immigration, pro-lockdown, leftist views.\"\n\n\"We're still working to certify and verify that that's his account also, but it does have differing points of view, it would appear,\" Abbate said.\n\nSenate atmosphere less theatric compared to House hearing last week\n\nThe Senate joint hearing took place with less theatrics and expletives than were present at the House hearing last week despite the outbursts from Hawley and Cruz. Many senators on both sides of the aisle thanked Abbate and Rowe for their service and cooperation and asked calm questions without interruption.\n\nThe person showing the most emotion during the hearing was Rowe.\n\nRowe became frustrated at his own agency multiple times during the hearing while answering questions from both Republicans and Democrats. He referenced several photos of the building that Crooks was able to access without law enforcement knowledge.\n\nCLICK HERE TO READ MORE FROM THE WASHINGTON EXAMINER\n\n\"This is from the AGR building. This point of view is the point of view where the countersniper team locally was posted. The gold arrow indicates where the shooter fired from, looking left,\" Rowe said with clear emotion in his voice. \"Why was the assailant not seen?\"\n\nRowe said he visited the building where Crooks shot at Trump and rally attendees, saying he \"cannot defend why that roof was not better secured.\"", "source": {"uri": "gazette.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Colorado Springs Gazette"},

What I saw made me ashamed,\" Rowe told a joint meeting of the Senate Judiciary and Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs committees.\n\n\"As a career law enforcement officer and a 25-year veteran with the Secret Service, I cannot defend why that roof was not better secured to prevent similar lapses from occurring in the future,\" said Rowe, who took his position after Secret Service Director Kimberly Cheatle resigned last week.\n\nAt another turn, he called the lack of preparedness \"a failure of imagination, a failure to imagine that we actually do live in a very dangerous world where people do actually harm to our protectees...I think it was a failure to challenge our own assumptions.\"\n\nIt was a marked difference from Cheatle, who resigned a day after a disastrous appearance before the House Oversight and Accountability Committee in which she was largely on the defensive, declining to answer numerous questions about the shooting.\n\nRowe, in comparison, appeared well prepared for the over three-hour hearing, spending ample time walking through the details of the attack and the numerous turns at which the agency failed to respond to shooter Thomas Matthew Crooks, who was killed at the scene.\n\nIn one exchange, he revealed that the Secret Service never received a warning from local police that the shooter was armed 30 seconds before Trump was shot due to local police not being linked to the agency's radio network.\n\nHe later expressed regret over the agency's failure to launch their own drones to survey the site at 3 p.m. as planned. The drones were delayed until 5 p.m. due to cell network issues. Federal officials have said Crooks used a drone to survey the site hours before the rally.\n\n\"I have no explanation for it. It is something that I feel as though we could have perhaps found him. We could have maybe stopped him. Maybe on that particular day, he would have decided this isn't the day to do it, because law enforcement just found me flying my drone,\" Rowe told lawmakers during the hearing.\n\n\"People fly drones all the time on the peripheries of our sites, and we go out and we talk to them and we ascertain what their intentions are.\"\n\nRowe also revealed that communication gaps between Secret Service agents and local law enforcement personnel helped lead to the security lapse, as agents did not hear radio warnings about the shooter being armed until it was too late.\n\nLocal police had radioed that Crooks was on the roof with a rifle 30 seconds before shots were fired at Trump, but \"none of that information ever made it over our [network],\" Rowe said.\n\n\"If we'd had that information, [agents] would have been able to address it more quickly,\" he said. \"That information was stuck or siloed in that state and local channel.\"\n\nHe said he has already ordered changes in how the agency prepares for future events, including an expanded use of drones to help protect from threats on roofs and elsewhere and better communications between the Secret Service and state and local partners.\n\n\"To prevent similar lapses from occurring in the future, I directed our personnel to ensure every event site security plan is thoroughly vetted by multiple experienced supervisors before it is implemented,\" he noted. \"It is clear to me that other protective enhancements could have strengthened our security at the Butler event site.\"\n\nIn addition, range finders will be barred at future events, given that Crooks was spotted with such a device ahead of Trump's speech, arousing suspicion with local police.\n\n\"Currently it is not on the list of prohibited items, but we're going to make that change,\" Rowe said.\n\nAt another point in the hearing,it was announced that the FBI uncovered a social media account believed to be associated with Crooks that contained antisemitic and anti-immigration ideas.\n\n\"Some of these comments, if ultimately attributable to the shooter, appear to reflect antisemitic and anti-immigration themes, to espouse political violence and are described as extreme in nature,\" said FBI Deputy Director Paul Abbate, who testified alongside Rowe.\n\nWhile the hearing represented a turnaround for the Secret Service in many ways, it was not fireworks free, particularly in two back-to-back heated exchanges with GOP Sens. Josh Hawley (Mo.) and Ted Cruz (Texas).\n\nThough numerous lawmakers questioned why the service has yet to fire any agents, Hawley appeared to agitate Rowe.\n\n\"Isn't the fact that a former president was shot, that a good American is dead, that other Americans were critically wounded -- isn't that enough mission failure for you to say that the person who decided that building should not be in the security perimeter probably ought to be stepped down?\" Hawley said, referencing the AGR building Crooks fired from.\n\nBut Rowe resisted the calls to immediately fire personnel in the midst of an investigation, saying \"we need to allow the investigation to play out.\"\n\n\"I want to be neutral and make sure that we get to the bottom of it and interview everybody in order to determine if there was more than one person who perhaps exercised bad judgment,\" Rowe said, adding he did not want to \"zero in on one or two individuals.\"\n\nHawley shot back, \"You've been on the job a few days so far. You've fired nobody.\"\n\nAt one point in the exchange, Rowe became emotional.\n\n\"I have lost sleep over that for the last 17 days, just like you have, and I will tell you, senator, that I will not rush to judgment, that people will be held accountable, and I will do so with integrity and not rush to judgment and put people [out there to be] unfairly persecuted,\" Rowe said.\n\nGOP lawmakers, however, are unlikely to let up on the agency before any punishments are enacted, with Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.) at the top of the hearing summing up the mindset best: \"Somebody's got to be fired. Nothing's going to change until somebody loses their job.\"", "source": {"uri": "thehill.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Hill"}, "authors": [{"uri": "ellen_mitchell@thehill.com", "name": "Ellen Mitchell", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}, {"uri": "rebecca_beitsch@thehill.com", "name": "Rebecca Beitsch", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Secret_Service", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "United States Secret Service"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unmanned_aerial_vehicle", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Unmanned aerial vehicle"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kimberly_Cheatle", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Kimberly Cheatle"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Law_enforcement_officer", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Law enforcement officer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Senate_Committee_on_Homeland_Security_and_Governmental_Affairs", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States Senate Committee on Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Law_enforcement", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Law enforcement"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assassination", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Assassination"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Judiciary", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Judiciary"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Congress", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States Congress"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republican_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Republican Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Opposition_to_immigration", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Opposition to immigration"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antisemitism", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Antisemitism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Senate", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United States Senate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Bureau_of_Investigation", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Federal Bureau of Investigation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rifle", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Rifle"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Josh_Hawley", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Josh Hawley"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_Abbate", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Paul Abbate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lindsey_Graham", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Lindsey Graham"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Political_violence", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Political violence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ted_Cruz", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Ted Cruz"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fireworks", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Fireworks"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_media", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Social media"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Texas", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Texas"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Texas"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Business_Services/Fire_and_Security", "label": "dmoz/Business/Business Services/Fire and Security", "wgt": 17}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Security", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Security", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Water_Sports/Rowing", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Water Sports/Rowing", "wgt": 29}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Conditions_and_Diseases/Communication_Disorders", "label": "dmoz/Health/Conditions and Diseases/Communication Disorders", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 79}], "image": "https://thehill.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/07/roweronald_secretservice_073024_AP.jpg?strip=1&w=640", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9772518", "eventUri": "eng-9772518", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-07-13", "textStart": 503, "textEnd": 510}], "sentiment": -0.2549019607843137, "wgt": 185, "relevance": 1}

Lindsey Graham, the top Republican on the Senate Judiciary Committee. \"And if a lot of people are not fired, the system failed yet again.\n\nHe added: \"Nothing's going to change until somebody loses their job.\"\n\nThe hearing comes one day after the FBI released new details about its investigation into the shooting, revealing that the gunman had looked online for information about mass shootings, power plants, improvised explosive devices and the May assassination attempt of the Slovakian prime minister.\n\nListen now and subscribe: Apple Podcasts | Google Podcasts | Spotify | RSS Feed | SoundStack | All Of Our Podcasts\n\nThe FBI also said that Trump, the 2024 Republican presidential nominee, has agreed to be interviewed by agents as a crime victim. The bureau said last week that the former president had been struck in the ear by a bullet or fragment of one. Trump said Monday evening that he expected that interview to take place on Thursday.\n\nBut most of the questions Tuesday are expected to be directed at Rowe as lawmakers demand answers about how Crooks was able to get so close to Trump. Investigators believe Crooks fired eight shots in Trump's direction from an AR-style rifle after scaling the roof of a building of some 135 meters (147 yards) from where Trump was speaking in Butler, Pennsylvania.\n\nOne rallygoer was killed, and two others were injured. Crooks was shot dead by a Secret Service counter-sniper.\n\nAt her hearing last week, Cheatle said the Secret Service had \"failed\" in its mission to protect Trump. She called the attempt on Trump's life the Secret Service's \"most significant operational failure\" in decades and vowed to \"move heaven and earth\" to get to the bottom of what went wrong and make sure there's no repeat of it.\n\nPhotos: Trump injured, 2 killed in shooting at rally\n\nCheatle acknowledged that the Secret Service was told about a suspicious person two to five times before the shooting at the rally. She also revealed that the roof from which Crooks opened fire had been identified as a potential vulnerability days before the rally.\n\nCheatle said she apologized to Trump in a phone call after the assassination attempt.\n\nIn a Monday night interview on Fox News Channel, Trump defended the Secret Service agents who protected him from the shooting but said that someone should have been on the roof with Crooks and that there should have been better communication with local police.\n\n\"They didn't speak to each other,\" he said.\n\nHe praised the sniper who killed Crooks with what he said was an amazing shot but noted: \"It would have been good if it was nine seconds sooner.\"\n\nLove 0 Funny 0 Wow 0 Sad 0 Angry 0\n\nGet Government & Politics updates in your inbox!\n\nStay up-to-date

Sign in You are logged in Switch accounts\n\n\"What I saw made me ashamed. As a career law enforcement officer and a 25-year Secret Service veteran, I cannot defend why that roof was not better secured,\" he said.\n\nARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW\n\nThe testimony was the most detailed catalog to date by the Secret Service of law enforcement failings and miscommunications, with Rowe accepting blame for his own agency's mistakes while also pointedly criticizing local law enforcement for communication breakdowns that resulted in his agency not sharing information that a gunman, later identified as 20-year-old Thomas Matthew Crooks, had been spotted on the roof of a building less than 150 yards (135 meters) from the rally stage where Trump was speaking.\n\n\"Neither the Secret Service counter sniper teams nor members of the former president's security detail had any knowledge that there was a man on the roof of the building with a firearm,\" Rowe said. \"It is my understanding those personnel were not aware the assailant had a firearm until they heard gunshots.\"\n\nHe said that the shooting amounted to a \"failure on multiple levels,\" including a failure of imagination and a \"failure to challenge our assumptions.\"\n\n\"We assumed that the state and locals had it,\" Rowe said. \"We made an assumption that there was going to be uniformed presence out there, that there would be sufficient eyes to cover that, that there was going to be counter-sniper teams\" in the building from whose roof Crooks fired shots.\n\n\"And I can assure you,\" Rowe added, \"that we're not going to make that mistake again.\"\n\nARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW ARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW\n\nHe said he had implemented multiple reforms since taking over as acting director last week, including mandating that every event security plan is vetted by multiple experienced supervisors before being implemented, expanding the use of aerial drones to improve visibility of roofs and dedicating more resources to improve communications at events where the Secret Service is operating.\n\nTrump, the 2024 Republican presidential nominee, was struck in the ear by a bullet or a bullet fragment in the assassination attempt, one rallygoer was killed and two others were injured before the gunman was killed by a Secret Service counter-sniper.\n\nThe blunt and at times emotional testimony Tuesday, featuring combative exchanges with lawmakers, ensured that an already simmering blame game between federal and local authorities will continue. It also suggested that Rowe, with ready and generally detailed answers, was determined to strike a different posture than that of his predecessor, Kimberly Cheatle, who resigned last week after facing intense criticism from lawmakers from both major political parties following responses at a congressional hearing that were seen as evasive and lacking in specifics.\n\nTuesday's hearing before the Senate Judiciary and Homeland Security committees was the latest in a series of congressional sessions dedicated to the law enforcement lapses and missed communications that preceded the shooting.\n\nLocal law enforcement officers had first observed a suspicious-looking man at the rally site more than an hour before the event and circulated that information, including photographs of a man who turned out to be Crooks. But the officers ultimately lost track of Crooks, who was able to scale the roof of a building at AGR International Inc., a supplier of automation equipment for the glass and plastic packaging industry, and fire an estimated eight shots with an AR-15-style rife.\n\nARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW ARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW\n\nShortly before the shooting, a local officer climbed up to the roof to investigate. Crooks turned and pointed his rifle at the officer, who retreated.\n\nEven though text messages among local snipers revealed anxiety about the man, Rowe said the only thing the Secret Service knew at the time of the shooting was that law enforcement was contending with a suspicious-looking man.\n\n\"No information regarding a weapon on a roof was ever passed to our personnel,\" Rowe said. At another point, he noted, \"It is troubling to me that we did not get that information as quickly as we should have. We didn't know that there was this incident going on.\"\n\nBut Rowe's willingness to assign blame to local law enforcement opened him up to harsh criticism from Senate Republicans, who saw him as failing to take sufficient responsibility.\n\n\"Isn't the fact that a former president was shot, that a good American is dead, that other Americans were critically wounded -- isn't that enough mission failure for you to say to the person who decided that that building should not be in the security perimeter, probably ought to be stepped down?\" said Sen. Josh Hawley, a Missouri Republican.\n\nARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW ARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW\n\nRowe, raising his voice, responded that he has \"lost sleep over this for the last 17 days\" and that he would not be rushed \"to judgment\" by Congress. He assured lawmakers that \"people will be held accountable.\"\n\nSen. Lindsey Graham, the top Republican on the Senate Judiciary Committee, said if something like this happened in the military, \"a lot of people would be fired. And if a lot of people are not fired, the system failed yet again.\"\n\nHe added: \"Nothing's going to change until somebody loses their job.\"\n\nThe FBI, meanwhile, disclosed new details about Crooks, with Deputy Director Paul Abbate saying a social media account believed to be associated with the gunman suspected in the assassination attempt espoused political violence and included antisemitic and anti-immigrant sentiment. The posts were from the 2019-2020 timeframe, when Crooks would have been in high school.\n\nAbbate did not identify the social media platform, saying investigators were still trying to definitively determine that it belonged to Crooks. However, he indicated that it was separate from an account on a different platform called Gab that was active in 2021.\n\nThe chief executive of Gab posted on X, formerly known as Twitter, during the Senate hearing that Crooks's presence on that platform was consistent with being \"pro-Biden and in particular pro-Biden's immigration policy.\"\n\nOn Monday, the FBI revealed that Crooks had looked online for information about mass shootings, power plants, improvised explosive devices and the May assassination attempt of the Slovakian prime minister Robert Fico.\n\nThe FBI also said that Trump has agreed to be interviewed by agents as a crime victim.", "source": {"uri": "thepeterboroughexaminer.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "thepeterboroughexaminer.com"}, "authors": [{"uri":

Josh Hawley (R-MO) and Ted Cruz (R-TX), the exchange of information between Acting Secret Service Director Ronald Rowe and FBI Deputy Director Paul Abbate and senators were conversational and filled with details, a contrast to the lackluster testimony given by former Secret Service Director Kimberly Cheatle before the House Oversight Committee.\n\nA clear detail coming out of the hearing on Tuesday was a lack of communication between local and federal law enforcement agencies that allowed Thomas Matthew Crooks, 20, to access a nearby building with an AR-15 rifle and fire shots at the former president and rally attendees.\n\nRowe said on Tuesday that neither the Secret Service counter-sniper teams nor members of Trump's security detail had \"any knowledge\" that there was a shooter with a gun on the roof.\n\n\"It is my understanding those personnel were not aware the assailant had a firearm until they heard gunshots,\" Rowe said.\n\nAbbate said that approximately 25 minutes prior to the shooting, the U.S. Secret Service command post was \"notified of a suspicious person.\"\n\nSen. Mike Lee (R-UT) took issue with the fact that there were several minutes during which Trump could have been removed from the stage or prevented from going on. Rowe explained that the Secret Service was only aware of a suspicious person and the presence of a gun was not communicated to them, so there was not an immediate threat relayed to them that would have prevented the former president from taking the stage.\n\nRowe added that the Secret Service had no communication \"beyond suspicious person\" and there were other suspicious people reports during the duration of the rally.\n\nAbbate said that at 6:11:03 p.m., local law enforcement had spotted Crooks with a gun. Rowe said that information did not make it over to the Secret Service.\n\nRowe said he regretted that information was not passed from the Secret Service to Congress and the public sooner. The lack of detail was the main reason that Cheatle's testimony before the House Oversight Committee was deemed \"unacceptable\" and a failure to hold the agency accountable.\n\nBoth agencies are still investigating how Crooks was able to access the roof with an AR-15. FBI footage found that Crooks had a backpack where they believe he kept the firearm, but Abbate could not say whether the rifle had been disassembled or not.\n\nRowe said he is also aware that two local Pennsylvania counter-snipers were posted in a nearby building that would have assumingly given them a clear shot of Crooks.\n\n\"There were two-man kind of sniper teams from the locals that were in that AGR building,\" Rowe said, adding that he could not speak to reports that they \"deserted\" their post.\n\nHowever, the acting director said, \"It seems to me, that if even one of them left, there should have been remaining -- some additional eyes left in that building.\"\n\nRowe said he would submit in writing once he learned the nature of the counter-snipers leaving their post.\n\nSens. Josh Hawley (R-MO) blasted Rowe for the fact that no one had been fired or relieved of duty due to the security failures and lack of coverage of the building where Crooks shot at the crowd.\n\nHawley said he had a problem with the idea that some Secret Service agents, including those who were in charge of placing personnel on buildings and sending Trump onto the stage to begin the rally, were still holding a job.\n\n\"Isn't the fact that a former president was shot, that a good American is dead, that other Americans were critically wounded, isn't that enough mission failure for you to say that the person who decided that that building should not be in a security perimeter probably ought to be stepped down?\" Hawley said.\n\n\"My question is, why don't you relieve everybody of duty who made bad judgment?\" Hawley added.\n\nRowe explained that he did not want to \"zero in\" and fire individual people without a full investigation taking place, which Hawley disagreed with.\n\n\"What more do you need to investigate to know that they were critical enough failures that some individuals ought to be held accountable?\" Hawley said heatedly. \"I mean, what more do you need to know?\"\n\n\"You're asking me, Senator, to completely make a rush to judgment about somebody failing,\" Rowe responded. \"I acknowledge this was a failure...I will tell you that I will not rush to judgment, that people will be held accountable, and I will do so with integrity and not rush to judgment and put people unfairly persecuted -- \"\n\n\"Unfairly persecuted? We have people that are dead,\" Hawley interrupted.\n\nOther senators more calmly suggested that personnel needed to be let go in response to the shooting.\n\n\"Somebody's gotta be fired,\" Senate Judiciary Committee ranking member Lindsey Graham (R-SC) said. \"Nothing's going to change until someone loses their job.\"\n\nSen. Richard Blumenthal (D-CT) agreed with Graham later in the hearing, arguing people need to lose their jobs \"to send a message that this massive intelligence and surveillance failure, as well as the enforcement failure, cries out for accountability.\"\n\nA number of recommendations and changes have already been suggested or made in the 17 days since the shooting, Rowe said.\n\nRowe said the Secret Service is committed to changing their radio communication systems so that they can be connected to both local and federal law enforcement. The task typically does not occur for one-day events, he said, as takes several days to complete due to technical issues that make it hard to connect federal systems with local frequencies.\n\nHe also said the agency will be connecting with the Homeland Security Department to obtain more connectivity resources so the agents do not need to rely on public domains, another aspect that Rowe said led to communication issues.\n\nRowe told the senators that typically, radio transmissions between agents are not recorded outside of Washington, D.C., and stops for the sitting president and vice president. He said he would make sure all communications are recorded from here out after some senators asked whether the discussions between law enforcement officers and agents regarding Crooks were preserved.\n\nWhen working with local law enforcement, he said both federal and local teams need to have their sniper teams working and standing by for any threats. Rowe said multiple times that, while offering respect to the work of local police, there was a \"failure of imagination\" that the local law enforcement had handled security thoroughly at the Butler rally.\n\nRowe also said that a laser range finder, which Crooks had in his possession when officials marked him as a suspicious person, would be added to the list of prohibited items moving forward.\n\nWhen speaking with Sen. Marsha Blackburn (R-TN) about disgruntled counter-snipers and other agents, Rowe said he is \"committed to being a change agent\" regarding the culture of the Secret Service, as well.\n\nGraham, along with Sen. Ron Johnson (R-OH), pressed Rowe on why requests for the committee to interview 13 Secret Service agents have gone unfulfilled.\n\nRowe said the 13 individuals are in the process of, if not already, interviewing with the FBI regarding the events of the assassination attempt. Johnson asked for transcribed interviews.\n\n\"Because memories are short, they can be influenced by events,\" Johnson said. \"We need these transcribed interviews as soon as possible.\"\n\nHomeland Security Committee Chairman Gary Peters (D-MI) asked Rowe to commit to having the agents available for interviews in a manner of days, to which the acting director agreed.\n\n\"We now need to speak with Secret Service agents directly, who are directly involved, and I would say that you need to make them available as soon as possible,\" Peters said. \"Those interviews can't start weeks from now or months from now. Time is of the essence, when memories are fresh and you can get the information that is most important to us.\"\n\nMany Republican senators focused on whether security details and other provisions were denied to Trump, a claim that several news outlets have reported on but the Secret Service has repeatedly said is false.\n\nSen. Ted Cruz (R-TX) asked Rowe whether the Secret Service lied in their statement.\n\n\"If you're talking about Butler, Pennsylvania, all assets requested were approved,\" Rowe said.\"If you're talking about the media reporting of assets requested, there were times when assets were unavailable and not able to be filled, and those gaps were staffed with state and local law enforcement tactical assets.\"\n\nRowe also denied that security detail was transferred from Trump to first lady Jill Biden on the day of the assassination attempt. Cruz and Rowe got into a heated exchange when Rowe could not provide the number of agents assigned to Trump compared to those assigned to President Joe Biden and Jill Biden. Rowe attempted to tell Cruz that the numbers are different for a sitting administration but got cut off by Cruz.\n\n\"Stop interrupting me,\" Cruz said. \"You are refusing to answer clear and direct questions. I am asking the relative difference in the number of agents between those assigned to Donald Trump and those assigned to Joe Biden.\"\n\n\"Senator, I will get you that number so you can see it with your own eyes,\" Rowe responded.\n\nRowe confirmed to Sen. Thom Tillis (R-NC) that he would get a chronology of requests made and whether they were accepted or denied.\n\nAbbate said a social media account that the agency believes may belong to Crooks reflected \"antisemitic and anti-immigration themes.\" This was a new piece of information revealed at the beginning of the hearing, and Abbate said he did not want to elaborate as the FBI continues its investigation.\n\nThe FBI deputy director told senators that over 700 comments were posted from an account the agency believes belonged to Crooks in the \"2019-2020 timeframe.\"\n\n\"Some of these comments, if ultimately attributable to the shooter, appear to reflect antisemitic and anti-immigration themes to espouse political violence and are described as extreme in nature,\" Abbate said.\n\nBlackburn later pointed to a Gab account believed to belong to Crooks in 2021 that portrayed \"pro-immigration, pro-lockdown, leftist views.\"\n\n\"We're still working to certify and verify that that's his account also, but it does have differing points of view, it would appear,\" Abbate said.\n\nThe Senate joint hearing took place with less theatrics and expletives that were present at the House hearing last week, despite the outbursts from Hawley and Cruz. Many senators on both sides of the aisle thanked Abbate and Rowe for their service and cooperation and asked calm questions without interruption.\n\nThe individual showing the most emotion during the hearing was Rowe.\n\nRowe became frustrated at his own agency multiple times during the hearing while answering questions from both Republicans and Democrats. He referenced several photos of the building that Crooks was able to access without law enforcement knowledge.\n\nCLICK HERE TO READ MORE FROM THE WASHINGTON EXAMINER\n\n\"This is from the AGR building. This point of view is the point of view where the countersniper team locally was posted. The gold arrow indicates where the shooter fired from, looking left,\" Rowe said with clear emotion in his voice. \"Why was the assailant not seen?\"\n\nRowe said he visited the building where Crooks shot at Trump and rally attendees, saying he \"cannot defend why that roof was not better secured.\"", "source": {"uri": "washingtonexaminer.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Washington Examiner"},

Rowe says he recently traveled to the Pennsylvania shooting site and says what he saw made him ashamed.\n\nRowe is being joined by FBI Deputy Director Paul Abbate at a joint hearing of the Senate committees on the Judiciary and Homeland Security.\n\nThe FBI's No. 2 official says a social media account believed to be associated with the gunman suspected in the assassination attempt espoused political violence and included antisemitic and anti-immigrant sentiment. The posts were from the 2019 and 2020 timeframe, when the shooter, Thomas Matthew Crooks, would have been in high school.\n\nPeople are also reading...

Lindsey Graham, the top Republican on the Senate Judiciary Committee. \"And if a lot of people are not fired, the system failed yet again.\n\nHe added: \"Nothing's going to change until somebody loses their job.\"\n\nThe hearing comes one day after the FBI released new details about its investigation into the shooting, revealing that the gunman had looked online for information about mass shootings, power plants, improvised explosive devices and the May assassination attempt of the Slovakian prime minister.\n\nListen now and subscribe: Apple Podcasts | Google Podcasts | Spotify | RSS Feed | SoundStack | All Of Our Podcasts\n\nThe FBI also said that Trump, the 2024 Republican presidential nominee, has agreed to be interviewed by agents as a crime victim. The bureau said last week that the former president had been struck in the ear by a bullet or fragment of one. Trump said Monday evening that he expected that interview to take place on Thursday.\n\nBut most of the questions Tuesday are expected to be directed at Rowe as lawmakers demand answers about how Crooks was able to get so close to Trump. Investigators believe Crooks fired eight shots in Trump's direction from an AR-style rifle after scaling the roof of a building of some 135 meters (147 yards) from where Trump was speaking in Butler, Pennsylvania.\n\nOne rallygoer was killed, and two others were injured. Crooks was shot dead by a Secret Service counter-sniper.\n\nAt her hearing last week, Cheatle said the Secret Service had \"failed\" in its mission to protect Trump. She called the attempt on Trump's life the Secret Service's \"most significant operational failure\" in decades and vowed to \"move heaven and earth\" to get to the bottom of what went wrong and make sure there's no repeat of it.\n\nPhotos: Trump injured, 2 killed in shooting at rally\n\nCheatle acknowledged that the Secret Service was told about a suspicious person two to five times before the shooting at the rally. She also revealed that the roof from which Crooks opened fire had been identified as a potential vulnerability days before the rally.\n\nCheatle said she apologized to Trump in a phone call after the assassination attempt.\n\nIn a Monday night interview on Fox News Channel, Trump defended the Secret Service agents who protected him from the shooting but said that someone should have been on the roof with Crooks and that there should have been better communication with local police.\n\n\"They didn't speak to each other,\" he said.\n\nHe praised the sniper who killed Crooks with what he said was an amazing shot but noted: \"It would have been good if it was nine seconds sooner.\"\n\nGet Government & Politics updates in your inbox!\n\nStay up-to-date on the latest in local and national

Officials have also confirmed, after the FBI director's ambiguous comments last week raised questions about what struck Trump, that the former president was hit by a bullet.\n\nRowe told lawmakers he was \"ashamed\" of the protection failures that day and said he visited the site of the shooting as one of his first acts as acting director.\n\n\"I went to the roof of the AGR building where the assailant fired shots and laid in a prone position to evaluate his line of sight. What I saw made me ashamed,\" Rowe said in his opening statement. \"As a career law enforcement officer, and a 25-year veteran with the Secret Service, I cannot defend why that roof was not better secured.\"\n\nHere are some key moments from the hearing.\n\nRowe, who took over as the head of the Secret Service after former director Kim Cheatle's resignation earlier this month, testified that Trump's security detail didn't have \"any knowledge\" there was an attacker on the roof with a gun prior to shots ringing out.\n\n\"It is my understanding those personnel were not aware that the assailant had a firearm until they heard gunshots,\" he said. \"Prior to that, they were operating with the knowledge that local law enforcement was working on issue of a suspicious individual prior to the shots being fired.\"\n\nIn dramatic fashion, he also displayed pictures of where the local sniper team was supposed to be posted and showed images of his agents re-enacting the shooter's position.\n\nRowe also said if they had \"more information\" about the 30 seconds between finding out the shooter had a gun on the roof and him opening fire, they would've been able to address it \"more quickly.\"\n\n\"It appears that that information was stuck or siloed in that state local channel,\" Rowe said.\n\nRowe said that while it was great there was a texting chain, more needs to go \"over the net,\" meaning, there needs to be more radio communication, which apparently there was a lack of during July 13.\n\nRowe was pressed on reports that 20 minutes passed between the time Secret Service snipers first spotted the gunman on a rooftop and the time shots were fired at the former president. Rowe said it was the \"first\" he was hearing of that and to his knowledge it was \"incorrect.\"\n\nAbbate also testified about the timeline, saying approximately 25 minutes prior to the shooting, the Secret Service command post was notified of a suspicious person.\n\nAbbate recently discovered video footage from a local business that shows the shooter getting onto the roof of the building at 6:06 p.m., and he was spotted by local law enforcement at 6:08 p.m. At approximately 6:11 p.m., Abbate said, a local police officer who was \"lifted to the roof by another officer, saw the shooter and radioed that he was armed with a 'long gun.' Within approximately the next 30 second, the shots were fired.\"\n\nThe acting Secret Service director said that if cellular capability was better on July 13, they could've launched a counter drone system sooner and potentially stopped the attack.\n\nIt is \"something that has cost me a lot of sleep because of the eventual outcome of the assailant,\" Rowe said.\n\nRowe said he grappled with circumstances that could have allowed drones to spot the gunman before he opened fire.\n\n\"That what if we ... geo-located him because that counter UAS platform had been up? It is something that I have struggled with to understand,\" he continued. \"I have no explanation for, it is something that I feel as though we could have perhaps found him. We could have maybe stopped him. Maybe on that particular day, he would have decided this isn't the day to do it, because law enforcement just found me flying my drone.\"\n\nThe countering drone system was down for about two hours and went back online at 5 p.m., Rowe testified.\n\nThe gunman flew his own drone near the site hours before the shooting.\n\nThe FBI deputy director said in his opening statement that the investigation remains focused on motive, identifying any potential co-conspirators and building out the timeline of the shooter's actions.\n\n\"Thus far, though absolutely nothing has been ruled out, the investigation has not identified a motive nor any co-conspirators or others with advanced knowledge,\" Abbate said.\n\nAbbate also told Congress that they recently discovered a social media account from 2019 to 2020 that appeared to belong to the shooter, but Abbate couched it as preliminary.\n\n\"There were over 700 comments posted from this account,\" Abbate said. \"Some of these comments, if ultimately attributable to the shooter, appear to reflect antisemitic and anti-immigration themes to espouse political violence and are described as extreme in nature,\" he said.\n\nRowe told lawmakers he is taking \"immediate steps\" to avoid repeating failures at the Trump rally including expanding the use of unmanned aerial systems to check unprotected areas, improving site communications with local partners and increasing the number of security details to address a heightened security environment.\n\nRowe also said he heard the calls for \"accountability\" and noted the Secret Service is reviewing the actions and decision-making of personnel leading up to the rally.\n\n\"If this investigation reveals Secret Service employees violated agency protocols, those employees will be held accountable to our disciplinary process,\" he said.\n\nSenators on both sides of the aisle said there needs to be \"individual accountability\" for who was responsible for what during the shooting.\n\nA particularly heated exchange ensued between Republican Sen. Josh Hawley and Rowe over why certain individuals had not been relieved of duty, with both men raising their voices. In the exchange, Rowe said Hawley was focused on one person rather than a whole investigative failure.\n\n\"Is it not prima facie that somebody has failed? The former president was shot,\" Hawley pressed.\n\nRowe responded: \"Sir, this could have been our Texas School Book Depository. I have lost sleep over that for the last 17 days.\" Rowe was referencing the building that Lee Harvey Oswald was in during the assassination of President John F. Kennedy.\n\n\"Then just fire somebody!\" Hawley exclaimed.\n\n\"I will tell you, senator, that I will not rush to judgment, that people will be held accountable, and I will do so with integrity and not rush to judgment and put people unfairly prosecuted,\" Rowe responded.\n\nSen. John Kennedy pressed Abbate on what struck President Trump.\n\n\"Is there any doubt in your mind or in the collective mind of the FBI that President Trump was shot in the ear by a bullet fired by the assassin?\" Kennedy asked.\n\n\"Senator, there is absolutely no doubt in the FBI's mind whether former President Trump was hit with the with a bullet and wounded in the ear. No doubt. There never has been,\" Abbate said.\n\nLast week, the FBI released a statement also emphasizing that what struck Trump was a \"bullet, whether whole or fragmented into smaller pieces, fired from the deceased subject's rifle.\"\n\nAbbate reiterated Tuesday that it was a bullet \"100%.\"", "source": {"uri": "abc7.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "ABC7"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Secret_Service", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "United States Secret Service"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unmanned_aerial_vehicle", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Unmanned aerial vehicle"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Law_enforcement", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Law enforcement"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sniper", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Sniper"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kimberly_Cheatle", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Kimberly Cheatle"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_Abbate", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Paul Abbate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Law_enforcement_officer", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Law enforcement officer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Attempted_assassination_of_Ronald_Reagan", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Attempted assassination of Ronald Reagan"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Director_of_the_Federal_Bureau_of_Investigation", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Director of the Federal Bureau of Investigation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Firearm", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Firearm"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Senate", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States Senate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Bureau_of_Investigation", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Federal Bureau of Investigation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_media", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Social media"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Butler,_Pennsylvania", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Butler, Pennsylvania"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Butler, Pennsylvania"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radio", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Radio"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Police_officer", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Police officer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Texas_School_Book_Depository", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Texas School Book Depository"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lee_Harvey_Oswald", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Lee Harvey Oswald"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assassination_of_John_F._Kennedy", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Assassination of John F.

It also suggested that Rowe, with ready and detailed answers, was determined to strike a different posture than that of his predecessor, Kimberly Cheatle, who resigned last week after facing intense criticism from lawmakers from both major political parties after responses that were seen as evasive and lacking in specifics.\n\nMuch of Tuesday's hearing before the Senate Judiciary and Homeland Security committees focused on what Rowe suggested was inadequate information received by Secret Service personnel in the hour before the shooting, including that Crooks had been spotted on the roof.\n\nLocal law enforcement officers had spotted a suspicious-looking man pacing near the metal detectors and circulated but ultimately lost track of Crooks before he scaled the roof of a building at AGR International Inc. Shortly before the shooting, a local officer climbed up to the roof to investigate. Crooks turned and pointed his rifle at the officer, who retreated.\n\n\"No information regarding a weapon on a roof was ever passed to our personnel,\" Rowe said. At another point, he noted, \"It is troubling to me that we did not get that information as quickly as we should have. We didn't know that there was this incident going on.\"\n\nBut Rowe's willingness to assign blame to local law enforcement opened him up to harsh criticism from Senate Republicans, who saw him as failing to take responsibility.\n\n\"Isn't it the fact that the former president was shot, that a good American is dead, that other Americans were critically wounded -- isn't that enough mission failure for you to say to the person who decided that that building should not be the security perimeter, probably ought to be stepped down?\" said Sen. Josh Hawley, a Missouri Republican.\n\nRowe, raising his voice, responded that he has \"lost sleep over this for the last 17 days\" and that he would not be rushed \"to judgment\" by Congress, but he assured lawmakers that \"people will be held accountable.\"\n\nSen. Lindsey Graham, the top Republican on the Senate Judiciary Committee, said if something like this happened in the military, \"a lot of people would be fired. And if a lot of people are not fired, the system failed yet again.\"\n\nHe added: \"Nothing's going to change until somebody loses their job.\"\n\nThe FBI, meanwhile, disclosed new details about Crooks, with Deputy Director Paul Abbate saying a social media account believed to be associated with the gunman suspected in the assassination attempt espoused political violence and included antisemitic and anti-immigrant sentiment. The posts were from the 2019 and 2020 timeframe, when Crooks would have been in high school.\n\nOn Monday, the FBI revealed that Crooks had looked online for information about mass shootings, power plants, improvised explosive devices and the May assassination attempt of the Slovakian prime minister.\n\nThe FBI also said that Trump has agreed to be interviewed by agents as a crime victim. Trump, who appeared at events in the days after the shooting with a bandage on his right ear, said he expects the interview to take place on Thursday.\n\nAt Cheatle's hearing last week, she said the Secret Service had \"failed\" in its mission to protect Trump. She called the attempt on Trump's life the Secret Service's \"most significant operational failure\" in decades and vowed to \"move heaven and earth\" to get to the bottom of what went wrong and make sure there's no repeat of it.\n\nCheatle acknowledged that the Secret Service was told about a suspicious person two to five times before the shooting at the rally. She also revealed that the roof from which Crooks opened fire had been identified as a potential vulnerability days before the rally.\n\nIn a Monday night interview on Fox News Channel, Trump defended the Secret Service agents who protected him from the shooting but said that someone should have been on the roof with Crooks and that there should have been better communication with local police.\n\n\"They didn't speak to each other,\" he said.\n\nHe praised the sniper who killed Crooks with what he said was an amazing shot but noted: \"It would have been good if it was nine seconds sooner.\"\n\nGet Government & Politics updates in your inbox!\n\nStay up-to-date on the latest in local and national government and political topics with our newsletter.\n\nSign up! * I understand and

The posts were from the 2019 and 2020 time frame, when the shooter would have been in high school.\n\nU.S. Sen. Lindsey Graham, the top Republican on the Senate Judiciary Committee, said if something like this happened in the military, \"a lot of people would be fired. And if a lot of people are not fired, the system failed yet again.\"\n\nHe added: \"Nothing's going to change until somebody loses their job.\"\n\nThe hearing came a day after the FBI released new details about its investigation into the shooting, revealing that the gunman had looked online for information about mass shootings, power plants, improvised explosive devices and the May assassination attempt of the Slovakian Prime Minister.\n\nThe FBI also said that Trump, the 2024 Republican presidential nominee, has agreed to be interviewed by agents as a crime victim. The Bureau said last week that the former President had been struck in the ear by a bullet or a bullet fragment. Trump, who appeared at events over the next few days with a bandage on his right ear, said he expects the interview to take place on Thursday.\n\nMost of the questions Tuesday were expected to be directed at Rowe as lawmakers demand answers about how the shooter was able to get so close to Trump. Investigators believe the shooter fired eight shots in Trump's direction from an AR-style rifle after scaling the roof of a building of some 135 meters (147 yards) from where Trump was speaking.\n\nOne rallygoer was killed, and two others were injured. The shooter was shot dead by a Secret Service counter-sniper.\n\nAt Cheatle's hearing last week, she said the Secret Service had \"failed\" in its mission to protect Trump. She called the attempt on Trump's life the Secret Service's \"most significant operational failure\" in decades and vowed to \"move heaven and earth\" to get to the bottom of what went wrong and make sure there's no repeat of it.\n\nCheatle acknowledged that the Secret Service was told about a suspicious person two to five times before the shooting at the rally. She also revealed that the roof from which the shooter opened fire had been identified as a potential vulnerability days before the rally.\n\nCheatle said she apologized to Trump in a phone call after the assassination attempt.\n\nIn a Monday night interview on Fox News Channel, Trump defended the Secret Service agents who protected him from the shooting but said that someone should have been on the roof with the shooter and that there should have been better communication with local police.\n\n\"They didn't speak to each other,\" he said.\n\nHe praised the sniper who killed the shooter with what he said was an amazing shot but noted: \"It would have been good if it was nine seconds sooner.\"\n\n___\n\nRepublished with permission of The Associated Press.", "source": {"uri": "floridapolitics.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Florida Politics - Campaigns & Elections.

To prevent similar lapses from occurring in the future, I directed our personnel to ensure every event site security plan is thoroughly vetted by multiple experienced supervisors before it is implemented.\"\n\nImprovements include directing the Secret Service CIO to shore up bandwidth at campaign events with \"redundancies as far as cellular on the ground or additional repeaters,\" Rowe said. He added that counter-drone technology was not deployed and that the Secret Service declined an offer from a state or local agency to operate a surveillance drone at the site. Crooks himself flew a drone on the periphery of the site hours ahead of the shooting, and, had this shown up on a DHS counter-drone system, he would have been singled out for special attention by Secret Service agents.\n\nRowe noted that the use of counter-drone tech is \"a little complex\" and requires layers of approval.\n\n\"State and locals don't necessarily have this ability to do that. It does require coordination with the [Federal Aviation Administration] because it...could impact commercial travel,\" Rowe said.\n\nRadio interoperability with state and local authorities continues to pose challenges for the Secret Service, Rowe said.\n\n\"It's not just about being able to find whatever frequency our local counterparts are on and then just piping it in,\" Rowe said.\n\nCrooks reportedly used a laser-powered golf rangefinder from his sniper position. Rowe told lawmakers that such gear is going to be banned at campaign events in the future.\n\nRowe also said that the Secret Service would begin recording agency radio traffic at campaign events. There's no record of conversations among Secret Service agents from the Butler event. Recordings of communications among state and local law enforcement are currently being used as part of ongoing investigations by the FBI and other agencies.\n\nSocial profiles\n\nAt the same hearing, FBI Deputy Director Paul Abbate revealed that the agency had unearthed a social media account \"believed to be associated with the shooter\" with posts dating back to 2019 and 2020.\n\n\"There were over 700 comments posted from this account. Some of these comments, if ultimately attributable to the shooter, appear to reflect anti-Semitic and anti-immigration themes, espouse political violence, and are extreme in nature,\" Abbate said in his opening statement. He declined to specify the platform in question because the FBI hadn't confirmed the account belonged to Crooks.\n\nSeparately, Crooks may have had an account on the far-right social network Gab, according to an exchange between Abbate and Sen. Marsha Blackburn, R-Tenn., at the hearing.\n\nAbbate said they were still \"awaiting returns from a number of the companies, to include other social media companies as well\" in response to possible social network activity by Crooks.", "source": {"uri": "nextgov.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Nextgov"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ronald_Rowe", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Ronald Rowe"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Attempted_assassination_of_Ronald_Reagan", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Attempted assassination of Ronald Reagan"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Senate", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "United States Senate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Secret_Service", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "United States Secret Service"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thomas_Crooks", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Thomas Crooks"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bandwidth_(computing)", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Bandwidth (computing)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Department_of_Homeland_Security", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "United States Department of Homeland Security"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kimberly_Cheatle", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Kimberly Cheatle"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interoperability", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Interoperability"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Senate_Committee_on_the_Judiciary", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States Senate Committee on the Judiciary"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unmanned_aerial_vehicle", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Unmanned aerial vehicle"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Congress", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States Congress"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Law_enforcement_officer", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Law enforcement officer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_Abbate", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Paul Abbate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gab_(social_network)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Gab (social network)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deputy_Director_of_the_Federal_Bureau_of_Investigation", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Deputy Director of the Federal Bureau of Investigation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marsha_Blackburn", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Marsha Blackburn"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Opposition_to_immigration", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Opposition to immigration"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Law_enforcement", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Law enforcement"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Political_violence", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Political violence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antisemitism", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Antisemitism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Local_government", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Local government"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Business", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Business", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Theft", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Theft", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Fraud", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Fraud", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Government_Operations", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Government Operations", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 72}], "image": "https://cdn.nextgov.com/media/img/cd/2024/07/30/073024_getty_ng_rowe/860x394.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9772518", "eventUri": "eng-9772518", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-07-13", "textStart": 385, "textEnd": 392}], "sentiment": -0.2470588235294118, "wgt": 182, "relevance": 1}

Nothing about a man on the roof. Nothing about a man with a gun.\"\n\nThe acting Secret Service director additionally admitted there were other holes in the security set-up at the rally, specifically citing the agency's inability to put its own drones in the air before the event got underway due to a lack of mobile connectivity.\n\nIt is \"something that has cost me a lot of sleep,\" Rowe said, noting the shooter had flown his own drone over the rally site in the hours before Trump took the stage.\n\n\"I have no explanation for it,\" he said. \"It is something that I feel as though we could have perhaps found him. We could have maybe stopped him.\"\n\n\"Maybe on that particular day he would have decided this isn't the day to do it, because law enforcement just found me flying my drone.\"\n\nRowe even promised lawmakers that the Secret Service would be adding range finders, like the one the shooter was seen carrying, to the list of items prohibited at rallies and other events, going forward.\n\n'People will be held accountable'\n\nDespite the admissions, some lawmakers were not satisfied.\n\n\"My question is, why don't you relieve everybody of duty who made [a] bad judgment?\" asked Missouri Republican Senator Josh Hawley. \"What more do you need to investigate to know that there were critical failures that some individuals should be held accountable?\"\n\n\"This could have been our Texas School Book Depository,\" Rowe responded, referring to the 1963 assassination of U.S. President John F. Kennedy.\n\n\"I have lost sleep over that for the last 17 days,\" Rowe said. \"I will tell you, Senator, that I will not rush to judgment, that people will be held accountable, and I will do so with integrity.\"\n\n'Nothing has been ruled out'\n\nMeanwhile, the FBI's ongoing investigation into the shooter, Thomas Matthew Crooks, has yet to determine why he tried to kill the former president.\n\nFBI Deputy Director Paul Abbate told lawmakers on Tuesday that the bureau has conducted more than 460 interviews but has so far come up empty.\n\n\"The investigation has not identified a motive, nor any coconspirators or others with advance knowledge,\" said Abbate. \"Absolutely nothing has been ruled out.\"\n\nCredit : Voice of America (VOA), Photo Credit : Associated Press (AP)", "source": {"uri": "newdelhitimes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "New Delhi Times"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Law_enforcement", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Law enforcement"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_F._Kennedy", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "John F.

Senators grilled Rowe and Deputy FBI Director Paul Abbate about the events leading to the July 13 attempted assassination of former U.S. President Donald Trump. (Photo by Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images)\n\nWASHINGTON -- When acting Secret Service Director Ronald Rowe Jr. visited the site of the campaign rally where a gunman attempted to assassinate former President Donald Trump, he went up to the roof, lying flat on his stomach, to evaluate the shooter's line of sight that mid-July day.\n\n\"What I saw made me ashamed,\" Rowe told U.S. senators Tuesday. \"As a career law enforcement officer and a 25-year-veteran with the Secret Service, I cannot defend why that roof was not better secured.\"\n\nRowe recounted his trip to Butler, Pennsylvania, which he said took place after being named acting director July 23, at a joint hearing of the Senate Judiciary and Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs committees examining the security failures that led to the assassination attempt. Deputy FBI Director Paul Abbate also testified.\n\nIt was the first Senate hearing on the attempted assassination since a shooter killed one rallygoer, injured two others and shot Trump's ear using an AR-15-style rifle during a campaign event in Butler on July 13. The 20-year-old gunman was killed at the scene.\n\n\"Let me be clear: This was an attack on our democracy,\" said Sen. Gary Peters, chairman of the Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee.\n\n\"Americans should be able to attend a political rally and express their political beliefs without fear of violence, and political candidates for our nation's highest office should be confident that their safety will never be compromised for their service,\" the Michigan Democrat added.\n\nPeters launched a bipartisan investigation into the security failures leading to the assassination attempt alongside ranking Republican Rand Paul of Kentucky. It's one of several congressional inquiries examining the failures of law enforcement that day.\n\nRowe stepped into his post after Kimberly Cheatle resigned as director last week. The day before her resignation, Cheatle testified in front of the House Committee on Oversight and Accountability, where lawmakers on both sides of the aisle berated her over the agency's failures to prevent the attempted assassination of Trump.\n\nFacing heavy criticism, many lawmakers called on Cheatle to resign. House Oversight Chairman James Comer of Kentucky and ranking member Jamie Raskin of Maryland also urged her to step down in a joint letter shortly after that hearing.\n\nRowe said the attempted assassination was \"a failure to imagine that we actually do live in a very dangerous world where people do actually want to do harm to our protectees.\"\n\n\"I think it was a failure to challenge our own assumptions -- the assumptions that we know our partners are going to do everything they can, and they do this every day,\" he added.\n\nSenators sought to uncover what went wrong, what policies are in place to facilitate real-time information sharing between the Secret Service and local law enforcement during an event and whether the Secret Service is developing a security plan for the upcoming Democratic National Convention in Chicago that takes into account what they learned from the July shooting.\n\nNeither the Secret Service counter sniper teams nor members of Trump's security detail \"had any knowledge that there was a man on the roof of the ... building with a firearm,\" according to Rowe.\n\nRowe said \"prior to that, they were operating with the knowledge that local law enforcement was working an issue of a suspicious individual prior to the shots being fired.\"\n\nAbbate noted that despite not having any definitive evidence as to how the gunman got the weapon onto the roof, they believe based on what they have gathered thus far that he likely had the rifle in a backpack.\n\nMeanwhile, Abbate said the FBI uncovered a social media account believed to be associated with the shooter, though they are still working to verify that the account belonged to him.\n\nMore than 700 comments were posted from the social media account \"in about the 2019, 2020 timeframe,\" when the shooter would have been in his mid-teens, and some of the comments \"appear to reflect antisemitic and anti-immigration themes to espouse political violence and are described as extreme in nature,\" Abbate said.\n\nAbbate said though nothing has been ruled out, the FBI's investigation has not identified any motive, co-conspirators or people with advanced knowledge. The FBI has so far held more than 460 interviews, received over 2,000 tips from the public, executed search warrants and seized electronic media.\n\nTuesday's hearing came the day after U.S. House Speaker Mike Johnson and Democratic Leader Hakeem Jeffries announced 13 lawmakers comprising a bipartisan task force to investigate the attempted assassination. The resolution creating the panel requires a final report by mid-December.\n\nRep. Mike Kelly, a Pennsylvania Republican whose district includes Butler, will chair the task force.\n\nRepublican Sen. Chuck Grassley of Iowa and Democratic Sen. Catherine Cortez Masto of Nevada introduced bipartisan legislation last week that would require Senate confirmation of Secret Service directors and limit them to one term of 10 years.", "source":

Sen. Ron Johnson (R-Wis.) objected to the second label, telling Abbate he feared that categorizing the shooting as terrorism would make the investigation \"potentially partisan.\"\n\nWhile taking full responsibility for the incident, Rowe also blamed poor communication with local law enforcement for the security lapse.\n\nLocal law enforcement officers were aware of Crooks' presence at the building for an hour and a half before he opened fire from the rooftop, he said. But, a clearly frustrated Rowe said, the Secret Service was not alerted.\n\n\"The only thing we had was that locals were working an issue at the 3 o'clock -- which would have been the former president's right-hand side -- which is where the shot came. Nothing about 'man on the roof,' nothing about 'man with a gun.' None of that information ever made it over our net,\" Rowe said.\n\n\"We assumed that the state and locals had it,\" he added later, prompting Sen. John Cornyn (R-Texas) to counter: \"Those assumptions can be lethal.\"\n\nCrooks was obscured by the roofline and went unseen by Secret Service snipers until he opened fire. Rowe said the shooter was \"neutralized\" within 15.5 seconds of his first shot.\n\nRowe took over the top job at the agency last week, after former Secret Service Director Kimberly Cheatle resigned following a disastrous appearance before the House oversight and accountability committee.\n\nSenate Judiciary committee Chair Dick Durbin (D-Ill.) opened the hearing by acknowledging how a failure to adequately regulate guns also contributed to the shooting.\n\n\"While we rely on the Secret Service to protect elected officials, we must acknowledge the unique challenges they face in light of the proliferation of weapons of war on our street,\" Durbin said.\n\n\"Pennsylvania, like many states, allows individuals to openly carry a loaded rifle without a permit,\" he said. \"To make matters worse, assault rifles can easily be purchased from the licensed dealers without a background check because of dangerous loopholes in our gun laws.\"", "source": {"uri": "huffpost.com", "dataType":

However, it was never relayed over to us,\" Mr Rowe said.\n\nThe proceedings grew heated when Republican senator Josh Hawley pushed Mr Rowe to begin expelling agency employees immediately.\n\n\"I will tell you, senator ... that people will be held accountable, and I will do so with integrity and not rush to judgement and let people be unfairly persecuted,\" Mr Rowe told Senator Hawley with a raised

While one of the bullets hit Trump in the right ear, another killed one rallygoer and injured two others.\n\n\"Based on what I know right now, neither the Secret Service counter-sniper teams nor members of the former president's security detail had any knowledge that there was a man on the roof of the AGR building with a firearm,\" Rowe told the joint hearing of the two committees.\n\n\"It is my understanding those personnel were not aware the assailant had a firearm until they heard gunshots,\" he revealed. \"Prior to that, they were operating with the knowledge that local law enforcement was working an issue of a suspicious individual prior to the shots being fired.\"\n\nEmphasising that \"what I saw put me to shame\", Roe noted that he cannot explain \"why this roof was not better secured\", despite being a professional law enforcement officer and a 25-year veteran of the Secret Service.\n\nAuthorities are yet to determine Crooks' motive. However, FBI Deputy Director Paul Abate said that a 2019-2020 social media profile seems to be connected to the perpetrator.\n\n\"There were over 700 comments posted by this account.

Lindsey Graham, the top Republican on the Senate Judiciary Committee. \"And if a lot of people are not fired, the system failed yet again.\n\nHe added: \"Nothing's going to change until somebody loses their job.\"\n\nThe hearing comes one day after the FBI released new details about its investigation into the shooting, revealing that the gunman had looked online for information about mass shootings, power plants, improvised explosive devices and the May assassination attempt of the Slovakian prime minister.\n\nListen now and subscribe: Apple Podcasts | Google Podcasts | Spotify | RSS Feed | SoundStack | All Of Our Podcasts\n\nThe FBI also said that Trump, the 2024 Republican presidential nominee, has agreed to be interviewed by agents as a crime victim. The bureau said last week that the former president had been struck in the ear by a bullet or fragment of one. Trump said Monday evening that he expected that interview to take place on Thursday.\n\nBut most of the questions Tuesday are expected to be directed at Rowe as lawmakers demand answers about how Crooks was able to get so close to Trump. Investigators believe Crooks fired eight shots in Trump's direction from an AR-style rifle after scaling the roof of a building of some 135 meters (147 yards) from where Trump was speaking in Butler, Pennsylvania.\n\nOne rallygoer was killed, and two others were injured. Crooks was shot dead by a Secret Service counter-sniper.\n\nAt her hearing last week, Cheatle said the Secret Service had \"failed\" in its mission to protect Trump. She called the attempt on Trump's life the Secret Service's \"most significant operational failure\" in decades and vowed to \"move heaven and earth\" to get to the bottom of what went wrong and make sure there's no repeat of it.\n\nPhotos: Trump injured, 2 killed in shooting at rally\n\nCheatle acknowledged that the Secret Service was told about a suspicious person two to five times before the shooting at the rally. She also revealed that the roof from which Crooks opened fire had been identified as a potential vulnerability days before the rally.\n\nCheatle said she apologized to Trump in a phone call after the assassination attempt.\n\nIn a Monday night interview on Fox News Channel, Trump defended the Secret Service agents who protected him from the shooting but said that someone should have been on the roof with Crooks and that there should have been better communication with local police.\n\n\"They didn't speak to each other,\" he said.\n\nHe praised the sniper who killed Crooks with what he said was an amazing shot but noted: \"It would have been good if it was nine seconds sooner.\"\n\nGet Government & Politics updates in your inbox!\n\nStay up-to-date on the latest in local and national

It also suggested that Rowe, with ready and detailed answers, was determined to strike a different posture than that of his predecessor, Kimberly Cheatle, who resigned last week after facing intense criticism from lawmakers from both major political parties after responses that were seen as evasive and lacking in specifics.\n\nMuch of Tuesday's hearing before the Senate Judiciary and Homeland Security committees focused on what Rowe suggested was inadequate information received by Secret Service personnel in the hour before the shooting, including that Crooks had been spotted on the roof.\n\nLocal law enforcement officers had spotted a suspicious-looking man pacing near the metal detectors and circulated but ultimately lost track of Crooks before he scaled the roof of a building at AGR International Inc. Shortly before the shooting, a local officer climbed up to the roof to investigate. Crooks turned and pointed his rifle at the officer, who retreated.\n\n\"No information regarding a weapon on a roof was ever passed to our personnel,\" Rowe said. At another point, he noted, \"It is troubling to me that we did not get that information as quickly as we should have. We didn't know that there was this incident going on.\"\n\nBut Rowe's willingness to assign blame to local law enforcement opened him up to harsh criticism from Senate Republicans, who saw him as failing to take responsibility.\n\nListen now and subscribe: Apple Podcasts | Google Podcasts | Spotify | RSS Feed | SoundStack | All Of Our Podcasts\n\n\"Isn't it the fact that the former president was shot, that a good American is dead, that other Americans were critically wounded -- isn't that enough mission failure for you to say to the person who decided that that building should not be the security perimeter, probably ought to be stepped down?\" said Sen. Josh Hawley, a Missouri Republican.\n\nRowe, raising his voice, responded that he has \"lost sleep over this for the last 17 days\" and that he would not be rushed \"to judgment\" by Congress, but he assured lawmakers that \"people will be held accountable.\"\n\nSen. Lindsey Graham, the top Republican on the Senate Judiciary Committee, said if something like this happened in the military, \"a lot of people would be fired. And if a lot of people are not fired, the system failed yet again.\"\n\nHe added: \"Nothing's going to change until somebody loses their job.\"\n\nThe FBI, meanwhile, disclosed new details about Crooks, with Deputy Director Paul Abbate saying a social media account believed to be associated with the gunman suspected in the assassination attempt espoused political violence and included antisemitic and anti-immigrant sentiment. The posts were from the 2019 and 2020 timeframe, when Crooks would have been in high school.\n\nOn Monday, the FBI revealed that Crooks had looked online for information about mass shootings, power plants, improvised explosive devices and the May assassination attempt of the Slovakian prime minister.\n\nThe FBI also said that Trump has agreed to be interviewed by agents as a crime victim. Trump, who appeared at events in the days after the shooting with a bandage on his right ear, said he expects the interview to take place on Thursday.\n\nAt Cheatle's hearing last week, she said the Secret Service had \"failed\" in its mission to protect Trump. She called the attempt on Trump's life the Secret Service's \"most significant operational failure\" in decades and vowed to \"move heaven and earth\" to get to the bottom of what went wrong and make sure there's no repeat of it.\n\nCheatle acknowledged that the Secret Service was told about a suspicious person two to five times before the shooting at the rally. She also revealed that the roof from which Crooks opened fire had been identified as a potential vulnerability days before the rally.\n\nIn a Monday night interview on Fox News Channel, Trump defended the Secret Service agents who protected him from the shooting but said that someone should have been on the roof with Crooks and that there should have been better communication with local police.\n\n\"They didn't speak to each other,\" he said.\n\nHe praised the sniper who killed Crooks with what he said was an amazing shot but noted: \"It would have been good if it was nine seconds

It also suggested that Rowe, with ready and detailed answers, was determined to strike a different posture than that of his predecessor, Kimberly Cheatle, who resigned last week after facing intense criticism from lawmakers from both major political parties after responses that were seen as evasive and lacking in specifics.\n\nMuch of Tuesday's hearing before the Senate Judiciary and Homeland Security committees focused on what Rowe suggested was inadequate information received by Secret Service personnel in the hour before the shooting, including that Crooks had been spotted on the roof.\n\nLocal law enforcement officers had spotted a suspicious-looking man pacing near the metal detectors and circulated but ultimately lost track of Crooks before he scaled the roof of a building at AGR International Inc. Shortly before the shooting, a local officer climbed up to the roof to investigate. Crooks turned and pointed his rifle at the officer, who retreated.\n\n\"No information regarding a weapon on a roof was ever passed to our personnel,\" Rowe said. At another point, he noted, \"It is troubling to me that we did not get that information as quickly as we should have. We didn't know that there was this incident going on.\"\n\nBut Rowe's willingness to assign blame to local law enforcement opened him up to harsh criticism from Senate Republicans, who saw him as failing to take responsibility.\n\n\"Isn't it the fact that the former president was shot, that a good American is dead, that other Americans were critically wounded -- isn't that enough mission failure for you to say to the person who decided that that building should not be the security perimeter, probably ought to be stepped down?\" said Sen. Josh Hawley, a Missouri Republican.\n\nRowe, raising his voice, responded that he has \"lost sleep over this for the last 17 days\" and that he would not be rushed \"to judgment\" by Congress, but he assured lawmakers that \"people will be held accountable.\"\n\nSen. Lindsey Graham, the top Republican on the Senate Judiciary Committee, said if something like this happened in the military, \"a lot of people would be fired. And if a lot of people are not fired, the system failed yet again.\"\n\nHe added: \"Nothing's going to change until somebody loses their job.\"\n\nThe FBI, meanwhile, disclosed new details about Crooks, with Deputy Director Paul Abbate saying a social media account believed to be associated with the gunman suspected in the assassination attempt espoused political violence and included antisemitic and anti-immigrant sentiment. The posts were from the 2019 and 2020 timeframe, when Crooks would have been in high school.\n\nOn Monday, the FBI revealed that Crooks had looked online for information about mass shootings, power plants, improvised explosive devices and the May assassination attempt of the Slovakian prime minister.\n\nThe FBI also said that Trump has agreed to be interviewed by agents as a crime victim. Trump, who appeared at events in the days after the shooting with a bandage on his right ear, said he expects the interview to take place on Thursday.\n\nAt Cheatle's hearing last week, she said the Secret Service had \"failed\" in its mission to protect Trump. She called the attempt on Trump's life the Secret Service's \"most significant operational failure\" in decades and vowed to \"move heaven and earth\" to get to the bottom of what went wrong and make sure there's no repeat of it.\n\nCheatle acknowledged that the Secret Service was told about a suspicious person two to five times before the shooting at the rally. She also revealed that the roof from which Crooks opened fire had been identified as a potential vulnerability days before the rally.\n\nIn a Monday night interview on Fox News Channel, Trump defended the Secret Service agents who protected him from the shooting but said that someone should have been on the roof with Crooks and that there should have been better communication with local police.\n\n\"They didn't speak to each other,\" he said.\n\nHe praised the sniper who killed Crooks with what he said was an amazing shot but noted: \"It would have been good if it was nine seconds sooner.\"", "source": {"uri": "missoulian.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "missoulian.com"}, "authors": [{"uri": "associated_press@missoulian.com", "name": "Associated Press", "type": "author",

As a career law enforcement officer and a 25-year Secret Service veteran, I cannot defend why that roof was not better secured,\" he said.\n\nThe testimony was the most detailed catalog to date by the Secret Service of law enforcement failings and miscommunications, with Rowe accepting blame for his own agency's mistakes while also pointedly criticizing local law enforcement for communication breakdowns that resulted in his agency not receiving information that a gunman, later identified as 20-year-old Thomas Matthew Crooks, had been seen on the roof of a building less than 150 yards (135 meters) from the rally stage where Trump was speaking.\n\n\"Neither the Secret Service counter sniper teams nor members of the former president's security detail had any knowledge that there was a man on the roof of the building with a firearm,\" Rowe said. \"It is my understanding those personnel were not aware the assailant had a firearm until they heard gunshots.\"\n\nHe said that the shooting amounted to a \"failure on multiple levels,\" including a failure of imagination and a \"failure to challenge our assumptions.\"\n\n\"We assumed that the state and locals had it,\" Rowe said. \"We made an assumption that there was going to be uniformed presence out there, that there would be sufficient eyes to cover that, that there was going to be counter-sniper teams\" in the building from whose roof Crooks fired shots.\n\n\"And I can assure you,\" Rowe added, \"that we're not going to make that mistake again.\"\n\nHe said he had implemented multiple reforms since taking over as acting director last week, including mandating that every event security plan is vetted by multiple experienced supervisors before being implemented, expanding the use of aerial drones to improve visibility of roofs, dedicating more resources to improve communications at events where the Secret Service is operating. He said he's also directed that federal and local counter snipers work together on roofs.\n\nTrump, the 2024 Republican presidential nominee, was struck in the ear by a bullet or a bullet fragment in the assassination attempt, one rallygoer was killed and two others were injured before the gunman was killed by a Secret Service counter-sniper.\n\nThe blunt and at times emotional testimony Tuesday, featuring combative exchanges with lawmakers, ensured that an already simmering blame game between federal and local authorities will continue.

But the officers ultimately lost track of Crooks, who was able to scale the roof of a building at AGR International Inc., a supplier of automation equipment for the glass and plastic packaging industry, and fire an estimated eight shots with an AR-15-style rife.\n\nToday's Top Headlines\n\nStory continues below\n\nSC lake hasn't allowed fishing since the 1950s.

Senators grilled Rowe and Deputy Federal Bureau of Investigation Director Paul Abbate about the events leading to the July 13 attempted assassination of former U.S. President Donald Trump, days before he accepted the Republican presidential nomination for the third time. (Photo by Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images)\n\nWASHINGTON -- When acting Secret Service Director Ronald Rowe Jr. visited the site of the campaign rally where a gunman attempted to assassinate former President Donald Trump, he went up to the roof, lying flat on his stomach, to evaluate the shooter's line of sight that mid-July day.\n\n\"What I saw made me ashamed,\" Rowe told U.S. senators Tuesday. \"As a career law enforcement officer and a 25-year-veteran with the Secret Service, I cannot defend why that roof was not better secured.\"\n\nRowe recounted his trip to Butler, Pennsylvania, which he said took place after being named acting director July 23, at a joint hearing of the Senate Judiciary and Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs committees examining the security failures that led to the assassination attempt. Deputy FBI Director Paul Abbate also testified.\n\nIt was the first Senate hearing on the attempted assassination since a shooter killed one rallygoer, injured two others and shot Trump's ear using an AR-15-style rifle during a campaign event in Butler on July 13. The 20-year-old gunman was killed at the scene.\n\n\"Let me be clear: This was an attack on our democracy,\" said Sen. Gary Peters, chairman of the Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee.\n\n\"Americans should be able to attend a political rally and express their political beliefs without fear of violence, and political candidates for our nation's highest office should be confident that their safety will never be compromised for their service,\" the Michigan Democrat added.\n\nPeters launched a bipartisan investigation into the security failures leading to the assassination attempt alongside ranking Republican Rand Paul of Kentucky. It's one of several congressional inquiries examining the failures of law enforcement that day.\n\nRowe stepped into his post after Kimberly Cheatle resigned as director last week. The day before her resignation, Cheatle testified in front of the House Committee on Oversight and Accountability, where lawmakers on both sides of the aisle berated her over the agency's failures to prevent the attempted assassination of Trump.\n\nFacing heavy criticism, many lawmakers called on Cheatle to resign. House Oversight Chairman James Comer of Kentucky and ranking member Jamie Raskin of Maryland also urged her to step down in a joint letter shortly after that hearing.\n\nRowe said the attempted assassination was \"a failure to imagine that we actually do live in a very dangerous world where people do actually want to do harm to our protectees.\"\n\n\"I think it was a failure to challenge our own assumptions -- the assumptions that we know our partners are going to do everything they can, and they do this every day,\" he added.\n\nSenators sought to uncover what went wrong, what policies are in place to facilitate real-time information sharing between the Secret Service and local law enforcement during an event and whether the Secret Service is developing a security plan for the upcoming Democratic National Convention in Chicago that takes into account what they learned from the July shooting.\n\nNeither the Secret Service counter sniper teams nor members of Trump's security detail \"had any knowledge that there was a man on the roof of the ... building with a firearm,\" according to Rowe.\n\nRowe said \"prior to that, they were operating with the knowledge that local law enforcement was working an issue of a suspicious individual prior to the shots being fired.\"\n\nAbbate noted that despite not having any definitive evidence as to how the gunman got the weapon onto the roof, they believe based on what they have gathered thus far that he likely had the rifle in a backpack.\n\nMeanwhile, Abbate said the FBI uncovered a social media account believed to be associated with the shooter, though they are still working to verify that the account belonged to him.\n\nMore than 700 comments were posted from the social media account \"in about the 2019, 2020 timeframe,\" when the shooter would have been in his mid-teens, and some of the comments \"appear to reflect antisemitic and anti-immigration themes to espouse political violence and are described as extreme in nature,\" Abbate said.\n\nAbbate said though nothing has been ruled out, the FBI's investigation has not identified any motive, co-conspirators or people with advanced knowledge. The FBI has so far held more than 460 interviews, received over 2,000 tips from the public, executed search warrants and seized electronic media.\n\nTuesday's hearing came the day after U.S. House Speaker Mike Johnson and Democratic Leader Hakeem Jeffries announced 13 lawmakers comprising a bipartisan task force to investigate the attempted assassination. The resolution creating the panel requires a final report by mid-December.\n\nRep. Mike Kelly, a Pennsylvania Republican whose district includes Butler, will chair the task force.\n\nRepublican Sen. Chuck Grassley of Iowa and Democratic Sen. Catherine Cortez Masto of Nevada introduced bipartisan legislation last week that would require Senate confirmation of Secret Service directors and limit them to one term of 10 years.", "source":

Lindsey Graham, the top Republican on the Senate Judiciary Committee. \"And if a lot of people are not fired, the system failed yet again.\n\nHe added: \"Nothing's going to change until somebody loses their job.\"\n\nThe hearing comes one day after the FBI released new details about its investigation into the shooting, revealing that the gunman had looked online for information about mass shootings, power plants, improvised explosive devices and the May assassination attempt of the Slovakian prime minister.\n\nListen now and subscribe: Apple Podcasts | Google Podcasts | Spotify | RSS Feed | SoundStack | All Of Our Podcasts\n\nThe FBI also said that Trump, the 2024 Republican presidential nominee, has agreed to be interviewed by agents as a crime victim. The bureau said last week that the former president had been struck in the ear by a bullet or fragment of one. Trump said Monday evening that he expected that interview to take place on Thursday.\n\nBut most of the questions Tuesday are expected to be directed at Rowe as lawmakers demand answers about how Crooks was able to get so close to Trump. Investigators believe Crooks fired eight shots in Trump's direction from an AR-style rifle after scaling the roof of a building of some 135 meters (147 yards) from where Trump was speaking in Butler, Pennsylvania.\n\nOne rallygoer was killed, and two others were injured. Crooks was shot dead by a Secret Service counter-sniper.\n\nAt her hearing last week, Cheatle said the Secret Service had \"failed\" in its mission to protect Trump. She called the attempt on Trump's life the Secret Service's \"most significant operational failure\" in decades and vowed to \"move heaven and earth\" to get to the bottom of what went wrong and make sure there's no repeat of it.\n\nPhotos: Trump injured, 2 killed in shooting at rally\n\nCheatle acknowledged that the Secret Service was told about a suspicious person two to five times before the shooting at the rally. She also revealed that the roof from which Crooks opened fire had been identified as a potential vulnerability days before the rally.\n\nCheatle said she apologized to Trump in a phone call after the assassination attempt.\n\nIn a Monday night interview on Fox News Channel, Trump defended the Secret Service agents who protected him from the shooting but said that someone should have been on the roof with Crooks and that there should have been better communication with local police.\n\n\"They didn't speak to each other,\" he said.\n\nHe praised the sniper who killed Crooks with what he said was an amazing shot but noted: \"It would have been good if it was nine seconds sooner.\"\n\n0 Comments Love 0 Funny 0 Wow 0 Sad 0 Angry 0\n\nGet Government & Politics updates in your inbox!\n\nStay

Lynch\n\nWASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. Secret Service's new acting director said in prepared congressional testimony on Tuesday he was \"ashamed\" of a major security lapse that preceded the July 13 attempted assassination of Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump at a Pennsylvania campaign rally.\n\nIn testimony released before addressing two Senate committees, Acting Secret Service Director Ronald Rowe said he visited the outdoor rally site in Butler and climbed onto the roof of a nearby building from which 20-year-old Thomas Crooks fired shots that wounded Trump's right ear, killed one rally attendee and wounded two others, with an AR-15-style rifle.\n\n\"What I saw made me ashamed,\" Rowe said in the prepared testimony for a joint hearing of the Senate Homeland Security and Judiciary Committees. \"As a career law enforcement officer, and a 25-year veteran with the Secret Service, I cannot defend why that roof was not better secured.\"\n\nRowe's admission of a glaring security lapse came a week after former Secret Service Director Kimberly Cheatle resigned under bipartisan congressional pressure after refusing to detail security shortfalls in testimony before a House of Representatives panel.\n\nRowe sought to assure lawmakers that he has since taken steps to prevent similar lapses from occurring amid concerns among both Democrats and Republicans about further political violence as the campaign intensifies ahead of the Nov. 5 U.S. election.\n\n\"I directed our personnel to ensure every event site security plan is thoroughly vetted by multiple experienced supervisors before it is implemented,\" Rowe said.\n\nThe Secret Service, a federal law enforcement agency whose duties including protecting the president and certain other top political figures, has added six people to its protection list since July 13, including Republican vice presidential candidate JD Vance and his family and independent presidential candidate Robert F. Kennedy, while reinforcing security details, Rowe said.\n\nRowe was due to testify alongside Paul Abbate, deputy director of the FBI, which is due to interview Trump on Thursday as part of its investigation into the shooting.\n\nThe attempted assassination is the topic of multiple investigations by House and Senate committees, as well as a new bipartisan task force established by Republican House Speaker Mike Johnson and House Democratic leader Hakeem Jeffries.\n\nInvestigators have been unable to determine a clear motive for Crooks, who they have described as a loner with no close friends and a social network limited mainly to immediate family members. Much interest revolves around the timeline from when law enforcement officials first noticed Crooks to when Secret Service snipers killed him after he opened fire.\n\nThe FBI said on Monday that Crooks first came to the attention of police more than an hour before he fired at least eight shots at the former president.\n\nA local officer took a photo of Crooks and sent it to other law enforcement officials at the scene. About 30 minutes later, SWAT team members saw Crooks using a rangefinder and browsing news sites, the FBI said.\n\n(Reporting by David Morgan, Sarah N.

A failure to imagine that we actually do live in a very dangerous world where people do actually want to do harm to our protectees,\" Rowe said.\n\nRowe also pointed to a communication breakdown between local and state law enforcement and the Secret Service, saying that \"no information regarding a weapon on a roof was ever passed\" to Secret Service agents.\n\n\"I think it was a failure to challenge our own assumptions,\" Rowe said. \"The assumptions that we know our partners are going to do everything they can ... We assume that someone is going to cover that. We assume that there's going to be uniform presence.\"\n\nLawmakers pushed back at placing the blame on local police and questioned why the Secret Service official who approved the security perimeter - which did not include the building the shooter perched on - wasn't fired.\n\n\"Isn't the fact that a former president was shot, that a good American is dead, that other Americans were critically wounded, isn't that enough mission failure for you to say that the person who decided that that building should not be in the security perimeter, probably ought to step down?\" said Republican Sen. Josh Hawley of Missouri.\n\nRowe - on hand because his former boss, Secret Service Director Kimberly Cheatle, resigned following a previous hearing on the shooting - said people will be held accountable after the investigation is complete, but he wouldn't be rushed to judgment by lawmakers.\n\nFBI Deputy Director Paul Abbate, who testified alongside Rowe, said the FBI's investigation is focused on the shooter's motive and timeline. To date, the FBI has not identified a motive or any co-conspirators, Abbate said.\n\n\"The FBI team has conducted more than 460 interviews, executed search warrants, including at the shooter's residence and seized electronic media to include phones, laptops, hard drives and thumb drives,\" he said. \"The full resources of the FBI have been brought to bear in furtherance of the investigation.\"\n\nAbbate said the FBI uncovered a social media account believed to be associated with the shooter in the 2019-2020 timeframe. There were over 700 posts from the account, some of which were anti-semetic, anti-immigration and espoused political violence.\n\n\"While the investigative team is still working to verify this account to determine if it did, in fact, belong to the shooter, we believe it important to share and note it today, particularly given the general absence of other information to date from social media and other sources of information that reflect on the shooter's potential, motive and mindset,\" Abbate said.\n\nThe hearing comes just a day after House Speaker Mike Johnson and Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries announced the members on the bipartisan task force investigating the assassination attempt. The group includes seven Republicans and five Democrats.\n\n\"We have the utmost confidence in this bipartisan group of steady, highly qualified and capable Members of Congress to move quickly to find the facts, ensure accountability and help make certain such failures never happen again,\" Johnson and Jeffries said in a statement.\n\nAfter its investigation, the task force will make recommendations for reform and any necessary legislation to implement the reforms.\n\nThe congressional task force comes in addition to several other federal inquiries into the shooting. The Department of Homeland Security is conducting an independent review of the Secret Service, the Secret Service is conducting its own internal review, the FBI has undertaken a criminal investigation and the Department of Homeland Security Office of Inspector General is looking into the incident.\n\nPresident Joe Biden has also ordered an independent review into the shooting. The external probe will be led in part by former DHS Secretary Janet Napolitano and Frances Townsend, who was President George W. Bush's homeland security adviser.\n\nThe shooting occurred at a campaign rally in Butler, Pennsylvania, on July 13, where 20-year-old Thomas Matthew Crooks accessed a building rooftop less than 500 feet from where Trump was speaking. Crooks fired at Trump with an AR-15 style rifle, injuring Trump's right ear. Rally attendee Corey Comperatore was killed, and two others were critically injured in addition to Crooks, who was killed by a Secret Service counter-sniper.\n\nLawmakers on Tuesday pressed for answers on how Crooks gained access to the rooftop, how he eluded the Secret Service and how he got a direct line of sight on the former president.\n\n\"We've all seen the movies, we've read the books. The international assassin with sophisticated technology and elaborate plans, sets out to kill a leading political figure in the United States. But how does that match the reality of what happened in Butler, Pennsylvania?\" asked Sen. Dick Durbin, a Democrat from Illinois.\n\n\"When a 20-year-old introverted college student outsmarted one of the most sophisticated American law enforcement agencies in history? Came within an inch of killing a former President of the United States? That's why we gather today to ask these hard questions. There's more to this story and other aspects we ought to consider as well.\"", "source": {"uri": "usnews.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "U.S. News & World Report"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Secret_Service", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "United States Secret Service"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Bureau_of_Investigation", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Federal Bureau of Investigation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Attempted_assassination_of_Ronald_Reagan", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Attempted assassination of Ronald Reagan"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Senate_Committee_on_the_Judiciary", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States Senate Committee on the Judiciary"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Law_enforcement", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Law enforcement"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Senate", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States Senate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Department_of_Homeland_Security", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States Department of Homeland Security"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republican_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Republican Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_media", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Social media"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kimberly_Cheatle", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Kimberly Cheatle"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_Abbate", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Paul Abbate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deputy_Director_of_the_Federal_Bureau_of_Investigation", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Deputy Director of the Federal Bureau of Investigation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hakeem_Jeffries", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Hakeem Jeffries"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Opposition_to_immigration", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Opposition to immigration"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Political_violence", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Political violence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bipartisanship", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Bipartisanship"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Search_warrant", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Search warrant"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Josh_Hawley", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Josh Hawley"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Missouri", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Missouri"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Missouri"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AR-15\u2013style_rifle", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "AR-15\u2013style rifle"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Independent_politician", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Independent politician"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Department_of_Homeland_Security_Office_of_Inspector_General", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Department of Homeland Security Office of Inspector General"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frances_Townsend", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Frances Townsend"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Janet_Napolitano", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Janet Napolitano"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dick_Durbin", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Dick Durbin"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Secretary_of_Homeland_Security", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "United States Secretary of Homeland Security"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homeland_security", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Homeland security"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Biden", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Party_leaders_of_the_United_States_House_of_Representatives", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Party leaders of the United States House of Representatives"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_W._Bush", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "George W.

The hearing, which took place on July 30, 2024, was part of a series of congressional hearings dedicated to the shooting that occurred on July 13 in Butler, Pennsylvania.\n\nDuring the hearing, Rowe was confronted with an email from a Secret Service counter-sniper warning that the agency \"SHOULD EXPECT ANOTHER assassination attempt\" before November due to inadequate leadership. The email, sent to the agency's Uniformed Division on Monday night, highlighted concerns about the agency's ability to protect Trump in the lead-up to the Republican National Convention.\n\nRowe, who was elevated to the position of acting director following the resignation of his predecessor, Kimberly Cheatle, admitted that the July 13 shooting was \"a failure on multiple levels.\" He revealed that neither the Secret Service counter-sniper teams nor members of Trump's security detail had any knowledge that there was a man on the roof of the American Glass Research building with a firearm.\n\nThe gunman, 20-year-old Thomas Matthew Crooks, was spotted on the roof less than 150 yards from where Trump was speaking. Despite this, Rowe claimed that the Secret Service was unaware of his presence until after the shooting had occurred.\n\nRowe's testimony came under fire from several lawmakers, including Senator Josh Hawley, who accused the Secret Service of making a politically motivated decision to deny Trump extra security. Hawley also questioned Rowe about the agency's decision to not secure the roof of the American Glass Research building, which he called \"indefensible.\"\n\n\"Isn't the fact that a former president was shot, that a good American is dead, that other Americans were critically wounded - isn't that enough mission failure for you to say to the person who decided that that building should not be in the security perimeter, probably ought to be stepped down?\" Hawley asked.\n\nRowe defended the agency's actions, stating that the Secret Service had made an assumption that there would be sufficient security coverage from local law enforcement. He also claimed that the agency had not received information from local law enforcement about the presence of an armed subject on the roof.\n\nThe hearing also revealed new details about the investigation into the shooting. The FBI announced that Crooks had looked online for information about mass shootings, power plants, improvised explosive devices, and the May assassination attempt of the Slovakian prime minister. The bureau also revealed that Trump had agreed to be interviewed as a crime victim, as he had been struck in the ear by a bullet or fragment of one during the shooting.", "source": {"uri": "thebeltwayreport.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Beltway Report"}, "authors": [{"uri": "jack_crane@thebeltwayreport.com", "name": "Jack Crane", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Secret_Service", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "United States Secret Service"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Attempted_assassination_of_Ronald_Reagan", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Attempted assassination of Ronald Reagan"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Senate", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "United States Senate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ronald_Rowe", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Ronald Rowe"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Josh_Hawley", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Josh Hawley"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Butler,_Pennsylvania", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Butler, Pennsylvania"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Butler, Pennsylvania"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kimberly_Cheatle", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Kimberly Cheatle"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Firearm", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Firearm"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republican_National_Convention", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Republican National Convention"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mass_shooting", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Mass shooting"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Improvised_explosive_device", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Improvised explosive device"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prime_Minister_of_the_United_Kingdom", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Prime Minister of the United Kingdom"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Law_enforcement", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Law enforcement"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Bureau_of_Investigation", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Federal Bureau of Investigation"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Terrorism", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Terrorism", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Warfare_and_Conflict", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Warfare and Conflict", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Crime_and_Justice", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Crime and Justice", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Theft", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Theft", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 69}], "image": "https://thebeltwayreport.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/img_8979-1024x576.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9772518", "eventUri": "eng-9772518", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-07-13", "textStart": 348, "textEnd": 355, "freq": 2}], "sentiment": -0.1450980392156863, "wgt": 180, "relevance": 1}

Abbate and Rowe are testifying before members of the Senate Homeland Security Committee and Judiciary Committee.\n\nThe fallout from the July 13 attack led to the resignation of former Secret Service Director Kimberly Cheatle, who announced her decision to step down from her post just one day after she faced sharp criticism from the House Oversight and Accountability Committee. Rowe, the agency's deputy director, was appointed to temporarily lead the Secret Service.\n\nThe Secret Service has faced significant criticism in the wake of the attack, as questions have arisen as to how the gunman, identified as 20-year-old Thomas Matthew Crooks, was able to gain access to a rooftop so close to where Trump was addressing the crowd of supporters in Butler, Pennsylvania. He was killed by a Secret Service sniper after firing eight rounds from the roof of a building belonging to AGR International, which was outside the security perimeter controlled by the agency.\n\nFBI officials told reporters Monday that they believe Crooks used the building's HVAC system and piping to climb up onto the roof, and he was spotted wearing a backpack and walking near the AGR building roughly 15 minutes before opening fire.\n\nKevin Rojek, the special agent in charge of the FBI's Pittsburgh field office, said the shooter also searched for information related to power plants, mass shooting events, improvised explosive devices and the assassination attempt against the prime minister of Slovakia in May.\n\nThe former president has agreed to speak with the FBI about the

The testimony, given on Tuesday has posed questions about the agency's handling of security during the event and the protocols in place to protect high-profile individuals.\n\nAs per Newsweek, Rowe, appearing before the Senate Judiciary Committee, acknowledged the security failure but explained that Crooks had not been identified as a threat when Trump began speaking. Rowe revealed, \"There were other calls that day of individuals who came to the attention of law enforcement...regarding the assailant, that never really rose to a level of we should not put him out there. Had we known that there was a dangerous individual out there, we would never let a protectee go out on stage.\"\n\nWhen questioned by Senator John Cornyn about when a suspicious individual becomes identified as a threat, Rowe highlighted, \"I think it's also when a weapon or some other dangerous item is then presented.\" He further explained, \"At that time Senator, suspicion had not risen to the level of threat or imminent harm.\"\n\nDespite this, many criticized the Secret Service for their handling of the situation. Former Secret Service Director Kimberly Cheatle faced calls for resignation after the incident, eventually stepping down and allowing Rowe to assume the role of acting Director. The shooting has led to an internal investigation and legislative action.\n\nHouse Speaker Mike Johnson recently announced the creation of a task force to investigate the assassination attempt. He said, \"There's a deadline of early December for the final report but we expect and anticipate interim reports along the way. That work will begin in earnest, they will be issuing subpoenas. We will get down to the bottom of this.\"\n\nAs per the New York Post, reports have also surfaced about internal complaints from Trump's Secret Service detail. They claim they were not informed of local police tracking Crooks or alerted to his suspicious behavior in the crucial minutes leading up to the shooting. In a statement, Secret Service spokesman Anthony Guglielmi said, \"As it relates to communications at the rally, the Secret Service is committed to better understanding what happened before, during, and after the assassination attempt of former President Trump to ensure that never happens again. That includes complete cooperation with Congress, the FBI and other relevant investigations.\"\n\nOn July 13, at a campaign rally in Butler, Pennsylvania, Crooks, 20, opened fire on Trump while he was on stage, injuring his ear.

Mike Lee sends Secret Service Director into PANIC with one simple question about fatal Trump assassination attempt in Butler, PA:\n\n\"Why was President Trump allowed to take the stage at 6:02pm exactly 17 minutes after multiple suspicious person reports...\n\nWatching today's questions from senators meet less-than-adequate answers from the current acting head of the Secret Service, Ronald Rowe - the former deputy director - one has to wonder if the leadership of the Secret Service is simply riddled with so much buck-passing, ass-covering, and finger-pointing that everyone should just be fired right now.\n\nTo his credit, Rowe acted much more human and much more upset than former Secret Service Director Kimberly Cheatle did during her testimony to the House Oversight Committee regarding the assassination attempt on Donald Trump. But that was a low bar to clear. Rowe had the task of explaining to some of the sharper minds on the Senate Judiciary and Homeland Security committees. Also there was FBI Deputy Director Paul Abbate, but most of the harsh questioning was aimed at Rowe, since it was the Secret Service who has the most to answer for in this investigation.\n\nRowe, at least, started out strong in his opening statement.\n\nRowe told lawmakers from the Senate Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee and the Senate Judiciary Committee that he visited the site after the disastrous security failure, including the rooftop from which the 20-year-old gunman, Thomas Matthew Crooks, fired eight shots from an AR-style rifle.\n\n\"What I saw made me ashamed,\" Rowe said. He became the acting director of the agency a week ago, following the resignation of Kimberly Cheatle under pressure from lawmakers and others. Rowe previously served as deputy director of the Secret Service, responsible for overseeing daily investigative and protective operations.\n\nRaising his voice in frustration, Rowe showed lawmakers photos of the rooftop, near where officials have said local law enforcement officers were posted.\n\n\"I cannot understand why there was not better coverage\" of that roof, Rowe said. \"I think this was a failure of imagination, a failure to imagine that we actually do live in a very dangerous world where people do actually want to do harm to our protectees. I think it was a failure to challenge our own assumptions.\"\n\nRowe said the Secret Service assumed there would be \"sufficient eyes\" from local law enforcement covering the outer perimeter of the rally, including countersniper teams in the AGR building from which the shooter fired.\n\n\"We assumed that the state and locals had it,\" Rowe said in response to questioning from Sen. John Cornyn (R-Tex.). \"I can assure you that we're not going to make that mistake again.\"\n\nHowever, Rowe comes with some problems of his own. Susan Crabtree, investigative reporter for Real Clear Politics, has been digging deeply into the failures of the the Secret Service, and reported today that it was Rowe himself who was responsible for denying Trump's security detail additional resources.\n\nActing Secret Service Director Ronald Rowe was directly involved in denying additional security resources and personnel, including counter snipers, to former President Trump's rallies and events - despite repeated requests by the agents assigned to Trump's detail in the two years leading up to his July 13 attempted assassination, according to several sources familiar with the decision-making.\n\nIt was Rowe's decision alone to deny counter sniper teams to any Trump event outside of driving distance from D.C., these sources asserted.\n\nAt first, the Trump rally in Butler, Pennsylvania had no Secret Service sniper teams assigned to it, but at the last minute, agency officials reversed course and decided to add two snipers to the outdoor event. It's still unclear whether there were just two counter snipers or two two-man teams for a total of four individuals. (Two-man teams usually include one spotter and one sniper.)\n\nSo far, there has been no explanation as to why agency officials made the late counter sniper assignments to the Butler event, though it could be in response to the increased threat level Trump has faced in recent weeks. The Secret Service has said the agency increased security for Trump for an unknown time period before the Butler rally in response to an Iranian plot against the former president.\n\nAs RCP previously reported, the late decision to add the two counter snipers cut short the time the team had to conduct a detailed on-site survey in advance of the Butler rally. Such a survey would usually take two to three days to complete, but the counter snipers had only one day to complete that critical advance work.\n\nSources familiar with counter sniper advance work also said an outdoor forum such as the Farm Show site in Butler should require at least three two-man counter sniper teams.\n\nInstead, the Secret Service sent two counter snipers and then relied on a local law enforcement counter sniper team to man the American Glass Research, or AGR, building, placing that structure outside the official Secret Service perimeter.\n\nWhen asked by Senator Ron Johnson about this report, Rowe denied that the buck stopped with him. Crabtree responded on X that she \"stands by her sources.\"\n\nIt has now been 17 days since the assassination attempt, and the Secret Service knows exactly who did what on that day. They have the name of the agent who made the call to let Donald Trump go onstage. They know who was in operational control of the rally. They just don't want to do anything about it yet, under the claims that the \"investigation isn't complete yet.\" That was unacceptable to Senator Josh Hawley (R-MO), who demanded to know why no one has been fired yet, or at least suspended pending the outcome of the investigation.\n\nIn one clash during aggressive questioning by Sen. Josh Hawley (R-Mo.), Rowe said he \"could not tip the scales\" and said \"we need to allow the investigation to play out.\"\n\nHawley demanded the firing of a number of Secret Service personnel, from whoever approved the security plan to whoever failed to pull Trump offstage despite warnings about a suspicious person.\n\n\"Isn't the fact that a former president was shot, that a good American is dead, that other Americans were critically wounded -- isn't that enough mission failure for you to say that the person who decided that building should not be in the security perimeter probably ought to be stepped down?\" Hawley said, referencing the AGR building Thomas Matthew Crooks fired from.\n\nRowe said agents involved were cooperating with an internal investigation.\n\n\"I want to be neutral and make sure that we get to the bottom of it and interview everybody in order to determine if there was more than one person who perhaps exercised bad judgment,\" Rowe said, adding he did not want to \"zero in on one or two individuals.\"\n\nHawley repeatedly asserted that there was \"prima facia\" evidence that the Secret Service failed.\n\n\"You've been on the job a few days so far. You've fired nobody,\" Hawley griped.\n\nAt one point in the exchange, Rowe became emotional.\n\n\"I have lost sleep over that for the last 17 days, just like you have, and I will tell you, senator, that I will not rush to judgment, that people will be held accountable, and I will do so with integrity and not rush to judgment and put people [out there to be] unfairly persecuted,\" Rowe said.\n\n\"Unfairly persecuted?\" Hawley responded. \"We've got people who are dead.\"\n\n\"You said earlier that you've got to make sure that your protocols are followed and unless there's a protocol violation, people wouldn't be disciplined,\" Hawley said.\n\n\"I would just say to you, I don't really care that much about your protocols.\"\n\nSenator Ted Cruz (R-TX) also hammered Rowe on the failures of the Secret Service, including asking who made the call initially to deny Robert F. Kennedy Jr. protection.\n\nSenator Mike Lee (R-UT) also tried nailing down the biggest question - why was Donald Trump allowed to take the stage? And Senator Lee asked, would Joe Biden have been allowed to go on stage under the same circumstances? And why did local law enforcement sniper teams ABANDON their post overlooking the roof?\n\nSenator Marsha Blackburn (R-TN), who attempted to get answers from the previous director, presented a whistleblower letter obtained by Susan Crabtree, where a Secret Service countersniper complains that leadership tied the hands of those on the ground in Butler, and asked Acting Director Rowe about it.\n\nThe full post reads:\n\n@MarshaBlackburn READS FROM THE EMAIL I was given exclusively this morning from a Secret Service counter sniper. That counter sniper sent the email to every employee at the agency's Uniform Division last night.\n\nIn the email, attached below, the counter sniper, whose name I redacted, expresed deep dismay, calling for all top leaders of the Secret Service to resign or be fired, and accused agency supervisors of engaging in \"CYA.\"\n\nRowe: \"I'm hurt by that email, but not in the way you think I'm saying. I'm hurt because my people are hurting right now. We need them....\"\n\nBlackburn: \"Then, when did somebody delete the email?\"\n\nRowe: \"I'll look, I'll get back to you on that [question of why the] agency deleted the email. May I address your question, and I will get back to you as to whether the email was deleted or not.\"\n\n\"My agency is hurting. Emotions are raw. I actually want to hear more from that [Uniform Division] officer, that technician in his email, he referenced that he had spent time serving our nation as a United States Marine, that he is a 20-year professional of the Secret Service. \"\n\nRowe then says he's \"committed to being a CHANGE AGENT.\"\n\n\"I am committed to reviewing some of these things. I looked at the points in his email very quickly. I saw, as I was on my way over here this morning, I want to have further conversations, not only with him, but also [other counter snipers.]\"\n\nHere's the devastating email the counter sniper sent last night at 10:34 p.m.\n\nThe email speaks to the collapse of morale among the Secret Service itself. Senator Cruz commended the agents who worked to get Donald Trump to safety on that day, but the failures seem to be happening at the logistical and command level. There were failures in communication, there were failures in planning, there were failures in equipment (apparently the warning by local law enforcement about the shooter once he was known to be armed did not reach the Secret Service by radio), and the assumptions made by the Secret Service that local law enforcement could cover their gaps got Corey Comperatore killed, and nearly got Donald Trump killed.\n\nMerely replacing the head of the Secret Service with the next person in line is not going to fix the failures of July 13th. The Secret Service needs a housecleaning from top to bottom, period. Today's hearing did not convince me, or the senators listening to this testimony, that Ronald Rowe is the right man for the job going forward.", "source": {"uri": "conservativeangle.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Brigitte Gabriel"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kimberly_Cheatle", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Kimberly Cheatle"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Attempted_assassination_of_Ronald_Reagan", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Attempted assassination of Ronald Reagan"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Senate_Committee_on_the_Judiciary", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "United States Senate Committee on the Judiciary"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sniper", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Sniper"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Senate", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "United States Senate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Secret_Service", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "United States Secret Service"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Josh_Hawley", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Josh Hawley"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Butler,_Pennsylvania", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Butler, Pennsylvania"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Butler, Pennsylvania"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mike_Lee", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Mike Lee"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_Abbate", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Paul Abbate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Law_enforcement_officer", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Law enforcement officer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deputy_Director_of_the_Federal_Bureau_of_Investigation", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Deputy Director of the Federal Bureau of Investigation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Senate_Committee_on_Homeland_Security_and_Governmental_Affairs", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States Senate Committee on Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bar_(law)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Bar (law)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Cornyn", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "John Cornyn"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Law_enforcement", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Law enforcement"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RealClearPolitics", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "RealClearPolitics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Department_of_Homeland_Security", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States Department of Homeland Security"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Email", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Email"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Investigative_journalism", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Investigative journalism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sanitization_(classified_information)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Sanitization (classified information)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marsha_Blackburn", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Marsha Blackburn"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_F._Kennedy_Jr.", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Robert F.

The director addressed specific failures, including the lack of urgent information circulation and inadequate scene protection, which contributed to the incident.\n\nDuring the testimony, the acting director Ronald Rowe Jr emphasized his disappointment, saying the shooting site inspection made him \"ashamed,\" and labeled the event as a \"failure on multiple levels,\" including a failure of imagination, reported AP.\n\n\"We assumed that the state and locals had it,\" the acting director said. \"We made an assumption that there was going to be uniformed presence out there, that there would be sufficient eyes to cover that, that there was going to be counter-sniper teams in the building from whose roof Crooks fired shots, less than 150 yards (135 meters) from the rally stage where Trump was speaking. And I can assure you that we're not going to make that mistake again.\"\n\nIn the attempted assassination, Trump, the 2024 Republican presidential nominee, was struck in the ear by a bullet or fragment, resulting in one fatality and two other injuries among rallygoers before the gunman, 20-year-old Thomas Matthew Crooks, was killed by a Secret Service counter-sniper.\n\nThe hearing revealed deep frustrations and combative exchanges, with the acting director taking a different approach than his predecessor, Kimberly Cheatle, who had resigned the previous week. Cheatle had faced bipartisan criticism for her vague responses during her testimony.\n\nThe focus of the session was the lack of timely information received by the Secret Service about Crooks being on the roof. Local law enforcement officers had noticed Crooks, described as suspicious, but lost track of him before he ascended a building's roof. A local officer who checked the roof saw Crooks with a rifle but retreated without relaying this information effectively.\n\n\"No information regarding a weapon on a roof was ever passed to our personnel,\" Rowe said. \"It is troubling to me that we did not get that information as quickly as we should have. We didn't know that there was this incident going on.\"\n\nThe criticism of local law enforcement by the acting director drew strong reactions from Senate Republicans, accusing him of not taking sufficient responsibility for the incident.\n\nSen. Josh Hawley, a Missouri Republican, questioned, \"Isn't it the fact that the former president was shot, that a good American is dead, that other Americans were critically wounded -- isn't that enough mission failure for you to say to the person who decided that that building should not be the security perimeter, probably ought to be stepped down?\"\n\nIn response, the acting director, with heightened said, \"I have lost sleep over this for the last 17 days and that he would not be rushed to judgment by Congress, but he assured lawmakers that people will be held accountable.\"\n\nSen. Lindsey Graham, the top Republican on the Senate Judiciary Committee, remarked that in the military, significant failures would result in numerous firings. \"Nothing's going to change until somebody loses their job,\" he added.\n\nHowever, Rowe refused to \"rush to judgement\" and promised to get to the bottom of the issue that lead to lapse in security. \"You're asking me, senator, to completely make a rush to judgment about somebody failing,\" Rowe said.\"This was a failure and we will get to the bottom of it,\" he added.\n\nDuring the session, Deputy Director of the FBI Paul Abbate added new information about Crooks. According to Abbate, Crooks had a social media account advocating political violence, antisemitism, and anti-immigrant views. These posts were from 2019 and 2020 when Crooks was in high school.\n\nThe FBI had also indicated that Crooks had researched mass shootings, power plants, improvised explosive devices, and the May assassination attempt of the Slovakian prime minister. Additionally, Trump agreed to be interviewed by the FBI as a victim of the crime, scheduled for Thursday. The former president had appeared in public events following the shooting with a bandage on his right ear.\n\nThe Secret Service acting director's predecessor, Cheatle, during her testimony, had labeled the Secret Service's failure to protect Trump as the most significant operational failure in decades. She expressed a commitment to uncovering the reasons behind the failure to prevent a recurrence.\n\nShe acknowledged receiving multiple reports about a suspicious person before the shooting and identified that the roof from which Crooks fired had been marked as a potential vulnerability before the rally.\n\nTrump, in a Fox News interview, defended the Secret Service agents who protected him but criticized the lack of roof surveillance and coordination with local police. \"They didn't speak to each other,\" he said.\n\nTrump praised the sniper who neutralized Crooks, calling the shot \"amazing,\" but also observed, \"It would have been good if it was nine seconds sooner.\"\n\nAt TOI World Desk, our dedicated team of seasoned journalists and passionate writers tirelessly sifts through the vast tapestry of global events to bring you the latest news and diverse perspectives round the clock.

It also suggested that Rowe, with ready and detailed answers, was determined to strike a different posture than that of his predecessor, Kimberly Cheatle, who resigned last week after facing intense criticism from lawmakers from both major political parties after responses that were seen as evasive and lacking in specifics.\n\nMuch of Tuesday's hearing before the Senate Judiciary and Homeland Security committees focused on what Rowe suggested was inadequate information received by Secret Service personnel in the hour before the shooting, including that Crooks had been spotted on the roof.\n\nLocal law enforcement officers had spotted a suspicious-looking man pacing near the metal detectors and circulated but ultimately lost track of Crooks before he scaled the roof of a building at AGR International Inc. Shortly before the shooting, a local officer climbed up to the roof to investigate. Crooks turned and pointed his rifle at the officer, who retreated.\n\n\"No information regarding a weapon on a roof was ever passed to our personnel,\" Rowe said. At another point, he noted, \"It is troubling to me that we did not get that information as quickly as we should have. We didn't know that there was this incident going on.\"\n\nBut Rowe's willingness to assign blame to local law enforcement opened him up to harsh criticism from Senate Republicans, who saw him as failing to take responsibility.\n\n\"Isn't it the fact that the former president was shot, that a good American is dead, that other Americans were critically wounded -- isn't that enough mission failure for you to say to the person who decided that that building should not be the security perimeter, probably ought to be stepped down?\" said Sen. Josh Hawley, a Missouri Republican.\n\nRowe, raising his voice, responded that he has \"lost sleep over this for the last 17 days\" and that he would not be rushed \"to judgment\" by Congress, but he assured lawmakers that \"people will be held accountable.\"\n\nSen. Lindsey Graham, the top Republican on the Senate Judiciary Committee, said if something like this happened in the military, \"a lot of people would be fired. And if a lot of people are not fired, the system failed yet again.\"\n\nHe added: \"Nothing's going to change until somebody loses their job.\"\n\nThe FBI, meanwhile, disclosed new details about Crooks, with Deputy Director Paul Abbate saying a social media account believed to be associated with the gunman suspected in the assassination attempt espoused political violence and included antisemitic and anti-immigrant sentiment. The posts were from the 2019 and 2020 timeframe, when Crooks would have been in high school.\n\nOn Monday, the FBI revealed that Crooks had looked online for information about mass shootings, power plants, improvised explosive devices and the May assassination attempt of the Slovakian prime minister.\n\nThe FBI also said that Trump has agreed to be interviewed by agents as a crime victim. Trump, who appeared at events in the days after the shooting with a bandage on his right ear, said he expects the interview to take place on Thursday.\n\nAt Cheatle's hearing last week, she said the Secret Service had \"failed\" in its mission to protect Trump. She called the attempt on Trump's life the Secret Service's \"most significant operational failure\" in decades and vowed to \"move heaven and earth\" to get to the bottom of what went wrong and make sure there's no repeat of it.\n\nCheatle acknowledged that the Secret Service was told about a suspicious person two to five times before the shooting at the rally. She also revealed that the roof from which Crooks opened fire had been identified as a potential vulnerability days before the rally.\n\nIn a Monday night interview on Fox News Channel, Trump defended the Secret Service agents who protected him from the shooting but said that someone should have been on the roof with Crooks and that there should have been better communication with local police.\n\n\"They didn't speak to each other,\" he said.\n\nHe praised the sniper who killed Crooks with what he said was an amazing shot but noted: \"It would have been good if it was nine seconds sooner.\"\n\n0 Comments Love 0 Funny 0 Wow 0 Sad 0 Angry 0\n\nBe the first to know\n\nGet local news delivered to your inbox!\n\nSign up! * I understand and agree that registration on or use of this

It also suggested that Rowe, with ready and detailed answers, was determined to strike a different posture than that of his predecessor, Kimberly Cheatle, who resigned last week after facing intense criticism from lawmakers from both major political parties after responses that were seen as evasive and lacking in specifics.\n\nMuch of Tuesday's hearing before the Senate Judiciary and Homeland Security committees focused on what Rowe suggested was inadequate information received by Secret Service personnel in the hour before the shooting, including that Crooks had been spotted on the roof.\n\nLocal law enforcement officers had spotted a suspicious-looking man pacing near the metal detectors and circulated but ultimately lost track of Crooks before he scaled the roof of a building at AGR International Inc. Shortly before the shooting, a local officer climbed up to the roof to investigate. Crooks turned and pointed his rifle at the officer, who retreated.\n\n\"No information regarding a weapon on a roof was ever passed to our personnel,\" Rowe said. At another point, he noted, \"It is troubling to me that we did not get that information as quickly as we should have. We didn't know that there was this incident going on.\"\n\nBut Rowe's willingness to assign blame to local law enforcement opened him up to harsh criticism from Senate Republicans, who saw him as failing to take responsibility.\n\nListen now and subscribe: Apple Podcasts | Google Podcasts | Spotify | RSS Feed | SoundStack | All Of Our Podcasts\n\n\"Isn't it the fact that the former president was shot, that a good American is dead, that other Americans were critically wounded -- isn't that enough mission failure for you to say to the person who decided that that building should not be the security perimeter, probably ought to be stepped down?\" said Sen. Josh Hawley, a Missouri Republican.\n\nRowe, raising his voice, responded that he has \"lost sleep over this for the last 17 days\" and that he would not be rushed \"to judgment\" by Congress, but he assured lawmakers that \"people will be held accountable.\"\n\nSen. Lindsey Graham, the top Republican on the Senate Judiciary Committee, said if something like this happened in the military, \"a lot of people would be fired. And if a lot of people are not fired, the system failed yet again.\"\n\nHe added: \"Nothing's going to change until somebody loses their job.\"\n\nThe FBI, meanwhile, disclosed new details about Crooks, with Deputy Director Paul Abbate saying a social media account believed to be associated with the gunman suspected in the assassination attempt espoused political violence and included antisemitic and anti-immigrant sentiment. The posts were from the 2019 and 2020 timeframe, when Crooks would have been in high school.\n\nOn Monday, the FBI revealed that Crooks had looked online for information about mass shootings, power plants, improvised explosive devices and the May assassination attempt of the Slovakian prime minister.\n\nThe FBI also said that Trump has agreed to be interviewed by agents as a crime victim. Trump, who appeared at events in the days after the shooting with a bandage on his right ear, said he expects the interview to take place on Thursday.\n\nAt Cheatle's hearing last week, she said the Secret Service had \"failed\" in its mission to protect Trump. She called the attempt on Trump's life the Secret Service's \"most significant operational failure\" in decades and vowed to \"move heaven and earth\" to get to the bottom of what went wrong and make sure there's no repeat of it.\n\nCheatle acknowledged that the Secret Service was told about a suspicious person two to five times before the shooting at the rally. She also revealed that the roof from which Crooks opened fire had been identified as a potential vulnerability days before the rally.\n\nIn a Monday night interview on Fox News Channel, Trump defended the Secret Service agents who protected him from the shooting but said that someone should have been on the roof with Crooks and that there should have been better communication with local police.\n\n\"They didn't speak to each other,\" he said.\n\nHe praised the sniper who killed Crooks with what he said was an amazing shot but noted: \"It would have been good if it was nine seconds sooner.\"\n\nLove 0 Funny 0 Wow 0 Sad 0 Angry 0\n\nGet Government & Politics updates in your inbox!\n\nStay up-to-date on the latest in local and national government and political topics with our

(Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images)\n\nTop FBI and Secret Service officials testified Tuesday about security failures that led to the attempted assassination of former President Donald Trump 17 days earlier.\n\nThe Senate Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee held a rare joint hearing with the Senate Judiciary Committee that featured testimony from the Secret Service's acting director, Ronald L. Rowe.\n\nRowe, previously deputy director, took over for Kimberly Cheatle after she stepped down as Secret Service director July 23, one day after a bruising House oversight hearing.\n\nFBI Deputy Director Paul Abbate, who also testified, gave the Senate committees some details about the time line before the shooter opened fire July 13 at the campaign rally in Butler, Pennsylvania. One bullet grazed Trump's right ear at about 6:11 p.m.; another killed firefighter Corey Comperatore. The gunman also wounded two other rallygoers.\n\nHouse Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., last week established a special task force to investigate the Trump assassination attempt.\n\nHere are six top takeaways from the two Senate panels' hearing.\n\nRowe and other Secret Service agents visited the site of the campaign rally in Pennsylvania after the fact. He said he climbed onto the rooftop where the 20-year-old gunman fired at Trump.\n\n\"I went to the roof of the AGR building where the assailant fired shots and I laid in a prone position to evaluate his line of sight. What I saw made me ashamed,\" Rowe said during his opening remarks.\n\n\"As a career law enforcement officer and a 25-year veteran with the Secret Service, I cannot defend why that roof was not better secured,\" he added.\n\nHomeland Security and Governmental Affairs Chairman Gary Peters, D-Mich., later pushed Rowe on the point.\n\n\"My understanding is there is a detailed site survey that is done prior to an event to identify potential threat points,\" Peters said, adding: \"How did that site survey get approved when it was so clear that that was a major threat from that building?\"\n\nRowe showed large photos of the building where the shooter positioned himself, from a reenactment that the Secret Service conducted.\n\n\"This point of view is the point of view where the countersniper team locally was posted,\" Rowe added. \"We were told that that building was going to be covered when our team leads met.\"\n\nTo demonstrate the difficulty of the countersniper's sight line, the next large photo from the reenactment showed a five-inch rise on the roof where the shooter fired.\n\nNext, Rowe showed Exhibit C.\n\n\"Shooter, no elbows, you barely make out the crown of his head,\" he said.\n\n\"Let me just tell you, our countersniper, this individual -- I know him, I consider him a friend,\" Rowe said. \"He has covered me operationally in conflict zones and when I did my time on the president's detail. He exemplifies the courage, the skill, and the ability to respond under great stress in such a short time to neutralize the threat and prevent further loss of life.\"\n\nRowe, as he did at several points during the hearing, pointed to the role of local law enforcement.\n\n\"Getting back to your questions, Senator, these are discussions that were had between the Pittsburgh field office and the local counterparts and everyone supporting that visit that day,\" Rowe said.\n\nSen. Roger Marshall, R-Kan., led a press conference held after the hearing by Senate Republicans. The security failures at the former president's campaign rally make most Americans feel unsafe, he said.\n\n\"I think it's time to realize why this is so important to people back home. Why is this the topic of conversation?\" Marshall asked. \"I'll tell you it's because people back at home don't feel safe.\"\n\nIn presenting a time line to the two Senate committees, Abbate said the FBI interviewed more than 460 people and accessed the shooter's electronic devices.\n\n\"Thus far, though absolutely nothing has been ruled out, the investigation has not identified a motive nor any co-conspirators or others with advanced knowledge,\" Abbate told the committees.\n\nAbbate added that the FBI found a social media account \"believed to be associated with the shooter\" where he posted 700 comments in 2019 and 2020.\n\n\"Some of these comments, if ultimately attributable to the shooter, appear to reflect antisemitic and anti-immigration themes, to espouse political violence, and are described as extreme in nature,\" the FBI's deputy director said.\n\n\"While the investigative team is still working to verify this [social media] account to determine if it did in fact belong to the shooter, we believe it important to note today, we believe it important to share and note today, particularly given the general absence of other information to date from social media and other sources of information that reflect on the shooter's potential, motive, and mindset,\" Abbate said.\n\nLaw enforcement officials first saw the shooter just before 4:30 p.m. July 13 before the campaign rally began. At 5:14 p.m., local law enforcement identified him as a suspicious person.\n\nA local SWAT team operator took a picture of the shooter just after 5:30 p.m. Less than half an hour later, law enforcement notified the Secret Service command post that the person was suspicious.\n\nBetween 6:02 p.m. and 6:08 p.m., law enforcement officers lost sight of him, Abbate said. At 6:06 p.m., the shooter was on the rooftop, he said. Two minutes later, officers saw him on the roof.\n\nAt 6:11 p.m., law enforcement radioed that this suspicious person had a gun. He fired about 30 seconds, with one bullet grazing Trump's ear.\n\nA Secret Service countersniper shot and killed the gunman. Eight shell casings were found next to his body on the roof, Abbate said, so he likely fired eight rounds.\n\nCommenting during the press conference afterward, Sen. Mike Lee, R-Utah, asked: \"Why didn't they remove President Trump from the stage after spectators and local law enforcement, assigned to help protect the president, had noticed that there was a guy with a rifle on a roof?\"\n\nSen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas, pushed for more information about why the Secret Service reportedly denied requests for more security from the Trump campaign -- and whether the Secret Service lied about it.\n\n\"Just after the shooting, the Secret Service put out an official statement from your spokesperson that said 'there is an untrue assertion that the former president's team requested additional security resources, that those were rebuffed. This is absolutely false,'\" Cruz said, reading the statement.\n\nThe Texas Republican then asked: \"Was this tweet accurate?\"\n\nAfter some back and forth, Rowe, the Secret Service's acting director, replied: \"If you're talking about Butler, Pennsylvania, all assets had been approved. If you are talking about media reporting of assets requested, there are times when assets were unavailable and not able to be filled, and those gaps were filled with state and local law enforcement.\"\n\nCruz also read from a story in The Washington Post about the Secret Service \"repeatedly denying\" requests from the Trump campaign for additional protection.\n\nRowe said of the report: \"That is not accurate, Senator.\"\n\n\"Assets are requested. There is a process,\" he added.\n\nHowever, when asked, Rowe said he didn't know how many requests the Trump team made for additional assets.\n\nRowe later said he couldn't recall the answer to several other questions from Cruz.\n\nCruz, pointing to a poster board showing the wording of the Secret Service spokesperson's tweet, asked: \"Did you approve this statement when it went out?\"\n\nRowe replied, \"I don't know if I did or didn't.\"\n\nThe spokesperson is still employed by the agency, he replied to another question.\n\n\"So he lied on behalf of the Secret Service and he still has a job,\" Cruz said.\n\nCruz asked whether Cheatle, the agency's former director, approved the statement.\n\nCruz later asked: \"Who makes the decision to deny those requests [for more security]? Did you make that decision?\"\n\nRowe replied, \"It's a conversation, it's not an absolute yea or nay.\"\n\nCruz brought up requests by independent presidential candidate Robert F. Kennedy Jr., the son of Sen. Robert F. Kennedy, D-N.Y., the former U.S. attorney general who was assassinated in May 1968. (RFK Jr. is also the nephew of President John F. Kennedy, who was assassinated less than five years earlier.)\n\n\"Did the same person who denied the request for additional security to President Trump also deny the requests for security to Robert F. Kennedy Jr., whose father was murdered by an assassin and whose uncle was murdered by an assassin? Did the same person make that decision?\" Cruz asked.\n\nRowe replied that the Secret Service is not partisan. When Cruz pressed him for a yes or no answer on whether the same person made both decisions, Rowe insisted: \"Senator, that is not a yes or no question. There is a process for a candidate [or] nominee to receive protection.\"\n\nDuring the GOP press conference after the hearing, Sen. Markwayne Mullin, R-Okla., said he thought the Secret Service still wouldn't hold itself accountable for the security failures in Pennsylvania.\n\n\"All we're asking the Secret Service is to give us their briefing,\" Mullin said. \"What did they break down? Where are the failure points? Because if you cannot admit you did something wrong, you're destined to do it again.\"\n\nSenate Judiciary Chairman Dick Durbin, D-Ill., used the hearing to push the need for more gun control.\n\nDurbin asserted that it's typical to see a movie where a skilled international assassin is dispatched to kill a political leader.\n\nHowever, he said, in this case, \"a 20-year-old, introverted college student\" managed to get past a sophisticated security force and get a shot at a former president.\n\nAfter making this point, Durbin quickly moved to blame the attempted assassination on the availability of guns.\n\n\"While we rely on the Secret Service to protect elected officials, we must acknowledge the unique challenges they face in light of the proliferation of weapons of war on our street,\" Durbin said.\n\n\"Pennsylvania, like many states, allows individuals to openly carry a loaded rifle without a permit,\" he said. \"To make matters worse, assault rifles can easily be purchased from the licensed dealers without a background check because of dangerous loopholes in our gun laws.\"\n\nBefore the Trump rally, the shooter surveyed the site using a drone. Yet, the Secret Service said the drones would not work in the area.\n\nSen. John Cornyn, R-Texas, asked: \"Can you explain why the shooter's drone worked?\"\n\nRowe replied: \"There was no counter-UAS [unmanned aerial system] present.\"\n\nCornyn asked: \"You had a drone system but you had bandwidth problems. The bandwidth was adequate, apparently, for the shooter's drone, but not for the Secret Service. Can you explain that?\"\n\nRowe replied, \"I have no explanation for it, sir.\"\n\n\"In the military context,\" Cornyn said, \"electronic warfare or jamming capabilities are commonly used on the battlefield.\"\n\nThe senior senator from Texas then asked: \"Does the Secret Service have jamming capabilities for drones?\"\n\nRowe said: \"We have drones, sir. ... We have technical security measures to address, I think, what you're asking me.\"\n\nCornyn followed by asking: \"Can you take down a suspicious drone? ... Do you have the capacity to stop a weaponized drone?\"\n\nRowe said there were security matters he couldn't talk about in a public forum.\n\n\"We have technical measures we use at permanently protected sites,\" Rowe said. \"We also have the ability in a limited fashion at temporary sites. What I can tell you is that on this day, the counter-UAS system had technical difficulties.\"\n\nAt the press conference afterward, Cornyn said the Secret Service's failure to answer that key question was \"another one of their multiple points of failure.\"\n\nSen. Ron Johnson, R-Wis., pointed to the photos displayed by Rowe earlier in the hearing, and questioned why the Secret Service waited so long to share them.\n\n\"I appreciate these photos today,\" Johnson said. \"These things could have been released in days and a whole lot more information as well.\"\n\nNear the beginning of his remarks at the Pennsylvania rally, Trump used an oversize chart depicting illegal border crossings that was created by Johnson's office. He turned his head slightly to point to the chart.\n\nThat slight turn has been credited for Trump's not being struck in the head by the bullet that grazed his right ear.\n\nJohnson's office released preliminary findings from his office's own investigation of the security failures July 13.\n\nJohnson pushed for more transparency and asked for transcripts of related FBI interviews.\n\n\"Does the Secret Service use encrypted communications at events?\" Johnson asked.\n\n\"The radio traffic from Butler we did not have recorded, sir,\" Rowe replied.\n\n\"Do you normally?\" Johnson asked.\n\n\"Not on the road outside of D.C., outside of a presidential or vice presidential stop,\" Rowe answered.\n\nJohnson said that is \"very unfortunate.\"\n\nRowe agreed, saying, \"Moving forward, I've directed we will now start recording those.\"\n\nJohnson pressed further about Secret Service communications with local law enforcement.\n\n\"My understanding is that what was communicated was the locals had a plan and they had been there before,\" Rowe replied.\n\nJohnson, referring to Trump's Florida home, asked: \"Was there ever requested additional coverage for Mar-a-Lago?\"\n\nRowe replied: \"We have provided additional resources to Mar-a-Lago.\"\n\nLawmaker, Johnson said, \"need to find out literally second by second what happened.\"", "source": {"uri":

She angered both Democrats and Republicans with her inability to share details of the shooting due to it being an \"ongoing investigation.\"\n\nThe acting director said he has implemented \"corrective actions\" to the Secret Service since stepping into the leadership role, including visiting the Butler rally site. Cheatle never visited the site, a fact for which House Oversight members blasted her.\n\n\"What I saw made me ashamed,\" Rowe said regarding his view of the roof at the rally site. \"As a career law enforcement officer and a 25-year veteran with the Secret Service, I cannot defend why that roof was not better secured.\"\n\nThe Senate hearing comes after Rowe gave a closed-door briefing on the assassination attempt to Judiciary and Homeland Security committee members on July 25.\n\n\"During the closed-door briefing, Acting Director Rowe was committed to providing details and answering questions that could not be answered in Monday's public Congressional hearing due to operational security and ongoing investigations,\" the Secret Service said in a statement.\n\nSenate Homeland Security Committee Chairman Gary Peters (D-MI) called the assassination attempt an \"inexcusable security and planning failure.\"\n\nSenate Homeland Security Committee ranking member Rand Paul (R-KY) said the committee requested interviews with the Secret Service agents who were in charge of security at the rally, but the committee has \"not been allowed to speak with them.\"\n\n\"I expect Director Rowe today to tell us when we will be allowed to talk to these people,\" Paul said.\n\nCLICK HERE TO READ MORE FROM THE WASHINGTON EXAMINER\n\nSenate Judiciary Committee ranking member

They did not.\n\n\"They should have been on the roof,\" the acting director of the Secret Service, Ronald L. Rowe Jr., told senators Tuesday.\n\nBut Rowe also acknowledged to lawmakers that it was the Secret Service's responsibility to make that expectation clear to the local countersnipers there that day and that his agency might have failed to do so.\n\nIt was the most straightforward explanation yet of what led to the glaring security failure that allowed a would-be assassin to fire eight shots at Trump, injuring him and others and killing a rally attendee, at the Butler Farm Show grounds on July 13. Yet Rowe often acknowledged to lawmakers that he was baffled by some of the decisions made before and on the day of the shooting, including some by his own agency.\n\nHis testimony about the delineation of responsibility for protecting a roof that was within a rifle bullet's range of Trump highlighted a weak link in the protection of the country's leaders. While the Secret Service relies on local law enforcement agencies for assistance, these officers are typically not experienced in the requirements of protective operations and therefore need detailed instructions from the federal agency.\n\n\"We need to be very direct to our local law enforcement counterparts that they understand exactly what their expectation is,\" he said.\n\nUltimately, Rowe said, the events of July 13 were a result of \"a failure of imagination\" to see that \"we actually do live in a very dangerous world where people do actually want to do harm to our protectee.\"\n\n\"But we didn't challenge our own assumptions,\" he said. \"We assumed that someone is going to cover that.\"\n\nHis comments were sure to rankle some officers who assisted at the rally. Details about what happened have been inconsistent and confusing, as the multiple federal, state and local law enforcement agencies involved have offered their own accounts, leading to a dizzying array of fingerpointing.\n\nIn Butler, Rowe said, two local countersnipers were in one of the warehouses, watching the crowd from windows at the time the shooter, later identified as Thomas Crooks of Bethel Park, Pennsylvania, ascended to the roof of the adjacent warehouse. He said that, in his view, the countersnipers would have been able to see Crooks on the roof if they had looked left out the window.\n\n\"We are looking at this, and they should have been on the roof, and the fact they were in the building is something I'm still trying to understand,\" Rowe said, adding that in the future, the Secret Service would ensure that local and state law enforcement are on roofs.\n\nLocal law enforcement officials have previously said the countersnipers were given permission from the Secret Service to surveil the fenced-in grounds from the warehouse windows because of the heat that day.\n\nRichard Goldinger, the Butler County district attorney who oversees the local countersnipers who were at the rally, issued a statement previously saying that the Secret Service never told his agents to cover the roof that Crooks used. \"I stand by my prior statement that that was not part of their duties that day,\" Goldinger said Tuesday.\n\nDuring the three-hour joint hearing before the Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs and Judiciary committees, Rowe offered more details about the sequence of events on July 13 than his predecessor, Kimberly Cheatle, did a week ago, drawing bipartisan outrage from House lawmakers. Cheatle resigned the following day.\n\nRowe described problems with communications among law enforcement agencies that delayed crucial information from being relayed to the Secret Service. There was a 30-second window between when local law enforcement saw Crooks with a firearm and when Crooks started shooting. It would have been enough time for a Secret Service countersniper to react, Rowe said, but only if the countersniper had received that information contemporaneously.\n\n\"It appears that that information was stuck or siloed in that state and local channel,\" Rowe said, drawing questions from lawmakers about why the various law enforcement agencies could not communicate with one another better.\n\nAll the Secret Service knew, he said, was that local law enforcement was working on an issue regarding a suspicious person. While the Secret Service received a photograph of Crooks about 30 minutes before the shooting, he was one of several who had drawn the eye of local law enforcement that day.\n\nThe agency also had plans to use equipment that would have detected the gunman's use of a drone hours before the shooting.

The photo was shared with local SWAT operators in a text message group more than 30 minutes before the attack. In between, local SWAT personnel saw Crooks near the building of the attack carrying a range finder and browsing news sites on his phone.\n\nHowever, the Secret Service command post wasn't notified of a suspicious person until about 5:46, and service operators lost sight of Crooks for six of the final minutes of his life, from about 6:02 p.m. to 6:08 p.m., including when he pulled himself onto the nearby rooftop.\n\nAbout 30 seconds before Crooks began unloading his weapon, a police officer who had been lifted by a fellow officer to peer onto the roof, radioed that Crooks was armed with \"a long gun.\"\n\nBut it was too little, too late.\n\nPressed by Sen. Mike Lee, R-Utah, about whether there was a communication channel to say there's a gun and the bearer needs to be taken out, Rowe said that information stayed in state and local law enforcement channels.\n\n\"(The local police) were in the midst of dealing with a very critical situation and they articulated that over the radio, as I understand it. However, it was never relayed over to us,\" Rowe said.\n\nPossible social media posts: first signs of 'extremist views'\n\nAbbate disclosed investigators have uncovered a social media account they believe belonged to Crooks, although they are still getting that verified.\n\nAbbate declined to specify the social media platform until the information is confirmed. But he did say the account posted more than 700 comments in the 2019-2020 timeframe, including anti-Semitic and anti-immigration messages.\n\n\"If it is in fact the shooter that posted these comments, it's the first real indication where he's expressing what are described as extremist views and talking about political violence,\" Abbate said.\n\nHowever, Abbate also testified that investigators are working to verify if Crooks posted left-leaning content as well. Sen. Marsha Blackburn, R-Tenn., asked Abbate to confirm Crooks expressed pro-immigration and pro-pandemic lockdown views on conservative social media platform Gab, which is associated with far-right users.\n\n\"We're still working to certify and verify that that's his account also, but it does have differing points of view, it would appear, Abbate said.\n\nScoping location six days in advance?\n\nCrooks appears to have been scoping out the site of his attack less than a week before he executed it.\n\nAbbate said Crooks visited the Butler farm show site on July 7, the day after he registered for the rally and only four days after the rally was announced.\n\nCrooks also practiced shooting at a sportsman club the day before the attack, and appears to have done more scoping on the day itself, Abbate said.\n\nOn the morning of July 13, Crooks visited the rally grounds for about 70 minutes. Later that day, after returning back home and getting a rifle from his father under the pretense of returning to the club, Crooks bought ammunition and ventured back to the rally site.\n\nAt about 3:51 p.m., Crooks flew a drone about 200 yards from the farm grounds and live streamed the approximately 11-minute flight.\n\n'I cannot defend why that roof was not better secured'\n\nRowe expressed anger at the security failures that allowed Crooks to pose a deadly threat to the Republican Party's presidential nominee. During a Pennsylvania visit, Rowe was able to see for himself the line of sight Crooks had on Trump by visiting the rally sight and lying in a prone position on the roof of the attack.\n\n\"What I saw made me ashamed,\" Rowe testified. \"As a career law enforcement officer and a 25 year veteran with the Secret Service, I cannot defend why that roof was not better secured.\"\n\nThe mea culpa on behalf of the agency charged didn't spare Rowe from some blistering criticism during the hearing.\n\n\"Your agency has not been transparent and forthcoming, so please, let's not go there,\" Sen. Josh Hawley, R-Mo., said at one point.\"\n\n\"I have been forthcoming, sir,\" Rowe shot back.\n\n\"That remains to be seen. You've been on the job a few days. So far, you've fired nobody,\" Hawley said.", "source": {"uri": "usatoday.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "USA Today"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

Woman from Valley Park drowns in Big River trying to help another canoeist\n\n\"We assumed that the state and locals had it,\" Rowe said. \"We made an assumption that there was going to be uniformed presence out there, that there would be sufficient eyes to cover that, that there was going to be counter-sniper teams\" in the building from whose roof Crooks fired shots, less than 150 yards (135 meters) from the rally stage where Trump was speaking.\n\n\"And I can assure you,\" Rowe added, \"that we're not going to make that mistake again.\"\n\nTrump, the 2024 Republican presidential nominee, was struck in the ear by a bullet or a bullet fragment in the assassination attempt, one rallygoer was killed and two others were injured before the gunman was killed by a Secret Service counter-sniper.\n\nThe blunt and at times emotional testimony Tuesday, featuring combative exchanges with lawmakers, ensured that an already simmering blame game between federal and local authorities will continue. It also suggested that Rowe, with ready and detailed answers, was determined to strike a different posture than that of his predecessor, Kimberly Cheatle, who resigned last week after facing intense criticism from lawmakers from both major political parties after responses that were seen as evasive and lacking in specifics.\n\nMuch of Tuesday's hearing before the Senate Judiciary and Homeland Security committees focused on what Rowe suggested was inadequate information received by Secret Service personnel in the hour before the shooting, including that Crooks had been spotted on the roof.\n\nLocal law enforcement officers had spotted a suspicious-looking man pacing near the metal detectors and circulated but ultimately lost track of Crooks before he scaled the roof of a building at AGR International Inc. Shortly before the shooting, a local officer climbed up to the roof to investigate. Crooks turned and pointed his rifle at the officer, who retreated.\n\n\"No information regarding a weapon on a roof was ever passed to our personnel,\" Rowe said. At another point, he noted, \"It is troubling to me that we did not get that information as quickly as we should have. We didn't know that there was this incident going on.\"\n\nBut Rowe's willingness to assign blame to local law enforcement opened him up to harsh criticism from Senate Republicans, who saw him as failing to take responsibility.\n\n\"Isn't it the fact that the former president was shot, that a good American is dead, that other Americans were critically wounded -- isn't that enough mission failure for you to say to the person who decided that that building should not be the security perimeter, probably ought to be stepped down?\" said Sen. Josh Hawley, a Missouri Republican.\n\nRowe, raising his voice, responded that he has \"lost sleep over this for the last 17 days\" and that he would not be rushed \"to judgment\" by Congress, but he assured lawmakers that \"people will be held accountable.\"\n\nSen. Lindsey Graham, the top Republican on the Senate Judiciary Committee, said if something like this happened in the military, \"a lot of people would be fired. And if a lot of people are not fired, the system failed yet again.\"\n\nHe added: \"Nothing's going to change until somebody loses their job.\"\n\nThe FBI, meanwhile, disclosed new details about Crooks, with Deputy Director Paul Abbate saying a social media account believed to be associated with the gunman suspected in the assassination attempt espoused political violence and included antisemitic and anti-immigrant sentiment. The posts were from the 2019 and 2020 timeframe, when Crooks would have been in high school.\n\nOn Monday, the FBI revealed that Crooks had looked online for information about mass shootings, power plants, improvised explosive devices and the May assassination attempt of the Slovakian prime minister.\n\nThe FBI also said that Trump has agreed to be interviewed by agents as a crime victim. Trump, who appeared at events in the days after the shooting with a bandage on his right ear, said he expects the interview to take place on Thursday.\n\nAt Cheatle's hearing last week, she said the Secret Service had \"failed\" in its mission to protect Trump. She called the attempt on Trump's life the Secret Service's \"most significant operational failure\" in decades and vowed to \"move heaven and earth\" to get to the bottom of what went wrong and make sure there's no repeat of it.\n\nCheatle acknowledged that the Secret Service was told about a suspicious person two to five times before the shooting at the rally. She also revealed that the roof from which Crooks opened fire had been identified as a potential vulnerability days before the rally.\n\nIn a Monday night interview on Fox News Channel, Trump defended the Secret Service agents who protected him from the shooting but said that someone should have been on the roof with Crooks and that there should have been better communication with local police.\n\n\"They didn't speak to each other,\" he said.\n\nHe praised the sniper who killed Crooks with what he said was an amazing shot but noted: \"It would have been good if it was nine seconds sooner.\"\n\n0 Comments", "source": {"uri": "stltoday.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "St. Louis Post-Dispatch"}, "authors": [{"uri": "associated_press@stltoday.com", "name": "Associated Press",

It also suggested that Rowe, with ready and detailed answers, was determined to strike a different posture than that of his predecessor, Kimberly Cheatle, who resigned last week after facing intense criticism from lawmakers from both major political parties after responses that were seen as evasive and lacking in specifics.\n\nMuch of Tuesday's hearing before the Senate Judiciary and Homeland Security committees focused on what Rowe suggested was inadequate information received by Secret Service personnel in the hour before the shooting, including that Crooks had been spotted on the roof.\n\nLocal law enforcement officers had spotted a suspicious-looking man pacing near the metal detectors and circulated but ultimately lost track of Crooks before he scaled the roof of a building at AGR International Inc. Shortly before the shooting, a local officer climbed up to the roof to investigate. Crooks turned and pointed his rifle at the officer, who retreated.\n\n\"No information regarding a weapon on a roof was ever passed to our personnel,\" Rowe said. At another point, he noted, \"It is troubling to me that we did not get that information as quickly as we should have. We didn't know that there was this incident going on.\"\n\nBut Rowe's willingness to assign blame to local law enforcement opened him up to harsh criticism from Senate Republicans, who saw him as failing to take responsibility.\n\nListen now and subscribe: Apple Podcasts | Google Podcasts | Spotify | RSS Feed | SoundStack | All Of Our Podcasts\n\n\"Isn't it the fact that the former president was shot, that a good American is dead, that other Americans were critically wounded -- isn't that enough mission failure for you to say to the person who decided that that building should not be the security perimeter, probably ought to be stepped down?\" said Sen. Josh Hawley, a Missouri Republican.\n\nRowe, raising his voice, responded that he has \"lost sleep over this for the last 17 days\" and that he would not be rushed \"to judgment\" by Congress, but he assured lawmakers that \"people will be held accountable.\"\n\nSen. Lindsey Graham, the top Republican on the Senate Judiciary Committee, said if something like this happened in the military, \"a lot of people would be fired. And if a lot of people are not fired, the system failed yet again.\"\n\nHe added: \"Nothing's going to change until somebody loses their job.\"\n\nThe FBI, meanwhile, disclosed new details about Crooks, with Deputy Director Paul Abbate saying a social media account believed to be associated with the gunman suspected in the assassination attempt espoused political violence and included antisemitic and anti-immigrant sentiment. The posts were from the 2019 and 2020 timeframe, when Crooks would have been in high school.\n\nOn Monday, the FBI revealed that Crooks had looked online for information about mass shootings, power plants, improvised explosive devices and the May assassination attempt of the Slovakian prime minister.\n\nThe FBI also said that Trump has agreed to be interviewed by agents as a crime victim. Trump, who appeared at events in the days after the shooting with a bandage on his right ear, said he expects the interview to take place on Thursday.\n\nAt Cheatle's hearing last week, she said the Secret Service had \"failed\" in its mission to protect Trump. She called the attempt on Trump's life the Secret Service's \"most significant operational failure\" in decades and vowed to \"move heaven and earth\" to get to the bottom of what went wrong and make sure there's no repeat of it.\n\nCheatle acknowledged that the Secret Service was told about a suspicious person two to five times before the shooting at the rally. She also revealed that the roof from which Crooks opened fire had been identified as a potential vulnerability days before the rally.\n\nIn a Monday night interview on Fox News Channel, Trump defended the Secret Service agents who protected him from the shooting but said that someone should have been on the roof with Crooks and that there should have been better communication with local police.\n\n\"They didn't speak to each other,\" he said.\n\nHe praised the sniper who killed Crooks with what he said was an amazing shot but noted: \"It would have been good if it was nine seconds sooner.\"\n\nGet Government & Politics updates in your inbox!\n\nStay up-to-date on the latest in local and national government and political topics with our newsletter.\n\nSign up! * I understand and

Lee's questions", "body": "The acting chief of the U.S. Secret Service told senators he was \"ashamed\" for his agency's failure to secure the rooftop from which a 20-year-old gunman took aim at former President Donald Trump at a rally in Pennsylvania on July 13. But despite his admission of fault, Republican lawmakers, including Sen. Mike Lee, pressed him for more answers at the Senate Judiciary Committee hearing Tuesday.\n\n\"What I saw made me ashamed,\" acting Secret Service Director Ronald Rowe said in his testimony. \"As a career law enforcement officer, and a 25-year veteran with the Secret Service, I cannot defend why that roof was not better secured.\"\n\nIn his testimony, Rowe detailed the action the federal agency has taken since the attack on Trump. But throughout the hearing, even as he explained the security failures at the rally, he failed to provide concrete answers about the Secret Service's lapses when questioned by GOP senators who accused the agency of treating Trump differently than they would President Joe Biden.\n\nSen. Mike Lee, R-Utah, pressed Rowe over why Trump took the stage minutes \"after multiple suspicious person reports were provided, complete with photos and information suggesting that the assailant had a range finder.\"\n\nRowe said the Secret Service didn't hear any communication about the individual being armed or having an intention to shoot. He said he would get back to Lee with the number of suspicious person reports the law enforcement agency received that day.\n\nIn his written testimony, Rowe said, \"At 5:43 p.m., a local Butler County Emergency Services Unit counter sniper team member texted the Secret Service counter sniper team leader about a suspicious person and sent two photos of the individual, later identified to be the assailant.\" The former president took the stage seven minutes later.\n\nLee continued, \"Would President Biden ever be allowed on stage under similar circumstances with an unresolved set of multiple suspicious person reports provided, including indicating that there was a rangefinder involved?\"\n\nTo this, Rowe said it would depend on the situation. \"For us, it comes down to ... a potential threat. Is the individual carrying an (improvised explosive device)? Is there a weapon?\"\n\nDuring his interaction with Sen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas, Rowe maintained that \"Secret Service agents are not political.\" The conversation got heated when Cruz accused the federal agency of diverting resources from the Trump campaign to first lady Jill Biden's event. Rowe said Cruz's assertion was false.\n\nMeanwhile California Democratic Sen. Laphonza Butler praised Rowe for being \"authoritative.\"\n\nShe added, \"He has proven that he had been out at the camps, at the site, and he is taking responsibility.\"\n\nAccording to CNN, Cruz said Rowe appeared more \"forthcoming\" than Kimberly A. Cheatle, the former Secret Service director, who resigned after Republicans and Democrats called for her ouster after she testified in the U.S. House.\n\n\"That's a step forward,\" the Texas senator said. \"But when asked specific questions, (Rowe) would not provide specific answers.\"\n\nRowe sidestepped several of Lee's questions, including one about the eight shell casings found next to the assailant's body. \"He was neutralized after the first shot, where did those other shots come from?\" the Utah senator asked.\n\nRowe said the Secret Service is still carrying out a ballistic analysis. He also couldn't answer why the sniper teams were assigned to the rooftop overlooking where the shots were fired.\n\nLee called on Rowe to provide details to Congress on the questions left unanswered as more information comes to light. He also asked Rowe to submit the list of requests Trump's protective detail and campaign made to the Secret Service for additional resources.\n\nThe shooter fired three shots aimed at Trump at 6:11 p.m., around the same time when the sniper team checked in with local law enforcement about a tip of a suspicious person.\n\n\"No information regarding a weapon on the roof was ever passed to our personnel,\" Rowe said at the hearing.\n\n\"Within three seconds, the former President's detail rushed the stage and covered former President Trump, shielding him with their bodies,\" Rowe said. Roughly 15 seconds later, the Secret Service neutralized the assailant. One of the first three shots pierced through Trump's ear, Rowe said.\n\nUpon Rowe's direction, the Secret Service will now require three agents to ensure security plans are vetted, expand the use of drones to detect threats on roofs and other high structures and heighten the use of agents, uniformed officers and technical support personnel for events like the upcoming Democratic National Convention in November.\n\nThe Secret Service also began protecting vice presidential nominee Sen. JD Vance and his family, as well as presidential candidate Robert F. Kennedy, Jr., whose father and uncle were killed by assassins.\n\nRowe also indicated during the hearing that the agency will add 200 agents to its force before the 2028 Olympics in Los Angeles, marking the first time the agency increased its staffing in a \"number of years.\"\n\nRowe promised his agency would cooperate with all the investigations launched into the attack, including those opened by Congress, the FBI, the Homeland Security Department and the White House.

During the intense session, both Rowe and FBI Deputy Director Paul Abbate provided insights into the investigation surrounding the incident, detailing discoveries related to the alleged assailant and outlining the security deficiencies that were evident.\n\nRowe's appearance before a joint gathering of the Senate Homeland Security and Judiciary committees followed the recent resignation of his predecessor, Kim Cheatle, who faced severe backlash for the Secret Service's management of a Trump rally in Butler on July 13, which resulted in a fatality and injuries to Trump and others.\n\nThroughout the often charged hearing, Rowe acknowledged the emotional strain that the events in Butler had on him and his personnel. \"My people are hurting right now,\" Rowe remarked, indicating the emotional rawness of the situation.\n\nOne significant shortcoming highlighted by Rowe was the inability of the Secret Service to utilize a \"counter unmanned aerial system\" before the event due to connectivity issues. This lack of preparedness may have led to the failure to detect a drone operated by the shooter, identified as Thomas Matthew Crooks, prior to the rally. Investigators later determined that Crooks had likely conducted preliminary surveillance of the site.\n\nRowe expressed, \"That is something that has cost me a lot of sleep,\" emphasizing the regret he experiences over the potential that the situation could have been mitigated if proactive measures had been taken. \"I have no explanation...I feel as though we could have found him,\" he added, suggesting that active law enforcement might have deterred the attack.\n\nRowe discussed that the Secret Service was already in the process of addressing the identified security gaps but was cautious about revealing too many specifics due to the sensitive nature of their operations. He did state that he would not await the conclusion of various investigations before implementing reforms to prevent future lapses.\n\nAmong the measures Rowe plans to introduce include improved internal communication among agents and coordination with local police, particularly in high-stakes environments. He noted that ineffective communication at the Butler event contributed to misunderstandings regarding potential threats.\n\nOne persistent question relates to how Crooks managed to bring a rifle onto the roof of a nearby building, from which he had a clear line of sight to Trump. While investigators have theories suggesting that the rifle may have been disassembled and concealed in a backpack, concrete evidence on this matter remains elusive.\n\nMoreover, as investigators sift through extensive digital evidence, they are still pursuing a clear motive for Crooks' actions. Abbate revealed the discovery of a social media account that may be linked to Crooks, containing posts reflective of extreme views, including antisemitic and anti-immigration sentiments.\n\nIn the course of the hearing, lawmakers voiced their expectations for accountability within the Secret Service. Senator Lindsey Graham noted, \"the best way to make sure it doesn't have to happen again is to fire people,\" emphasizing the need for consequences for security failures. Rowe assured that any violations of policy would be addressed and that accountability measures would be instituted, including potential terminations.\n\nThe unfolding investigation and the actions by the Secret Service leadership illustrate a significant focus on enhancing security and preventing similar incidents in the future.", "source": {"uri": "theglobalherald.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Global Herald"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Secret_Service", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "United States Secret Service"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ronald_Rowe", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Ronald Rowe"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kimberly_Cheatle", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Kimberly Cheatle"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_Abbate", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Paul Abbate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deputy_Director_of_the_Federal_Bureau_of_Investigation", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Deputy Director of the Federal Bureau of Investigation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Attempted_assassination_of_Ronald_Reagan", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Attempted assassination of Ronald Reagan"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Judiciary", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Judiciary"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Senate", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States Senate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unmanned_aerial_vehicle", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Unmanned aerial vehicle"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Department_of_Homeland_Security", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States Department of Homeland Security"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Law_enforcement", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Law enforcement"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surveillance", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Surveillance"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Opposition_to_immigration", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Opposition to immigration"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lindsey_Graham", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Lindsey Graham"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antisemitism", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Antisemitism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_media", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Social media"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Terrorism", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Terrorism", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Crime_and_Justice", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Crime and Justice", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Theft", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Theft", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Fraud", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Fraud", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 71}], "image": null, "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9772518", "eventUri": "eng-9772518", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-07-13", "textStart": 762, "textEnd": 769}], "sentiment": -0.2470588235294118, "wgt": 177, "relevance": 1}

Yet Rowe often acknowledged to lawmakers that he was baffled by some of the decisions made before and on the day of the shooting, including some by his own agency.\n\nHis testimony about the delineation of responsibility for protecting a roof that was within a rifle bullet's range of Trump highlighted a weak link in the protection of the country's leaders. While the Secret Service relies on local law enforcement agencies for assistance, these officers are typically not experienced in the requirements of protective operations and therefore need detailed instructions from the federal agency.\n\n\"We need to be very direct to our local law enforcement counterparts that they understand exactly what their expectation is,\" he said.\n\nUltimately, Rowe said, the events of July 13 were a result of \"a failure of imagination\" to see that \"we actually do live in a very dangerous world where people do actually want to do harm to our protectee.\"\n\n\"But we didn't challenge our own assumptions,\" he said. \"We assumed that someone is going to cover that.\"\n\nHis comments were sure to rankle some officers who assisted at the rally. Details about what happened have been inconsistent and confusing, as the multiple federal, state and local law enforcement agencies involved have offered their own accounts, leading to a dizzying array of fingerpointing.\n\nIn Butler, Rowe said, two local countersnipers were in one of the warehouses, watching the crowd from windows at the time the shooter, later identified as Thomas Crooks of Bethel Park, Pa., ascended to the roof of the adjacent warehouse. He said that, in his view, the countersnipers would have been able to see Crooks on the roof if they had looked left out the window.\n\n\"We are looking at this, and they should have been on the roof, and the fact they were in the building is something I'm still trying to understand,\" Rowe said, adding that in the future, the Secret Service would ensure that local and state law enforcement are on roofs.\n\nLocal law enforcement officials have previously said the countersnipers were given permission from the Secret Service to surveil the fenced-in grounds from the warehouse windows because of the heat that day.\n\nRichard Goldinger, the Butler County district attorney who oversees the local countersnipers who were at the rally, issued a statement previously saying that the Secret Service never told his agents to cover the roof that Crooks used. \"I stand by my prior statement that that was not part of their duties that day,\" Goldinger said Tuesday.\n\nDuring the three-hour joint hearing before the Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs and Judiciary committees, Rowe offered more details about the sequence of events on July 13 than his predecessor, Kimberly Cheatle, did a week ago, drawing bipartisan outrage from House lawmakers. Cheatle resigned the following day.\n\nRowe described problems with communications among law enforcement agencies that delayed crucial information from being relayed to the Secret Service. There was a 30-second window between when local law enforcement saw Crooks with a firearm and when Crooks started shooting. It would have been enough time for a Secret Service countersniper to react, Rowe said, but only if the countersniper had received that information contemporaneously.\n\n\"It appears that that information was stuck or siloed in that state and local channel,\" Rowe said, drawing questions from lawmakers about why the various law enforcement agencies could not communicate with one another better.\n\nAll the Secret Service knew, he said, was that local law enforcement was working on an issue regarding a suspicious person. While the Secret Service received a photograph of Crooks about 30 minutes before the shooting, he was one of several who had drawn the eye of local law enforcement that day.\n\nThe agency also had plans to use equipment that would have detected the gunman's use of a drone hours before the shooting. But problems with the local cellular service delayed that from happening. Rowe said this is one issue that he has lost sleep over.\n\n\"I have no explanation for it,\" Rowe said. \"We could have maybe stopped him.\"\n\nMultiple investigations are underway into what happened on July 13 and what led Crooks to try to kill Trump.\n\nTrump has complimented his Secret Service detail for its bravery. But overall, he said, there were holes.\n\n\"Nobody on that roof and, and no coordination with the police, it seems to be coming out that there was absolutely no coordination,\" Trump said Tuesday during an interview with a New York radio station. \"And that's, that's a pretty bad thing, when you think of it.\"\n\nIn one of his first actions as acting director, Rowe said, he went to the site of the shooting and specifically to the warehouse roof that the gunman used. Rowe climbed onto the building and lay on the roof so he could see the direct line that the shooter had to Trump.", "source": {"uri": "bostonglobe.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Boston Globe"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Law_enforcement", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Law enforcement"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Law_enforcement_agency", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Law enforcement agency"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Secret_Service", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "United States Secret Service"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Butler_County,_Pennsylvania", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Butler County, Pennsylvania"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Butler County, Pennsylvania"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matt_Crooks", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Matt Crooks"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assassination", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Assassination"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_government_of_the_United_States", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Federal government of the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rifle", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Rifle"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thomas_Crooks", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Thomas Crooks"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/District_attorney", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "District attorney"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bethel,_Alaska", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Bethel, Alaska"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Bethel, Alaska"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kimberly_Cheatle", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Kimberly Cheatle"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Senate_Committee_on_Homeland_Security_and_Governmental_Affairs", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "United States Senate Committee on Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_(state)", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "New York (state)"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Senate_Committee_on_the_Judiciary", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "United States Senate Committee on the Judiciary"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radio_broadcasting", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Radio broadcasting"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Firearm", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Firearm"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bipartisanship", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Bipartisanship"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unmanned_aerial_vehicle", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Unmanned aerial vehicle"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Crime_and_Justice", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Crime and Justice", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Theft", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Theft", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Fraud", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Fraud", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Job-Related", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Job-Related", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Death/Suicide", "label": "dmoz/Society/Death/Suicide", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 80}], "image": "https://bostonglobe-prod.cdn.arcpublishing.com/resizer/B7ucXXMDx32nxFzoQc0klsk3rBA=/506x0/cloudfront-us-east-1.images.arcpublishing.com/bostonglobe/BHK5W5RX76GYKDD2UU4ZQLP5AE.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9772518", "eventUri": "eng-9772518", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-07-13", "textStart": 455, "textEnd": 462, "freq": 4}], "sentiment": -0.2627450980392156, "wgt": 177, "relevance": 1}

It also suggested that Rowe, with ready and detailed answers, was determined to strike a different posture than that of his predecessor, Kimberly Cheatle, who resigned last week after facing intense criticism from lawmakers from both major political parties after responses that were seen as evasive and lacking in specifics.\n\nMuch of Tuesday's hearing before the Senate Judiciary and Homeland Security committees focused on what Rowe suggested was inadequate information received by Secret Service personnel in the hour before the shooting, including that Crooks had been spotted on the roof.\n\nLocal law enforcement officers had spotted a suspicious-looking man pacing near the metal detectors and circulated but ultimately lost track of Crooks before he scaled the roof of a building at AGR International Inc. Shortly before the shooting, a local officer climbed up to the roof to investigate. Crooks turned and pointed his rifle at the officer, who retreated.\n\n\"No information regarding a weapon on a roof was ever passed to our personnel,\" Rowe said. At another point, he noted, \"It is troubling to me that we did not get that information as quickly as we should have. We didn't know that there was this incident going on.\"\n\nBut Rowe's willingness to assign blame to local law enforcement opened him up to harsh criticism from Senate Republicans, who saw him as failing to take responsibility.\n\nListen now and subscribe: Apple Podcasts | Google Podcasts | Spotify | RSS Feed | SoundStack | All Of Our Podcasts\n\n\"Isn't it the fact that the former president was shot, that a good American is dead, that other Americans were critically wounded -- isn't that enough mission failure for you to say to the person who decided that that building should not be the security perimeter, probably ought to be stepped down?\" said Sen. Josh Hawley, a Missouri Republican.\n\nRowe, raising his voice, responded that he has \"lost sleep over this for the last 17 days\" and that he would not be rushed \"to judgment\" by Congress, but he assured lawmakers that \"people will be held accountable.\"\n\nSen. Lindsey Graham, the top Republican on the Senate Judiciary Committee, said if something like this happened in the military, \"a lot of people would be fired. And if a lot of people are not fired, the system failed yet again.\"\n\nHe added: \"Nothing's going to change until somebody loses their job.\"\n\nThe FBI, meanwhile, disclosed new details about Crooks, with Deputy Director Paul Abbate saying a social media account believed to be associated with the gunman suspected in the assassination attempt espoused political violence and included antisemitic and anti-immigrant sentiment. The posts were from the 2019 and 2020 timeframe, when Crooks would have been in high school.\n\nOn Monday, the FBI revealed that Crooks had looked online for information about mass shootings, power plants, improvised explosive devices and the May assassination attempt of the Slovakian prime minister.\n\nThe FBI also said that Trump has agreed to be interviewed by agents as a crime victim. Trump, who appeared at events in the days after the shooting with a bandage on his right ear, said he expects the interview to take place on Thursday.\n\nAt Cheatle's hearing last week, she said the Secret Service had \"failed\" in its mission to protect Trump. She called the attempt on Trump's life the Secret Service's \"most significant operational failure\" in decades and vowed to \"move heaven and earth\" to get to the bottom of what went wrong and make sure there's no repeat of it.\n\nCheatle acknowledged that the Secret Service was told about a suspicious person two to five times before the shooting at the rally. She also revealed that the roof from which Crooks opened fire had been identified as a potential vulnerability days before the rally.\n\nIn a Monday night interview on Fox News Channel, Trump defended the Secret Service agents who protected him from the shooting but said that someone should have been on the roof with Crooks and that there should have been better communication with local police.\n\n\"They didn't speak to each other,\" he said.\n\nHe praised the sniper who killed Crooks with what he said was an amazing shot but noted: \"It would have been good if it was nine seconds sooner.\"\n\nGet Government & Politics updates in your inbox!\n\nStay up-to-date on the latest in local and national government and political topics with our newsletter.\n\nSign up! * I understand and

(Anna Moneymaker/Getty Images)\n\nWASHINGTON -- When acting Secret Service Director Ronald Rowe Jr. visited the site of the campaign rally where a gunman attempted to assassinate former President Donald Trump, he went up to the roof, lying flat on his stomach, to evaluate the shooter's line of sight that mid-July day.\n\n\"What I saw made me ashamed,\" Rowe told U.S. senators Tuesday. \"As a career law enforcement officer and a 25-year-veteran with the Secret Service, I cannot defend why that roof was not better secured.\"\n\nRowe recounted his trip to Butler, Pennsylvania, which he said took place after being named acting director July 23, at a joint hearing of the Senate Judiciary and Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs committees examining the security failures that led to the assassination attempt. Deputy FBI Director Paul Abbate also testified.\n\nIt was the first Senate hearing on the attempted assassination since a shooter killed one rallygoer, injured two others and shot Trump's ear using an AR-15-style rifle during a campaign event in Butler on July 13. The 20-year-old gunman was killed at the scene.\n\n\"Let me be clear: This was an attack on our democracy,\" said Sen. Gary Peters, chairman of the Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee.\n\n\"Americans should be able to attend a political rally and express their political beliefs without fear of violence, and political candidates for our nation's highest office should be confident that their safety will never be compromised for their service,\" the Michigan Democrat added.\n\nPeters launched a bipartisan investigation into the security failures leading to the assassination attempt alongside ranking Republican Rand Paul of Kentucky. It's one of several congressional inquiries examining the failures of law enforcement that day.\n\nRowe stepped into his post after Kimberly Cheatle resigned as director last week. The day before her resignation, Cheatle testified in front of the House Committee on Oversight and Accountability, where lawmakers on both sides of the aisle berated her over the agency's failures to prevent the attempted assassination of Trump.\n\nFacing heavy criticism, many lawmakers called on Cheatle to resign. House Oversight Chairman James Comer of Kentucky and ranking member Jamie Raskin of Maryland also urged her to step down in a joint letter shortly after that hearing.\n\nRowe said the attempted assassination was \"a failure to imagine that we actually do live in a very dangerous world where people do actually want to do harm to our protectees.\"\n\n\"I think it was a failure to challenge our own assumptions -- the assumptions that we know our partners are going to do everything they can, and they do this every day,\" he added.\n\nSenators sought to uncover what went wrong, what policies are in place to facilitate real-time information sharing between the Secret Service and local law enforcement during an event and whether the Secret Service is developing a security plan for the upcoming Democratic National Convention in Chicago that takes into account what they learned from the July shooting.\n\nNeither the Secret Service counter sniper teams nor members of Trump's security detail \"had any knowledge that there was a man on the roof of the ... building with a firearm,\" according to Rowe.\n\nRowe said \"prior to that, they were operating with the knowledge that local law enforcement was working an issue of a suspicious individual prior to the shots being fired.\"\n\nAbbate noted that despite not having any definitive evidence as to how the gunman got the weapon onto the roof, they believe based on what they have gathered thus far that he likely had the rifle in a backpack.\n\nMeanwhile, Abbate said the FBI uncovered a social media account believed to be associated with the shooter, though they are still working to verify that the account belonged to him.\n\nMore than 700 comments were posted from the social media account \"in about the 2019, 2020 timeframe,\" when the shooter would have been in his mid-teens, and some of the comments \"appear to reflect antisemitic and anti-immigration themes to espouse political violence and are described as extreme in nature,\" Abbate said.\n\nAbbate said though nothing has been ruled out, the FBI's investigation has not identified any motive, co-conspirators or people with advanced knowledge. The FBI has so far held more than 460 interviews, received over 2,000 tips from the public, executed search warrants and seized electronic media.\n\nTuesday's hearing came the day after U.S. House Speaker Mike Johnson and Democratic Leader Hakeem Jeffries announced 13 lawmakers comprising a bipartisan task force to investigate the attempted assassination. The resolution creating the panel requires a final report by mid-December.\n\nRep. Mike Kelly, a Pennsylvania Republican whose district includes Butler, will chair the task force.\n\nRepublican Sen. Chuck Grassley of Iowa and Democratic Sen. Catherine Cortez Masto of Nevada introduced bipartisan legislation last week that would require Senate confirmation of Secret Service directors and limit them to one term of 10 years.", "source":

Joe sets give estate shoppers chance to live out their 'man-childhood'\n\nSenate lawmakers are grilling the officials about law enforcement lapses in the hours before the attempted assassination of Trump in the latest in a series of congressional hearings dedicated to the shooting.\n\nRowe became acting director of the agency last week after Kimberly Cheatle resigned in the aftermath of a House hearing in which she was berated by lawmakers and failed to answer specific questions about the communication failures preceding the July 13 shooting.\n\n\"If this happened in the military, a lot of people would be fired,\" said Sen. Lindsey Graham, the top Republican on the Senate Judiciary Committee. \"And if a lot of people are not fired, the system failed yet again.\n\nHe added: \"Nothing's going to change until somebody loses their job.\"\n\nThe hearing comes one day after the FBI released new details about its investigation into the shooting, revealing that the gunman had looked online for information about mass shootings, power plants, improvised explosive devices and the May assassination attempt of the Slovakian prime minister.\n\nListen now and subscribe: Apple Podcasts | Google Podcasts | Spotify | RSS Feed | SoundStack | All Of Our Podcasts\n\nThe FBI also said that Trump, the 2024 Republican presidential nominee, has agreed to be interviewed by agents as a crime victim. The bureau said last week that the former president had been struck in the ear by a bullet or fragment of one. Trump said Monday evening that he expected that interview to take place on Thursday.\n\nBut most of the questions Tuesday are expected to be directed at Rowe as lawmakers demand answers about how Crooks was able to get so close to Trump. Investigators believe Crooks fired eight shots in Trump's direction from an AR-style rifle after scaling the roof of a building of some 135 meters (147 yards) from where Trump was speaking in Butler, Pennsylvania.\n\nOne rallygoer was killed, and two others were injured. Crooks was shot dead by a Secret Service counter-sniper.\n\nAt her hearing last week, Cheatle said the Secret Service had \"failed\" in its mission to protect Trump. She called the attempt on Trump's life the Secret Service's \"most significant operational failure\" in decades and vowed to \"move heaven and earth\" to get to the bottom of what went wrong and make sure there's no repeat of it.\n\nPhotos: Trump injured, 2 killed in shooting at rally\n\nCheatle acknowledged that the Secret Service was told about a suspicious person two to five times before the shooting at the rally. She also revealed that the roof from which Crooks opened fire had been identified as a potential vulnerability days before the rally.\n\nCheatle said she apologized to Trump in a phone call after the assassination attempt.\n\nIn a Monday night interview on Fox News Channel, Trump defended the Secret Service agents who protected him from the shooting but said that someone should have been on the roof with Crooks and that there should have been better communication with local police.\n\n\"They didn't speak to each other,\" he said.\n\nHe praised the sniper who killed Crooks with what he said was an amazing shot but noted: \"It would have been good if it was nine seconds sooner.\"\n\nLove 0 Funny 0 Wow 0 Sad 0 Angry 0\n\nGet Government & Politics updates in your inbox!\n\nStay up-to-date

It also suggested that Rowe, with ready and detailed answers, was determined to strike a different posture than that of his predecessor, Kimberly Cheatle, who resigned last week after facing intense criticism from lawmakers from both major political parties after responses that were seen as evasive and lacking in specifics.\n\nMuch of Tuesday's hearing before the Senate Judiciary and Homeland Security committees focused on what Rowe suggested was inadequate information received by Secret Service personnel in the hour before the shooting, including that Crooks had been spotted on the roof.\n\nLocal law enforcement officers had spotted a suspicious-looking man pacing near the metal detectors and circulated but ultimately lost track of Crooks before he scaled the roof of a building at AGR International Inc. Shortly before the shooting, a local officer climbed up to the roof to investigate. Crooks turned and pointed his rifle at the officer, who retreated.\n\n\"No information regarding a weapon on a roof was ever passed to our personnel,\" Rowe said. At another point, he noted, \"It is troubling to me that we did not get that information as quickly as we should have. We didn't know that there was this incident going on.\"\n\nBut Rowe's willingness to assign blame to local law enforcement opened him up to harsh criticism from Senate Republicans, who saw him as failing to take responsibility.\n\nListen now and subscribe: Apple Podcasts | Google Podcasts | Spotify | RSS Feed | SoundStack | All Of Our Podcasts\n\n\"Isn't it the fact that the former president was shot, that a good American is dead, that other Americans were critically wounded -- isn't that enough mission failure for you to say to the person who decided that that building should not be the security perimeter, probably ought to be stepped down?\" said Sen. Josh Hawley, a Missouri Republican.\n\nRowe, raising his voice, responded that he has \"lost sleep over this for the last 17 days\" and that he would not be rushed \"to judgment\" by Congress, but he assured lawmakers that \"people will be held accountable.\"\n\nSen. Lindsey Graham, the top Republican on the Senate Judiciary Committee, said if something like this happened in the military, \"a lot of people would be fired. And if a lot of people are not fired, the system failed yet again.\"\n\nHe added: \"Nothing's going to change until somebody loses their job.\"\n\nThe FBI, meanwhile, disclosed new details about Crooks, with Deputy Director Paul Abbate saying a social media account believed to be associated with the gunman suspected in the assassination attempt espoused political violence and included antisemitic and anti-immigrant sentiment. The posts were from the 2019 and 2020 timeframe, when Crooks would have been in high school.\n\nOn Monday, the FBI revealed that Crooks had looked online for information about mass shootings, power plants, improvised explosive devices and the May assassination attempt of the Slovakian prime minister.\n\nThe FBI also said that Trump has agreed to be interviewed by agents as a crime victim. Trump, who appeared at events in the days after the shooting with a bandage on his right ear, said he expects the interview to take place on Thursday.\n\nAt Cheatle's hearing last week, she said the Secret Service had \"failed\" in its mission to protect Trump.

(AP Photo/Rod Lamkey, Jr.)\n\nWASHINGTON - Recent revelations surrounding the assassination attempt on former President Donald Trump have exposed critical failures within the Secret Service. During a high-profile hearing on Capitol Hill Tuesday, Acting Secret Service Director Ronald Rowe testified about significant oversights in the agency's security measures.\n\nIn his testimony before two Senate committees, Rowe conceded that the Secret Service's failure to secure the roof from which the gunman fired was a grave error.\n\n\"I went to the roof of the AGR building where the assailant fired shots and I laid in a prone position to evaluate his line of sight. What I saw made me ashamed,\" Rowe stated. His remarks represent the agency's most direct admission of fault since the attack on July 13th.\n\nThe revelation comes on the heels of new information from the FBI. It was disclosed that the gunman, identified as Thomas Crooks, had actively searched for details on previous mass casualty events as well as current and former U.S. Presidents, raising questions about the effectiveness of the Secret Service's intelligence and security protocols.\n\nDuring the hearing, Rowe emphasized that the failure lay not with local law enforcement but with the Secret Service.\n\n\"As a career law enforcement officer and a 25-year veteran of the Secret Service, I cannot defend why that roof was not better secured,\" he said.\n\nThis admission follows Rowe's appointment to lead the agency after Director Kimberly Cheatle resigned under pressure for failing to address communication failures during a previous House hearing.\n\nSen. Roger Marshall (R-Kansas) criticized the Secret Service's handling of the situation, labeling it a \"dysfunctional organization\" and pointing to serious lapses in security management.\n\nAdding to the scrutiny, members of the Beaver County SWAT team, who played a critical role during the incident, expressed frustration over the lack of communication and coordination with the Secret Service.\n\nGreg Nichol, a member of the SWAT team, noted that the shooter's behavior seemed suspicious and out of place but questioned whether this information reached Trump's security detail.\n\nJason Woods, also from the Beaver County SWAT, highlighted that there was no face-to-face briefing with Secret Service snipers before the rally.\n\nIn response to these revelations, former President Trump defended the Secret Service agents but criticized the lack of security on the roof and poor communication with local police. Trump has agreed to be interviewed by FBI agents regarding the incident, with the interview expected to take place on Thursday.", "source": {"uri": "cbn.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "CBN.com - The Christian Broadcasting Network"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ronald_Rowe", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Ronald Rowe"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Secret_Service", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "United States Secret Service"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Attempted_assassination_of_Ronald_Reagan", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Attempted assassination of Ronald Reagan"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Senate", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "United States Senate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Bureau_of_Investigation", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Federal Bureau of Investigation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_Abbate", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Paul Abbate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Senate_Committee_on_Homeland_Security_and_Governmental_Affairs", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States Senate Committee on Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capitol_Hill", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Capitol Hill"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Judiciary", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Judiciary"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republican_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Republican Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Washington,_D.C.", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Washington, D.C."}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Washington, D.C."}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thomas_Crooks", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Thomas Crooks"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Law_enforcement", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Law enforcement"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kimberly_Cheatle", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Kimberly Cheatle"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roger_Marshall_(politician)", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Roger Marshall (politician)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SWAT", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "SWAT"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sniper", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Sniper"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Associated_Press", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Associated Press"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beaver_County,_Pennsylvania", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Beaver County, Pennsylvania"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Beaver County, Pennsylvania"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Terrorism", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Terrorism", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Warfare_and_Conflict", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Warfare and Conflict", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Theft", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Theft", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Government_Operations", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Government Operations", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Government/Intelligence", "label": "dmoz/Society/Government/Intelligence", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 92}], "image": "https://www2.cbn.com/sites/default/files/media/slider/images/secretserviceronaldroweap.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9772518", "eventUri": "eng-9772518", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-07-13", "textStart": 1213, "textEnd": 1222}], "sentiment": -0.3333333333333334, "wgt": 176, "relevance": 1}

Lindsey Graham, the top Republican on the Senate Judiciary Committee. \"And if a lot of people are not fired, the system failed yet again.\n\nHe added: \"Nothing's going to change until somebody loses their job.\"\n\nThe hearing comes one day after the FBI released new details about its investigation into the shooting, revealing that the gunman had looked online for information about mass shootings, power plants, improvised explosive devices and the May assassination attempt of the Slovakian prime minister.\n\nListen now and subscribe: Apple Podcasts | Google Podcasts | Spotify | RSS Feed | SoundStack | All Of Our Podcasts\n\nThe FBI also said that Trump, the 2024 Republican presidential nominee, has agreed to be interviewed by agents as a crime victim. The bureau said last week that the former president had been struck in the ear by a bullet or fragment of one. Trump said Monday evening that he expected that interview to take place on Thursday.\n\nBut most of the questions Tuesday are expected to be directed at Rowe as lawmakers demand answers about how Crooks was able to get so close to Trump. Investigators believe Crooks fired eight shots in Trump's direction from an AR-style rifle after scaling the roof of a building of some 135 meters (147 yards) from where Trump was speaking in Butler, Pennsylvania.\n\nOne rallygoer was killed, and two others were injured. Crooks was shot dead by a Secret Service counter-sniper.\n\nAt her hearing last week, Cheatle said the Secret Service had \"failed\" in its mission to protect Trump. She called the attempt on Trump's life the Secret Service's \"most significant operational failure\" in decades and vowed to \"move heaven and earth\" to get to the bottom of what went wrong and make sure there's no repeat of it.\n\nPhotos: Trump injured, 2 killed in shooting at rally\n\nCheatle acknowledged that the Secret Service was told about a suspicious person two to five times before the shooting at the rally. She also revealed that the roof from which Crooks opened fire had been identified as a potential vulnerability days before the rally.\n\nCheatle said she apologized to Trump in a phone call after the assassination attempt.\n\nIn a Monday night interview on Fox News Channel, Trump defended the Secret Service agents who protected him from the shooting but said that someone should have been on the roof with Crooks and that there should have been better communication with local police.\n\n\"They didn't speak to each other,\" he said.\n\nHe praised the sniper who killed Crooks with what he said was an amazing shot but noted: \"It would have been good if it was nine seconds sooner.\"\n\nSubscribe to stay connected to Tucson.

Rowe Jr., the acting director, provided a more complete account of what happened that day than his predecessor did a week ago, he failed to answer a crucial question about that day: Who was supposed to be watching that roof?\n\nIn one of his first actions as acting director, Rowe said he went to the site of the shooting in Butler, Pennsylvania, and specifically to the warehouse roof that the gunman used, which had been unmanned and apparently unwatched.\n\nRowe said he climbed onto the building and laid on the roof so he could see the direct line that the shooter, later identified as Thomas Crooks of Bethel Park, Pennsylvania, had to Trump.\n\n\"What I saw made me ashamed,\" Rowe told a joint hearing of the Senate Homeland Security and Judiciary committees. \"As a career law enforcement officer and a 25-year veteran with the Secret Service, I cannot defend why that roof was not better secured.\"\n\nHe said the Secret Service would ensure that local and or state law enforcement are on roofs in the future. In Butler, there were two local countersnipers in one of the warehouse buildings, watching the crowd from windows, at the time Crooks ascended to the roof of the adjacent warehouse.\n\n\"We are looking at this, and they should have been on the roof, and the fact they were in the building is something I'm still trying to understand,\" Rowe said.\n\nThe Butler County district attorney, who oversees local countersnipers who were at the rally, has previously said that the Secret Service never told his agents to cover the roof Crooks used.\n\nRowe described problems with communications among law enforcement agencies that ultimately delayed crucial information from being relayed to the Secret Service. He said that the agency's plans to use equipment that would have detected the gunman's use of a drone hours earlier was stymied by the local cellular service.\n\nUltimately, Rowe said, the events of July 13 were a result of \"a failure of imagination\" to see that \"we actually do live in a very dangerous world where people do actually want to do harm to our protectee.\"\n\n\"But we didn't challenge our own assumptions,\" he said. \"We assumed that someone is going to cover that.\"\n\nThis article originally appeared in The New York Times.", "source": {"uri": "westhawaiitoday.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "West Hawaii Today"}, "authors": [{"uri": "none@westhawaiitoday.com", "name": "none", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Secret_Service", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "United States Secret Service"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Law_enforcement", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Law enforcement"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Washington_(state)", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Washington (state)"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Washington (state)"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Butler,_Pennsylvania", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Butler, Pennsylvania"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Butler, Pennsylvania"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thomas_Crooks", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Thomas Crooks"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Garth_Crooks", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Garth Crooks"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Judiciary", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Judiciary"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Senate", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United States Senate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Department_of_Homeland_Security", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United States Department of Homeland Security"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bethel_Park,_Pennsylvania", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Bethel Park, Pennsylvania"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Bethel Park, Pennsylvania"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Law_enforcement_agency", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Law enforcement agency"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/District_attorney", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "District attorney"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_New_York_Times", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "The New York Times"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Butler_County,_Pennsylvania", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Butler County, Pennsylvania"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Butler County, Pennsylvania"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Business/Business_Services/Fire_and_Security", "label": "dmoz/Business/Business Services/Fire and Security", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Law/Legal_Information", "label": "dmoz/Society/Law/Legal Information", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Construction_and_Maintenance/Building_Types", "label": "dmoz/Business/Construction and Maintenance/Building Types", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Water_Sports/Rowing", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Water Sports/Rowing", "wgt": 23}, {"uri": "dmoz/Home/Home_Improvement/Exterior", "label": "dmoz/Home/Home Improvement/Exterior", "wgt": 17}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 95}], "image": "https://www.westhawaiitoday.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/web1_TRUMP-SHOOTING-INQUIRY.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9772518", "eventUri": "eng-9772518", "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Washington (state)"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-07-13", "textStart": 97, "textEnd": 104, "freq": 2}], "sentiment": -0.1137254901960785, "wgt": 175, "relevance": 1}

Deputy FBI Director Paul Abbate also testified.\n\nIt was the first Senate hearing on the attempted assassination since a shooter killed one rallygoer, injured two others and shot Trump's ear using an AR-15-style rifle during a campaign event in Butler on July 13. The 20-year-old gunman was killed at the scene.\n\n\"Let me be clear: This was an attack on our democracy,\" said Sen. Gary Peters, chairman of the Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee.\n\n\"Americans should be able to attend a political rally and express their political beliefs without fear of violence, and political candidates for our nation's highest office should be confident that their safety will never be compromised for their service,\" the Michigan Democrat added.\n\nPeters launched a bipartisan investigation into the security failures leading to the assassination attempt alongside ranking Republican Rand Paul of Kentucky. It's one of several congressional inquiries examining the failures of law enforcement that day.\n\nRowe stepped into his post after Kimberly Cheatle resigned as director last week. The day before her resignation, Cheatle testified in front of the House Committee on Oversight and Accountability, where lawmakers on both sides of the aisle berated her over the agency's failures to prevent the attempted assassination of Trump.\n\nFacing heavy criticism, many lawmakers called on Cheatle to resign. House Oversight Chairman James Comer of Kentucky and ranking member Jamie Raskin of Maryland also urged her to step down in a joint letter shortly after that hearing.\n\nRowe said the attempted assassination was \"a failure to imagine that we actually do live in a very dangerous world where people do actually want to do harm to our protectees.\"\n\n\"I think it was a failure to challenge our own assumptions -- the assumptions that we know our partners are going to do everything they can, and they do this every day,\" he added.\n\nSenators sought to uncover what went wrong, what policies are in place to facilitate real-time information sharing between the Secret Service and local law enforcement during an event and whether the Secret Service is developing a security plan for the upcoming Democratic National Convention in Chicago that takes into account what they learned from the July shooting.\n\nNeither the Secret Service counter sniper teams nor members of Trump's security detail \"had any knowledge that there was a man on the roof of the ... building with a firearm,\" according to Rowe.\n\nRowe said \"prior to that, they were operating with the knowledge that local law enforcement was working an issue of a suspicious individual prior to the shots being fired.\"\n\nAbbate noted that despite not having any definitive evidence as to how the gunman got the weapon onto the roof, they believe based on what they have gathered thus far that he likely had the rifle in a backpack.\n\nMeanwhile, Abbate said the FBI uncovered a social media account believed to be associated with the shooter, though they are still working to verify that the account belonged to him.\n\nMore than 700 comments were posted from the social media account \"in about the 2019, 2020 timeframe,\" when the shooter would have been in his mid-teens, and some of the comments \"appear to reflect antisemitic and anti-immigration themes to espouse political violence and are described as extreme in nature,\" Abbate said.\n\nAbbate said though nothing has been ruled out, the FBI's investigation has not identified any motive, co-conspirators or people with advanced knowledge. The FBI has so far held more than 460 interviews, received over 2,000 tips from the public, executed search warrants and seized electronic media.\n\nTuesday's hearing came the day after U.S. House Speaker Mike Johnson and Democratic Leader Hakeem Jeffries announced 13 lawmakers comprising a bipartisan task force to investigate the attempted assassination. The resolution creating the panel requires a final report by mid-December.\n\nRep. Mike Kelly, a Pennsylvania Republican whose district includes Butler, will chair the task force.\n\nRepublican Sen. Chuck Grassley of Iowa and Democratic Sen. Catherine Cortez Masto of Nevada introduced bipartisan legislation last week that would require Senate confirmation of Secret Service directors and limit them to one term of 10 years.", "source":

It also suggested that Rowe, with ready and detailed answers, was determined to strike a different posture than that of his predecessor, Kimberly Cheatle, who resigned last week after facing intense criticism from lawmakers from both major political parties after responses that were seen as evasive and lacking in specifics.\n\nMuch of Tuesday's hearing before the Senate Judiciary and Homeland Security committees focused on what Rowe suggested was inadequate information received by Secret Service personnel in the hour before the shooting, including that Crooks had been spotted on the roof.\n\nLocal law enforcement officers had spotted a suspicious-looking man pacing near the metal detectors and circulated but ultimately lost track of Crooks before he scaled the roof of a building at AGR International Inc. Shortly before the shooting, a local officer climbed up to the roof to investigate. Crooks turned and pointed his rifle at the officer, who retreated.\n\n\"No information regarding a weapon on a roof was ever passed to our personnel,\" Rowe said. At another point, he noted, \"It is troubling to me that we did not get that information as quickly as we should have. We didn't know that there was this incident going on.\"\n\nBut Rowe's willingness to assign blame to local law enforcement opened him up to harsh criticism from Senate Republicans, who saw him as failing to take responsibility.\n\nListen now and subscribe: Apple Podcasts | Google Podcasts | Spotify | RSS Feed | SoundStack | All Of Our Podcasts\n\n\"Isn't it the fact that the former president was shot, that a good American is dead, that other Americans were critically wounded -- isn't that enough mission failure for you to say to the person who decided that that building should not be the security perimeter, probably ought to be stepped down?\" said Sen. Josh Hawley, a Missouri Republican.\n\nRowe, raising his voice, responded that he has \"lost sleep over this for the last 17 days\" and that he would not be rushed \"to judgment\" by Congress, but he assured lawmakers that \"people will be held accountable.\"\n\nSen. Lindsey Graham, the top Republican on the Senate Judiciary Committee, said if something like this happened in the military, \"a lot of people would be fired. And if a lot of people are not fired, the system failed yet again.\"\n\nHe added: \"Nothing's going to change until somebody loses their job.\"\n\nThe FBI, meanwhile, disclosed new details about Crooks, with Deputy Director Paul Abbate saying a social media account believed to be associated with the gunman suspected in the assassination attempt espoused political violence and included antisemitic and anti-immigrant sentiment. The posts were from the 2019 and 2020 timeframe, when Crooks would have been in high school.\n\nOn Monday, the FBI revealed that Crooks had looked online for information about mass shootings, power plants, improvised explosive devices and the May assassination attempt of the Slovakian prime minister.\n\nThe FBI also said that Trump has agreed to be interviewed by agents as a crime victim. Trump, who appeared at events in the days after the shooting with a bandage on his right ear, said he expects the interview to take place on Thursday.\n\nAt Cheatle's hearing last week, she said the Secret Service had \"failed\" in its mission to protect Trump. She called the attempt on Trump's life the Secret Service's \"most significant operational failure\" in decades and vowed to \"move heaven and earth\" to get to the bottom of what went wrong and make sure there's no repeat of it.\n\nCheatle acknowledged that the Secret Service was told about a suspicious person two to five times before the shooting at the rally. She also revealed that the roof from which Crooks opened fire had been identified as a potential vulnerability days before the rally.\n\nIn a Monday night interview on Fox News Channel, Trump defended the Secret Service agents who protected him from the shooting but said that someone should have been on the roof with Crooks and that there should have been better communication with local police.\n\n\"They didn't speak to each other,\" he said.\n\nHe praised the sniper who killed Crooks with what he said was an amazing shot but noted: \"It would have been good if it was nine seconds sooner.\"\n\n0 Comments Get Government & Politics updates in your inbox!\n\nStay up-to-date on the latest in local and national government and political topics with our newsletter.\n\nSign up! * I

It also suggested that Rowe, with ready and detailed answers, was determined to strike a different posture than that of his predecessor, Kimberly Cheatle, who resigned last week after facing intense criticism from lawmakers from both major political parties after responses that were seen as evasive and lacking in specifics.\n\nMuch of Tuesday's hearing before the Senate Judiciary and Homeland Security committees focused on what Rowe suggested was inadequate information received by Secret Service personnel in the hour before the shooting, including that Crooks had been spotted on the roof.\n\nLocal law enforcement officers had spotted a suspicious-looking man pacing near the metal detectors and circulated but ultimately lost track of Crooks before he scaled the roof of a building at AGR International Inc. Shortly before the shooting, a local officer climbed up to the roof to investigate. Crooks turned and pointed his rifle at the officer, who retreated.\n\n\"No information regarding a weapon on a roof was ever passed to our personnel,\" Rowe said. At another point, he noted, \"It is troubling to me that we did not get that information as quickly as we should have. We didn't know that there was this incident going on.\"\n\nBut Rowe's willingness to assign blame to local law enforcement opened him up to harsh criticism from Senate Republicans, who saw him as failing to take responsibility.\n\nListen now and subscribe: Apple Podcasts | Google Podcasts | Spotify | RSS Feed | SoundStack | All Of Our Podcasts\n\n\"Isn't it the fact that the former president was shot, that a good American is dead, that other Americans were critically wounded -- isn't that enough mission failure for you to say to the person who decided that that building should not be the security perimeter, probably ought to be stepped down?\" said Sen. Josh Hawley, a Missouri Republican.\n\nRowe, raising his voice, responded that he has \"lost sleep over this for the last 17 days\" and that he would not be rushed \"to judgment\" by Congress, but he assured lawmakers that \"people will be held accountable.\"\n\nSen. Lindsey Graham, the top Republican on the Senate Judiciary Committee, said if something like this happened in the military, \"a lot of people would be fired. And if a lot of people are not fired, the system failed yet again.\"\n\nHe added: \"Nothing's going to change until somebody loses their job.\"\n\nThe FBI, meanwhile, disclosed new details about Crooks, with Deputy Director Paul Abbate saying a social media account believed to be associated with the gunman suspected in the assassination attempt espoused political violence and included antisemitic and anti-immigrant sentiment. The posts were from the 2019 and 2020 timeframe, when Crooks would have been in high school.\n\nOn Monday, the FBI revealed that Crooks had looked online for information about mass shootings, power plants, improvised explosive devices and the May assassination attempt of the Slovakian prime minister.\n\nThe FBI also said that Trump has agreed to be interviewed by agents as a crime victim. Trump, who appeared at events in the days after the shooting with a bandage on his right ear, said he expects the interview to take place on Thursday.\n\nAt Cheatle's hearing last week, she said the Secret Service had \"failed\" in its mission to protect Trump. She called the attempt on Trump's life the Secret Service's \"most significant operational failure\" in decades and vowed to \"move heaven and earth\" to get to the bottom of what went wrong and make sure there's no repeat of it.\n\nCheatle acknowledged that the Secret Service was told about a suspicious person two to five times before the shooting at the rally. She also revealed that the roof from which Crooks opened fire had been identified as a potential vulnerability days before the rally.\n\nIn a Monday night interview on Fox News Channel, Trump defended the Secret Service agents who protected him from the shooting but said that someone should have been on the roof with Crooks and that there should have been better communication with local police.\n\n\"They didn't speak to each other,\" he said.\n\nHe praised the sniper who killed Crooks with what he said was an amazing shot but noted: \"It would have been good if it was nine seconds sooner.\"\n\nLove\n\n0\n\nFunny\n\n0\n\nWow\n\n0\n\nSad\n\n0\n\nAngry\n\n0\n\nGet Government & Politics updates in your inbox!\n\nStay up-to-date on the latest in local and national government and

Lindsey Graham.\n\n\"If a lot of people are not fired, the system failed yet again,\" the 69-year-old lawmaker insisted. \"Nothing's gonna change until somebody loses their job.\"\n\nRowe assured lawmakers he has already put measures in place to ensure the safety of elected officials moving forward. That includes the use of drones to detect threats on rooftops and other elevated positions.\n\nHe was unable to explain how Trump's shooter was able to survey the Butler Farm Show grounds before the former president began his rally, while the Secret Service struggled to deploy similar counteractive measures due to \"connectivity challenge.\"\n\nHis predecessor frustrated lawmakers when she failed to address questions about Trump's security detail when she testified before Congress last week.\n\nSouth Carolina Rep. Nancy Mace suggested Cheatle draft a resignation letter on the spot, while Ohio Rep. Mike Turner told her, \"You look incompetent.\"\n\nRowe told elected officials Tuesday that he has lost sleep over the Secret Service's inability to deploy a drone defense system the day Trump was fired on from roughly 150 yards away by local man Thomas Matthew Crooks.\n\n\"We could have perhaps stopped him,\" Rowe agonized.\n\nThe FBI has yet to determine a motive for the attempt on Trump's life. The gunman was a registered Republican with a seemingly small digital footprint, and wasn't known to harbor animosity toward the outspoken presidential candidate he fired upon.\n\nSome Republicans indicated they feel security for President Biden receives more attention that it does for their party's leader, whom many of them still refer to as President Trump.\n\nDuring a tense exchange with Texas Sen. Ted Cruz, Rowe felt compelled to explain the difference between a sitting president and a presidential candidate.\n\n\"Actual command authority to launch a nuclear strike!\" Rowe exclaimed.\n\nLawmakers, including Cruz, praised Secret Service agents in Pennsylvania for their bravery after bullets started pouring down on Trump and his supporters. Two bystanders were wounded and one man was killed before a counter-sniper team stopped Crooks.", "source": {"uri": "nydailynews.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Daily News"}, "authors": [{"uri": "brian_niemietz@nydailynews.com", "name": "Brian Niemietz", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Secret_Service", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "United States Secret Service"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kimberly_Cheatle", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Kimberly Cheatle"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Senate_Committee_on_the_Judiciary", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States Senate Committee on the Judiciary"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Senate", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States Senate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Bureau_of_Investigation", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Federal Bureau of Investigation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Department_of_Homeland_Security", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States Department of Homeland Security"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republican_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Republican Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Carolina", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "South Carolina"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "South Carolina"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_Abbate", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Paul Abbate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lindsey_Graham", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Lindsey Graham"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capitol_Hill", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Capitol Hill"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unmanned_aerial_vehicle", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Unmanned aerial vehicle"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pennsylvania", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Pennsylvania"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Pennsylvania"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Washington,_D.C.", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Washington, D.C."}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Washington, D.C."}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nancy_Mace", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Nancy Mace"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mike_Turner", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Mike Turner"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Biden", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ted_Cruz", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Ted Cruz"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Congress", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "United States Congress"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strike_action", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Strike action"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ohio", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Ohio"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Ohio"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Texas", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Texas"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Texas"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Business/Business_Services/Fire_and_Security", "label": "dmoz/Business/Business Services/Fire and Security", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Security", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Security", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Water_Sports/Rowing", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Water Sports/Rowing", "wgt": 22}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Security/Advisories_and_Patches", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Security/Advisories and Patches", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Security/FAQs,_Help,_and_Tutorials", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Security/FAQs, Help, and Tutorials", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 97}], "image": "https://www.nydailynews.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/GettyImages-2164437897.jpg?w=640", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9772518", "eventUri": "eng-9772518", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.2941176470588235, "wgt": 174, "relevance": 1}

It also suggested that Rowe, with ready and detailed answers, was determined to strike a different posture than that of his predecessor, Kimberly Cheatle, who resigned last week after facing intense criticism from lawmakers from both major political parties after responses that were seen as evasive and lacking in specifics.\n\nMuch of Tuesday's hearing before the Senate Judiciary and Homeland Security committees focused on what Rowe suggested was inadequate information received by Secret Service personnel in the hour before the shooting, including that Crooks had been spotted on the roof.\n\nLocal law enforcement officers had spotted a suspicious-looking man pacing near the metal detectors and circulated but ultimately lost track of Crooks before he scaled the roof of a building at AGR International Inc. Shortly before the shooting, a local officer climbed up to the roof to investigate. Crooks turned and pointed his rifle at the officer, who retreated.\n\n\"No information regarding a weapon on a roof was ever passed to our personnel,\" Rowe said. At another point, he noted, \"It is troubling to me that we did not get that information as quickly as we should have. We didn't know that there was this incident going on.\"\n\nBut Rowe's willingness to assign blame to local law enforcement opened him up to harsh criticism from Senate Republicans, who saw him as failing to take responsibility.\n\nListen now and subscribe: Apple Podcasts | Google Podcasts | Spotify | RSS Feed | SoundStack | All Of Our Podcasts\n\n\"Isn't it the fact that the former president was shot, that a good American is dead, that other Americans were critically wounded -- isn't that enough mission failure for you to say to the person who decided that that building should not be the security perimeter, probably ought to be stepped down?\" said Sen. Josh Hawley, a Missouri Republican.\n\nRowe, raising his voice, responded that he has \"lost sleep over this for the last 17 days\" and that he would not be rushed \"to judgment\" by Congress, but he assured lawmakers that \"people will be held accountable.\"\n\nSen. Lindsey Graham, the top Republican on the Senate Judiciary Committee, said if something like this happened in the military, \"a lot of people would be fired. And if a lot of people are not fired, the system failed yet again.\"\n\nHe added: \"Nothing's going to change until somebody loses their job.\"\n\nThe FBI, meanwhile, disclosed new details about Crooks, with Deputy Director Paul Abbate saying a social media account believed to be associated with the gunman suspected in the assassination attempt espoused political violence and included antisemitic and anti-immigrant sentiment. The posts were from the 2019 and 2020 timeframe, when Crooks would have been in high school.\n\nOn Monday, the FBI revealed that Crooks had looked online for information about mass shootings, power plants, improvised explosive devices and the May assassination attempt of the Slovakian prime minister.\n\nThe FBI also said that Trump has agreed to be interviewed by agents as a crime victim. Trump, who appeared at events in the days after the shooting with a bandage on his right ear, said he expects the interview to take place on Thursday.\n\nAt Cheatle's hearing last week, she said the Secret Service had \"failed\" in its mission to protect Trump. She called the attempt on Trump's life the Secret Service's \"most significant operational failure\" in decades and vowed to \"move heaven and earth\" to get to the bottom of what went wrong and make sure there's no repeat of it.\n\nCheatle acknowledged that the Secret Service was told about a suspicious person two to five times before the shooting at the rally. She also revealed that the roof from which Crooks opened fire had been identified as a potential vulnerability days before the rally.\n\nIn a Monday night interview on Fox News Channel, Trump defended the Secret Service agents who protected him from the shooting but said that someone should have been on the roof with Crooks and that there should have been better communication with local police.\n\n\"They didn't speak to each other,\" he said.\n\nHe praised the sniper who killed Crooks with what he said was an amazing shot but noted: \"It would have been good if it was nine seconds sooner.\"\n\nGet Government & Politics updates in your inbox!\n\nStay up-to-date on the latest in local and national government and political topics with our newsletter.\n\nSign up! * I understand and

Gary Peters, D-Mich., chair of the Homeland Security panel, said he has requested documentation from relevant entities related to security preparations for the event and the response to the assassination attempt from federal state and local authorities.\n\n\"By all accounts, this was an inexcusable security and planning failure, and we need to get all of the facts about what happened that day and how we can ensure an attack like this is never allowed to happen again,\" Peters said.\n\nSen. Raul Paul of Kentucky, top Republican on the Homeland Security Committee, was among the senators who questioned Acting Director Ronald Rowe Jr. about why concerns about a suspicious individual identified long before he took shots at Trump didn't raise alarms.\n\n\"The question is not whether there's enough information to take down an individual,\" Paul said. \"It's a much lower standard to say, 'Hey, we're going to wait until we get this individual. The roof and the 90 minutes of it, both I think are failures of your protocol. And I think when that's determined the person who made these decisions can't be in a position of authority again.\"\n\nRowe said the Secret Service has had difficulties keeping agents because of interest from outside in poaching talent, and a hard time filling roles because of the rigorous hiring standards including background checks and security clearances.\n\nSen. Lindsey Graham of South Carolina, the top Republican on the Judiciary panel, said the Secret Service deserves more funding and resources in addition to accountability.\n\n\"Let's get more people more time off,\" Graham concluded. \"These are tough jobs. People in this community know, I don't know how they hold a family together doing what they're doing. It's the military, really, on steroids.\"\n\nRowe admitted in his opening statement the shooting was a \"failure at multiple levels,\" saying the rooftop near the rally should have been made secure.\n\n\"What I saw made me ashamed,\" Rowe said. \"As a career law enforcement officer and a 25-year veteran with the Secret Service, I cannot defend why that roof was not better secured to prevent similar lapses from occurring in the future. I directed our personnel to ensure every event site security plan is thoroughly vetted by multiple experienced supervisors before it is implemented.\"\n\nJoining Rowe in testimony before the joint committee was Paul Abbate, deputy director of the FBI, who sought to provide an update of his agency's investigation into the failure while making clear it was still ongoing.\n\n\"This as we all know, is an extraordinarily tragic set of circumstances of the utmost national importance, making essential to inform the American public and Congress what is known right now, with full transparency,\" Abbate said.\n\nSen. Charles E. Grassley, R-Iowa, brought up a bill he wrote with Sen. Catherine Cortez Masto, D-Nev., that would make the position of Secret Service director subject to Senate confirmation and limit that person to single 10-year term.\n\nGrassley said during the hearing the bill is \"very important because no other agency has a no-fail mission.\"\n\nSen. Ron Johnson, R-Wis., had questions about whether transcriptions of interviews from independent reviews within the Secret Service and internal communications among agents on that day would be made available to Congress, and expressed disappointment at some of the answers.\n\nDuring Johnson's questioning, Rowe said he would be able to get to the Senate transcriptions of the interviews from the internal review. Rowe did not immediately answer Johnson's question about when the Wisconsin Republican when those interviews would be available, stating simply: \"We will get them done, sir.\"\n\nBut radio traffic by which the Secret Service communicated on that day would not be available, Rowe said. The acting director said the Secret Service doesn't keep its communications records \"on the road outside of D.C. or outside of a presidential or vice-presidential stop.\" Rowe said, however, moving forward the agency would begin to keep those records.\n\nJohnson was unimpressed: \"So communications between Secret Service agents will not be available like we've gotten the communications from local law enforcement.\"\n\nA heated exchange took place when Sen. Josh Hawley, R-Mo., questioned Rowe on why the Secret Service didn't have a counter-sniper positioned to take out a potential sniper on the roof where the sniper took his shot, as well as why the agency hasn't relieved of duty the lead site agent responsible for overseeing the safety for the Trump rally.\n\nRowe said he couldn't give the name of the lead site agent, adding that person is \"operational\" and still doing investigations and protective visits.\n\nRowe said that any conclusions about fault would be premature, adding he can't \"make a rush to judgment about somebody failing.\"\n\nHawley angrily questioned why a such person -- as well as others involved in the responsibility of securing the Trump rally -- hasn't been relieved of duty.\n\n\"Isn't the fact that a former president was shot, that a good American is dead, that other Americans were critically wounded -- isn't that enough mission failure for you to say that the person who decided that that building should not be in the security perimeter probably ought to be stepped down,\" Hawley said.", "source": {"uri": "rollcall.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Roll Call"}, "authors": [{"uri":

The photo was shared with local SWAT operators in a text message group more than 30 minutes before the attack. In between, local SWAT personnel saw Crooks near the building of the attack carrying a range finder and browsing news sites on his phone.\n\nHowever, the Secret Service command post wasn't notified of a suspicious person until about 5:46, and service operators lost sight of Crooks for six of the final minutes of his life, from about 6:02 p.m. to 6:08 p.m., including when he pulled himself onto the nearby rooftop.\n\nAbout 30 seconds before Crooks began unloading his weapon, a police officer who had been lifted by a fellow officer to peer onto the roof, radioed that Crooks was armed with \"a long gun.\"\n\nBut it was too little, too late.\n\nPressed by Sen. Mike Lee, R-Utah, about whether there was a communication channel to say there's a gun and the bearer needs to be taken out, Rowe said that information stayed in state and local law enforcement channels.\n\n\"(The local police) were in the midst of dealing with a very critical situation and they articulated that over the radio, as I understand it. However, it was never relayed over to us,\" Rowe said.\n\nPossible social media posts: first signs of 'extremist views'\n\nAbbate disclosed investigators have uncovered a social media account they believe belonged to Crooks, although they are still getting that verified.\n\nAbbate declined to specify the social media platform until the information is confirmed. But he did say the account posted more than 700 comments in the 2019-2020 timeframe, including anti-Semitic and anti-immigration messages.\n\n\"If it is in fact the shooter that posted these comments, it's the first real indication where he's expressing what are described as extremist views and talking about political violence,\" Abbate said.\n\nHowever, Abbate also testified that investigators are working to verify if Crooks posted left-leaning content as well. Sen. Marsha Blackburn, R-Tenn., asked Abbate to confirm Crooks expressed pro-immigration and pro-pandemic lockdown views on conservative social media platform Gab, which is associated with far-right users.\n\n\"We're still working to certify and verify that that's his account also, but it does have differing points of view, it would appear, Abbate said.\n\nScoping location six days in advance?\n\nCrooks appears to have been scoping out the site of his attack less than a week before he executed it.\n\nAbbate said Crooks visited the Butler farm show site on July 7, the day after he registered for the rally and only four days after the rally was announced.\n\nCrooks also practiced shooting at a sportsman club the day before the attack, and appears to have done more scoping on the day itself, Abbate said.\n\nOn the morning of July 13, Crooks visited the rally grounds for about 70 minutes. Later that day, after returning back home and getting a rifle from his father under the pretense of returning to the club, Crooks bought ammunition and ventured back to the rally site.\n\nAt about 3:51 p.m., Crooks flew a drone about 200 yards from the farm grounds and live streamed the approximately 11-minute flight.\n\n'I cannot defend why that roof was not better secured'\n\nRowe expressed anger at the security failures that allowed Crooks to pose a deadly threat to the Republican Party's presidential nominee. During a Pennsylvania visit, Rowe was able to see for himself the line of sight Crooks had on Trump by visiting the rally sight and lying in a prone position on the roof of the attack.\n\n\"What I saw made me ashamed,\" Rowe testified. \"As a career law enforcement officer and a 25 year veteran with the Secret Service, I cannot defend why that roof was not better secured.\"\n\nThe mea culpa on behalf of the agency charged didn't spare Rowe from some blistering criticism during the hearing.\n\n\"Your agency has not been transparent and forthcoming, so please, let's not go there,\" Sen. Josh Hawley, R-Mo., said at one point.\"\n\n\"I have been forthcoming, sir,\" Rowe shot back.\n\n\"That remains to be seen. You've been on the job a few days. So far, you've fired nobody,\" Hawley said.\n\nThis article originally appeared on USA TODAY: 4 takeaways from Senate's Trump shooting hearing: New details emerge", "source": {"uri": "aol.com",

Hassan presses Secret Service acting head over protection of Trump on July 13", "body": "WASHINGTON - Responding to questions from U.S. Sen. Maggie Hassan, D-N.H., U.S. Secret Service Acting Director Ronald L. Rowe Jr. admitted the agency's technology failed to thwart a drone that shooter Thomas Matthew Crooks flew over the Butler, Pennsylvania, rally before he shot former President Donald Trump and killed another last July 13.\n\nRowe and Deputy FBI Director Paul Abbate faced three hours of sometimes-heated questioning from the Senate Judiciary and Homeland Security Committees in this fourth hearing held on Capitol Hill since the presidential assassination attempt.\n\nA rallygoer was killed and two others were critically injured after they were struck by bullets from the AR-15-style rifle that Crooks fired at Trump.\n\nAbbate confirmed Trump was stuck in the right ear by a bullet, correcting the speculation of FBI Director Christopher Wray, who late last week said Trump could have been struck by shrapnel.\n\n\"On July 13th, major failures nearly led to the assassination of a presidential candidate who is also a former president of the United States,\" Hassan said at the hearing.\n\n\"The Secret Service has to be fully transparent about how this happened and how it's going to change moving forward.\"\n\nFBI officials said Crooks flew a drone over the property for about 11 minutes from 3:50 p.m. to around 4 p.m. that afternoon.\n\nRowe said the Secret Services' counter-drone system had \"technical difficulties\" and didn't work that day until after 5 p.m. At 6:11 p.m., Crooks began shooting.\n\nWhen Hassan asked if there was backup, anti-drone technology that could have been deployed\n\n\"We are working to determine that right now, getting the redundancies in place,\" Rowe responded.

Mike Lee, R-Utah, about whether there was a communication channel to say there's a gun and the bearer needs to be taken out, Rowe said that information stayed in state and local law enforcement channels.\n\n\"(The local police) were in the midst of dealing with a very critical situation and they articulated that over the radio, as I understand it. However, it was never relayed over to us,\" Rowe said.\n\nAbbate disclosed investigators have uncovered a social media account they believe belonged to Crooks, although they are still getting that verified.\n\nAbbate declined to specify the social media platform until the information is confirmed. But he did say the account posted more than 700 comments in the 2019-2020 timeframe, including anti-Semitic and anti-immigration messages.\n\n\"If it is in fact the shooter that posted these comments, it's the first real indication where he's expressing what are described as extremist views and talking about political violence,\" Abbate said.\n\nHowever, Abbate also testified that investigators are working to verify if Crooks posted left-leaning content as well. Sen. Marsha Blackburn, R-Tenn., asked Abbate to confirm Crooks expressed pro-immigration and pro-pandemic lockdown views on conservative social media platform Gab, which is associated with far-right users.\n\n\"We're still working to certify and verify that that's his account also, but it does have differing points of view, it would appear, Abbate said.\n\nCrooks appears to have been scoping out the site of his attack less than a week before he executed it.\n\nAbbate said Crooks visited the Butler farm show site on July 7, the day after he registered for the rally and only four days after the rally was announced.\n\nCrooks also practiced shooting at a sportsman club the day before the attack, and appears to have done more scoping on the day itself, Abbate said.\n\nOn the morning of July 13, Crooks visited the rally grounds for about 70 minutes. Later that day, after returning back home and getting a rifle from his father under the pretense of returning to the club, Crooks bought ammunition and ventured back to the rally site.\n\nAt about 3:51 p.m., Crooks flew a drone about 200 yards from the farm grounds and live streamed the approximately 11-minute flight.\n\nRowe expressed anger at the security failures that allowed Crooks to pose a deadly threat to the Republican Party's presidential nominee. During a Pennsylvania visit, Rowe was able to see for himself the line of sight Crooks had on Trump by visiting the rally sight and lying in a prone position on the roof of the attack.\n\n\"What I saw made me ashamed,\" Rowe testified. \"As a career law enforcement officer and a 25 year veteran with the Secret Service, I cannot defend why that roof was not better secured.\"\n\nThe mea culpa on behalf of the agency charged didn't spare Rowe from some blistering criticism during the hearing.\n\n\"Your agency has not been transparent and forthcoming, so please, let's not go there,\" Sen. Josh Hawley, R-Mo., said at one point.\"\n\n\"I have been forthcoming, sir,\" Rowe shot back.\n\n\"That remains to be seen. You've been on the job a few days. So far, you've fired nobody,\" Hawley said.", "source": {"uri": "ca.news.yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

One died.\n\nMr. Rowe assumed the director position after Kimberly Cheatle, the presidential appointee who was serving as director, stepped down a week after the former president was hit with a bullet.\n\nMs. Cheatle, in remarks before Congress before she resigned, said the assassination attempt represented the Secret Service's \"most significant operational failure in decades.\"\n\nLawmakers from both parties said the Secret Service should have secured the rooftop of the nearby building, or made sure other law enforcement officers secured the rooftop.\n\nSnipers spotted Mr. Crooks 1 hour and 45 minutes before shots were fired, according to texts disclosed this week, but no officers detained the suspicious person, according to officials.\n\nAfter Mr. Crooks fired the shots, he was taken out by a Secret Service sniper, officials have said.\n\nHomeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas appointed Mr. Rowe to serve as acting director. Mr. Rowe has been part of the Secret Service for 24 years. He was previously the agency's deputy director.\n\n\"I appreciate his willingness to lead the Secret Service at this incredibly challenging moment, as the agency works to get to the bottom of exactly what happened on July 13 and cooperate with ongoing investigations and Congressional oversight,\" Mr. Mayorkas said.\n\nMr. Rowe said that the Secret Service has implemented enhanced protective measures such as expanding the use of drones at sites since the rally shooting \"to ensure the people and places we protect are safe.\" He said the agency has strengthened protection for all individuals it protects, is conducting threat assessments for all the people, and has started protecting six new people, including Sen. J.D. Vance (R-Ohio), who was recently tapped to join former President Trump's ticket, and independent presidential candidate Robert F. Kennedy Jr., to whom officials had previously denied protection.\n\nMr. Rowe also said that officials are working to make sure the agency's protection of the Democratic National Convention is strong and effective, following the protection of the Republican National Convention.\n\n\"I am immensely proud of the selfless dedication of our employees to the mission,\" he said. \"Every day, across the globe, the men and women [of the Secret Service] answer the call to protect our nation's leaders and the standard is no fail for a reason.\"\n\nThe acting director said that, depending on the results of an internal probe, some employees may be disciplined. That could include termination, he said.\n\nThe Secret Service is conducting an investigation. The U.S. House of Representatives is also investigating, as is the U.S. Department of Homeland Security's inspector general.", "source": {"uri": "zerohedge.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Zero Hedge"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Secret_Service", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "United States Secret Service"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/.mr", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": ".mr"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Attempted_assassination_of_Ronald_Reagan", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Attempted assassination of Ronald Reagan"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Law_enforcement", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Law enforcement"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epoch_Times", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Epoch Times"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capitol_Hill", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Capitol Hill"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sniper", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Sniper"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Senate", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States Senate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Butler,_Pennsylvania", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Butler, Pennsylvania"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Butler, Pennsylvania"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kimberly_Cheatle", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Kimberly Cheatle"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alejandro_Mayorkas", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Alejandro Mayorkas"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Secretary_of_Homeland_Security", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United States Secretary of Homeland Security"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Congress", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United States Congress"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Independent_politician", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Independent politician"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/J._D._Vance", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "J.

The posts were from the 2019 and 2020 timeframe, when Crooks, would have been in high school.\n\nRowe is testifying before Senate legislators regarding law enforcement lapses in the hours before the incident.\n\nRELATED: Trump was struck by a bullet during assassination attempt, FBI says\n\nLast week, Rowe became acting director of the agency after Kimberly Cheatle resigned following a House hearing where she was questioned by legislators and didn't answer questions regarding communication failures before the shooting earlier this month.\n\nRowe will be joined by FBI Deputy Director Paul Abbate at a joint hearing of the Senate committees on the Judiciary and Homeland Security.\n\nRELATED: Secret Service Director Kimberly Cheatle resigns after Trump assassination attempt\n\nAccording to the Associated Press, the hearing comes a day after the FBI released new details about the probe into the shooting, stating that the shooter, Thomas Matthew Crooks, searched online for information about mass shootings, power plants, explosive devices, and the May assassination attempt of the Slovakian prime minister.\n\nThe FBI told the AP that Trump has agreed to be interviewed by agents as a crime victim.\n\nText messages reveal that authorities responsible for monitoring former President Trump's Pennsylvania rally spotted his would-be assassin and flagged him to colleagues as suspicious at least 90 minutes before he opened fire.\n\nThe messages, obtained by Fox News Digital from Sen. Chuck Grassley, R-Iowa, who obtained them from Beaver County Emergency Services Unit (ESU), showed that officers flagged Thomas Matthew Crooks after he was spotted using a range finder - but did not approach him.\n\nAccording to FOX News, the first screenshot is a group chat of Beaver ESU officers, while the second is from one Beaver County sniper departing his shift at around 4:30 - approximately 90 minutes before Trump took the stage. The New York Times first reported the text screenshots.\n\nKimberly Cheatle was called to testify in Congress more than a week after the shooting.\n\nShe called the attempt on Trump's life the Secret Service's \"most significant operational failure\" in decades, and vowed to \"move heaven and earth\" to get to the bottom of what went wrong and make sure there's no repeat of it.\n\nDemocrats and Republicans were united in their exasperation as Cheatle said she didn't know or couldn't answer numerous questions more than a week after the shooting that left one spectator dead. At one point, Mace used profanity as she accused Cheatle of lying and dodging questions, prompting calls for lawmakers to show \"decorum.\"\n\nLawmakers pressed Cheatle on how the shooter could get so close to the Republican presidential nominee when he was supposed to be carefully guarded, and why Trump was allowed to take the stage after local law enforcement had identified Crooks as suspicious.\n\nDonald Trump survived the assassination attempt before he was whisked off the stage at a rally in Butler, Pennsylvania, when gunshots rang through the crowd on July 13.\n\nThe former president and Republican nominee was showing off a chart of border crossing numbers when the sound of gunfire started ringing through the crowd. Trump could be seen reaching with his right hand toward his neck, and there appeared to be blood on his face.\n\nHe quickly ducked behind the riser as agents from his protective detail rushed the stage and screams were heard in the crowd of several thousand people. The gunfire continued as agents tended to him on stage.", "source": {"uri": "fox35orlando.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "FOX 35 Orlando"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

John Cornyn took issue with Rowe's statement, saying the Secret Service's ultimate responsibility is keeping Trump safe.\n\n\"Isn't that something that Secret Service should have covered, as opposed to delegating it to local law enforcement?\" Cornyn asked.\n\nRowe responded, \"We assumed that the state and locals had it. I can assure you that we're not going to make that mistake again.\"\n\nSen.

Trump in rural Pennsylvania, the Secret Service expected that local countersnipers would protect the warehouse roof where the gunman was able to take aim. They did not.\n\n\"They should have been on the roof,\" the acting director of the Secret Service, Ronald L. Rowe Jr., told senators on Tuesday.\n\nBut Mr. Rowe also acknowledged to lawmakers that it was the Secret Service's responsibility to make that expectation clear to the local countersnipers there that day and that his agency might have failed to do so.\n\nIt was the most straightforward explanation yet of what led to the glaring security failure that allowed a would-be assassin to fire eight shots at Mr. Trump, injuring him and others and killing a rally attendee, at the Butler Farm Show grounds on July 13. Yet Mr. Rowe often acknowledged to lawmakers that he was baffled by some of the decisions made before and on the day of the shooting, including some by his own agency.\n\nHis testimony about the delineation of responsibility for protecting a roof that was within a rifle bullet's range of Mr. Trump highlighted a weak link in the protection of the country's leaders. While the Secret Service relies on local law enforcement agencies for assistance, these officers are typically not experienced in the requirements of protective operations and therefore need detailed instructions from the federal agency.\n\n\"We need to be very direct to our local law enforcement counterparts that they understand exactly what their expectation is,\" he said.\n\nUltimately, Mr. Rowe said, the events of July 13 were a result of \"a failure of imagination\" to see that \"we actually do live in a very dangerous world where people do actually want to do harm to our protectee.\"\n\n\"But we didn't challenge our own assumptions,\" he said. \"We assumed that someone is going to cover that.\"\n\nHis comments were sure to rankle some of the officers who assisted at the rally. Details about what happened have been inconsistent and confusing, as the multiple federal, state and local law enforcement agencies involved have offered their own accounts, leading to a dizzying array of finger-pointing.\n\nIn Butler, Mr. Rowe said, two local countersnipers were in one of the warehouses, watching the crowd from windows at the time the shooter, later identified as Thomas Crooks of Bethel Park, Pa., ascended to the roof of the adjacent warehouse. He said that, in his view, the countersnipers would have been able to see Mr. Crooks on the roof if they had looked left out the window.\n\n\"We are looking at this, and they should have been on the roof, and the fact they were in the building is something I'm still trying to understand.\" Mr. Rowe said, adding that in the future, the Secret Service would ensure that local and state law enforcement are on roofs.\n\nLocal law enforcement officials have previously said the countersnipers were given permission from the Secret Service to surveil the fenced-in grounds from the warehouse windows because of the heat that day.\n\nRichard Goldinger, the Butler County district attorney who oversees the local countersnipers who were at the rally, issued a statement previously saying that the Secret Service never told his agents to cover the roof that Mr. Crooks used. \"I stand by my prior statement that that was not part of their duties that day,\" Mr. Goldinger said Tuesday.\n\nDuring the three-hour joint hearing before the Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs and Judiciary committees, Mr. Rowe offered more details about the sequence of events on July 13 than his predecessor, Kimberly A. Cheatle, did a week ago, drawing bipartisan outrage from House lawmakers. Ms. Cheatle resigned the following day.\n\nMr. Rowe described problems with communications among law enforcement agencies that delayed critical information from being relayed to the Secret Service. There was a 30-second window between when local law enforcement saw Mr. Crooks with a firearm and when Mr. Crooks started shooting. It would have been enough time for a Secret Service countersniper to react, Mr. Rowe said, but only if the countersniper had received that information contemporaneously.\n\n\"It appears that that information was stuck or siloed in that state and local channel,\" Mr. Rowe said, drawing questions from lawmakers about why the various law enforcement agencies could not communicate with one another better.\n\nAll the Secret Service knew, he said, was that local law enforcement was working on an issue regarding a suspicious person. While the Secret Service received a photograph of Mr. Crooks about 30 minutes before the shooting, he was one of several who had drawn the eye of local law enforcement that day.\n\nThe agency also had plans to use equipment that would have detected the gunman's use of a drone hours before the shooting. But problems with the local cellular service delayed that from happening. Mr. Rowe said this is one issue that he has lost sleep over.\n\n\"I have no explanation for it,\" Mr. Rowe said. \"We could have maybe stopped him.\"\n\nMultiple investigations are underway into what happened on July 13 and what led Mr. Crooks to try to kill Mr. Trump.\n\nMr. Trump has complimented his Secret Service detail for its bravery. But overall, he said, there were holes.\n\n\"Nobody on that roof and, and no coordination with the police, it seems to be coming out that there was absolutely no coordination,\" Mr. Trump said Tuesday during an interview with a New York radio station. \"And that's, that's a pretty bad thing, when you think of it.\"\n\nIn some instances on Tuesday, Mr. Rowe had the same questions as lawmakers.\n\nSenator James Lankford, Republican of Oklahoma, asked why the Secret Service did not use a surveillance drone.\n\nMr. Rowe replied, \"It appears there was an offer by a state or local agency to fly a drone on our behalf, and I'm getting to the bottom as to why we turned that down.\"\n\nSenator Roger Marshall, Republican of Kansas, asked why the building Mr. Crooks was on was not included in the Secret Service security zone in the first place.\n\n\"That's a question that I've asked, senator,\" Mr. Rowe said. \"I've been there and walked it. I had a hard time understanding why.\"\n\nIn one of his first actions as acting director, Mr. Rowe said, he went to the site of the shooting and specifically to the warehouse roof that the gunman used. Mr. Rowe climbed onto the building and lay on the roof so he could see the direct line that the shooter had to Mr. Trump.\n\n\"What I saw made me ashamed,\" Mr. Rowe said. \"As a career law enforcement officer and a 25-year veteran with the Secret Service, I cannot defend why that roof was not better secured.\"", "source": {"uri": "dnyuz.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "DNyuz"},

Gary Peters, D-Mich., chair of the Homeland Security panel, said he has requested documentation from relevant entities related to security preparations for the event and the response to the assassination attempt from federal state and local authorities.\n\n\"By all accounts, this was an inexcusable security and planning failure, and we need to get all of the facts about what happened that day and how we can ensure an attack like this is never allowed to happen again,\" Peters said.\n\nSen. Rand Paul of Kentucky, top Republican on the Homeland Security Committee, was among the senators who questioned acting Director Ronald Rowe Jr. about why concerns about a suspicious individual identified long before he took shots at Trump didn't raise alarms.\n\n\"The question is not whether there's enough information to take down an individual,\" Paul said. \"It's a much lower standard to say, 'Hey, we're going to wait until we get this individual. The roof and the 90 minutes of it, both I think are failures of your protocol. And I think when that's determined the person who made these decisions can't be in a position of authority again.\"\n\nRowe said the Secret Service has had difficulties keeping agents because of interest from outside in poaching talent, and a hard time filling roles because of the rigorous hiring standards including background checks and security clearances.\n\nSen. Lindsey Graham of South Carolina, the top Republican on the Judiciary panel, said the Secret Service deserves more funding and resources in addition to accountability.\n\n\"Let's get more people more time off,\" Graham concluded. \"These are tough jobs. People in this community know, I don't know how they hold a family together doing what they're doing. It's the military, really, on steroids.\"\n\n'Failure at multiple levels'\n\nRowe admitted in his opening statement the shooting was a \"failure at multiple levels,\" saying the rooftop near the rally should have been made secure.\n\n\"What I saw made me ashamed,\" Rowe said. \"As a career law enforcement officer and a 25-year veteran with the Secret Service, I cannot defend why that roof was not better secured to prevent similar lapses from occurring in the future. I directed our personnel to ensure every event site security plan is thoroughly vetted by multiple experienced supervisors before it is implemented.\"\n\nJoining Rowe in testimony before the joint committee was Paul Abbate, deputy director of the FBI, who sought to provide an update of his agency's investigation into the failure while making clear it was still ongoing.\n\n\"This as we all know, is an extraordinarily tragic set of circumstances of the utmost national importance, making essential to inform the American public and Congress what is known right now, with full transparency,\" Abbate said.\n\nSen. Charles E. Grassley, R-Iowa, brought up a bill he wrote with Sen. Catherine Cortez Masto, D-Nev., that would make the position of Secret Service director subject to Senate confirmation and limit that person to single 10-year term.\n\nGrassley said during the hearing the bill is \"very important because no other agency has a no-fail mission.\"\n\nSen. Ron Johnson, R-Wis., had questions about whether transcriptions of interviews from independent reviews within the Secret Service and internal communications among agents on that day would be made available to Congress, and expressed disappointment at some of the answers.\n\nDuring Johnson's questioning, Rowe said he would be able to get to the Senate transcriptions of the interviews from the internal review. Rowe did not immediately answer Johnson's question about when the Wisconsin Republican when those interviews would be available, stating simply: \"We will get them done, sir.\"\n\nBut radio traffic by which the Secret Service communicated on that day would not be available, Rowe said. The acting director said the Secret Service doesn't keep its communications records \"on the road outside of D.C. or outside of a presidential or vice presidential stop.\" Rowe said, however, moving forward the agency would begin to keep those records.\n\nJohnson was unimpressed: \"So communications between Secret Service agents will not be available like we've gotten the communications from local law enforcement.\"\n\nA heated exchange took place when Sen. Josh Hawley, R-Mo., questioned Rowe on why the Secret Service didn't have a countersniper positioned to take out a potential sniper on the roof where the sniper took his shot, as well as why the agency hasn't relieved of duty the lead site agent responsible for overseeing the safety for the Trump rally.\n\nRowe said he couldn't give the name of the lead site agent, adding that person is \"operational\" and still doing investigations and protective visits.\n\nRowe said that any conclusions about fault would be premature, adding he can't \"make a rush to judgment about somebody failing.\"\n\nHawley angrily questioned why a such person -- as well as others involved in the responsibility of securing the Trump rally -- hasn't been relieved of duty.\n\n\"Isn't the fact that a former president was shot, that a good American is dead, that other Americans were critically wounded -- isn't that enough mission failure for you to say that the person who decided that that building should not be in the security perimeter probably ought to be stepped down,\" Hawley said.\n\nHawley urged him to \"fire somebody.\"\n\n\u00a92024 CQ-Roll Call, Inc., All Rights Reserved.

In his testimony, United States Secret Service Acting Director Ronald Rowe, Jr. shared that he could not defend why the building where the shooter carried out his attack was not better covered by secret service agents.\n\nIn his remarks, Rowe shared that he was \"ashamed\" of the security flaws that led to the assassination attempt.\n\n\"I cannot defend why that roof was not better secured,\" he acknowledged.\n\nIn Rowe's testimony, he stated, \"I do not believe inadequate time to plan for this event was a factor in the failure.\"\n\nDuring the hearing, Sen.

For instance, local law enforcement became aware of a \"suspicious person\" 90 minutes before the shooting, whereas the Secret Service became aware 30 minutes before the shooting.\n\nSenators questioned Rowe why local law enforcement \"appeared\" to be in charge of handling the \"suspicious person\" and why the Secret Service decided to \"delegate\" with local law enforcement about the shooter instead of taking charge. Sen. John Cor\n\nIn response, Rowe could not give a clear answer to the senators, but agreed with Sen.

It also suggested that Rowe, with ready and detailed answers, was determined to strike a different posture than that of his predecessor, Kimberly Cheatle, who resigned last week after facing intense criticism from lawmakers from both major political parties after responses that were seen as evasive and lacking in specifics.\n\nMuch of Tuesday's hearing before the Senate Judiciary and Homeland Security committees focused on what Rowe suggested was inadequate information received by Secret Service personnel in the hour before the shooting, including that Crooks had been spotted on the roof.\n\nLocal law enforcement officers had spotted a suspicious-looking man pacing near the metal detectors and circulated but ultimately lost track of Crooks before he scaled the roof of a building at AGR International Inc. Shortly before the shooting, a local officer climbed up to the roof to investigate. Crooks turned and pointed his rifle at the officer, who retreated.\n\n\"No information regarding a weapon on a roof was ever passed to our personnel,\" Rowe said. At another point, he noted, \"It is troubling to me that we did not get that information as quickly as we should have. We didn't know that there was this incident going on.\"\n\nBut Rowe's willingness to assign blame to local law enforcement opened him up to harsh criticism from Senate Republicans, who saw him as failing to take responsibility.\n\nListen now and subscribe: Apple Podcasts | Google Podcasts | Spotify | RSS Feed | SoundStack | All Of Our Podcasts\n\n\"Isn't it the fact that the former president was shot, that a good American is dead, that other Americans were critically wounded -- isn't that enough mission failure for you to say to the person who decided that that building should not be the security perimeter, probably ought to be stepped down?\" said Sen. Josh Hawley, a Missouri Republican.\n\nRowe, raising his voice, responded that he has \"lost sleep over this for the last 17 days\" and that he would not be rushed \"to judgment\" by Congress, but he assured lawmakers that \"people will be held accountable.\"\n\nSen. Lindsey Graham, the top Republican on the Senate Judiciary Committee, said if something like this happened in the military, \"a lot of people would be fired. And if a lot of people are not fired, the system failed yet again.\"\n\nHe added: \"Nothing's going to change until somebody loses their job.\"\n\nThe FBI, meanwhile, disclosed new details about Crooks, with Deputy Director Paul Abbate saying a social media account believed to be associated with the gunman suspected in the assassination attempt espoused political violence and included antisemitic and anti-immigrant sentiment. The posts were from the 2019 and 2020 timeframe, when Crooks would have been in high school.\n\nOn Monday, the FBI revealed that Crooks had looked online for information about mass shootings, power plants, improvised explosive devices and the May assassination attempt of the Slovakian prime minister.\n\nThe FBI also said that Trump has agreed to be interviewed by agents as a crime victim. Trump, who appeared at events in the days after the shooting with a bandage on his right ear, said he expects the interview to take place on Thursday.\n\nAt Cheatle's hearing last week, she said the Secret Service had \"failed\" in its mission to protect Trump. She called the attempt on Trump's life the Secret Service's \"most significant operational failure\" in decades and vowed to \"move heaven and earth\" to get to the bottom of what went wrong and make sure there's no repeat of it.\n\nCheatle acknowledged that the Secret Service was told about a suspicious person two to five times before the shooting at the rally. She also revealed that the roof from which Crooks opened fire had been identified as a potential vulnerability days before the rally.\n\nIn a Monday night interview on Fox News Channel, Trump defended the Secret Service agents who protected him from the shooting but said that someone should have been on the roof with Crooks and that there should have been better communication with local police.\n\n\"They didn't speak to each other,\" he said.\n\nHe praised the sniper who killed Crooks with what he said was an amazing shot but noted: \"It would have been good if it was nine seconds sooner.\"\n\n0 Comments Love 0 Funny 0 Wow 0 Sad 0 Angry 0\n\nGet Government & Politics updates in your inbox!\n\nStay up-to-date on the latest in local and national government and political topics

(Brendan McDermid/Reuters)\n\nThe Secret Service is making changes in the wake of the assassination attempt against former President Donald Trump, the agency's new acting director announced on July 30.\n\nActing Director Ronald Rowe Jr. said that he traveled to the site of the July 13 rally in Butler, Pennsylvania, where the former president was shot by a man who fired from the roof of the nearby AGR building.\n\n\"What I saw made me ashamed,\" Mr. Rowe said in prepared remarks. \"As a career law enforcement officer, and a twenty-five-year veteran with the Secret Service, I cannot defend why that roof was not better secured.\"\n\nHe added, \"To prevent similar lapses from occurring in the future, I directed our personnel to ensure every event site security plan is thoroughly vetted by multiple experienced supervisors before it is implemented.\"\n\nMr. Rowe's prepared remarks were set to be delivered to two Senate committees on Capitol Hill in Washington on Tuesday.\n\nMr. Rowe assumed the director position after Kimberly Cheatle, the presidential appointee who was serving as director, stepped down a week after the former president was hit with a bullet.\n\nMs. Cheatle, in remarks before Congress before she resigned, said the assassination attempt represented the Secret Service's \"most significant operational failure in decades.\"\n\nLawmakers from both parties said the Secret Service should have secured the rooftop of the nearby building, or made sure other law enforcement officers secured the rooftop.\n\nSnipers spotted Mr. Crooks 1 hour and 45 minutes before shots were fired, according to texts disclosed this week, but no officers detained the suspicious person, according to officials.\n\nAfter Mr. Crooks fired the shots, he was taken out by a Secret Service sniper, officials have said.\n\nHomeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas appointed Mr. Rowe to serve as acting director. Mr. Rowe has been part of the Secret Service for 24 years. He was previously the agency's deputy director.\n\n\"I appreciate his willingness to lead the Secret Service at this incredibly challenging moment, as the agency works to get to the bottom of exactly what happened on July 13 and cooperate with ongoing investigations and Congressional oversight,\" Mr. Mayorkas said.\n\nMr. Rowe said that the Secret Service has implemented enhanced protective measures since the rally shooting \"to ensure the people and places we protect are safe.\" He said the agency has strengthened protection for all individuals it protects, is conducting threat assessments for all the people, and has started protecting six new people, including Sen. J.D. Vance (R-Ohio), who was recently tapped to join former President Trump's ticket, and independent presidential candidate Robert F. Kennedy Jr., to whom officials had previously denied protection.\n\nMr. Rowe also said that officials are working to make sure the agency's protection of the Democratic National Convention is strong and effective, following the protection of the Republican National Convention.\n\n\"The Secret Service workforce is comprised of special agents, Uniformed Division officers, technical law enforcement employees, and administrative, professional, and technical employees. I am immensely proud of their selfless dedication to the mission.

As a career law enforcement officer and a 25-year veteran with the Secret Service, I cannot defend why that roof was not better secured.\"\n\nThat marked a sharp shift in tone from Rowe's predecessor, Kimberly Cheatle, who repeatedly tried to shift blame for the attack to local cops. She claimed local law enforcement was tasked with securing the building Crooks opened fire from, which was outside the rally's security perimeter.\n\nCheatle resigned under pressure from lawmakers a week ago.\n\n\"I've heard your calls for accountability, and I take them very seriously,\" Rowe said Tuesday. \"And given the magnitude of this failure, the Secret Service's Office of Professional Responsibility is reviewing the actions and decision making of Secret Service personnel in the lead up to and on the day of the attack.\"\n\nDespite Cheatle's resignation, many lawmakers have called for more heads to roll within the Secret Service for the debacle.\n\n\"Somebody's got to be fired,\" Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-SC) said at Tuesday's hearing. \"Nothing's going to change until somebody loses their job.\"\n\nThe FBI's deputy director, Paul Abbate, testified at the same hearing that investigators still have not nailed down Crooks' definitive motive.

Tillis demands answers about a critical 30 seconds before Trump was shot", "body": "He was listening Tuesday morning in a Senate hearing to testimony -- which included a timeline of events from the attempted assassination on Trump in Butler -- from both Ronald Rowe Jr., acting director of the Secret Service, and Paul Abbate, deputy director of the FBI.\n\nSeventeen days earlier, a gunman identified by law enforcement as Thomas Matthew Crooks, 20, shot at Trump and in the process killed a retired firefighter and seriously injured two others.\n\nIn the two weeks since, members of Congress and the public have learned local law enforcement had been suspicious of Crooks and that two officers had followed him to a building's roof where he positioned himself to shoot at Trump. One officer hoisted the other onto his shoulders to get a look over the roofline and found Crooks pointing his gun back at him.\n\n\"What actually happened in the 30 seconds where a law enforcement officer knew that a gun was pointed in the direction of the president from a fairly short range?\" Tillis asked. \"What actually did those folks who did have knowledge of exactly what was happening and could probably infer with what was about to happen, what did they do?\"\n\nAbbate told the North Carolina Republican that after the officer jumped down to avoid being shot, Butler County law enforcement and Pennsylvania State Police began to react.\n\nTillis cut off the testimony, saying there was a clear operational problem because there was enough time to get word to the counter snipers of a problem.\n\nIn earlier testimony during the hearing, senators learned that even though local law enforcement knew Crooks had a gun, that information never made it to federal officers.\n\nSecret Service leader 'ashamed'\n\n\"I love law enforcement,\" Tillis said. \"I wear the \"Back the Blue\" pin every day. They do great work. The Secret Service did phenomenal work on the stage. But they failed, because their job is to protect the public, and they needed to put themselves in harm's way to stop him.\"\n\nTillis was one of nine senators to immediately request Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Dick Durbin hold a hearing regarding the events that led to the attempted assassination of Trump.\n\nThe Judiciary Committee and the Senate Homeland Security and Government Affairs Committee held the hearing together Tuesday morning. It was the first public hearing for senators, though a classified briefing had previously been held.\n\nThe shooting led to the resignation of Secret Service Director Kim Cheatle, but that didn't spare Rowe from facing some tongue lashings, accusations and calls for employee terminations during the hearing.\n\n\"I have taken and will continue to take immediate steps to ensure we do not repeat those failures, since my appointment as the acting director one week ago, identify gaps in our security on July 13 and have implemented corrective actions,\" Rowe told the senators.\n\nRowe said one of his first actions as acting director was to travel to Butler to understand how Secret Service protection failed. He said he laid on the rooftop where the shooter was to see his line of sight.\n\n\"What I saw made me ashamed as a career law enforcement officer and a 25-year veteran with the U.S. Secret Service,\" Rowe said. \"I cannot defend why that roof was not better secured.\"\n\nBut he ticked off a list of things he's implementing to make sure something like the events of July 13 don't happen again.\n\nAnd he defended his staff.\n\n\"It is my understanding those personnel were not aware the assailant had a firearm until they heard gunshots,\" Rowe said. \"Prior to that, they were operating with the knowledge that local law enforcement was working an issue of a suspicious individual prior to the shots being fired.\"\n\nHe also promised that if any policies were broken, his team would face repercussions.\n\nAbbate testified that the FBI has not identified a motive for the shooting, any co-conspirators or anyone with advance knowledge, though the investigation remains ongoing.\n\nHe said the FBI recently uncovered a social media account and is working to authenticate that it belonged to Crooks. He said it contains 700 posts from 2019 to 2020 that \"appear to reflect antisemitic and anti-immigration themes, to espouse political violence and are described as extreme in nature.\"\n\nTimeline\n\nAbbate also provided a detailed timeline of what they've learned about Crooks' and law enforcement's actions leading up to the shooting. Here is the timeline as described by Abbate.\n\nJuly 3: The Trump rally is publicly announced.\n\nJuly 6: Crooks registers to attend the rally. He searches for how far Lee Harvey Oswald was from President John F. Kennedy when Kennedy was assassinated.\n\nJuly 7: Crooks travels to the Butler Farm Show, the site of the rally, where he spends 20 minutes.\n\n1:30 p.m: Crooks returns home and gets a rifle from his father, who believes Crooks is going to the sportsmen's club.\n\n6:11 p.m: An officer hoists a second officer onto his shoulders to see onto the roof and radios to local police that Crooks is armed.\n\n\"There were at least two law enforcement officers that knew a guy was about to pull the trigger at the president and I'm just not really happy with the fact that we could have communicated: 'Cover President Trump and try to secure the situation.' I'm going to let the investigation go forward, but I think it's very important to point out that we can't let a scenario go in the future where 20 seconds can lapse when a law enforcement officer within two football fields of a former president of the United States has material knowledge that somebody is about to get shot at on stage, and we don't have instantaneous response.\"\n\nTillis cautioned his colleagues from believing that Rowe and Abbate had not been forthcoming in their testimony, saying that anybody who believes that local law enforcement don't have problems with communications needs to spend some time in local government.\n\nTillis asked Rowe about any obstructions the Secret Service snipers had that prevented them from seeing Crooks. He said a tree blocked the view from the counter snipers on stage right.\n\nTillis said he doesn't believe reports that the sniper saw Crooks 20 minutes prior to the shooting.\n\n\"It sounds like the one who took the shot probably saw him for the first time about a split second before he pulled the trigger,\" Tillis said, asking for confirmation.\n\n\"That's my assessment, senator,\" Rowe said.\n\nTillis also requested that Rowe provide the two committees with data from Nov. 5, 2022, the day Trump announced his reelection campaign, through the shooting, of every time Trump requested additional security and whether that request was fulfilled, denied or downsized.\n\nBoth men also promised that their agencies are working to secure the Democratic National Convention slated to begin on Aug. 19. The shooting took place just two days before the start of the Republican National Convention, which already had increased security due to the country's political climate.\n\n\"We've been working on this for well over a year in preparation,\" Abbate said.\n\nUnder the Dome\n\nGet the latest news about North Carolina politics from The News & Observer's award-winning team.

Some of these comments, if ultimately attributable to the shooter, appear to reflect antisemitic and anti-immigration themes to espouse political violence and are described as extreme in nature.\"\n\nWhile Abbate made clear that the account in question is believed to be associated with 20-year-old shooter Thomas Matthew Crooks, he did not specifying which social media platform it was on.\n\n\"While the investigative team is still working to verify this account to determine if it did in fact belong to the shooter, we believe it important to share and note it today, particularly given the general absence of other information to date from social media and other sources of information that reflect on the shooter's potential motive and mindset,\" he continued.\n\nTrump, who has agreed to participate in a victim interview with the FBI regarding his assassination attempt, has routinely espoused antisemitic and anti-immigration rhetoric.\n\nAnti-Defamation League chief Jonathan Greenblatt and the White House both condemned him in 2021 and this year for, respectively, suggesting that Jewish people control Congress and the media and claiming that pro-Democrat Jews \"hate Israel\" as well as \"hate their religion\".\n\nTrump additionally has drawn criticism for his anti-immigration comments, including his accusation that migrants are \"poisoning the blood of our country\".\n\nMeanwhile, Rowe Jr testified Tuesday that he had visited and \"laid in a prone position\" on the roof of the warehouse complex in Butler county, Pennsylvania, from where Crooks fired at Trump during a political rally.\n\n\"What I saw made me ashamed,\" Rowe Jr said. \"As a career law enforcement officer, and a 25-year veteran with the Secret Service, I cannot defend why that roof was not better secured.\n\n\"To prevent similar lapses from occurring in the future, I directed our personnel to ensure every event-site security plan is thoroughly vetted by multiple experienced supervisors before it is implemented.\"\n\nHe also said that he directed the expansion of drones at protective sites to help detect threats on roofs and other elevated areas.\n\nDuring his testimony, Rowe Jr further revealed that the Secret Service has started providing protection to six additional high-profile figures, including Trump's November presidential election running mate JD Vance and his family, as well as independent White House candidate Robert F Kennedy Jr.\n\n\"I have heard your calls for accountability, and I take them very seriously,\" said Rowe Jr, who stepped into his role after Secret Service director Kimberley Cheatle resigned 10 days after the assassination attempt. \"Given the magnitude of this failure, the Secret Service's office of professional responsibility is reviewing the actions and decision making of Secret Service personnel in the lead-up to, and on the day of, the attack.\n\n\"If this investigation reveals that Secret Service employees violated agency protocols, those employees will be held accountable to our disciplinary process.\"\n\nAbbate and Rowe Jr's testimonies follow a recent New York Times report that found that a Pennsylvania officer had spotted Crooks 90 minutes before he opened fire - 30 minutes earlier than what officials had previously said.\n\nMeanwhile, in an interview with ABC on Sunday, the lead sharpshooter on a local police department's special tactical team assigned to protect the president said that he and his colleagues were supposed to get an in-person briefing with Secret Service agents before the rally. But sharpshooter Jason Woods said \"that never happened\".\n\nThe ensuing shooting not only injured one of Trump's ears - it also killed one rally-goer while wounding two others.", "source": {"uri": "aol.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo News"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Opposition_to_immigration", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Opposition to immigration"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antisemitism", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Antisemitism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Bureau_of_Investigation", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Federal Bureau of Investigation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_media", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Social media"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Secret_Service", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "United States Secret Service"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_Abbate", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Paul Abbate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maya_civilization", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Maya civilization"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Political_violence", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Political violence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assassination", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Assassination"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Senate", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States Senate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jews", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Jews"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jonathan_Greenblatt", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Jonathan Greenblatt"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assassination_of_John_F._Kennedy", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Assassination of John F.

It also suggested that Rowe, with ready and detailed answers, was determined to strike a different posture than that of his predecessor, Kimberly Cheatle, who resigned last week after facing intense criticism from lawmakers from both major political parties after responses that were seen as evasive and lacking in specifics.\n\nMuch of Tuesday's hearing before the Senate Judiciary and Homeland Security committees focused on what Rowe suggested was inadequate information received by Secret Service personnel in the hour before the shooting, including that Crooks had been spotted on the roof.\n\nLocal law enforcement officers had spotted a suspicious-looking man pacing near the metal detectors and circulated but ultimately lost track of Crooks before he scaled the roof of a building at AGR International Inc. Shortly before the shooting, a local officer climbed up to the roof to investigate. Crooks turned and pointed his rifle at the officer, who retreated.\n\n\"No information regarding a weapon on a roof was ever passed to our personnel,\" Rowe said. At another point, he noted, \"It is troubling to me that we did not get that information as quickly as we should have. We didn't know that there was this incident going on.\"\n\nBut Rowe's willingness to assign blame to local law enforcement opened him up to harsh criticism from Senate Republicans, who saw him as failing to take responsibility.\n\nListen now and subscribe: Apple Podcasts | Google Podcasts | Spotify | RSS Feed | SoundStack | All Of Our Podcasts\n\n\"Isn't it the fact that the former president was shot, that a good American is dead, that other Americans were critically wounded -- isn't that enough mission failure for you to say to the person who decided that that building should not be the security perimeter, probably ought to be stepped down?\" said Sen. Josh Hawley, a Missouri Republican.\n\nRowe, raising his voice, responded that he has \"lost sleep over this for the last 17 days\" and that he would not be rushed \"to judgment\" by Congress, but he assured lawmakers that \"people will be held accountable.\"\n\nSen. Lindsey Graham, the top Republican on the Senate Judiciary Committee, said if something like this happened in the military, \"a lot of people would be fired. And if a lot of people are not fired, the system failed yet again.\"\n\nHe added: \"Nothing's going to change until somebody loses their job.\"\n\nThe FBI, meanwhile, disclosed new details about Crooks, with Deputy Director Paul Abbate saying a social media account believed to be associated with the gunman suspected in the assassination attempt espoused political violence and included antisemitic and anti-immigrant sentiment. The posts were from the 2019 and 2020 timeframe, when Crooks would have been in high school.\n\nOn Monday, the FBI revealed that Crooks had looked online for information about mass shootings, power plants, improvised explosive devices and the May assassination attempt of the Slovakian prime minister.\n\nThe FBI also said that Trump has agreed to be interviewed by agents as a crime victim. Trump, who appeared at events in the days after the shooting with a bandage on his right ear, said he expects the interview to take place on Thursday.\n\nAt Cheatle's hearing last week, she said the Secret Service had \"failed\" in its mission to protect Trump. She called the attempt on Trump's life the Secret Service's \"most significant operational failure\" in decades and vowed to \"move heaven and earth\" to get to the bottom of what went wrong and make sure there's no repeat of it.\n\nCheatle acknowledged that the Secret Service was told about a suspicious person two to five times before the shooting at the rally. She also revealed that the roof from which Crooks opened fire had been identified as a potential vulnerability days before the rally.\n\nIn a Monday night interview on Fox News Channel, Trump defended the Secret Service agents who protected him from the shooting but said that someone should have been on the roof with Crooks and that there should have been better communication with local police.\n\n\"They didn't speak to each other,\" he said.\n\nHe praised the sniper who killed Crooks with what he said was an amazing shot but noted: \"It would have been good if it was nine seconds

It also suggested that Rowe, with ready and detailed answers, was determined to strike a different posture than that of his predecessor, Kimberly Cheatle, who resigned last week after facing intense criticism from lawmakers from both major political parties after responses that were seen as evasive and lacking in specifics.\n\nMuch of Tuesday's hearing before the Senate Judiciary and Homeland Security committees focused on what Rowe suggested was inadequate information received by Secret Service personnel in the hour before the shooting, including that Crooks had been spotted on the roof.\n\nLocal law enforcement officers had spotted a suspicious-looking man pacing near the metal detectors and circulated but ultimately lost track of Crooks before he scaled the roof of a building at AGR International Inc. Shortly before the shooting, a local officer climbed up to the roof to investigate. Crooks turned and pointed his rifle at the officer, who retreated.\n\n\"No information regarding a weapon on a roof was ever passed to our personnel,\" Rowe said. At another point, he noted, \"It is troubling to me that we did not get that information as quickly as we should have. We didn't know that there was this incident going on.\"\n\nBut Rowe's willingness to assign blame to local law enforcement opened him up to harsh criticism from Senate Republicans, who saw him as failing to take responsibility.\n\nListen now and subscribe: Apple Podcasts | Google Podcasts | Spotify | RSS Feed | SoundStack | All Of Our Podcasts\n\n\"Isn't it the fact that the former president was shot, that a good American is dead, that other Americans were critically wounded -- isn't that enough mission failure for you to say to the person who decided that that building should not be the security perimeter, probably ought to be stepped down?\" said Sen. Josh Hawley, a Missouri Republican.\n\nRowe, raising his voice, responded that he has \"lost sleep over this for the last 17 days\" and that he would not be rushed \"to judgment\" by Congress, but he assured lawmakers that \"people will be held accountable.\"\n\nSen. Lindsey Graham, the top Republican on the Senate Judiciary Committee, said if something like this happened in the military, \"a lot of people would be fired. And if a lot of people are not fired, the system failed yet again.\"\n\nHe added: \"Nothing's going to change until somebody loses their job.\"\n\nThe FBI, meanwhile, disclosed new details about Crooks, with Deputy Director Paul Abbate saying a social media account believed to be associated with the gunman suspected in the assassination attempt espoused political violence and included antisemitic and anti-immigrant sentiment. The posts were from the 2019 and 2020 timeframe, when Crooks would have been in high school.\n\nOn Monday, the FBI revealed that Crooks had looked online for information about mass shootings, power plants, improvised explosive devices and the May assassination attempt of the Slovakian prime minister.\n\nThe FBI also said that Trump has agreed to be interviewed by agents as a crime victim. Trump, who appeared at events in the days after the shooting with a bandage on his right ear, said he expects the interview to take place on Thursday.\n\nAt Cheatle's hearing last week, she said the Secret Service had \"failed\" in its mission to protect Trump. She called the attempt on Trump's life the Secret Service's \"most significant operational failure\" in decades and vowed to \"move heaven and earth\" to get to the bottom of what went wrong and make sure there's no repeat of it.\n\nCheatle acknowledged that the Secret Service was told about a suspicious person two to five times before the shooting at the rally. She also revealed that the roof from which Crooks opened fire had been identified as a potential vulnerability days before the rally.\n\nIn a Monday night interview on Fox News Channel, Trump defended the Secret Service agents who protected him from the shooting but said that someone should have been on the roof with Crooks and that there should have been better communication with local police.\n\n\"They didn't speak to each other,\" he said.\n\nHe praised the sniper who killed Crooks with what he said was an amazing shot but noted: \"It would have been good if it was nine seconds sooner.\"\n\n0 Comments Love 0 Funny 0 Wow 0 Sad 0 Angry 0\n\nGet Government & Politics updates in your inbox!\n\nStay up-to-date on the latest in local and national government and political topics

Sen. Hawley Gets Into Shouting Match With Secret Service Acting Director Over Assassination Attempt", "body": "Former President Donald Trump surrounded by Secret Service agents after an attempted assassination in Butler, Pa. (Screen Capture/CSPAN)\n\nRepublican Missouri Sen. Josh Hawley engaged in a shouting match with Acting Secret Service Director Ronald Rowe Jr. on Tuesday over the agency's handling of the assassination attempt against Republican nominee Donald Trump.\n\nRowe testified before the U.S. Senate Judiciary Committee on Tuesday about the handling of the assassination attempt during a July 13 rally in Butler, Pennsylvania. Hawley pressed Rowe on the lack of firings that occurred over the failures to surveil the rooftop where the would-be assassin, Thomas Matthew Crooks, opened fire.\n\n\"You're asking me, senator, to completely make a rush to judgment about somebody failing. I acknowledge, this was a failure -- \" Rowe said during the questioning.\n\n\"Is it not prima facie that somebody has failed? The former president was shot!\" Hawley interjected.\n\nRowe said he has \"lost sleep\" over the handling of the assassination attempt since the incident occurred, and assured Hawley that he would people accountable \"with integrity\" and not \"rush to judgement.\"\n\n\"Then fire somebody to hold them accountable!\" Hawley shouted.\n\n\"And I will do so with integrity and not rush to judgment and put people unfairly persecuted,\" Rowe said.\n\nThe senator then confronted Rowe on reports that the Secret Service denyied the Trump campaign's request for additional security, which Department of Homeland Security (DHS) Alejandro Mayorkas said on July 15 was \"unequivocally false.\" Rowe also denied the reports said he had no involvement in that type of decision making.\n\nWhistleblowers reportedly told Hawley that Secret Service agents were assigned to be present on the roof where Crooks fired eight bullets into the crowd, but did not do so because of the hot temperature. Rowe said the agents \"posted up inside\" and assured that state and local counter snipers were present on roofs during political events.\n\n\"Again senator, we are looking at this, and they should've been on that roof and the fact that they were in the building is something I'm still trying to understand,\" Rowe said.\n\n\"I just want to express my frustration, director, that seventeen days or whatever it's been that whistleblowers are telling us more than you are and you don't know, you haven't ascertained if there was supposed to be law enforcement on the roof. That seems like a pretty basic fact. I'm also told that law enforcement suppliers offered the Secret Service drones, and you declined them,\" Hawley said.\n\nA whistleblower reportedly told Hawley's office that local enforcement offered drone technology to the Secret Service the night before the rally that allegedly had the capability to both monitor and \"neutralize\" potential threats, according to a July 25 letter sent by Hawley to the DHS. Rowe confirmed the agency was offered to fly a drone over the stadium and said they \"probably\" should have accepted the offer.\n\nHawley immediately pushed back against Rowe after he said he has been \"transparent and forthcoming\" regarding the information he obtained about the shooting.\n\n\"Your agency has not been transparent and forthcoming,\" Hawley interrupted. \"So please, let's not go there.\"\n\n\"I have been forthcoming, sir,\" Rowe pushed back, leading Hawley to point out he has not fired any of his personnel.\n\nMembers of the Secret Service and the FBI told lawmakers on July 17 that officials noticed Crooks approximately 50 minutes before Trump took the stage during the rally. The Secret Service reportedly witnessed Crooks on the roof about 20 minutes before he fired shots into the crowd.\n\nRepublican Iowa Sen. Chuck Grassley obtained text messages on Monday suggesting that law enforcement flagged Crooks to their colleagues as a suspicious presence nearly 90 minutes before the shooting, according to The New York Times. Officers spotted Crooks as he was using a rangefinder, but did not approach him.\n\nCrooks' attack injured Trump in the upper portion of his right ear and killed former fire chief Corey Comperatore as he shielded his two daughters from the bullets. The shooting injured two other rally goers.", "source": {"uri": "dailycallernewsfoundation.org", "dataType": "news", "title": "dailycallernewsfoundation.org"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Attempted_assassination_of_Ronald_Reagan", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Attempted assassination of Ronald Reagan"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Senate", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "United States Senate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Secret_Service", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "United States Secret Service"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republican_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Republican Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Josh_Hawley", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Josh Hawley"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Butler,_Pennsylvania", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Butler, Pennsylvania"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Butler, Pennsylvania"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C-SPAN", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "C-SPAN"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Senate_Committee_on_the_Judiciary", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States Senate Committee on the Judiciary"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assassination", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Assassination"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Whistleblower", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Whistleblower"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Missouri", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Missouri"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Missouri"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump_2016_presidential_campaign", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump 2016 presidential campaign"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alejandro_Mayorkas", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Alejandro Mayorkas"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Law_enforcement", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Law enforcement"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sniper", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Sniper"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unmanned_aerial_vehicle", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Unmanned aerial vehicle"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Department_of_Homeland_Security", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United States Department of Homeland Security"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chuck_Grassley", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Chuck Grassley"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Bureau_of_Investigation", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Federal Bureau of Investigation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_New_York_Times", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "The New York Times"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iowa", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Iowa"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Iowa"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Terrorism", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Terrorism", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Warfare_and_Conflict", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Warfare and Conflict", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Crime_and_Justice", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Crime and Justice", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Theft", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Theft", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 83}], "image": null, "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9772518", "eventUri": "eng-9772518", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-07-13", "textStart": 490, "textEnd": 497}, {"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-07-15", "textStart": 1536, "textEnd": 1543}, {"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-07-25", "textStart": 2828, "textEnd": 2835}, {"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-07-17", "textStart": 3445, "textEnd": 3452}], "sentiment": -0.4352941176470588, "wgt": 169, "relevance": 1}

Lindsey Graham, the top Republican on the Senate Judiciary Committee. \"And if a lot of people are not fired, the system failed yet again.\n\nHe added: \"Nothing's going to change until somebody loses their job.\"\n\nThe hearing comes one day after the FBI released new details about its investigation into the shooting, revealing that the gunman had looked online for information about mass shootings, power plants, improvised explosive devices and the May assassination attempt of the Slovakian prime minister.\n\nListen now and subscribe: Apple Podcasts | Google Podcasts | Spotify | RSS Feed | SoundStack | All Of Our Podcasts\n\nThe FBI also said that Trump, the 2024 Republican presidential nominee, has agreed to be interviewed by agents as a crime victim. The bureau said last week that the former president had been struck in the ear by a bullet or fragment of one. Trump said Monday evening that he expected that interview to take place on Thursday.\n\nBut most of the questions Tuesday are expected to be directed at Rowe as lawmakers demand answers about how Crooks was able to get so close to Trump. Investigators believe Crooks fired eight shots in Trump's direction from an AR-style rifle after scaling the roof of a building of some 135 meters (147 yards) from where Trump was speaking in Butler, Pennsylvania.\n\nOne rallygoer was killed, and two others were injured. Crooks was shot dead by a Secret Service counter-sniper.\n\nAt her hearing last week, Cheatle said the Secret Service had \"failed\" in its mission to protect Trump. She called the attempt on Trump's life the Secret Service's \"most significant operational failure\" in decades and vowed to \"move heaven and earth\" to get to the bottom of what went wrong and make sure there's no repeat of it.\n\nPhotos: Trump injured, 2 killed in shooting at rally\n\nCheatle acknowledged that the Secret Service was told about a suspicious person two to five times before the shooting at the rally. She also revealed that the roof from which Crooks opened fire had been identified as a potential vulnerability days before the rally.\n\nCheatle said she apologized to Trump in a phone call after the assassination attempt.\n\nIn a Monday night interview on Fox News Channel, Trump defended the Secret Service agents who protected him from the shooting but said that someone should have been on the roof with Crooks and that there should have been better communication with local police.\n\n\"They didn't speak to each other,\" he said.\n\nHe praised the sniper who killed Crooks with what he said was an amazing shot but noted: \"It would have been good if it was nine seconds sooner.\"\n\nGet Government & Politics updates in your inbox!\n\nStay up-to-date on the latest in local and national

Marsha Blackburn read from an email (see below) obtained by RealClearPolitics political correspondent Susan Crabtree in which a counter sniper states that all top leaders at the Secret Service should \"resign or be fired.\"\n\nRowe, who took over after former Secret Service Director Kimberly Cheatle resigned last week after bipartisan calls for her to step down following her widely criticized testimony before the House Oversight Committee, said in his opening statement on Tuesday:\n\n\"I went to the roof of the AGR building where the assailant fired shots and laid in a prone position to evaluate his line of sight.

Cheatle never visited the site, a fact for which House Oversight members blasted her.\n\n\"What I saw made me ashamed,\" Rowe said regarding his view of the roof at the rally site. \"As a career law enforcement officer and a 25-year veteran with the Secret Service, I cannot defend why that roof was not better secured.\"\n\nSupport American Journalism\n\nMeanwhile, Crabtree reported on Tuesday that Rowe had been directly involved in denying additional security resources and personnel, including counter snipers, to Trump's rallies and events.\n\n\"It was Rowe's decision alone to deny counter sniper teams to any Trump event outside of driving distance from D.C.,\" Crabtree reported, citing sources familiar with Secret Service decision-making.\n\nRowe and FBI Deputy Director Paul Abbate are set to appear Tuesday before a joint hearing of the Senate Judiciary and Homeland Security and Government Affairs committees.\n\nFlorida Republican Rep. Cory Mills on Monday pledged to fund a \"parallel independent investigation\" into the assassination attempt after not being selected to sit on a House task force that will investigate the rally shooting.\n\n\"It's very unfortunate but not surprising for anyone familiar with how DC works. I'm not a politician, leadership, or a 'yes man,'\" Mills said in a statement on Monday.\n\n\"I wish the members of Speaker Johnson's Task Force well, and think it's time for a parallel independent investigation with subject matter experts (SME) and the whistleblowers who've already come forward that myself and Rep. Eli Crane and Benny Johnson have spoken with,\" Mills said. \"I will be speaking with other members, and although I won't have subpoena powers, I will personally fund whatever is required for additional staff to further investigation and expose the truth.\"\n\nThe 13-member task force will be chaired by Pennsylvania Republican Rep. Mike Kelly, who represents Butler and was present at the rally during the shooting. The ranking member will be Colorado Democrat Rep. Jason Crow, a former Army ranger and Bronze Star recipient who sits on the House Intelligence and Foreign Affairs committees.", "source": {"uri": "worldtribune.com", "dataType": "news", "title":

This admission marked a significant moment in the ongoing investigation into the July 13 shooting incident.\n\nDuring his testimony before the Senate Judiciary and Homeland Security committees, Rowe revealed a critical flaw in the drone detection system that was supposed to be operational on the day of the rally. The system, designed to detect unauthorized drones in the area, was delayed due to connectivity issues with the public cellular network, only coming online hours later than planned. This delay allowed the shooter, Thomas Matthew Crooks, to conduct his own surveillance undetected.\n\nSen. Chuck Grassley questioned the reliance of the Secret Service on public cellular networks and pressed Rowe on the lack of a backup plan. Rowe expressed regret over the consequences of the system failure and admitted to losing sleep over the missed opportunity to intercept the assailant. He emphasized the need for dedicated connectivity to ensure the operational readiness of security assets in the future.\n\nLawmakers further probed Rowe on the absence of security coverage at the building used by Crooks to carry out the assassination attempt. Despite plans for a sniper team to be stationed with a direct view of the rooftop, the position was left unattended, leading to questions about oversight and decision-making within the Secret Service.\n\nSen. Josh Hawley engaged in a heated exchange with Rowe regarding the delay in taking disciplinary action against Secret Service agents involved in the incident. While Rowe defended waiting for the investigation to conclude before any firings, Hawley argued for immediate accountability given the severity of the situation.\n\nSen. Rick Scott criticized the lack of transparency in the investigation and called for more frequent updates from the Secret Service and FBI. He drew parallels to his experience during the Pulse Nightclub shooting in Florida, emphasizing the importance of clear communication with the public during such crises.\n\nFBI Deputy Director Paul Abbate disclosed that the bureau has encountered challenges in accessing the content of Crooks' phone, particularly data hidden in encrypted messaging apps. While progress has been made in identifying one of Crooks' social media accounts, verification of ownership remains pending.\n\nAs the investigation continues, the focus remains on addressing the failures that allowed the assassination attempt to occur and implementing measures to prevent such incidents in the future. The commitment to enhanced security protocols and improved communication with the public underscores the urgency of learning from this tragic event.", "source": {"uri": "usanews.net", "dataType": "news", "title": "USANews Press Release Network"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Senate", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "United States Senate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Secret_Service", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "United States Secret Service"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Attempted_assassination_of_Ronald_Reagan", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Attempted assassination of Ronald Reagan"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cellular_network", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Cellular network"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unmanned_aerial_vehicle", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Unmanned aerial vehicle"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ronald_Rowe", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Ronald Rowe"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Senate_Committee_on_the_Judiciary", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States Senate Committee on the Judiciary"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Law_enforcement", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Law enforcement"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Department_of_Homeland_Security", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States Department of Homeland Security"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chuck_Grassley", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Chuck Grassley"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sniper", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Sniper"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surveillance", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Surveillance"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Josh_Hawley", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Josh Hawley"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_Abbate", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Paul Abbate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deputy_Director_of_the_Federal_Bureau_of_Investigation", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Deputy Director of the Federal Bureau of Investigation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rick_Scott", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Rick Scott"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transparency_(behavior)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Transparency (behavior)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Encryption", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Encryption"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Bureau_of_Investigation", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Federal Bureau of Investigation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_media", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Social media"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Florida", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Florida"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Florida"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orlando_nightclub_shooting", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Orlando nightclub shooting"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Theft", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Theft", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Security/Intrusion_Detection_Systems", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Security/Intrusion Detection Systems", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Fraud", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Fraud", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Internet/Abuse", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Internet/Abuse", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 58}], "image": "https://usanews.net/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/news-30072024-101903.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9772518", "eventUri": "eng-9772518", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-07-13", "textStart": 348, "textEnd": 355}], "sentiment": -0.1764705882352942, "wgt": 168, "relevance": 1}

Deputy FBI Director Paul Abbate also appeared before the Committee on Tuesday.\n\nDuring the hearing, Rowe and Abbate were grilled by a number of different senators as they sought to find more information about the attempt to assassinate the former president.\n\nAt one point during the hearing, Abbate revealed that law enforcement officials discovered a social media account that they believe may be connected to Crooks. The account reportedly shared \"antisemitic\" topics and thoughts.\n\n\"Some of these comments, if ultimately attributable to the shooter, appear to reflect antisemitic and anti-immigration themes, to espouse political violence and are described as extreme in nature,\" Abbate told Senators during the hearing. \"While the investigative team is still working to verify this account to determine if it did in fact belong to the shooter, we believe it important to share and note it today, particularly given the general absence of other information to date from social media and other sources of information that reflect on the shooter's potential motive and mindset.\"\n\nAbbate also revealed that a local law enforcement officer noticed Crooks with a firearm on the roof where the gun was shot.\n\n\"At approximately 6:11 p.m., a local police officer was lifted to the roof by another officer, saw the shooter and radioed that he was armed with 'a long gun.' Within approximately the next 30 seconds, the shots were fired,\" he said.\n\nHowever, Rowe explained that members of the Secret Service were not alerted to the individual with a gun, saying, \"No information regarding a weapon on the roof was ever passed to our personnel.\"\n\nWhen asked how Crooks was able to get onto the roof with a rifle, Abbate explained that while officials have yet to find \"definitive evidence\" he noted that \"based on everything that's been collected thus far, photos, video, eyewitness accounts, we do believe he likely had it in the backpack, broken down into the backpack.\"\n\nOn July 13, Crooks, 20, was identified as the individual who shot at the former president at a campaign rally over the weekend while he was on stage, injuring his ear in an assassination attempt. Crooks was later killed by the Secret Service while one rally attendee also died and two others were in critical condition.\n\nNewsweek previously reached out to the Secret Service via email for comment on Rowe's testimony.", "source": {"uri": "newsweek.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Newsweek"}, "authors": [{"uri": "matthew_impelli@newsweek.com", "name": "Matthew Impelli", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antisemitism", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Antisemitism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ronald_Rowe", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Ronald Rowe"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thomas_Crooks", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Thomas Crooks"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_Abbate", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Paul Abbate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Garth_Crooks", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Garth Crooks"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Attempted_assassination_of_Ronald_Reagan", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Attempted assassination of Ronald Reagan"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Director_of_the_Federal_Bureau_of_Investigation", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Director of the Federal Bureau of Investigation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Senate_Committee_on_the_Judiciary", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States Senate Committee on the Judiciary"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Law_enforcement", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Law enforcement"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Secret_Service", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States Secret Service"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_media", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Social media"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Butler,_Pennsylvania", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Butler, Pennsylvania"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Butler, Pennsylvania"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Opposition_to_immigration", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Opposition to immigration"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Political_violence", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Political violence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Senate", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United States Senate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newsweek", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Newsweek"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Firearm", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Firearm"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Police_officer", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Police officer"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Terrorism", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Terrorism", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Crime_and_Justice", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Crime and Justice", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Theft", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Theft", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Death", "label": "dmoz/Society/Death", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Death/Suicide", "label": "dmoz/Society/Death/Suicide", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 80}], "image": "https://d.newsweek.com/en/full/2439329/ronald-rowe.webp?w=1600&h=900&q=88&f=f7bc0cf52349c0c6f5e1347fe347ad33", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9772518", "eventUri": "eng-9772518", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-07-13", "textStart": 344, "textEnd": 351, "freq": 2}], "sentiment": -0.03529411764705881, "wgt": 168, "relevance": 1}

It also suggested that Rowe, with ready and detailed answers, was determined to strike a different posture than that of his predecessor, Kimberly Cheatle, who resigned last week after facing intense criticism from lawmakers from both major political parties after responses that were seen as evasive and lacking in specifics.\n\nMuch of Tuesday's hearing before the Senate Judiciary and Homeland Security committees focused on what Rowe suggested was inadequate information received by Secret Service personnel in the hour before the shooting, including that Crooks had been spotted on the roof.\n\nLocal law enforcement officers had spotted a suspicious-looking man pacing near the metal detectors and circulated but ultimately lost track of Crooks before he scaled the roof of a building at AGR International Inc. Shortly before the shooting, a local officer climbed up to the roof to investigate. Crooks turned and pointed his rifle at the officer, who retreated.\n\n\"No information regarding a weapon on a roof was ever passed to our personnel,\" Rowe said. At another point, he noted, \"It is troubling to me that we did not get that information as quickly as we should have. We didn't know that there was this incident going on.\"\n\nBut Rowe's willingness to assign blame to local law enforcement opened him up to harsh criticism from Senate Republicans, who saw him as failing to take responsibility.\n\nListen now and subscribe: Apple Podcasts | Google Podcasts | Spotify | RSS Feed | SoundStack | All Of Our Podcasts\n\n\"Isn't it the fact that the former president was shot, that a good American is dead, that other Americans were critically wounded -- isn't that enough mission failure for you to say to the person who decided that that building should not be the security perimeter, probably ought to be stepped down?\" said Sen. Josh Hawley, a Missouri Republican.\n\nRowe, raising his voice, responded that he has \"lost sleep over this for the last 17 days\" and that he would not be rushed \"to judgment\" by Congress, but he assured lawmakers that \"people will be held accountable.\"\n\nSen. Lindsey Graham, the top Republican on the Senate Judiciary Committee, said if something like this happened in the military, \"a lot of people would be fired. And if a lot of people are not fired, the system failed yet again.\"\n\nHe added: \"Nothing's going to change until somebody loses their job.\"\n\nThe FBI, meanwhile, disclosed new details about Crooks, with Deputy Director Paul Abbate saying a social media account believed to be associated with the gunman suspected in the assassination attempt espoused political violence and included antisemitic and anti-immigrant sentiment. The posts were from the 2019 and 2020 timeframe, when Crooks would have been in high school.\n\nOn Monday, the FBI revealed that Crooks had looked online for information about mass shootings, power plants, improvised explosive devices and the May assassination attempt of the Slovakian prime minister.\n\nThe FBI also said that Trump has agreed to be interviewed by agents as a crime victim. Trump, who appeared at events in the days after the shooting with a bandage on his right ear, said he expects the interview to take place on Thursday.\n\nAt Cheatle's hearing last week, she said the Secret Service had \"failed\" in its mission to protect Trump. She called the attempt on Trump's life the Secret Service's \"most significant operational failure\" in decades and vowed to \"move heaven and earth\" to get to the bottom of what went wrong and make sure there's no repeat of it.\n\nCheatle acknowledged that the Secret Service was told about a suspicious person two to five times before the shooting at the rally. She also revealed that the roof from which Crooks opened fire had been identified as a potential vulnerability days before the rally.\n\nIn a Monday night interview on Fox News Channel, Trump defended the Secret Service agents who protected him from the shooting but said that someone should have been on the roof with Crooks and that there should have been better communication with local police.\n\n\"They didn't speak to each other,\" he said.\n\nHe praised the sniper who killed Crooks with what he said was an amazing shot but noted: \"It would have been good if it was nine seconds sooner.\"\n\nSubscribe to stay connected to Tucson.

Josh Hawley (R-MO) confronted acting Secret Service Director Ronald Rowe on Tuesday about firing personnel over the attempted assassination of former President Donald Trump.\n\nThe clash took place as Rowe and FBI Deputy Director Paul Abbate appeared before the Senate's Judiciary and Homeland Security committees over the security lapse underlying the attack.\n\nQuestions have been raised about how the gunman, identified as a 20-year-old man named Thomas Matthew Crooks, managed to get onto a nearby rooftop and begin shooting with a rifle.\n\nA Secret Service sniper shot and killed Crooks while other personnel rushed to protect Trump and escort him off the stage, but not before the former president got hit in the right ear.\n\nOne rallygoer, 50-year-old fireman Corey Comperatore, was killed. Two others were wounded and have been released from the hospital in recent days.\n\nFormer Secret Service Director Kimberly Cheatle resigned last week, one day after testifying before the House as she faced backlash over the security failure underlying the Trump rally shooting.\n\nHomeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas then announced that Rowe, the Secret Service's deputy director, would become acting director.\n\nDuring the hearing on Tuesday, Hawley asked Rowe to identify the lead site agent who made the decision to leave the building on which the gunman opened fire outside of the security perimeter.\n\n\"Senator, I cannot give you that name,\" Rowe said. \"This person is operational.

Tillis demands answers about a critical 30 seconds before Trump was shot", "body": "Sen. Thom Tillis narrowed his focus to a 30-second time frame during the July 13 rally in Butler, Pennsylvania, where former President Donald Trump was giving a speech.\n\nHe was listening Tuesday morning in a Senate hearing to testimony -- which included a timeline of events from the attempted assassination on Trump in Butler -- from both Ronald Rowe Jr., acting director of the Secret Service, and Paul Abbate, deputy director of the FBI.\n\nSeventeen days earlier, a gunman identified by law enforcement as Thomas Matthew Crooks, 20, shot at Trump and in the process killed a retired firefighter and seriously injured two others.\n\nIn the two weeks since, members of Congress and the public have learned local law enforcement had been suspicious of Crooks and that two officers had followed him to a building's roof where he positioned himself to shoot at Trump. One officer hoisted the other onto his shoulders to get a look over the roofline and found Crooks pointing his gun back at him.\n\n\"What actually happened in the 30 seconds where a law enforcement officer knew that a gun was pointed in the direction of the president from a fairly short range?\" Tillis asked. \"What actually did those folks who did have knowledge of exactly what was happening and could probably infer with what was about to happen, what did they do?\"\n\nAbbate told the North Carolina Republican that after the officer jumped down to avoid being shot, Butler County law enforcement and Pennsylvania State Police began to react.\n\nTillis cut off the testimony, saying there was a clear operational problem because there was enough time to get word to the counter snipers of a problem.\n\nIn earlier testimony during the hearing, senators learned that even though local law enforcement knew Crooks had a gun, that information never made it to federal officers.\n\nSecret Service leader 'ashamed'\n\n\"I love law enforcement,\" Tillis said. \"I wear the \"Back the Blue\" pin every day. They do great work. The Secret Service did phenomenal work on the stage. But they failed, because their job is to protect the public, and they needed to put themselves in harm's way to stop him.\"\n\nTillis was one of nine senators to immediately request Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Dick Durbin hold a hearing regarding the events that led to the attempted assassination of Trump.\n\nThe Judiciary Committee and the Senate Homeland Security and Government Affairs Committee held the hearing together Tuesday morning. It was the first public hearing for senators, though a classified briefing had previously been held.\n\nThe shooting led to the resignation of Secret Service Director Kim Cheatle, but that didn't spare Rowe from facing some tongue lashings, accusations and calls for employee terminations during the hearing.\n\n\"I have taken and will continue to take immediate steps to ensure we do not repeat those failures, since my appointment as the acting director one week ago, identify gaps in our security on July 13 and have implemented corrective actions,\" Rowe told the senators.\n\nRowe said one of his first actions as acting director was to travel to Butler to understand how Secret Service protection failed. He said he laid on the rooftop where the shooter was to see his line of sight.\n\n\"What I saw made me ashamed as a career law enforcement officer and a 25-year veteran with the U.S. Secret Service,\" Rowe said. \"I cannot defend why that roof was not better secured.\"\n\nBut he ticked off a list of things he's implementing to make sure something like the events of July 13 don't happen again.\n\nAnd he defended his staff.\n\n\"It is my understanding those personnel were not aware the assailant had a firearm until they heard gunshots,\" Rowe said. \"Prior to that, they were operating with the knowledge that local law enforcement was working an issue of a suspicious individual prior to the shots being fired.\"\n\nHe also promised that if any policies were broken, his team would face repercussions.\n\nAbbate testified that the FBI has not identified a motive for the shooting, any co-conspirators or anyone with advance knowledge, though the investigation remains ongoing.\n\nHe said the FBI recently uncovered a social media account and is working to authenticate that it belonged to Crooks. He said it contains 700 posts from 2019 to 2020 that \"appear to reflect antisemitic and anti-immigration themes, to espouse political violence and are described as extreme in nature.\"\n\nTimeline\n\nAbbate also provided a detailed timeline of what they've learned about Crooks' and law enforcement's actions leading up to the shooting. Here is the timeline as described by Abbate.\n\nJuly 3: The Trump rally is publicly announced.\n\nJuly 6: Crooks registers to attend the rally. He searches for how far Lee Harvey Oswald was from President John F. Kennedy when Kennedy was assassinated.\n\nJuly 7: Crooks travels to the Butler Farm Show, the site of the rally, where he spends 20 minutes.\n\n1:30 p.m: Crooks returns home and gets a rifle from his father, who believes Crooks is going to the sportsmen's club.\n\n6:11 p.m: An officer hoists a second officer onto his shoulders to see onto the roof and radios to local police that Crooks is armed.\n\n\"There were at least two law enforcement officers that knew a guy was about to pull the trigger at the president and I'm just not really happy with the fact that we could have communicated: 'Cover President Trump and try to secure the situation.' I'm going to let the investigation go forward, but I think it's very important to point out that we can't let a scenario go in the future where 20 seconds can lapse when a law enforcement officer within two football fields of a former president of the United States has material knowledge that somebody is about to get shot at on stage, and we don't have instantaneous response.\"\n\nTillis cautioned his colleagues from believing that Rowe and Abbate had not been forthcoming in their testimony, saying that anybody who believes that local law enforcement don't have problems with communications needs to spend some time in local government.\n\nTillis asked Rowe about any obstructions the Secret Service snipers had that prevented them from seeing Crooks. He said a tree blocked the view from the counter snipers on stage right.\n\nTillis said he doesn't believe reports that the sniper saw Crooks 20 minutes prior to the shooting.\n\n\"It sounds like the one who took the shot probably saw him for the first time about a split second before he pulled the trigger,\" Tillis said, asking for confirmation.\n\n\"That's my assessment, senator,\" Rowe said.\n\nTillis also requested that Rowe provide the two committees with data from Nov. 5, 2022, the day Trump announced his reelection campaign, through the shooting, of every time Trump requested additional security and whether that request was fulfilled, denied or downsized.\n\nBoth men also promised that their agencies are working to secure the Democratic National Convention slated to begin on Aug. 19. The shooting took place just two days before the start of the Republican National Convention, which already had increased security due to the country's political climate.\n\n\"We've been working on this for well over a year in preparation,\" Abbate said.", "source": {"uri": "mcclatchydc.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "McClatchy Washington Bureau"}, "authors": [{"uri": "danielle_battaglia@mcclatchydc.com", "name": "Danielle Battaglia", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matt_Crooks", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Matt Crooks"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thom_Tillis", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Thom Tillis"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Law_enforcement", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Law enforcement"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Secret_Service", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "United States Secret Service"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Butler,_Pennsylvania", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Butler, Pennsylvania"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Butler, Pennsylvania"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Law_enforcement_officer", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Law enforcement officer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Attempted_assassination_of_Ronald_Reagan", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Attempted assassination of Ronald Reagan"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Senate", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "United States Senate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_Abbate", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Paul Abbate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Director_of_the_Federal_Bureau_of_Investigation", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Director of the Federal Bureau of Investigation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pennsylvania_State_Police", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Pennsylvania State Police"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Senate_Committee_on_the_Judiciary", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States Senate Committee on the Judiciary"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Congress", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States Congress"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republican_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Republican Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Firefighter", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Firefighter"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_Carolina", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "North Carolina"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "North Carolina"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kimberly_Cheatle", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Kimberly Cheatle"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dick_Durbin", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Dick Durbin"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sniper", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Sniper"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Firearm", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Firearm"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Bureau_of_Investigation", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Federal Bureau of Investigation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Department_of_Homeland_Security", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United States Department of Homeland Security"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump_2020_presidential_campaign", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump 2020 presidential campaign"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lee_Harvey_Oswald", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Lee Harvey Oswald"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advice_and_consent", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Advice and consent"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assassination_of_John_F._Kennedy", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Assassination of John F.

As a career law enforcement officer and a 25-year Secret Service veteran, I cannot defend why that roof was not better secured,\" he said.\n\nThe testimony was the most detailed catalog to date by the Secret Service of law enforcement failings and miscommunications, with Rowe accepting blame for his own agency's mistakes while also pointedly criticizing local law enforcement for communication breakdowns that resulted in his agency not sharing information that a gunman, later identified as 20-year-old Thomas Matthew Crooks, had been spotted on the roof of a building less than 150 yards (135 meters) from the rally stage where Trump was speaking.\n\nPeople are also reading...

It also suggested that Rowe, with ready and generally detailed answers, was determined to strike a different posture than that of his predecessor, Kimberly Cheatle, who resigned last week after facing intense criticism from lawmakers from both major political parties following responses at a congressional hearing that were seen as evasive and lacking in specifics.\n\nTuesday's hearing before the Senate Judiciary and Homeland Security committees was the latest in a series of congressional sessions dedicated to the law enforcement lapses and missed communications that preceded the shooting.\n\nLocal law enforcement officers had first observed a suspicious-looking man at the rally site more than an hour before the event and circulated that information, including photographs of a man who turned out to be Crooks. But the officers ultimately lost track of Crooks, who was able to scale the roof of a building at AGR International Inc., a supplier of automation equipment for the glass and plastic packaging industry, and fire an estimated eight shots with an AR-15-style rife.\n\nShortly before the shooting, a local officer climbed up to the roof to investigate. Crooks turned and pointed his rifle at the officer, who retreated.\n\nEven though text messages among local snipers revealed anxiety about the man, Rowe said the only thing the Secret Service knew at the time of the shooting was that law enforcement was contending with a suspicious-looking man.\n\n\"No information regarding a weapon on a roof was ever passed to our personnel,\" Rowe said. At another point, he noted, \"It is troubling to me that we did not get that information as quickly as we should have. We didn't know that there was this incident going on.\"\n\nBut Rowe's willingness to assign blame to local law enforcement opened him up to harsh criticism from Senate Republicans, who saw him as failing to take sufficient responsibility.\n\n\"Isn't the fact that a former president was shot, that a good American is dead, that other Americans were critically wounded -- isn't that enough mission failure for you to say to the person who decided that that building should not be in the security perimeter, probably ought to be stepped down?\" said Sen. Josh Hawley, a Missouri Republican.\n\nRowe, raising his voice, responded that he has \"lost sleep over this for the last 17 days\" and that he would not be rushed \"to judgment\" by Congress. He assured lawmakers that \"people will be held accountable.\"\n\nSen. Lindsey Graham, the top Republican on the Senate Judiciary Committee, said if something like this happened in the military, \"a lot of people would be fired. And if a lot of people are not fired, the system failed yet again.\"\n\nHe added: \"Nothing's going to change until somebody loses their job.\"\n\nThe FBI, meanwhile, disclosed new details about Crooks, with Deputy Director Paul Abbate saying a social media account believed to be associated with the gunman suspected in the assassination attempt espoused political violence and included antisemitic and anti-immigrant sentiment. The posts were from the 2019-2020 timeframe, when Crooks would have been in high school.\n\nAbbate did not identify the social media platform, saying investigators were still trying to definitively determine that it belonged to Crooks. However, he indicated that it was separate from an account on a different platform called Gab that was active in 2021.\n\nThe chief executive of Gab posted on X, formerly known as Twitter, during the Senate hearing that Crooks's presence on that platform was consistent with being \"pro-Biden and in particular pro-Biden's immigration policy.\"\n\nOn Monday, the FBI revealed that Crooks had looked online for information about mass shootings, power plants, improvised explosive devices and the May assassination attempt of the Slovakian prime minister Robert Fico.\n\nThe FBI also said that Trump has agreed to be interviewed by agents as a crime victim.\n\n0 Comments Love 0 Funny 0 Wow 0 Sad 0 Angry 0\n\nBe the first to know\n\nGet local news delivered to your inbox!\n\nSign up! * I understand

The acting director appeared before the Senate Judiciary and Homeland Security committees on Tuesday alongside FBI Deputy Director Paul Abbate.\n\nRowe detailed the failure of a drone detection system that was supposed to be online before shooter Thomas Matthew Crooks conducted his own reconnaissance the day of the rally.\n\nInvestigators say the drone system was reliant on public cellphone service and that there were bandwidth issues, causing the system to only go online at 5:20 pm. instead of 3 p.m.\n\nTRUMP SHOOTING: TIMELINE OF ASSASSINATION ATTEMPT RAISES QUESTIONS ABOUT HOW GUNMAN EVADED SECURITY\n\n\"Why is the Secret Service dependent upon local a cellular network? Does the Secret Service have a backup plan in place?\" asked Sen. Chuck Grassley, R-Iowa.\n\nTRUMP ASSASSINATION ATTEMPT: TEXTS REVEAL OFFICERS WERE AWARE OF THOMAS CROOKS 90 MINUTES BEFORE SHOOTING\n\n\"That is something ... that has cost me a lot of sleep because of the eventual outcome of the assailant. What if we had a geolocated him because that counter-UAS platform had been up?\" Rowe said. \"It is something that I have struggled with to understand, and I have no explanation for it. It is something that I feel as though could have perhaps found him. We could have maybe stopped him. Maybe on that particular day he would have decided this isn't the day to do it, because law enforcement just found me flying my drone.\"\n\n\"People fly drones all the time on the peripheries of our sites, and we go out and we talk to them and we ascertain what their intentions are. On this day, in particular, because of the connectivity challenge, as you noted, there was a delay and he flew his drone at 3:51, approximately. So moving forward, we are leveraging resources from the Department of Homeland Security and others to make sure that we have dedicated connectivity. So that we're not reliant on public domain so that we can ensure that whatever assets we have in place, those assets are operational, and that is my commitment to you that we are going to make sure we're going to do that,\" Rowe continued.\n\nTRUMPF RALLY SHOOTING VICTIMS' FAMILIES BREAK SILENCE, THANK COMMUNITY FOR 'OUTPOURING OF SUPPORT'\n\nLawmakers continued to press Rowe on why there was no security coverage of the building Crooks used to fire on Trump. The official said admitted he \"cannot understand\" how it was overlooked.\n\nRowe said a local sniper team was supposed to be stationed at a sight with a direct view of the rooftop, but the position was abandoned. Despite multiple weeks of investigation, Rowe says the Secret Service has not confirmed why the position was abandoned.\n\nSen. Josh Hawley, R-MO., got into a heated back-and-forth with Rowe over why no Secret Service agents have been relieved of duty or suspended as of yet in relation to the shooting.\n\nRowe insisted that he wait for the conclusion of the investigation before making any firings, while Hawley argued that the reality of a former president being shot should be enough to act without delay.\n\nSen. Rick Scott, R-Fla., also admonished both Rowe and Abbate for their lack of transparency in the investigation. He compared the incident to the shooting at Pulse Nightclub during his time as the governor of Florida, saying the Secret Service and FBI should be conducting near-daily press conferences.\n\nA top detail lawmakers honed in on was the fact that Crooks was confirmed to be holding a range finder but was deemed only a suspicious person rather than a threat. Rowe confirmed that range finders-this one designed for golf-are not on the Secret Service's list of prohibited items. He said the agency will add it in the near future.\n\nSen. Marsha Blackburn, R-Tenn., later referenced a whistleblower letter from a Secret Service countersniper who stated that the work environment within the agency needed massive reforms.\n\nHer office did not immediately respond to a request to see the letter.\n\nAbbate later revealed that the FBI has yet to gain full access to the apps on Crooks' phone, saying some content remains hidden on encrypted messaging apps.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nAbbate went on to say that the FBI believes it has identified one of Crooks' social media accounts, but they have yet to fully verify its ownership.\n\nThis is a developing story.

Trump, injuring him and others and killing a rally attendee.\n\nWhile Ronald L. Rowe Jr., the acting director, provided a more complete account of what happened that day than his predecessor did a week ago, he failed to answer a critical question about that day: Who was supposed to be watching that roof?\n\nIn one of his first actions as acting director, Mr. Rowe said he went to the site of the shooting in Butler, Pa., and specifically to the warehouse roof that the gunman used, which had been unmanned and apparently unwatched.\n\nMr. Rowe said he climbed onto the building and laid on the roof so he could see the direct line that the shooter, later identified as Thomas Crooks of Bethel Park, Pa., had to Mr. Trump.\n\n\"What I saw made me ashamed,\" Mr. Rowe told a joint hearing of the Senate Homeland Security and Judiciary committees. \"As a career law enforcement officer and a 25-year veteran with the Secret Service, I cannot defend why that roof was not better secured.\"\n\nHe said that the Secret Service would ensure that local and or state law enforcement are on roofs in the future. In Butler, there were two local countersnipers in one of the warehouse buildings, watching the crowd from windows, at the time Mr. Crooks ascended to the roof of the adjacent warehouse.\n\n\"We are looking at this, and they should have been on the roof, and the fact they were in the building is something I'm still trying to understand.\" Mr. Rowe said.\n\nThe Butler County district attorney, who oversees the local countersnipers who were at the rally, has previously said that the Secret Service never told his agents to cover the roof Mr. Crooks used.\n\nMr. Rowe described problems with communications among law enforcement agencies that ultimately delayed critical information from being relayed to the Secret Service. He said that the agency's plans to use equipment that would have detected the gunman's use of a drone hours earlier was stymied by the local cellular service.\n\nUltimately, Mr. Rowe said, the events of July 13 were a result of \"a failure of imagination\" to see that \"we actually do live in a very dangerous world where people do actually want to do harm to our protectee.\"\n\n\"But we didn't challenge our own assumptions,\" he said. \"We assumed that someone is going to cover that.\"\n\nThis is a developing story.

He told the Senate committees that the 20-year-old visited the site on July 7 for about 20 minutes in what the FBI claims was a reconnaissance visit, USA Today reported.\n\nActing Secret Service director Ronald Rowe -- who replaced the agency's former director Kimberly Cheatle after she failed to satisfactorily answer the committee's questions -- appeared alongside Abbate. Rowe told the Senate that he visited the rally site and climbed onto the roof that Crooks fired from.\n\n\"What I saw made me ashamed,\" Rowe said. \"As a career law enforcement officer, and a 25-year veteran with the Secret Service, I cannot defend why that roof was not better secured.\"\n\nThe former president was shot at on July 13 with an AR-15-style rifle during a rally in Butler, Pennsylvania. While Trump narrowly escaped death, with a wound to his right ear, the subsequent bullets intended for him killed one rally attendee and injured two others.\n\nInvestigators described Crooks as a loner whose social network was limited to immediate family members.", "source": {"uri": "salon.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Salon.com"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Attempted_assassination_of_Ronald_Reagan", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Attempted assassination of Ronald Reagan"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Senate", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "United States Senate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_Abbate", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Paul Abbate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deputy_Director_of_the_Federal_Bureau_of_Investigation", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Deputy Director of the Federal Bureau of Investigation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Judiciary", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Judiciary"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Department_of_Homeland_Security", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "United States Department of Homeland Security"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_media", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Social media"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Opposition_to_immigration", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Opposition to immigration"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antisemitism", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Antisemitism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Bureau_of_Investigation", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Federal Bureau of Investigation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Middle_East", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Middle East"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Washington,_D.C.", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Washington, D.C."}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Washington, D.C."}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Political_violence", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Political violence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kimberly_Cheatle", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Kimberly Cheatle"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Law_enforcement", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Law enforcement"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Secret_Service", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "United States Secret Service"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/USA_Today", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "USA Today"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agence_France-Presse", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Agence France-Presse"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reuters", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Reuters"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Butler,_Pennsylvania", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Butler, Pennsylvania"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Butler, Pennsylvania"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Terrorism", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Terrorism", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Warfare_and_Conflict", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Warfare and Conflict", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Crime_and_Justice", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Crime and Justice", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Theft", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Theft", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 54}, {"uri": "news/Technology", "label": "news/Technology", "wgt": 46}], "image": "https://mediaproxy.salon.com/width/1200/https://media2.salon.com/2024/07/paul-abbate-216393547.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9772518", "eventUri": "eng-9772518", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-07-07", "textStart": 1309, "textEnd": 1315}, {"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-07-13", "textStart": 1933, "textEnd": 1940}], "sentiment": -0.05098039215686279, "wgt": 164, "relevance": 1}

Chuck Grassley called for answers Tuesday over the \"communication breakdown\" between Pennsylvania law enforcement and the Secret Service that led to the assassination attempt on former President Donald Trump, the 2024 Republican presidential nominee.\n\nText messages, police body camera footage and an after-action report obtained by Grassley provide the most detailed picture yet of security failures surrounding the shooting at the July 13 campaign rally in Butler, Pa.\n\nGrassley, appearing Tuesday on Fox News' \"America's Newsroom\" ahead of a Senate hearing with the FBI and Secret Service, said \"there's just a lot of shortcomings\" about law enforcement lapses in the hours before the attempted assassination of Trump.\n\n\"It's just bad when a member of Congress has to get his information from local law enforcement instead of from the federal agencies,\" Grassley said. \"(I've) turned over everything (I) have now, and if (I) get more, (I)'ll turn it over. I believe in transparency. The public's business ought to be public, and the protection of a presidential candidate ought to be a top priority.\"\n\nThe acting director of the Secret Service said Tuesday he \"cannot defend\" why the roof used by the gunman was not secured, the Associated Press reported.\n\nRonald Rowe became acting director last week after Kimberly Cheatle resigned amid mounting criticism by members of Congress over a lack of substantive answers during a hearing about the communication failures preceding the July 13 shooting.\n\nRowe testified Tuesday before two Senate committees. He was joined by FBI Deputy Director Paul Abbate at a joint hearing of the Senate Judiciary and Homeland Security committees.\n\nGrassley pressed Rowe about the failed vetting and communications procedures that led to the near-assassination of the former president.\n\nRowe said he \"had no explanation\" for some of the Secret Service's shortcomings at the July 13 campaign rally, and committed to improving certain agency procedures and providing \"rolling\" updates to Congress and the public.\n\nGrassley also asked about the Secret Service and local law enforcement's use of a drone to monitor the rally location. In a letter last week asking for the Secret Service's operational plan and other records, Grassley included a document showing that a Counter Unmanned Aerial System operator was on the list of personnel for the rally.\n\nNBC News has reported that deceased gunman Thomas Matthew Crooks flew a drone over the rally site a few hours before Trump began speaking.\n\n\"According to the Secret Service, the drone system was supposed to be operational at 3 p.m. that day,\" Grassley said during his questioning of Rowe. \"However, we've been told by Secret Service that because of cellular bandwidth problems, it wasn't operational until about 5:20 (p.m.) on that day. If the system was operational, Secret Service would've had the ability to detect the shooter and his own drone use. Why is the Secret Service dependent upon local cellular networks? Does Secret Service have back up plans in place?\"\n\nRowe said the Secret Service's failure to detect the shooter's drone has \"cost me a lot of sleep.\" Had the Secret Service's platform been operational, Rowe noted, it might have been able to locate Crooks and intervene.\n\nRowe committed to leveraging Department of Homeland Security resources to provide the Secret Service guaranteed connectivity to its drone. He said the lapse \"is something that I have struggled with to understand.\"\n\n\"It is something that I feel as though we could have perhaps found him,\" he said. \"We could have maybe stopped him.\"\n\nAccording to documents released by Grassley's office, law enforcement officers knew of and communicated presence of Crooks, 20, of Bethel Park, Pa., at the rally to federal counterparts more than 90 minutes before he climbed onto a roof of what's known as the AGR Building and fired eight rounds toward Trump.\n\nBelow is a summary of local law enforcement's planning and communications regarding the Trump event, according to records released by Grassley's office:\n\nJuly 13\n\nGrassley underscored the need to pass legislation he introduced with Nevada Democratic U.S. Sen. Catherine Cortez Masto, which would subject Secret Service directors to Senate confirmation and a single, 10-year term.\n\n\"The Secret Service's core mission is to protect the individuals entrusted to its care,\" Grassley said in a statement. \"President Trump's brush with death was a Secret Service failure of epic proportions, and this mission failure must never be repeated.\"\n\nHe called the bill a \"crucial step toward providing the transparency and accountability that Congress and the American people deserve from the Secret Service.\"", "source": {"uri": "thegazette.com", "dataType":

Sen. Hawley gets into shouting match with Secret Service acting director over assassination attempt", "body": "Republican Missouri Sen. Josh Hawley engaged in a shouting match with Acting Secret Service Director Ronald Rowe Jr. on Tuesday over the agency's handling of the assassination attempt against Republican nominee Donald Trump.\n\nRowe testified before the U.S. Senate Judiciary Committee on Tuesday about the handling of the assassination attempt during a July 13 rally in Butler, Pennsylvania. Hawley pressed Rowe on the lack of firings that occurred over the failures to surveil the rooftop where the would-be assassin, Thomas Matthew Crooks, opened fire.\n\n\"You're asking me, senator, to completely make a rush to judgment about somebody failing. I acknowledge this was a failure -- \" Rowe said during the questioning.\n\n\"Is it not prima facie that somebody has failed? The former president was shot!\" Hawley interjected.\n\nRowe said he has \"lost sleep\" over the handling of the assassination attempt since the incident occurred, and assured Hawley that he would hold people accountable \"with integrity\" and not \"rush to judgment.\"\n\n\"Then fire somebody to hold them accountable!\" Hawley shouted.\n\n\"And I will do so with integrity and not rush to judgment and put people unfairly persecuted,\" Rowe said.\n\nThe senator then confronted Rowe on reports that the Secret Service denied the Trump campaign's request for additional security, which Department of Homeland Security (DHS) Alejandro Mayorkas said on July 15 was \"unequivocally false.\" Rowe also denied the reports and said he had no involvement in that type of decision-making.\n\nWhistleblowers reportedly told Hawley that Secret Service agents were assigned to be present on the roof where Crooks fired eight bullets into the crowd, but did not do so because of the hot temperature. Rowe said the agents \"posted up inside\" and assured that state and local counter snipers were present on roofs during political events.\n\n\"Again senator, we are looking at this, and they should've been on that roof and the fact that they were in the building is something I'm still trying to understand,\" Rowe said.\n\n\"I just want to express my frustration, director, that seventeen days or whatever it's been that whistleblowers are telling us more than you are and you don't know, you haven't ascertained if there was supposed to be law enforcement on the roof. That seems like a pretty basic fact. I'm also told that law enforcement suppliers offered the Secret Service drones, and you declined them,\" Hawley said.\n\nA whistleblower reportedly told Hawley's office that local enforcement offered drone technology to the Secret Service the night before the rally that allegedly had the capability to both monitor and \"neutralize\" potential threats, according to a July 25 letter sent by Hawley to the DHS. Rowe confirmed the agency was offered to fly a drone over the stadium and said they \"probably\" should have accepted the offer.\n\nHawley immediately pushed back against Rowe after he said he had been \"transparent and forthcoming\" regarding the information he obtained about the shooting.\n\n\"Your agency has not been transparent and forthcoming,\" Hawley interrupted. \"So please, let's not go there.\"\n\n\"I have been forthcoming, sir,\" Rowe pushed back, leading Hawley to point out he has not fired any of his personnel.\n\nMembers of the Secret Service and the FBI told lawmakers on July 17 that officials noticed Crooks approximately 50 minutes before Trump took the stage during the rally. The Secret Service reportedly witnessed Crooks on the roof about 20 minutes before he fired shots into the crowd.\n\nRepublican Iowa Sen. Chuck Grassley obtained text messages on Monday suggesting that law enforcement flagged Crooks to their colleagues as a suspicious presence nearly 90 minutes before the shooting, according to The New York Times. Officers spotted Crooks as he was using a rangefinder, but did not approach him.\n\nCrooks' attack injured Trump in the upper portion of his right ear and killed former fire chief Corey Comperatore as he shielded his two daughters from the bullets. The shooting injured two other rallygoers.\n\nWe have no tolerance for comments containing violence, racism, profanity, vulgarity, doxing, or discourteous behavior.

He said he has also directed resources to facilitate communications with state and local security partners.\n\nThe visit by Crooks to the site took place one day after he registered for the rally on July 6. The rally wasn't announced until July 3.\n\nCrooks traveled from his home to a sportsman club to practice shooting the day before the attack, according to Abbate. On the morning of the attack, he returned to the rally grounds for about 70 minutes.

WATCH Josh Hawley get into shouting match with Secret Service acting director over assassination attempt * WorldNetDaily * by Nicole Silverio, Daily Caller News Foundation", "body": "Republican Missouri Sen. Josh Hawley engaged in a shouting match with Acting Secret Service Director Ronald Rowe Jr. on Tuesday over the agency's handling of the assassination attempt against Republican nominee Donald Trump.\n\nRowe testified before the U.S. Senate Judiciary Committee on Tuesday about the handling of the assassination attempt during a July 13 rally in Butler, Pennsylvania. Hawley pressed Rowe on the lack of firings that occurred over the failures to surveil the rooftop where the would-be assassin, Thomas Matthew Crooks, opened fire.\n\n\"You're asking me, senator, to completely make a rush to judgment about somebody failing. I acknowledge, this was a failure -- \" Rowe said during the questioning.\n\n\"Is it not prima facie that somebody has failed? The former president was shot!\" Hawley interjected.\n\nGet the hottest, most important news stories on the Internet - delivered FREE to your inbox as soon as they break! Take just 30 seconds and sign up for WND's Email News Alerts!\n\nRowe said he has \"lost sleep\" over the handling of the assassination attempt since the incident occurred, and assured Hawley that he would hold people accountable \"with integrity\" and not \"rush to judgement.\"\n\n\"Then fire somebody to hold them accountable!\" Hawley shouted.\n\n\"And I will do so with integrity and not rush to judgment and put people unfairly persecuted,\" Rowe said.\n\nThe senator then confronted Rowe on reports that the Secret Service denyied the Trump campaign's request for additional security, which Department of Homeland Security (DHS) Alejandro Mayorkas said on July 15 was \"unequivocally false.\" Rowe also denied the reports said he had no involvement in that type of decision making.\n\nWhistleblowers reportedly told Hawley that Secret Service agents were assigned to be present on the roof where Crooks fired eight bullets into the crowd, but did not do so because of the hot temperature. Rowe said the agents \"posted up inside\" and assured that state and local counter snipers were present on roofs during political events.\n\n\"Again senator, we are looking at this, and they should've been on that roof and the fact that they were in the building is something I'm still trying to understand,\" Rowe said.\n\n\"I just want to express my frustration, director, that seventeen days or whatever it's been that whistleblowers are telling us more than you are and you don't know, you haven't ascertained if there was supposed to be law enforcement on the roof. That seems like a pretty basic fact. I'm also told that law enforcement suppliers offered the Secret Service drones, and you declined them,\" Hawley said.\n\nA whistleblower reportedly told Hawley's office that local enforcement offered drone technology to the Secret Service the night before the rally that allegedly had the capability to both monitor and \"neutralize\" potential threats, according to a July 25 letter sent by Hawley to the DHS. Rowe confirmed the agency was offered to fly a drone over the stadium and said they \"probably\" should have accepted the offer.\n\nHawley immediately pushed back against Rowe after he said he has been \"transparent and forthcoming\" regarding the information he obtained about the shooting.\n\n\"Your agency has not been transparent and forthcoming,\" Hawley interrupted. \"So please, let's not go there.\"\n\n\"I have been forthcoming, sir,\" Rowe pushed back, leading Hawley to point out he has not fired any of his personnel.\n\nMembers of the Secret Service and the FBI told lawmakers on July 17 that officials noticed Crooks approximately 50 minutes before Trump took the stage during the rally. The Secret Service reportedly witnessed Crooks on the roof about 20 minutes before he fired shots into the crowd.\n\nRepublican Iowa Sen. Chuck Grassley obtained text messages on Monday suggesting that law enforcement flagged Crooks to their colleagues as a suspicious presence nearly 90 minutes before the shooting, according to the New York Times.

Sen. Hawley Gets Into Shouting Match With Secret Service Acting Director Over Assassination Attempt", "body": "Republican Missouri Sen. Josh Hawley engaged in a shouting match with Acting Secret Service Director Ronald Rowe Jr. on Tuesday over the agency's handling of the assassination attempt against Republican nominee Donald Trump.\n\nRowe testified before the U.S. Senate Judiciary Committee on Tuesday about the handling of the assassination attempt during a July 13 rally in Butler, Pennsylvania. Hawley pressed Rowe on the lack of firings that occurred over the failures to surveil the rooftop where the would-be assassin, Thomas Matthew Crooks, opened fire.\n\n\"You're asking me, senator, to completely make a rush to judgment about somebody failing. I acknowledge, this was a failure -- \" Rowe said during the questioning.\n\n\"Is it not prima facie that somebody has failed? The former president was shot!\" Hawley interjected.\n\nRowe said he has \"lost sleep\" over the handling of the assassination attempt since the incident occurred, and assured Hawley that he would hold people accountable \"with integrity\" and not \"rush to judgement.\"\n\n\"Then fire somebody to hold them accountable!\" Hawley shouted.\n\n\"And I will do so with integrity and not rush to judgment and put people unfairly persecuted,\" Rowe said.\n\nThe senator then confronted Rowe on reports that the Secret Service denyied the Trump campaign's request for additional security, which Department of Homeland Security (DHS) Alejandro Mayorkas said on July 15 was \"unequivocally false.\" Rowe also denied the reports said he had no involvement in that type of decision making. (RELATED: Trump Announces Return To Butler For New Rally After Assassination Attempt)\n\nWhistleblowers reportedly told Hawley that Secret Service agents were assigned to be present on the roof where Crooks fired eight bullets into the crowd, but did not do so because of the hot temperature. Rowe said the agents \"posted up inside\" and assured that state and local counter snipers were present on roofs during political events.\n\n\"Again senator, we are looking at this, and they should've been on that roof and the fact that they were in the building is something I'm still trying to understand,\" Rowe said.\n\n\"I just want to express my frustration, director, that seventeen days or whatever it's been that whistleblowers are telling us more than you are and you don't know, you haven't ascertained if there was supposed to be law enforcement on the roof. That seems like a pretty basic fact. I'm also told that law enforcement suppliers offered the Secret Service drones, and you declined them,\" Hawley said.\n\nA whistleblower reportedly told Hawley's office that local enforcement offered drone technology to the Secret Service the night before the rally that allegedly had the capability to both monitor and \"neutralize\" potential threats, according to a July 25 letter sent by Hawley to the DHS. Rowe confirmed the agency was offered to fly a drone over the stadium and said they \"probably\" should have accepted the offer.\n\nHawley immediately pushed back against Rowe after he said he has been \"transparent and forthcoming\" regarding the information he obtained about the shooting.\n\n\"Your agency has not been transparent and forthcoming,\" Hawley interrupted. \"So please, let's not go there.\"\n\n\"I have been forthcoming, sir,\" Rowe pushed back, leading Hawley to point out he has not fired any of his personnel.\n\nMembers of the Secret Service and the FBI told lawmakers on July 17 that officials noticed Crooks approximately 50 minutes before Trump took the stage during the rally. The Secret Service reportedly witnessed Crooks on the roof about 20 minutes before he fired shots into the crowd.\n\nRepublican Iowa Sen. Chuck Grassley obtained text messages on Monday suggesting that law enforcement flagged Crooks to their colleagues as a suspicious presence nearly 90 minutes before the shooting, according to The New York Times. Officers spotted Crooks as he was using a rangefinder, but did not approach him.\n\nCrooks' attack injured Trump in the upper portion of his right ear and killed former fire chief Corey Comperatore as he shielded his two daughters from the bullets. The shooting injured two other rally goers.\n\nAll content created by the Daily Caller News Foundation, an independent and nonpartisan newswire service, is available without charge to any legitimate news publisher that can provide a large audience.

They need to be focused on the mission at hand.\"\n\nWhile he was unable to reveal many details because of the sensitive nature of the Secret Service's protective work, Mr Rowe said that the agency he now oversee has already addressing \"identified gaps in our security\".\n\nMr Rowe added that he \"will not wait\" for various investigations to be finished to ensure \"we do not repeat those failures\".\n\nIn addition to its plans for drone threats, Mr Rowe outlined intentions to reform how the Secret Service communicates internally and with local police before and during events.\n\nOfficials have said that much of the communications chatter at the Butler rally took place via text messages, potentially contributing to confusion over reports of a suspicious person.\n\nMr Rowe said that suspicions about Crooks were \"stuck or siloed\" in a communications channel used mostly by state and local officers.\n\n\"It was great [that] there was a text chain,\" Mr Rowe said. \"But that communication needs to go over the net. It needs to go over a radio channel so that everyone has situational awareness of it....I want people using the radio.\"\n\nMr Rowe added that the service will move to ban rangefinders - devices which measure distances between the user and a fixed distance - at future events.\n\nOne of the lingering mysteries about the Butler shooting is how Crooks was able to get a rifle onto the rooftop of the now-infamous American Glass Research building in Butler, which is where he had a clear shot of Trump.\n\nNeither Mr Rowe or Mr Abbate was able to answer that question.\n\n\"We don't have definitive evidence as to how he got the rifle up there,\" Mr Abbate said, although officials believe it was in a backpack he had with him at the rally.\n\nAccording to Mr Abbate, the rifle \"would have been visible\" if placed in the bag while assembled.\n\n\"We don't have anyone who observed him with the backpack with a rifle barrel or other parts sticking out,\" he said. \"The rifle would not have fit fully into this backpack, concealed and whole.\"\n\nNewly uncovered video shows Crooks retrieving the bag from his car shortly before climbing up to the roof and firing eight shots at Trump's podium.\n\n\"It's possible he broke the rifle down and took it out of the bag in those moments before and re-assembled it there,\" Mr Abbate said. \"That's one of the theories that we're looking at.\"\n\nDespite conducting hundreds of interviews and poring over mountains of digital evidence, the two law enforcement leaders said that investigators have not yet been able to conclusively provide a motive that can explain why Crooks drove to the rally and opened fire.\n\nMr Abbate revealed that investigators have unearthed a social media account they believe may be tied to Crooks - a discovery that could potentially provide a glimpse at his worldview.\n\nThe account, which includes more than 700 posts, dates back to 2019 and 2020, Mr Abbate said.\n\nMr Abbate added that the posts, \"if ultimately attributable to the shooter, appear to reflect antisemitic and anti-immigration themes, to espouse political violence, and are described as extreme in nature.\"\n\n\"While the investigative team is still working to verify this account to determine if it did in fact belong to the shooter, we believe it is important to share and note today,\" he said. \"Our work is very much ongoing and urgent.\"\n\nEven as the investigation into what took place continues, some lawmakers at the hearing made it clear that they expect additional disciplinary actions to take place.\n\nSouth Carolina Republican Lindsey Graham, for example, said that the \"best way to make sure it doesn't have to happen again is to fire people, so that those who come behind them will realise there's a consequence for not getting it right\".\n\nWhile Mr Rowe said he would \"not rush to judgement\", he did promise that \"people will be held accountable\".\n\n\"If there were policy violations, those individuals will be held accountable,\" he said. \"They will be held to our table of penalties, which will include up to termination.\"", "source": {"uri": "yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo"},

Ron Johnson (R-WI), Ted Cruz (R-TX), and Marsha Blackburn (R-TN) indicated that whistleblowers have been able to fill in key details since the shooting on July 13, which left one dead, two seriously injured, and Trump with a minor injury.\n\n\"We need more whistleblowers,\" Johnson said. \"We need people inside the agencies who are willing to talk to us, tell the American people what's really happening.\"\n\nJohnson's remarks came during a press conference the lawmakers held right after a Senate hearing on the shooting, where acting Secret Service Director Ronald Rowe and FBI Deputy Director Paul Abbate both testified.\n\nBlackburn applauded whistleblowers who had already come forward, pointing to a report in RealClearPolitics of an internal email allegedly written by a Secret Service whistleblower decrying the bureau's perceived culture of \"CYA,\" an acronym for \"cover your a**.\"\n\nAt the hearing, Sen. Josh Hawley (R-MO) confronted Rowe about a whistleblower report he received indicating that the Secret Service was offered the option to use drone technology at the Trump rally in Butler, Pennsylvania, where the shooting occurred, but an agent repeatedly rejected the offer.\n\n\"There was an offer to fly a drone on that day,\" Rowe said. \"We probably should have taken them up on it.\"\n\nRowe was put in the hot seat after his predecessor, former Secret Service Director Kimberly Cheatle, resigned following her inability to answer numerous questions at a similar hearing about the stunning security failures that led to the assassination attempt. The gunman, 20-year-old Thomas Matthew Crooks, was able to access a nearby rooftop and fire eight shots into the rally crowd.\n\nSeveral senators at the hearing zeroed in on communication failures between the Secret Service and local law enforcement at the rally, but Cruz grilled Rowe on reports that the Secret Service had at times denied additional security requests from Trump since he left office.\n\nRowe said Trump was provided all the security assets his team requested for the rally, but he indicated that there were times in the past couple of years when this was not the case.\n\nCruz said he believed Secret Service leadership \"made a political decision to deny these requests.\"\n\n\"Secret Service agents are not political,\" Rowe replied.\n\nCLICK HERE TO READ MORE FROM THE WASHINGTON EXAMINER\n\nLater at the press conference, Cruz commended Rowe for doing \"marginally better\" than Cheatle but was still unconvinced that politics were not a factor in the Secret Service. Cruz reiterated the plea for more whistleblowers, saying they could shed light on the matter.\n\n\"I want to underscore the call that has come from multiple senators for whistleblowers,\" Cruz said. \"I believe the rational inference from the evidence we know now is it was political bias at the top, at the leadership of the Secret Service, that led to insufficient agents and insufficient resources being devoted to protecting President Trump.\"", "source": {"uri": "washingtonexaminer.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Washington Examiner"}, "authors": [{"uri": "ashley_oliver@washingtonexaminer.com", "name": "Ashley Oliver", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Whistleblower", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Whistleblower"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Senate", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "United States Senate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Secret_Service", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "United States Secret Service"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Attempted_assassination_of_Ronald_Reagan", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Attempted assassination of Ronald Reagan"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ted_Cruz", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Ted Cruz"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marsha_Blackburn", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Marsha Blackburn"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unmanned_aerial_vehicle", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Unmanned aerial vehicle"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Congress", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States Congress"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republican_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Republican Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kimberly_Cheatle", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Kimberly Cheatle"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_Abbate", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Paul Abbate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RealClearPolitics", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "RealClearPolitics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Bureau_of_Investigation", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Federal Bureau of Investigation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acronym", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Acronym"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Josh_Hawley", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Josh Hawley"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Butler,_Pennsylvania", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Butler, Pennsylvania"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Butler, Pennsylvania"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blackburn", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Blackburn"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Blackburn"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Law_enforcement", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Law enforcement"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bias", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Bias"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Terrorism", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Terrorism", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Warfare_and_Conflict", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Warfare and Conflict", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Crime_and_Justice", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Crime and Justice", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Theft", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Theft", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Fraud", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Fraud", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 87}], "image": "https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/secret-service-hawley_334.webp", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9772518", "eventUri": "eng-9772518", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-07-13", "textStart": 428, "textEnd": 435}], "sentiment": -0.2, "wgt": 162, "relevance": 1}

Republican Iowa Sen. Chuck Grassley, during a Senate Judiciary Committee hearing, asked Rowe why the Secret Service did not have a system in place to track Crooks' drone, with the acting Secret Service director saying he has \"no explanation for it\" and that he has lost sleep over the issue.\n\nWATCH:\n\n\"Secret Service deployed a counter, unmanned aerial system operator on July 13, according to the Secret Service. The drone system was supposed to be operational at 3:00 PM that day.\" Grassley said. \"However, we have been told by Secret Service that because of cellular bandwidth problems, it was not operational until about 5:20 of that day. If the system was operational, Secret Service would have had the ability to detect the shooter and his own drone use. Why is the Secret Service dependent upon local cellular network? Does the Secret Service have a backup plan in place?\"\n\n\"That is something ... that has cost me a lot of sleep because of the eventual outcome of the assailant, that what if we had geo-located him because that counter [unmanned aerial system] platform had been up? It is something that I have struggled with, to understand, and I have no explanation for it,\" Rowe said. \"It is something that I feel as though we could have perhaps found him. We could have maybe stopped him.\"\n\nCrooks killed former volunteer fire chief Corey Comperatore in the attack. He also injured two rally attendees and the former president.\n\n\"Maybe on that particular day he would have decided, this isn't the day to do it because law enforcement just found me flying my drone,\" Rowe continued. \"People fly drones all the time on the peripheries of our sites. And we go out, and we talk to them and ascertain what their intentions are.\"\n\nRowe added that the Secret Service will now be \"leveraging resources from the Department of Homeland Security and others to make sure we have dedicated connectivity so we are not reliant on public domain, so we can ensure whatever assets we have in place, those assets are operational.\"\n\nU.S. Secret Service Director Kimberly Cheatle recently resigned in the aftermath of the assassination attempt and her evasive testimony before Congress.\n\n\"I take full responsibility for the security lapse,\" Cheatle said in an email to staff obtained by the Associated Press. \"In light of recent events, it is with a heavy heart that I have made the difficult decision to step down as your director.\"", "source": {"uri": "dailycallernewsfoundation.org", "dataType": "news", "title": "dailycallernewsfoundation.org"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Secret_Service", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "United States Secret Service"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unmanned_aerial_vehicle", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Unmanned aerial vehicle"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chuck_Grassley", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Chuck Grassley"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Attempted_assassination_of_Ronald_Reagan", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Attempted assassination of Ronald Reagan"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Senate_Committee_on_the_Judiciary", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States Senate Committee on the Judiciary"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_New_York_Times", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "The New York Times"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republican_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Republican Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Butler,_Pennsylvania", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Butler, Pennsylvania"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Butler, Pennsylvania"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iowa", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Iowa"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Iowa"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kimberly_Cheatle", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Kimberly Cheatle"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Law_enforcement", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Law enforcement"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Associated_Press", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Associated Press"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Congress", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "United States Congress"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Department_of_Homeland_Security", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "United States Department of Homeland Security"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_domain", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Public domain"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Theft", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Theft", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Death", "label": "dmoz/Society/Death", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Fraud", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Fraud", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 93}], "image": null, "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9772518", "eventUri": "eng-9772518", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-07-13", "textStart": 826, "textEnd": 833}], "sentiment": -0.1372549019607843, "wgt": 162, "relevance": 1}

Mr. Crooks allegedly fired multiple shots from a rifle starting at 6:11 p.m. He hit four people, including the former president. Former President Trump and two others survived, but the other individual, firefighter Corey Comperatore, died.\n\nLocal law enforcement officials tagged Mr. Crooks as suspicious at 4:26 p.m., in part because he parked by officers' vehicles.

The Senate Judiciary and Homeland Security committees on July 30 convened to question Ronald Rowe Jr., now the acting director of the Secret Service, and FBI Deputy Director Paul Abbate.\n\nRowe has not officially been appointed to replace Cheatle - at least not yet. However, he brought a more cooperative attitude and some answers - or at least partial ones - to a few pertinent questions surrounding the Trump assassination attempt.\n\nLiberty Nation reported that the former director completely stonewalled a joint House committee. Unlike Rowe, Cheatle showed no signs of humility, not even of dismay or disappointment, that the agency she headed had failed so badly in its mission that a former - and possibly future - US president was almost killed. She provided no clear answers or explanations, offered no conclusions, and evaded multiple opportunities to reassure members of Congress that anyone in the Secret Service would be held accountable for mistakes.\n\nHer successor - or temporary successor - was at least willing to assert that when internal investigations had been completed, agency personnel found at fault would face disciplinary action and possibly termination of employment. Obviously, someone from the Secret Service on the ground that day in Butler, PA, failed to carry out his or her duty adequately. This is not speculation; it's fact. After all, if nobody assigned to protect the former president had done anything wrong or made any bad decisions, then an untrained 20-year-old wouldn't have gotten off eight shots in the direction of Trump and his supporters.\n\nRowe conceded unequivocally that the Secret Service bore responsibility for the fatal security lapses. He also shed some light on a couple of issues that have spawned conspiracy theories, heated debate, and sheer disbelief in the media and on social media platforms.\n\nWhy had the Secret Service not deployed one or more drones for aerial coverage and reconnaissance prior to Trump's rally? According to Rowe, technical issues prevented the timely deployment of drones - until it was too late. That didn't seem to satisfy any of the committee members present, and it appeared Rowe himself was not particularly happy that he had to provide such an answer.\n\nAs for why there was no immediate action from one of the Secret Service counter-sniper teams when reports that a gunman was on the roof of a building less than 200 yards from the stage, the agency's new boss asserted that local law enforcement did not pass on that information. If true, that was a catastrophic breakdown in communications. It remains to be seen how that blunder will be responded to at the state or local level in Pennsylvania.\n\nAs Liberty Nation noted shortly after the assassination attempt, the big question is why the roof from which the shooter opened fire was not manned. It was never adequate that this vantage point was supposedly being observed from another location by a counter-sniper team. Rowe conceded that someone should have been posted on that roof but couldn't explain why that was not the case.\n\nRowe's ability to give detailed answers to questions ended abruptly when it was Missouri Republican Sen. Josh Hawley's turn to confront him. It is an unfortunate - and perhaps centuries-old - truth that most politicians would rather be seen doing something than actually doing something, that they are more interested in casting blame than finding solutions. Hawley repeatedly cut off the Secret Service boss in mid-sentence and seemed interested only in hearing that someone - anyone - was getting fired.\n\nIt was reminiscent of inquiries held by congressional Democrats in the days of the Trump administration. They had usually already reached a verdict, so to speak, and rarely allowed witnesses at a hearing to finish answering a question - typically because they knew the answer would contradict their own narrative.\n\nSo combative was the senator's tone that the Secret Service head - somewhat understandably, one could argue - also began to raise his voice in an effort to defend himself. For a couple of minutes, the hearing descended into a shouting match as the two men heatedly talked over one another. In the end, nothing was gained by this. Still, Hawley, who will be defending his seat in this year's general election, will be able to brag in fundraising emails that he beat up on the head of the Secret Service for the agency's failure to protect Trump.\n\nTo be fair, no one should lose sight of the fact that this was nothing less than an assassination attempt on a former head of state - and quite possibly America's next leader. There is no way to take it lightly or brush off its significance. Ultimately, one or more Secret Service personnel - as well as local law enforcement officers - tasked with protecting Trump, should probably lose their jobs. However, investigations and inquiries do need to be completed. It is totally counterproductive to begin escorting people out of the building with their belongings in a cardboard box before those investigations have concluded.\n\nIf and when the time comes to start handing out pink slips, that's exactly what should happen. Too many people at all levels of government are never held accountable for their mistakes - and they certainly should be. Unfortunately, Hawley - and to a slightly lesser extent Texas Sen. Ted Cruz (R) -- seemed to adopt the somewhat immature attitude that yelling at witnesses and demanding heads on spikes was more important than getting to the bottom of why the attempted assassination was allowed to take place at all.\n\nUnfortunately, as is usually the case with the Joe Biden administration - just as it was during the Barack Obama tenure - the American public may never find the whole truth of how and why things broke down on that fateful day. At some point, no doubt, we will be treated to a heavily redacted report or two from the FBI and Secret Service. Still, neither Trump nor his supporters are ever going to allow the rest of the country to forget this one thing: After eight years of the most extreme and vitriolic rhetoric being directed at him by much of the establishment media and many prominent Democrats, an impressionable young man really did attempt to assassinate him. And this will be the case whether Trump wins or loses in November.", "source": {"uri": "libertynation.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Liberty Nation"}, "authors": [{"uri":

Nothing about a man on the roof. Nothing about a man with a gun.\"\n\nCheatle resigned a day after she was berated by a congressional committee for failing to prevent the attempt on Trump's life.\n\nCheatle testified that the Secret Service had been told about a suspicious person up to five times prior to the shooting.\n\nMeanwhile, the FBI's ongoing investigation into the shooter, Thomas Matthew Crooks, has yet to determine why he tried to kill the former president.\n\nFBI Deputy Director Paul Abbate told lawmakers Tuesday that the bureau has now conducted more than 460 interviews but has so far come up empty.\n\n\"The investigation has not identified a motive, nor any coconspirators or others with advance knowledge,\" Abbate said, adding, \"absolutely nothing has been ruled out.\"\n\nBut the deputy FBI director said a newly discovered social media account used in 2019-2020 may shed some new light on the shooter's motivation.\n\n\"There were over 700 comments posted from this account,\" he told lawmakers. \"Some of these comments, if ultimately attributable to the shooter, appear to reflect antisemitic and anti-immigration themes to espouse political violence and are described as extreme in nature.\"\n\n\"While the investigative team is still working to verify this account to determine if it did in fact belong to the shooter, we believe it important to share it ... particularly given the general absence of other information to date from social media and other sources of information that reflect on the shooter's potential motive and mindset.\"\n\nFBI officials, who briefed reporters on Monday, described Crooks as an intelligent loner and said it appears he \"made significant efforts to conceal his activities,\" which may have begun more than a year ago.\n\nInvestigators said that is when he began using encrypted email accounts and aliases to make online, gun-related purchases, followed by a series of online purchases of chemicals to make the three explosive devices found in his car and bedroom.\n\nCrooks also began to do internet searches on mass shootings, power plants, a variety of elected officials and attempted assassinations.\n\nThey also noted a lack of communication between the shooter and others, in general.\n\n\"We have identified only a couple people who we would call his friends, and most of those contacts were, in fact, dated,\" said FBI Special Agent Kevin Rojek.\n\nRojek added that even the shooter's accounts on gaming platforms showed \"very little interaction,\" describing it as outside the norm.", "source": {"uri": "voanews.com", "dataType": "news",

Chuck Grassley called for answers Tuesday over the \"communication breakdown\" between Pennsylvania law enforcement and the Secret Service that led to the assassination attempt on former President Donald Trump, the 2024 Republican presidential nominee.\n\nText messages, police body camera footage and an after-action report obtained by Grassley provide the most detailed picture yet of security failures surrounding the shooting at the July 13 campaign rally in Butler, Pa.\n\nGrassley, appearing Tuesday on Fox News' \"America's Newsroom\" ahead of a Senate hearing with the FBI and Secret Service, said \"there's just a lot of shortcomings\" about law enforcement lapses in the hours before the attempted assassination of Trump.\n\n\"It's just bad when a member of Congress has to get his information from local law enforcement instead of from the federal agencies,\" Grassley said. \"(I've) turned over everything (I) have now, and if (I) get more, (I)'ll turn it over. I believe in transparency. The public's business ought to be public, and the protection of a presidential candidate ought to be a top priority.\"\n\nPeople are also reading...\n\nSierra signage going up at former Sioux City Bed Bath & Beyond Tom and Molly Bedell's West Lake Okoboji home sells for state record $9.5M North Sioux City crash kills one 4-year-old boy escaped from cage in Iowa home; deputies found him covered in feces on street Sioux City's Lyons Park getting $1.22 million in upgrades Now streaming and on DVD: 'The Richmond Way' gives us the whole 'Ted Lasso' story Body found in Floyd River in Sioux City Sioux City driver charged with vehicular homicide from weekend crash Elk Point man killed in North Sioux City crash Wife of Dakota Dunes fatal stabbing suspect charged as an accessory Financial situation for McCook Lake residents still murky a month after flood State baseball: Scrapy dynamic duo sends Crusaders to state title game, down top seed Wahlert Jason's Frozen Treats open second dine-in ice cream parlor A favorite Sioux City deli stages a comeback with a new lobby and full menu of sandwiches Five rescued after tree falls on Sioux City home; wind storm knocks out power, causes outages\n\nThe acting director of the Secret Service said Tuesday he \"cannot defend\" why the roof used by the gunman was not secured, the Associated Press reported.\n\nRonald Rowe became acting director last week after Kimberly Cheatle resigned amid mounting criticism by members of Congress over a lack of substantive answers during a hearing about the communication failures preceding the July 13 shooting.\n\nRowe testified Tuesday before two Senate committees. He was joined by FBI Deputy Director Paul Abbate at a joint hearing of the Senate Judiciary and Homeland Security committees.\n\nGrassley pressed Rowe about the failed vetting and communications procedures that led to the near-assassination of the former president. Rowe said he \"had no explanation\" for some of the Secret Service's shortcomings at the July 13 campaign rally, and committed to improving certain agency procedures and providing \"rolling\" updates to Congress and the public.\n\nGrassley also asked about the Secret Service and local law enforcement's use of a drone to monitor the rally location. In a letter last week asking for the Secret Service's operational plan and other records, Grassley included a document showing that a Counter Unmanned Aerial System operator was on the list of personnel for the rally.\n\nNBC News has reported that deceased gunman Thomas Matthew Crooks flew a drone over the rally site a few hours before Trump began speaking.\n\n\"According to the Secret Service, the drone system was supposed to be operational at 3 p.m. that day,\" Grassley said during his questioning of Rowe. \"However, we've been told by Secret Service that because of cellular bandwidth problems, it wasn't operational until about 5:20 (p.m.) on that day. If the system was operational, Secret Service would've had the ability to detect the shooter and his own drone use. Why is the Secret Service dependent upon local cellular networks? Does Secret Service have back up plans in place?\"\n\nRowe said the Secret Service's failure to detect the shooter's drone has \"cost me a lot of sleep.\" Had the Secret Service's platform been operational, Rowe noted, it might have been able to locate Crooks and intervene.\n\nRowe committed to leveraging Department of Homeland Security resources to provide the Secret Service guaranteed connectivity to its drone. He said the lapse \"is something that I have struggled with to understand.\"\n\n\"It is something that I feel as though we could have perhaps found him,\" he said. \"We could have maybe stopped him.\"\n\nAccording to documents released by Grassley's office, law enforcement officers knew of and communicated presence of Crooks, 20, of Bethel Park, Pa., at the rally to federal counterparts more than 90 minutes before he climbed onto a roof of what's known as the AGR Building and fired eight rounds toward Trump.\n\nBelow is a summary of local law enforcement's planning and communications regarding the Trump event, according to records released by Grassley's office:\n\nJuly 13\n\n9 a.m.: The Butler County Emergency Response Unit hosts a briefing for local law enforcement ahead of the Trump event. The Secret Service was absent from the briefing\n\n1:03 p.m.: Beaver, Butler and Washington County snipers connect via group chat\n\nLocal sniper locations are noted\n\n4:26 p.m.: A Beaver County sniper finishes his shift and departs the AGR Building. While exiting, he spots Crooks at a picnic table outside and alerts the remaining Beaver and Butler snipers in the AGR Building to Crooks' presence\n\n5:38 p.m.: A Beaver County sniper sends photos of Crooks to the Beaver, Butler and Washington snipers group chat. The Beaver sniper notes Crooks was using \"a range finder looking toward the stage\" and recommends that they notify Secret Service snipers to \"look out\"\n\n5:45 p.m.: A Beaver County sniper sends photos of Crooks to the Beaver County ESU group chat. Beaver law enforcement recommends they alert \"command\"\n\nGrassley underscored the need to pass legislation he introduced with Nevada Democratic U.S. Sen. Catherine Cortez Masto, which would subject Secret Service directors to Senate confirmation and a single, 10-year term.\n\n\"The Secret Service's core mission is to protect the individuals entrusted to its care,\" Grassley said in a statement. \"President Trump's brush with death was a Secret Service failure of epic proportions, and this mission failure must never be repeated.\"\n\nHe called the bill a \"crucial step toward providing the transparency and accountability that Congress and the American people deserve from the Secret Service.\"\n\nLove\n\n0\n\nFunny\n\n0\n\nWow\n\n0\n\nSad\n\n0\n\nAngry\n\n0\n\nBe the first to know\n\nGet local news delivered to your inbox!\n\nSign up!\n\n* I understand and agree that registration

Mike Kelly tapped to lead bipartisan House task force on Trump assassination attempt", "body": "Body cam scenes were captured in the chaotic minutes after Thomas Matthew Crooks took aim at former President Donald Trump on July 13.\n\nU.S. Rep. Mike Kelly will chair a House committee that will investigate the attempted assassination of former President Donald Trump at a rally in Kelly's hometown of Butler.\n\nThe Pennsylvania Republican, who represents the 16th Congressional District, was appointed by Speaker of the House Mike Johnson to lead the bipartisan task force, which will include seven Republicans and six Democrats. Kelly sponsored the legislation to form the task force, which was approved last week.\n\nIn a statement, Kelly thanked Johnson for entrusting him in with the \"important and solemn role\" and he said the task force must \"set politics aside\" to \"restore the faith, trust and confidence\" in our government.\"\n\nAssassination attempt\n\nMinutes into a rally at the Butler Farm Show grounds on July 13, 20-year-old Thomas Matthew Crooks opened fire with an AR-style rifle from the roof of a building near where Trump was speaking. Crooks killed one attendee, Corey Comperatore, a volunteer firefighter who was attempting to shield his wife and daughters when he was struck in the head, and injured two others, who have since been released from the hospital. One of the bullets or bullet fragments grazed Trump's right ear, according to the FBI.\n\nCrooks was killed by U.S. Secret Service sniper fire, which came from an agent positioned on the roof of another building.\n\n'Security breakdowns'\n\nThe U.S. Secret Service and other law enforcement agencies at the rally have faced questions about how Crooks was able to get on the roof and open fire. Reports indicate that several people, including law enforcement, spotted Crooks before the incident and reported him as suspicious. Secret Service snipers spotted Crooks on the roof 20 minutes before the shooting.\n\nFormer U.S. Secret Service Director Kimberly Cheatle was forced to resign July 23, a day after a House Oversight Committee hearing in which lawmakers from both parties called on her to step down.\n\n\"It's critical that we investigate, detail, and explain the security breakdowns that tragically killed one person, injured two others, and nearly claimed President Trump's life,\" Kelly said in a statement. \"We must never let something like this happen again. The American people have a right to know what happened. Congress has a responsibility to find out.\"\n\nMore: Investigation into Trump shooting started within minutes on the roof, but questions linger\n\nJohnson and Democratic Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries issued a joint statement about the bipartisan task force:\n\n\"We have the utmost confidence in this bipartisan group of steady, highly qualified, and capable members of Congress to move quickly to find the facts, ensure accountability, and help make certain such failures never happen again,\" Johnson and Jeffries said.\n\nThe latest\n\nOn Tuesday, members of the U.S. Senate Judiciary and Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs committees held a hearing on the assassination attempt, questioning the new acting director of the Secret Service, Ronald Rowe, and FBI Deputy Director Paul Abbate. In his opening statement, Rowe characterized the security measures taken to protect Trump and rallygoers as a \"failure on multiple levels.\"", "source": {"uri": "eu.poconorecord.com", "dataType":

While officials ultimately neutralized Thomas Matthew Crooks, the 20-year-old assailant, Rowe said he could not understand \"why there was not better coverage or at least somebody looking at that roofline when that's where they were posted.\"\n\nOfficials have not yet identified a motive, Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) Deputy Director Paul Abbate said. There is currently no evidence that the shooter acted with any co-conspirators.\n\nHere's the information we learned during the Senate hearing on July 30.\n\nAbbate said that investigations remain ongoing and details could be refined, but shared a current working timeline of events on the day of the Trump assassination attempt.\n\nCrooks registered to attend the Butler, Pa. Trump rally on July 6. That day, he Googled, \"How far was Oswald from Kennedy,\" referencing the man who shot President John F. Kennedy in 1963 in Dallas. The following day, Crooks visited the Butler farm area where the rally was set to take place, which Abbate says shows Crooks was planning in advance.\n\nThe rally was held on July 13. At 1:30 p.m. that day, Crooks' father gave his son a rifle which he believed Crooks would use at a sportsmen's club, Abbate said. Some 25 minutes later, the shooter bought ammunition while traveling to the Trump event.\n\nRead More: What We Do and Don't Know About Trump's Ear Wound\n\nAt 3:51 p.m., Crooks flew a drone some 200 yards from the Butler farm show grounds. Rowe testified that a counter-drone system wasn't used that day because of connectivity issues. \"On this day in particular, because of the connectivity challenge ... there was a delay,\" he said. If the system had been employed, \"We could have perhaps stopped him,\" Roe said.\n\nLocal SWAT officers first observed the assailant near the American Glass Research (AGR) building where the shooting took place at around 5:32 p.m., Abbate said. At 5:38 p.m., a photo of the shooter was sent in a text message group with local SWAT operators. Rowe later said that information regarding the shooter should have gone through a radio channel so that all officers had \"situational awareness\" of Crooks.\n\nOfficials temporarily lost sight of Crooks, during which the shooter pulled himself onto the rooftop of the AGR building. By 6:08 p.m. local law enforcement saw the shooter on the roof, and a local police officer radioed in that Crooks had a long gun. In the next 30 seconds, some eight shots were fired, according to the number of shell casings found by law enforcement.\n\nThe FBI recently uncovered a social media account that they believe is associated with Crooks, according to Abbate. That account had more than 700 comments that \"appear to reflect antisemitic and anti-immigration themes to espouse political violence and are described as extreme in nature,\" Abbate said.\n\nOfficials are still working to verify that the account belonged to Crooks, but Abbate said it was important to share these new details because of the lack of information regarding Crooks' motive.", "source": {"uri": "time.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "TIME"}, "authors": [{"uri": "solcyre_burga@time.com", "name": "Solcyr\u00e9 Burga", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matt_Crooks", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Matt Crooks"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Attempted_assassination_of_Ronald_Reagan", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Attempted assassination of Ronald Reagan"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Senate", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "United States Senate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Secret_Service", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "United States Secret Service"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kimberly_Cheatle", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Kimberly Cheatle"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_F._Kennedy", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "John F.

He was joined by FBI Deputy Director Paul Abbate at a joint hearing of the Senate Judiciary and Homeland Security committees.\n\nGrassley pressed Rowe about the failed vetting and communications procedures that led to the near-assassination of the former president.\n\nRowe said he \"had no explanation\" for some of the Secret Service's shortcomings at the July 13 campaign rally, and committed to improving certain agency procedures and providing \"rolling\" updates to Congress and the public.\n\nGrassley also asked about the Secret Service and local law enforcement's use of a drone to monitor the rally location. In a letter last week asking for the Secret Service's operational plan and other records, Grassley included a document showing that a Counter Unmanned Aerial System operator was on the list of personnel for the rally.\n\nNBC News has reported that deceased gunman Thomas Matthew Crooks flew a drone over the rally site a few hours before Trump began speaking.\n\n\"According to the Secret Service, the drone system was supposed to be operational at 3 p.m. that day,\" Grassley said during his questioning of Rowe. \"However, we've been told by Secret Service that because of cellular bandwidth problems, it wasn't operational until about 5:20 (p.m.) on that day. If the system was operational, Secret Service would've had the ability to detect the shooter and his own drone use. Why is the Secret Service dependent upon local cellular networks? Does Secret Service have back up plans in place?\"\n\nRowe said the Secret Service's failure to detect the shooter's drone has \"cost me a lot of sleep.\" Had the Secret Service's platform been operational, Rowe noted, it might have been able to locate Crooks and intervene.\n\nRowe committed to leveraging Department of Homeland Security resources to provide the Secret Service guaranteed connectivity to its drone. He said the lapse \"is something that I have struggled with to understand.\"\n\n\"It is something that I feel as though we could have perhaps found him,\" he said. \"We could have maybe stopped him.\"\n\nAccording to documents released by Grassley's office, law enforcement officers knew of and communicated presence of Crooks, 20, of Bethel Park, Pa., at the rally to federal counterparts more than 90 minutes before he climbed onto a roof of what's known as the AGR Building and fired eight rounds toward Trump.\n\nBelow is a summary of local law enforcement's planning and communications regarding the Trump event, according to records released by Grassley's office:\n\nJuly 13\n\n9 a.m.: The Butler County Emergency Response Unit hosts a briefing for local law enforcement ahead of the Trump event. The Secret Service was absent from the briefing1:03 p.m.: Beaver, Butler and Washington County snipers connect via group chatLocal sniper locations are noted4:26 p.m.: A Beaver County sniper finishes his shift and departs the AGR Building. While exiting, he spots Crooks at a picnic table outside and alerts the remaining Beaver and Butler snipers in the AGR Building to Crooks' presence5:38 p.m.: A Beaver County sniper sends photos of Crooks to the Beaver, Butler and Washington snipers group chat. The Beaver sniper notes Crooks was using \"a range finder looking toward the stage\" and recommends that they notify Secret Service snipers to \"look out\"5:45 p.m.: A Beaver County sniper sends photos of Crooks to the Beaver County ESU group chat. Beaver law enforcement recommends they alert \"command\"\n\nGrassley underscored the need to pass legislation he introduced with Nevada Democratic U.S. Sen. Catherine Cortez Masto, which would subject Secret Service directors to Senate confirmation and a single, 10-year term.\n\n\"The Secret Service's core mission is to protect the individuals entrusted to its care,\" Grassley said in a statement. \"President Trump's brush with death was a Secret Service failure of epic proportions, and this mission failure must never be repeated.\"\n\nHe called the bill a \"crucial step toward providing the transparency and accountability that Congress and the American people deserve from the Secret Service.\"\n\nU.S. Secret Service Director Kimberly Cheatle before Congressional committee 0 Comments Love 0 Funny 0 Wow 0 Sad 0 Angry 0\n\nGet Government & Politics updates in your inbox!\n\nStay up-to-date on the latest in local and national government and political topics with our newsletter.\n\nSign up! * I understand and agree that registration on or use of this site constitutes agreement to its user agreement and privacy policy.", "source": {"uri": "qctimes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Quad-City Times"}, "authors": [{"uri": "associated_press@qctimes.com", "name": "Associated Press", "type": "author", "isAgency": true}, {"uri": "gene_j_puskar@qctimes.com", "name": "Gene J.

It also suggested that Rowe, with ready and detailed answers, was determined to strike a different posture than that of his predecessor, Kimberly Cheatle, who resigned last week after facing intense criticism from lawmakers from both major political parties after responses that were seen as evasive and lacking in specifics.\n\nMuch of Tuesday's hearing before the Senate Judiciary and Homeland Security committees focused on what Rowe suggested was inadequate information received by Secret Service personnel in the hour before the shooting, including that Crooks had been spotted on the roof.\n\nLocal law enforcement officers had spotted a suspicious-looking man pacing near the metal detectors and circulated but ultimately lost track of Crooks before he scaled the roof of a building at AGR International Inc. Shortly before the shooting, a local officer climbed up to the roof to investigate. Crooks turned and pointed his rifle at the officer, who retreated.\n\n\"No information regarding a weapon on a roof was ever passed to our personnel,\" Rowe said. At another point, he noted, \"It is troubling to me that we did not get that information as quickly as we should have. We didn't know that there was this incident going on.\"\n\nBut Rowe's willingness to assign blame to local law enforcement opened him up to harsh criticism from Senate Republicans, who saw him as failing to take responsibility.\n\nListen now and subscribe: Apple Podcasts | Google Podcasts | Spotify | RSS Feed | SoundStack | All Of Our Podcasts\n\n\"Isn't it the fact that the former president was shot, that a good American is dead, that other Americans were critically wounded -- isn't that enough mission failure for you to say to the person who decided that that building should not be the security perimeter, probably ought to be stepped down?\" said Sen. Josh Hawley, a Missouri Republican.\n\nRowe, raising his voice, responded that he has \"lost sleep over this for the last 17 days\" and that he would not be rushed \"to judgment\" by Congress, but he assured lawmakers that \"people will be held accountable.\"\n\nSen. Lindsey Graham, the top Republican on the Senate Judiciary Committee, said if something like this happened in the military, \"a lot of people would be fired. And if a lot of people are not fired, the system failed yet again.\"\n\nHe added: \"Nothing's going to change until somebody loses their job.\"\n\nThe FBI, meanwhile, disclosed new details about Crooks, with Deputy Director Paul Abbate saying a social media account believed to be associated with the gunman suspected in the assassination attempt espoused political violence and included antisemitic and anti-immigrant sentiment. The posts were from the 2019 and 2020 timeframe, when Crooks would have been in high school.\n\nOn Monday, the FBI revealed that Crooks had looked online for information about mass shootings, power plants, improvised explosive devices and the May assassination attempt of the Slovakian prime minister.\n\nThe FBI also said that Trump has agreed to be interviewed by agents as a crime victim. Trump, who appeared at events in the days after the shooting with a bandage on his right ear, said he expects the interview to take place on Thursday.\n\nAt Cheatle's hearing last week, she said the Secret Service had \"failed\" in its mission to protect Trump. She called the attempt on Trump's life the Secret Service's \"most significant operational failure\" in decades and vowed to \"move heaven and earth\" to get to the bottom of what went wrong and make sure there's no repeat of it.\n\nCheatle acknowledged that the Secret Service was told about a suspicious person two to five times before the shooting at the rally. She also revealed that the roof from which Crooks opened fire had been identified as a potential vulnerability days before the rally.\n\nIn a Monday night interview on Fox News Channel, Trump defended the Secret Service agents who protected him from the shooting but said that someone should have been on the roof with Crooks and that there should have been better communication with local police.\n\n\"They didn't speak to each other,\" he said.\n\nHe praised the sniper who killed Crooks with what he said was an amazing shot but noted: \"It would have been good if it was nine seconds sooner.\"\n\nGet Government & Politics updates in your inbox!\n\nStay up-to-date on the latest in local and national government and political topics with our newsletter.\n\nSign up! * I understand and

He took responsibility; we don't know who is accountable, and no one was fired yet.\n\nI asked Acting Director Rowe why Trump was allowed to take the stage 17 minutes after Secret Service received multiple reports of a suspicious person with a rangefinder -- something one doesn't expect to see at a political rally. I did not receive a clear answer. Infuriating.\n\nCruz did a great job of getting Rowe to demonstrate that he is wholly unqualified to remain as Secret Service director. Instead of answering questions honestly, Rowe barked at Cruz like an entitled teenager and went out of his way to avoid any responsibility or accountability for the assassination attempt against Trump.\n\nFinally! Ted Cruz asks why the Secret Service spokesman still has his job after he lied to the press and the public in the 48 hours after the assassination attempt against Trump and no longer has credibility.\n\nThe spokesperson specifically lied about reports that the Secret Service denied more security requests for Trump.\n\nCruz: \"Your spokesperson put something out that is false on its face, by the way, did you approve this statement when it went out?\n\nCruz: \"So he lied on behalf of the Secret Service? He still has a job? Did your predecessor, the former director, did she approve this statement?\"\n\nRowe: \"Senator, our comms team sends out statements. They do de-conflict them, and they put them out.\"\n\nCruz: \"Did she approve this statement?\"\n\nRowe: \"I don't know if she did or did not...I don't recall approving it, senator.\"\n\nIn an intense line of questioning, Sen. Hawley harshly grills Secret Service Director Rowe on who the lead site agent was for the 7/13 Trump rally.\n\n\"I'm trying to find someone who is accountable here.\"\n\nHawley: \"Let me ask you this: who is the lead site agent who made the decision to leave the AGR building completely outside of the security perimeter? Who was that Senator?\"\n\nRowe: \"I cannot give you that name. This person is operational. They're still doing investigations. They're still doing protective visits.\"\n\nHawley: \"Why have they not been relieved of duty? They are still cooperating, not only being interviewed by the FBI, but also [Secret Service Office of] Professional Responsibility, and we will let the facts of the mission assurance and any further investigations play out.\"\n\nRowe pushed back strongly: \"What I need to know is exactly what happened. And I need my investigators to do their job, and I can't put my thumb on the scale.\"\n\nRowe says Hawley is asking him \"to make a rush to judgment about somebody failing.\"\n\nRowe: \"I acknowledge this was a failure.

Rowe on why a local law enforcement counter sniper wasn't positioned on the roof of the AGR building when the Secret Service counter snipers were on rooftops.\n\nRowe: \"So, I think we made an assumption there [would] be uniform presence out there, sufficient eyes to cover that, that there was going to be teams in the AGR building.\"\n\n\"And, I can assure you, we're not going to make that mistake again.

And so that is our TTP moving forward.\"\n\nRowe is asked about why the Secret Service didn't use drones that day when local law enforcement offered their drones for use that day, and the shooter did fly his own drone roughly 2 hours before the event.\n\nRowe responds that the issues surrounding [Unmanned Aerial Systems] are a \"little complex\" and involve capabilities that state and local law enforcement don't necessarily have access to.\n\nHe says there has to be coordination with the FAA because \"it could impact commercial\" flights.", "source": {"uri": "independentsentinel.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "www.independentsentinel.com"}, "authors": [{"uri": "m_dowling@independentsentinel.com", "name": "M Dowling", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ted_Cruz", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Ted Cruz"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Senate", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "United States Senate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Secret_Service", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "United States Secret Service"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Attempted_assassination_of_Ronald_Reagan", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Attempted assassination of Ronald Reagan"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sniper", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Sniper"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Bureau_of_Investigation", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Federal Bureau of Investigation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Texas_School_Book_Depository", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Texas School Book Depository"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Cornyn", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "John Cornyn"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Law_enforcement", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Law enforcement"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_City_Police_Department", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "New York City Police Department"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Nations_General_Assembly", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "United Nations General Assembly"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unmanned_aerial_vehicle", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Unmanned aerial vehicle"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Aviation_Administration", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Federal Aviation Administration"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Advice", "label": "dmoz/Society/Advice", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Job-Related", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Job-Related", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 89}], "image": "https://www.independentsentinel.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Rowe.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9772518", "eventUri": "eng-9772518", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.2392156862745098, "wgt": 159, "relevance": 1}

It also suggested that Rowe, with ready and detailed answers, was determined to strike a different posture than that of his predecessor, Kimberly Cheatle, who resigned last week after facing intense criticism from lawmakers from both major political parties after responses that were seen as evasive and lacking in specifics.\n\nMuch of Tuesday's hearing before the Senate Judiciary and Homeland Security committees focused on what Rowe suggested was inadequate information received by Secret Service personnel in the hour before the shooting, including that Crooks had been spotted on the roof.\n\nLocal law enforcement officers had spotted a suspicious-looking man pacing near the metal detectors and circulated but ultimately lost track of Crooks before he scaled the roof of a building at AGR International Inc. Shortly before the shooting, a local officer climbed up to the roof to investigate. Crooks turned and pointed his rifle at the officer, who retreated.\n\n\"No information regarding a weapon on a roof was ever passed to our personnel,\" Rowe said. At another point, he noted, \"It is troubling to me that we did not get that information as quickly as we should have. We didn't know that there was this incident going on.\"\n\nBut Rowe's willingness to assign blame to local law enforcement opened him up to harsh criticism from Senate Republicans, who saw him as failing to take responsibility.\n\nListen now and subscribe: Apple Podcasts | Google Podcasts | Spotify | RSS Feed | SoundStack | All Of Our Podcasts\n\n\"Isn't it the fact that the former president was shot, that a good American is dead, that other Americans were critically wounded -- isn't that enough mission failure for you to say to the person who decided that that building should not be the security perimeter, probably ought to be stepped down?\" said Sen. Josh Hawley, a Missouri Republican.\n\nRowe, raising his voice, responded that he has \"lost sleep over this for the last 17 days\" and that he would not be rushed \"to judgment\" by Congress, but he assured lawmakers that \"people will be held accountable.\"\n\nSen. Lindsey Graham, the top Republican on the Senate Judiciary Committee, said if something like this happened in the military, \"a lot of people would be fired. And if a lot of people are not fired, the system failed yet again.\"\n\nHe added: \"Nothing's going to change until somebody loses their job.\"\n\nThe FBI, meanwhile, disclosed new details about Crooks, with Deputy Director Paul Abbate saying a social media account believed to be associated with the gunman suspected in the assassination attempt espoused political violence and included antisemitic and anti-immigrant sentiment. The posts were from the 2019 and 2020 timeframe, when Crooks would have been in high school.\n\nOn Monday, the FBI revealed that Crooks had looked online for information about mass shootings, power plants, improvised explosive devices and the May assassination attempt of the Slovakian prime minister.\n\nThe FBI also said that Trump has agreed to be interviewed by agents as a crime victim. Trump, who appeared at events in the days after the shooting with a bandage on his right ear, said he expects the interview to take place on Thursday.\n\nAt Cheatle's hearing last week, she said the Secret Service had \"failed\" in its mission to protect Trump. She called the attempt on Trump's life the Secret Service's \"most significant operational failure\" in decades and vowed to \"move heaven and earth\" to get to the bottom of what went wrong and make sure there's no repeat of it.\n\nCheatle acknowledged that the Secret Service was told about a suspicious person two to five times before the shooting at the rally. She also revealed that the roof from which Crooks opened fire had been identified as a potential vulnerability days before the rally.\n\nIn a Monday night interview on Fox News Channel, Trump defended the Secret Service agents who protected him from the shooting but said that someone should have been on the roof with Crooks and that there should have been better communication with local police.\n\n\"They didn't speak to each other,\" he said.\n\nHe praised the sniper who killed Crooks with what he said was an amazing shot but noted: \"It would have been good if it was nine seconds sooner.\"\n\nLove 0 Funny 0 Wow 0 Sad 0 Angry 0\n\nGet Government & Politics updates in your inbox!\n\nStay up-to-date on the latest in local and national government and political topics with our

Marsha Blackburn expressed concerns about the public's trust in the Secret Service agency during a Senate hearing following an assassination attempt against former President Trump on July 13 in Butler, Pennsylvania. She read an email reportedly sent by a Secret Service counter sniper, criticizing the agency's mission and stating that employees are more focused on \"covering their behinds\" than protecting the president.\n\nThe email, which was circulated within the Uniform Division, highlighted the lack of trust in the agency's ability to protect public figures. This comes after new Acting U.S. Secret Service Director Ronald Rowe took over the position following the resignation of Kimberly Cheatle. During the hearing, Rowe acknowledged that emotions are high within the agency and expressed his commitment to addressing the concerns raised by the counter sniper.\n\nIn addition to Sen. Blackburn's questioning, Sen. Mike Lee of Utah raised concerns about the delay in relaying information about a suspicious person to Secret Service personnel during the Trump rally. Rowe explained that critical information about a potential threat on the roof did not reach the Secret Service due to a breakdown in communication with local law enforcement.\n\nMeanwhile, the FBI revealed details about the assailant, Thomas Crooks, who accessed the roof of a building near the rally site using HVAC equipment and piping. Crooks managed to evade security measures and find a shooting position on a building owned by American Glass Research, located close to where the former president was speaking. The FBI is currently investigating how Crooks went unnoticed despite being spotted by law enforcement prior to the shooting.\n\nThe incident has raised questions about the effectiveness of security measures in place to protect public figures and the need for improved communication between law enforcement agencies.

Republican Iowa Sen. Chuck Grassley, during a Senate Judiciary Committee hearing, asked Rowe why the Secret Service did not have a system in place to track Crooks' drone, with the acting Secret Service director saying he has \"no explanation for it\" and that he has lost sleep over the issue.\n\nWATCH:\n\n\"Secret Service deployed a counter, unmanned aerial system operator on July 13, according to the Secret Service. The drone system was supposed to be operational at 3:00 PM that day.\" Grassley said. \"However, we have been told by Secret Service that because of cellular bandwidth problems, it was not operational until about 5:20 of that day. If the system was operational, Secret Service would have had the ability to detect the shooter and his own drone use. Why is the Secret Service dependent upon local cellular network? Does the Secret Service have a backup plan in place?\"\n\n\"That is something ... that has cost me a lot of sleep because of the eventual outcome of the assailant, that what if we had geo-located him because that counter [unmanned aerial system] platform had been up? It is something that I have struggled with, to understand, and I have no explanation for it,\" Rowe said. \"It is something that I feel as though we could have perhaps found him. We could have maybe stopped him.\"\n\nCrooks killed former volunteer fire chief Corey Comperatore in the attack. He also injured two rally attendees and the former president.\n\n\"Maybe on that particular day he would have decided, this isn't the day to do it because law enforcement just found me flying my drone,\" Rowe continued. \"People fly drones all the time on the peripheries of our sites. And we go out, and we talk to them and ascertain what their intentions are.\"\n\nRowe added that the Secret Service will now be \"leveraging resources from the Department of Homeland Security and others to make sure we have dedicated connectivity so we are not reliant on public domain, so we can ensure whatever assets we have in place, those assets are operational.\"\n\nU.S. Secret Service Director Kimberly Cheatle recently resigned in the aftermath of the assassination attempt and her evasive testimony before Congress.\n\n\"I take full responsibility for the security lapse,\" Cheatle said in an email to staff obtained by the Associated Press. \"In light of recent events, it is with a heavy heart that I have made the difficult decision to step down as your director.\"\n\nWe have no tolerance for comments containing violence, racism, profanity, vulgarity, doxing, or discourteous behavior.

Ted Cruz accused the U.S. Secret Service on Tuesday of making a politically motivated decision to deny former President Donald Trump extra security, exposing him to an assassination attempt during a campaign rally in Pennsylvania earlier this month.\n\n\"I believe the Secret Service leadership made a political decision to deny these requests,\" Cruz said during a joint hearing of the Senate Judiciary and Homeland Security committees Tuesday. \"And I believe the Biden administration has been suffused with partisan politics.\"\n\nRonald Rowe, acting director of the Secret Service who has served since 1999 for presidents of both parties, responded indignantly to the remark in a tense exchange where he asserted, \"Secret Service agents are not political.\"\n\nCruz retorted that Secret Service leadership is appointed by the president and is therefore a political position.\n\nSecret Service has faced withering bipartisan criticism after a gunman came within an inch of shooting Trump in the head during a rally in Butler, Pennsylvania, just ahead of the Republican National Convention. Trump's ear was grazed by a bullet, the FBI later reported, but he was otherwise unharmed.\n\nKim Cheatle, who was director of the agency when the shooting occurred, faced ire from lawmakers in both parties for her role in one of the biggest security failures since the 1981 attempted assassination of President Ronald Reagan. Secret Service failed to prevent Thomas Crooks, a 20-year-old man, from gaining access to a roof where he had a clear shot at the former president. Cheatle resigned from her post last week.\n\nThe U.S. House has opened a bipartisan inquiry into the security failures. U.S. Rep. Pat Fallon, R-Sherman, was named to serve on the inquiry, the only Texan.\n\nCruz has also previously blamed Secret Service's efforts to diversify its ranks for distracting the agency from its core mission of protecting officials. During a podcast he released two weeks ago -- after the Butler shooting -- Cruz criticized the agency for its efforts to have 30% of agents be women by 2030.\n\n\"Well, this is yet another manifestation of what we've seen throughout the Biden administration, which is an obsessive focus on bean counting, on quotas, on DEI at the expense of the mission,\" Cruz said.\n\nSecret Service spokesperson Anthony Guglielmi said to CNN that criticisms of female officers \"an insult to the women of our agency to imply that they are unqualified based on gender. Such baseless assertions undermine the professionalism, dedication and expertise of our workforce.\"\n\nCruz confronted Rowe with reporting by The Washington Post that Trump's security detail repeatedly -- and unsuccessfully -- requested additional resources from Secret Service in the years leading to the Butler, Pennsylvania, rally. Rowe acknowledged that that may have been the case in the past but said no resources were denied for the Butler rally.\n\nCruz demanded a full accounting of requests from Trump's security detail and Secret Service's responses, which Rowe agreed to provide. Cruz also repeatedly asked for who in the agency denied requests by Trump's security detail and was unsatisfied when Rowe said requests went through an approval process.\n\n\"It's a conversation. It's not just an absolute yea or nay,\" Rowe said of approving additional security requests.\n\n\"Does the buck stop anywhere?\" Cruz asked.\n\nCruz also asked for the size of Trump's security detail relative to President Joe Biden's. Rowe said Trump traveled with a full security crew, though he acknowledged a sitting president has more personnel.\n\n\"What's the difference?\" Cruz interjected.\n\n\"National command authority to launch a nuclear strike, sir,\" Rowe responded, impatience rising in his voice. \"There are other assets that travel with the president that the former president will not get.\"\n\nRowe said he would get a more detailed breakdown in the number of personnel for Trump and Biden for Cruz.\n\nDuring the hearing, Rowe placed much of the blame for the security failures in Butler with local police. Secret Service often delegates to state and local law enforcement to cover all vulnerabilities.\n\nSen. John Cornyn, R-Texas, who also serves on the Judiciary Committee, asked Rowe how the Secret Service, \"being an elite law enforcement agency, would delegate to local enforcement or others who did not meet\" the same standards as their agency, which admits only two percent of applicants.\n\n\"It was a failure to challenge our assumptions,\" Rowe responded. \"We made an assumption that there was going to be uniform presence out there, that there would be sufficient eyes to cover that, that there were going to be counter sniper teams in the AGR building, and I can assure you that we're not going to make that mistake again.\"", "source": {"uri": "texastribune.org", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Texas Tribune"}, "authors": [{"uri": "matthew_choi@texastribune.org", "name": "Matthew

Mike Kelly tapped to lead bipartisan House task force on Trump assassination attempt", "body": "U.S. Rep. Mike Kelly will chair a House committee that will investigate the attempted assassination of former President Donald Trump at a rally in Kelly's hometown of Butler.\n\nThe Pennsylvania Republican, who represents the 16th Congressional District, was appointed by Speaker of the House Mike Johnson to lead the bipartisan task force, which will include seven Republicans and six Democrats. Kelly sponsored the legislation to form the task force, which was approved last week.\n\nIn a statement, Kelly thanked Johnson for entrusting him in with the \"important and solemn role\" and he said the task force must \"set politics aside\" to \"restore the faith, trust and confidence\" in our government.\"\n\nMinutes into a rally at the Butler Farm Show grounds on July 13, 20-year-old Thomas Matthew Crooks opened fire with an AR-style rifle from the roof of a building near where Trump was speaking. Crooks killed one attendee, Corey Comperatore, a volunteer firefighter who was attempting to shield his wife and daughters when he was struck in the head, and injured two others, who have since been released from the hospital. One of the bullets or bullet fragments grazed Trump's right ear, according to the FBI.\n\nCrooks was killed by U.S. Secret Service sniper fire, which came from an agent positioned on the roof of another building.\n\nThe U.S. Secret Service and other law enforcement agencies at the rally have faced questions about how Crooks was able to get on the roof and open fire. Reports indicate that several people, including law enforcement, spotted Crooks before the incident and reported him as suspicious. Secret Service snipers spotted Crooks on the roof 20 minutes before the shooting.\n\nFormer U.S. Secret Service Director Kimberly Cheatle was forced to resign July 23, a day after a House Oversight Committee hearing in which lawmakers from both parties called on her to step down.\n\n\"It's critical that we investigate, detail, and explain the security breakdowns that tragically killed one person, injured two others, and nearly claimed President Trump's life,\" Kelly said in a statement. \"We must never let something like this happen again. The American people have a right to know what happened. Congress has a responsibility to find out.\"\n\nMore: Investigation into Trump shooting started within minutes on the roof, but questions linger\n\nJohnson and Democratic Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries issued a joint statement about the bipartisan task force:\n\n\"We have the utmost confidence in this bipartisan group of steady, highly qualified, and capable members of Congress to move quickly to find the facts, ensure accountability, and help make certain such failures never happen again,\" Johnson and Jeffries said.\n\nOn Tuesday, members of the U.S. Senate Judiciary and Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs committees held a hearing on the assassination attempt, questioning the new acting director of the Secret Service, Ronald Rowe, and FBI Deputy Director Paul Abbate. In his opening statement, Rowe characterized the security measures taken to protect Trump and rallygoers as a \"failure on multiple levels.\"\n\nMatthew Rink can be reached at mrink@timesnews.com or

Ted Cruz accused the U.S. Secret Service on Tuesday of making a politically motivated decision to deny former President Donald Trump extra security, exposing him to an assassination attempt during a campaign rally in Pennsylvania earlier this month.\n\n\"I believe the Secret Service leadership made a political decision to deny these requests,\" Cruz said during a joint hearing of the Senate Judiciary and Homeland Security committees Tuesday. \"And I believe the Biden administration has been suffused with partisan politics.\"\n\nRonald Rowe, acting director of the Secret Service who has served since 1999 for presidents of both parties, responded indignantly to the remark in a tense exchange where he asserted, \"Secret Service agents are not political.\"\n\nCruz retorted that Secret Service leadership is appointed by the president and is therefore a political position.\n\nSecret Service has faced withering bipartisan criticism after a gunman came within an inch of shooting Trump in the head during a rally in Butler, Pennsylvania, just ahead of the Republican National Convention. Trump's ear was grazed by a bullet, the FBI later reported, but he was otherwise unharmed.\n\nKim Cheatle, who was director of the agency when the shooting occurred, faced ire from lawmakers in both parties for her role in one of the biggest security failures since the 1981 attempted assassination of President Ronald Reagan. Secret Service failed to prevent Thomas Crooks, a 20-year-old man, from gaining access to a roof where he had a clear shot at the former president. Cheatle resigned from her post last week.\n\nThe U.S. House has opened a bipartisan inquiry into the security failures. U.S. Rep. Pat Fallon, R-Sherman, was named to serve on the inquiry, the only Texan.\n\nCruz has also previously blamed Secret Service's efforts to diversify its ranks for distracting the agency from its core mission of protecting officials. During a podcast he released two weeks ago -- after the Butler shooting -- Cruz criticized the agency for its efforts to have 30% of agents be women by 2030.\n\n\"Well, this is yet another manifestation of what we've seen throughout the Biden administration, which is an obsessive focus on bean counting, on quotas, on DEI at the expense of the mission,\" Cruz said.\n\nSecret Service spokesperson Anthony Guglielmi said to CNN that criticisms of female officers \"an insult to the women of our agency to imply that they are unqualified based on gender. Such baseless assertions undermine the professionalism, dedication and expertise of our workforce.\"\n\nCruz confronted Rowe with reporting by The Washington Post that Trump's security detail repeatedly -- and unsuccessfully -- requested additional resources from Secret Service in the years leading to the Butler, Pennsylvania, rally. Rowe acknowledged that that may have been the case in the past but said no resources were denied for the Butler rally.\n\nCruz demanded a full accounting of requests from Trump's security detail and Secret Service's responses, which Rowe agreed to provide. Cruz also repeatedly asked for who in the agency denied requests by Trump's security detail and was unsatisfied when Rowe said requests went through an approval process.\n\n\"It's a conversation. It's not just an absolute yea or nay,\" Rowe said of approving additional security requests.\n\n\"Does the buck stop anywhere?\" Cruz asked.\n\nCruz also asked for the size of Trump's security detail relative to President Joe Biden's. Rowe said Trump traveled with a full security crew, though he acknowledged a sitting president has more personnel.\n\n\"What's the difference?\" Cruz interjected.\n\n\"National command authority to launch a nuclear strike, sir,\" Rowe responded, impatience rising in his voice. \"There are other assets that travel with the president that the former president will not get.\"\n\nRowe said he would get a more detailed breakdown in the number of personnel for Trump and Biden for Cruz.\n\nDuring the hearing, Rowe placed much of the blame for the security failures in Butler with local police. Secret Service often delegates to state and local law enforcement to cover all vulnerabilities.\n\nSen. John Cornyn, R-Texas, who also serves on the Judiciary Committee, asked Rowe how the Secret Service, \"being an elite law enforcement agency, would delegate to local enforcement or others who did not meet\" the same standards as their agency, which admits only two percent of applicants.\n\n\"It was a failure to challenge our assumptions,\" Rowe responded. \"We made an assumption that there was going to be uniform presence out there, that there would be sufficient eyes to cover that, that there were going to be counter sniper teams in the AGR building, and I can assure you that we're not going to make that mistake again.\"\n\nThe Texas Tribune answering reader questions about 2024 elections.

Chuck Grassley, R-Iowa, called for answers Tuesday over the \"communication breakdown\" between Pennsylvania law enforcement and the Secret Service that led to the assassination attempt on former President Donald Trump, the 2024 Republican presidential nominee.\n\nText messages, police body camera footage and an after-action report obtained by Grassley provide the most detailed picture yet of security failures surrounding the shooting at the July 13 campaign rally in Butler, Pa.\n\nGrassley, appearing Tuesday on Fox News' \"America's Newsroom\" ahead of a Senate hearing with the FBI and Secret Service, said \"there's just a lot of shortcomings\" about law enforcement lapses in the hours before the attempted assassination of Trump.\n\n\"It's just bad when a member of Congress has to get his information from local law enforcement instead of from the federal agencies,\" Grassley said. \"(I've) turned over everything (I) have now, and if (I) get more, (I)'ll turn it over. I believe in transparency. The public's business ought to be public, and the protection of a presidential candidate ought to be a top priority.\"\n\nPeople are also reading...

He was joined by FBI Deputy Director Paul Abbate at a joint hearing of the Senate Judiciary and Homeland Security committees.\n\nGrassley pressed Rowe about the failed vetting and communications procedures that led to the near-assassination of the former president.\n\nRowe said he \"had no explanation\" for some of the Secret Service's shortcomings at the July 13 campaign rally, and committed to improving certain agency procedures and providing \"rolling\" updates to Congress and the public.\n\nGrassley also asked about the Secret Service and local law enforcement's use of a drone to monitor the rally location. In a letter last week asking for the Secret Service's operational plan and other records, Grassley included a document showing that a Counter Unmanned Aerial System operator was on the list of personnel for the rally.\n\nNBC News has reported that deceased gunman Thomas Matthew Crooks flew a drone over the rally site a few hours before Trump began speaking.\n\n\"According to the Secret Service, the drone system was supposed to be operational at 3 p.m. that day,\" Grassley said during his questioning of Rowe. \"However, we've been told by Secret Service that because of cellular bandwidth problems, it wasn't operational until about 5:20 (p.m.) on that day. If the system was operational, Secret Service would've had the ability to detect the shooter and his own drone use. Why is the Secret Service dependent upon local cellular networks? Does Secret Service have back up plans in place?\"\n\nRowe said the Secret Service's failure to detect the shooter's drone has \"cost me a lot of sleep.\" Had the Secret Service's platform been operational, Rowe noted, it might have been able to locate Crooks and intervene.\n\nRowe committed to leveraging Department of Homeland Security resources to provide the Secret Service guaranteed connectivity to its drone. He said the lapse \"is something that I have struggled with to understand.\"\n\n\"It is something that I feel as though we could have perhaps found him,\" he said. \"We could have maybe stopped him.\"\n\nAccording to documents released by Grassley's office, law enforcement officers knew of and communicated presence of Crooks, 20, of Bethel Park, Pa., at the rally to federal counterparts more than 90 minutes before he climbed onto a roof of what's known as the AGR Building and fired eight rounds toward Trump.\n\nBelow is a summary of local law enforcement's planning and communications regarding the Trump event, according to records released by Grassley's office:\n\nJuly 139 a.m.: The Butler County Emergency Response Unit hosts a briefing for local law enforcement ahead of the Trump event. The Secret Service was absent from the briefing.1:03 p.m.: Beaver, Butler and Washington County snipers connect via group chat.Local sniper locations are noted.4:26 p.m.: A Beaver County sniper finishes his shift and departs the AGR Building. While exiting, he spots Crooks at a picnic table outside and alerts the remaining Beaver and Butler snipers in the AGR Building to Crooks' presence.5:38 p.m.: A Beaver County sniper sends photos of Crooks to the Beaver, Butler and Washington snipers group chat. The Beaver sniper notes Crooks was using \"a range finder looking toward the stage\" and recommends that they notify Secret Service snipers to \"look out.\"5:45 p.m.: A Beaver County sniper sends photos of Crooks to the Beaver County ESU group chat. Beaver law enforcement recommends they alert \"command.\"\n\nGrassley underscored the need to pass legislation he introduced with Nevada Democratic U.S. Sen. Catherine Cortez Masto, which would subject Secret Service directors to Senate confirmation and a single, 10-year term.\n\n\"The Secret Service's core mission is to protect the individuals entrusted to its care,\" Grassley said in a statement. \"President Trump's brush with death was a Secret Service failure of epic proportions, and this mission failure must never be repeated.\"\n\nHe called the bill a \"crucial step toward providing the transparency and accountability that Congress and the American people deserve from the Secret Service.\"\n\nRelated

Biden wrote in a statement that he plans to make his choice \"soon.\"\n\n\"The independent review to get to the bottom of what happened on July 13 continues, and I look forward to assessing its conclusions. We all know what happened that day can never happen again,\" Biden wrote. \"As we move forward, I wish Kim all the best, and I will plan to appoint a new Director soon.\"\n\nFox News' Sarah Rumpf-Whitten and Christina Coulter contributed to this report", "source": {"uri": "dnyuz.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "DNyuz"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Secret_Service", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "United States Secret Service"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Bureau_of_Investigation", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Federal Bureau of Investigation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Congress", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "United States Congress"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Attempted_assassination_of_Ronald_Reagan", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Attempted assassination of Ronald Reagan"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kimberly_Cheatle", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Kimberly Cheatle"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_Abbate", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Paul Abbate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Director_of_the_United_States_Secret_Service", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Director of the United States Secret Service"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special_agent", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Special agent"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Senate_Committee_on_the_Judiciary", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States Senate Committee on the Judiciary"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Senate", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States Senate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Department_of_Homeland_Security", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States Department of Homeland Security"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/West_Palm_Beach,_Florida", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "West Palm Beach, Florida"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "West Palm Beach, Florida"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Law_enforcement", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Law enforcement"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assassination", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Assassination"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CBS", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "CBS"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Florida", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Florida"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Florida"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fox_News", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Fox News"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Independent_politician", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Independent politician"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Biden", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pittsburgh", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Pittsburgh"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Pittsburgh"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Terrorism", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Terrorism", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Crime_and_Justice", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Crime and Justice", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Theft", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Theft", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Government/Intelligence", "label": "dmoz/Society/Government/Intelligence", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 93}], "image": "https://dnyuz.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/New-acting-Secret-Service-director-FBI-official-to-face-Senate.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9772518", "eventUri": "eng-9772518", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-07-13", "textStart": 2565, "textEnd": 2572}], "sentiment": 0.1372549019607843, "wgt": 155, "relevance": 1}

Republican Iowa Sen. Chuck Grassley, during a Senate Judiciary Committee hearing, asked Rowe why the Secret Service did not have a system in place to track Crooks' drone, with the acting Secret Service director saying he has \"no explanation for it\" and that he has lost sleep over the issue. (RELATED: Security Had Reportedly Been Stationed On Rooftop Used By Trump Rally Shooter, But Abandoned It Due To 'Hot Weather')\n\n\"Secret Service deployed a counter, unmanned aerial system operator on July 13, according to the Secret Service. The drone system was supposed to be operational at 3:00 PM that day.\" Grassley said. \"However, we have been told by Secret Service that because of cellular bandwidth problems, it was not operational until about 5:20 of that day. If the system was operational, Secret Service would have had the ability to detect the shooter and his own drone use. Why is the Secret Service dependent upon local cellular network? Does the Secret Service have a backup plan in place?\"\n\n\"That is something ... that has cost me a lot of sleep because of the eventual outcome of the assailant, that what if we had geo-located him because that counter [unmanned aerial system] platform had been up? It is something that I have struggled with, to understand, and I have no explanation for it,\" Rowe said. \"It is something that I feel as though we could have perhaps found him. We could have maybe stopped him.\"\n\nCrooks killed former volunteer fire chief Corey Comperatore in the attack. He also injured two rally attendees and the former president.\n\n\"Maybe on that particular day he would have decided, this isn't the day to do it because law enforcement just found me flying my drone,\" Rowe continued. \"People fly drones all the time on the peripheries of our sites. And we go out, and we talk to them and ascertain what their intentions are.\"\n\nRowe added that the Secret Service will now be \"leveraging resources from the Department of Homeland Security and others to make sure we have dedicated connectivity so we are not reliant on public domain, so we can ensure whatever assets we have in place, those assets are operational.\"\n\nU.S. Secret Service Director Kimberly Cheatle recently resigned in the aftermath of the assassination attempt and her evasive testimony before Congress.\n\n\"I take full responsibility for the security lapse,\" Cheatle said in an email to staff obtained by the Associated Press. \"In light of recent events, it is with a heavy heart that I have made the difficult decision to step down as your director.\"\n\nAll content created by the Daily Caller News Foundation, an independent and nonpartisan newswire service, is available without charge to any legitimate news publisher that can provide a large audience.

Cruz and Josh Hawley for the failure of the Secret Service to protect Donald Trump from a sniper on a \"sloped\" rooftop in Butler, Pennsylvania earlier this month.\n\nSen. Mike Lee also went off on Rowe, recalling how the Secret Service let Trump take the stage 17 minutes after receiving reports of a suspicious person with a rangefinder and then didn't remove him from the stage when they learned that would-be assassin Thomas Crooks had a gun with him up on that unmanned roof.\n\nLee wasn't done yet, though. The Post Millennial reports that Rowe told the committees that July 13 was a \"failure of imagination.\"\n\nThomas Stevenson reports:\n\nThe acting Secret Service director said that a \"failure of imagination\" was to blame in preventing the attempted assassination of Trump during his testimony in Congress on Tuesday. Ronald L. Rowe said that the United States Secret Service (USSS) did not challenge its \"assumptions\" about the event.\n\nWhile answering a question from Sen. Amy Klobuchar (D-IN), who asked, \"There's some people that think it didn't really happen, which of course is completely ridiculous. It did. There are some people that think all kinds of conspiracies went on within the government, which is also false. But could you just tell them what went wrong so they understand?\"\n\nRowe responded saying that it was a \"failure of imagination,\" adding, \"a failure to imagine that we actually do live in a very dangerous world where people do actually want to do harm to our protectees.\"\n\nThe Secret Service failed to imagine that someone would try to harm someone under their protection.

However, he said agents are beginning to get a clearer picture of who Crooks, a 20-year-old who lived with his parents and worked at a nursing home, really was.\n\nDespite its ownership not being confirmed, Abbate said the agency felt it was important to detail the social account's nature because of the \"general absence of other information\" about Crooks' \"motive and mindset.\"\n\nThe comments come as lawmakers have pressed the Secret Service and FBI for answers about Crooks, who was shot dead within seconds of opening fire at a Trump rally on July 13.\n\nRonald Rowe, the Secret Service's acting director, testified Tuesday that he was \"ashamed\" by his agency's failures and was prepared to be candid about them.

As a career law enforcement officer and a 25 year veteran with the Secret Service, I cannot defend why that roof was not better secured to prevent similar lapses from occurring in the future.\"", "source": {"uri": "thedailybeast.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Daily Beast"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Bureau_of_Investigation", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Federal Bureau of Investigation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_media", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Social media"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Opposition_to_immigration", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Opposition to immigration"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Political_violence", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Political violence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antisemitism", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Antisemitism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_Abbate", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Paul Abbate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assassination", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Assassination"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Attempted_assassination_of_Ronald_Reagan", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Attempted assassination of Ronald Reagan"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Law_enforcement_officer", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Law enforcement officer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Secret_Service", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "United States Secret Service"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pennsylvania", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Pennsylvania"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Pennsylvania"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Crime_and_Justice", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Crime and Justice", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Death", "label": "dmoz/Society/Death", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Death/Suicide", "label": "dmoz/Society/Death/Suicide", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 66}], "image": "https://img.thedailybeast.com/image/upload/c_crop,d_placeholder_euli9k,h_2363,w_4200,x_0,y_93/dpr_2.0/c_limit,w_740/fl_lossy,q_auto/v1722352799/2024-07-14T161318Z_1450160356_RC23V8A549S7_RTRMADP_3_USA-ELECTION-TRUMP_aqdznr", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9772518", "eventUri": "eng-9772518", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-07-13", "textStart": 1349, "textEnd": 1356}], "sentiment": -0.2313725490196078, "wgt": 154, "relevance": 1}

The two are expected to be questioned about how 20-year-old Thomas Mathew Crooks was able to access a rooftop within 150 yards of Trump and fire several shots at the former president.\n\nAbbate is also expected to give lawmakers an update on the FBI investigation into the attack, which injured Trump, two rally attendees, and killed 50-year-old Corey Comperatore.\n\nSen. Dick Durbin (D-IL), who heads up the Senate Judiciary Committee, said on Monday that the hearing would focus on the security lapses surrounding the incident.\n\n\"Despite the implementation of a security plan to secure the rally site on July 13, the shooter involved was able to fly a drone outside of the security perimeter for 11 minutes,\" Durbin said. \"His suspicious activity was reported twice, and he was spotted on the roof of a building prior to taking his first shot -- yet his violent plan continued unimpeded, and he was able to fire eight shots before a Secret Service countersniper killed him.\"\n\nText messages obtained by Sen. Chuck Grassley (R-IA) and shared with the New York Times show that Crooks was flagged by law enforcement as suspicious more than 90 minutes before he started shooting.\n\nSenator Roger Marshall (R-KS), who is on the Homeland Security committee, told The Daily Wire that security lapses occurred because Secret Service agents didn't work closely with local law enforcement.\n\n\"Time and time again, we see three letter agencies and their bureaucratic processes and political biases fail our communities,\" he told The Daily Wire. \"This is a top-down systemic failure and culture that's plaguing these agencies and must be addressed.\"\n\n\"The U.S. Secret Service team blew off Butler County local law enforcement, the officers who know this community the best- why is that?\" he asked. \"Would things be different today if communication and respect between local and D.C. officials was stronger?\"\n\nLawmakers in both the House and Senate have launched investigations into the attack. On Monday, the House named a task force to spearhead an inquiry.

Chuck Grassley called for answers Tuesday over the \"communication breakdown\" between Pennsylvania law enforcement and the Secret Service that led to the assassination attempt on former President Donald Trump, the 2024 Republican presidential nominee.\n\nText messages, police body camera footage and an after-action report obtained by Grassley provide the most detailed picture yet of security failures surrounding the shooting at the July 13 campaign rally in Butler, Pa.\n\nGrassley, appearing Tuesday on Fox News' \"America's Newsroom\" ahead of a Senate hearing with the FBI and Secret Service, said \"there's just a lot of shortcomings\" about law enforcement lapses in the hours before the attempted assassination of Trump.\n\n\"It's just bad when a member of Congress has to get his information from local law enforcement instead of from the federal agencies,\" Grassley said. \"(I've) turned over everything (I) have now, and if (I) get more, (I)'ll turn it over. I believe in transparency. The public's business ought to be public, and the protection of a presidential candidate ought to be a top priority.\"\n\nPeople are also reading...

He was joined by FBI Deputy Director Paul Abbate at a joint hearing of the Senate Judiciary and Homeland Security committees.\n\nGrassley pressed Rowe about the failed vetting and communications procedures that led to the near-assassination of the former president.\n\nRowe said he \"had no explanation\" for some of the Secret Service's shortcomings at the July 13 campaign rally, and committed to improving certain agency procedures and providing \"rolling\" updates to Congress and the public.\n\nGrassley also asked about the Secret Service and local law enforcement's use of a drone to monitor the rally location. In a letter last week asking for the Secret Service's operational plan and other records, Grassley included a document showing that a Counter Unmanned Aerial System operator was on the list of personnel for the rally.\n\nNBC News has reported that deceased gunman Thomas Matthew Crooks flew a drone over the rally site a few hours before Trump began speaking.\n\n\"According to the Secret Service, the drone system was supposed to be operational at 3 p.m. that day,\" Grassley said during his questioning of Rowe. \"However, we've been told by Secret Service that because of cellular bandwidth problems, it wasn't operational until about 5:20 (p.m.) on that day. If the system was operational, Secret Service would've had the ability to detect the shooter and his own drone use. Why is the Secret Service dependent upon local cellular networks? Does Secret Service have back up plans in place?\"\n\nRowe said the Secret Service's failure to detect the shooter's drone has \"cost me a lot of sleep.\" Had the Secret Service's platform been operational, Rowe noted, it might have been able to locate Crooks and intervene.\n\nListen now and subscribe: Apple Podcasts | Google Podcasts | Spotify | RSS Feed | SoundStack | All Of Our Podcasts\n\nRowe committed to leveraging Department of Homeland Security resources to provide the Secret Service guaranteed connectivity to its drone. He said the lapse \"is something that I have struggled with to understand.\"\n\n\"It is something that I feel as though we could have perhaps found him,\" he said. \"We could have maybe stopped him.\"\n\nAccording to documents released by Grassley's office, law enforcement officers knew of and communicated presence of Crooks, 20, of Bethel Park, Pa., at the rally to federal counterparts more than 90 minutes before he climbed onto a roof of what's known as the AGR Building and fired eight rounds toward Trump.\n\nBelow is a summary of local law enforcement's planning and communications regarding the Trump event, according to records released by Grassley's office:\n\nJuly 13\n\n9 a.m.: The Butler County Emergency Response Unit hosts a briefing for local law enforcement ahead of the Trump event. The Secret Service was absent from the briefing\n\n1:03 p.m.: Beaver, Butler and Washington County snipers connect via group chat\n\nLocal sniper locations are noted\n\n4:26 p.m.: A Beaver County sniper finishes his shift and departs the AGR Building. While exiting, he spots Crooks at a picnic table outside and alerts the remaining Beaver and Butler snipers in the AGR Building to Crooks' presence\n\n5:38 p.m.: A Beaver County sniper sends photos of Crooks to the Beaver, Butler and Washington snipers group chat. The Beaver sniper notes Crooks was using \"a range finder looking toward the stage\" and recommends that they notify Secret Service snipers to \"look out\"\n\n5:45 p.m.: A Beaver County sniper sends photos of Crooks to the Beaver County ESU group chat. Beaver law enforcement recommends they alert \"command\"\n\nGrassley underscored the need to pass legislation he introduced with Nevada Democratic U.S. Sen. Catherine Cortez Masto, which would subject Secret Service directors to Senate confirmation and a single, 10-year term.\n\n\"The Secret Service's core mission is to protect the individuals entrusted to its care,\" Grassley said in a statement. \"President Trump's brush with death was a Secret Service failure of epic proportions, and this mission failure must never be repeated.\"\n\nHe called the bill a \"crucial step toward providing the transparency and accountability that Congress and the American people deserve from the Secret Service.\"\n\n0 Comments Love 0 Funny 0 Wow 0 Sad 0 Angry

Chuck Grassley, R-Iowa, who obtained them from Beaver County Emergency Services Unit (ESU), showed that officers flagged Thomas Matthew Crooks after he was spotted using a range finder - but did not approach him.\n\nAccording to FOX News, the first screenshot is a group chat of Beaver ESU officers, while the second is from one Beaver County sniper departing his shift at around 4:30 - approximately 90 minutes before Trump took the stage. The New York Times first reported the text screenshots.\n\nKimberly Cheatle was called to testify in Congress more than a week after the shooting.\n\nShe called the attempt on Trump's life the Secret Service's \"most significant operational failure\" in decades, and vowed to \"move heaven and earth\" to get to the bottom of what went wrong and make sure there's no repeat of it.\n\nDemocrats and Republicans were united in their exasperation as Cheatle said she didn't know or couldn't answer numerous questions more than a week after the shooting that left one spectator dead. At one point, Mace used profanity as she accused Cheatle of lying and dodging questions, prompting calls for lawmakers to show \"decorum.\"\n\nLawmakers pressed Cheatle on how the shooter could get so close to the Republican presidential nominee when he was supposed to be carefully guarded, and why Trump was allowed to take the stage after local law enforcement had identified Crooks as suspicious.\n\nDonald Trump survived the assassination attempt before he was whisked off the stage at a rally in Butler, Pennsylvania, when gunshots rang through the crowd on July 13.\n\nThe former president and Republican nominee was showing off a chart of border crossing numbers when the sound of gunfire started ringing through the crowd. Trump could be seen reaching with his right hand toward his neck, and there appeared to be blood on his face.\n\nHe quickly ducked behind the riser as agents from his protective detail rushed the stage and screams were heard in the crowd of several thousand people. The gunfire continued as agents tended to him on stage.", "source": {"uri": "fox5atlanta.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "FOX 5 Atlanta"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kimberly_Cheatle", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Kimberly Cheatle"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Attempted_assassination_of_Ronald_Reagan", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Attempted assassination of Ronald Reagan"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Secret_Service", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "United States Secret Service"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Bureau_of_Investigation", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Federal Bureau of Investigation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Senate", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "United States Senate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_Abbate", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Paul Abbate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fox_News", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Fox News"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Director_of_the_United_States_Secret_Service", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Director of the United States Secret Service"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Law_enforcement", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Law enforcement"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Judiciary", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Judiciary"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Department_of_Homeland_Security", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States Department of Homeland Security"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beaver_County,_Pennsylvania", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Beaver County, Pennsylvania"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Beaver County, Pennsylvania"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mass_shooting", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Mass shooting"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chuck_Grassley", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Chuck Grassley"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prime_Minister_of_the_United_Kingdom", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Prime Minister of the United Kingdom"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assassination", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Assassination"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sniper", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Sniper"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republican_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Republican Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pennsylvania", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Pennsylvania"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Pennsylvania"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Associated_Press", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Associated Press"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Congress", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "United States Congress"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Democratic Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_New_York_Times", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "The New York Times"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Butler,_Pennsylvania", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Butler, Pennsylvania"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Butler, Pennsylvania"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Terrorism", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Terrorism", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Warfare_and_Conflict", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Warfare and Conflict", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Crime_and_Justice", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Crime and Justice", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Theft", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Theft", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 93}], "image": "https://images.foxtv.com/static.livenowfox.com/www.livenowfox.com/content/uploads/2024/07/1280/720/Trump-hearing.jpg?ve=1&tl=1", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9772518", "eventUri": "eng-9772518", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-07-13", "textStart": 153, "textEnd": 160, "freq": 2}], "sentiment": -0.3176470588235294, "wgt": 154, "relevance": 1}

And almost pull it off,\" Senator Tom Carper said, summing up what many in the room were thinking.\n\nOne of the major flaws discussed: the Secret Service's drone was not operational at the rally site.\n\nThe acting director attributed the drone issues to the rocky cell service in the area surrounding the rally.\n\n\"Communication that day at the Butler rally site was challenging,\" Rowe said. \"This day, in particular, there was a connectivity problem.\"\n\n\"Faulty connectivity\" kept the Secret Service's drone out of operation until 5 pm. Senator Mike Lee from Utah explicitly asked Rowe why the shooter's drone could fly despite poor service, but the Secret Service's drone did not. Rowe could provide an answer.\n\nIf the drone was active and surveying the rally grounds, it would have detected the shooter's drone and alerted the Secret Service of the potential threat.\n\n\"We could have perhaps found him,\" Rowe said. \"Maybe even stopped him before.\"\n\nSenator Chuck Grassley of Iowa expressed serious concern about why such an advanced federal agency depends on local cell service.\n\nOther grave flaws were picked apart by Senators, including the communication and planning between local law enforcement and the Secret Service.\n\n\"We did have a meeting in the days leading up to the event to assess any potential threats. The focus is to coordinate times for walk-throughs. Those walk-through assessments of the Butler site did happen,\" Abbate said.\n\nLocal law enforcement was stationed inside of the AGR building which Crooks climbed on top of. A whistleblower claimed that police were supposed to be stationed on the roof of the building, but it got too hot and they went down. Rowe said he heard the same claims but did not confirm it.\n\nSenator Lee asked Rowe why local law enforcement officers covered the AGR building, a location that should have been covered by the Secret Service when the individuals did not meet the qualifications to work for the agency. Lee emphasized that a decision like this is \"lethal.\"\n\nRowe stated that information about an active shooter \"stayed within state and local enforcement and did not get passed to the Secret Service.\" This raised many questions in the Senate about whether any communication mechanisms exist to connect all layers of security at these kinds of events.\n\nQuestions spiraled among the Senate regarding why the shooter's use of a range finder did not alter his classification from just a suspicious person to a serious threat.\n\nRowe argued that \"a suspicious person turns to a threat when there is a weapon involved.\" Ignoring the suspicion that a range finder would only have been useful to someone who had a weapon and planned to use it.\n\nSenators criticized the secrecy of the Secret Service and suggested they speak directly to the press to avoid conspiracies and the spread of false information. They argued for more frequent and public information releases.\n\n\"You guys are a black hole,\" said Senator Ted Cruz. \"You're making the federal government look bad, and you're losing the trust of the American people. You need to commit to talking to the press.\"\n\nSenator Ron Johnson said that the transparency of the July 13th events will be unveiled to the public.\n\n\"We need to find out literally second by second what happened, so the American public knows what happened,\" said Johnson.", "source": {"uri": "fox5dc.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "FOX 5 DC"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Senate", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "United States Senate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Secret_Service", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "United States Secret Service"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Bureau_of_Investigation", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Federal Bureau of Investigation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unmanned_aerial_vehicle", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Unmanned aerial vehicle"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Butler,_Pennsylvania", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Butler, Pennsylvania"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Butler, Pennsylvania"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_government_of_the_United_States", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Federal government of the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mike_Lee", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Mike Lee"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_Abbate", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Paul Abbate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tom_Carper", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Tom Carper"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Attempted_assassination_of_Ronald_Reagan", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Attempted assassination of Ronald Reagan"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Senate_Committee_on_Homeland_Security_and_Governmental_Affairs", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States Senate Committee on Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Senate_Committee_on_the_Judiciary", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States Senate Committee on the Judiciary"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Law_enforcement", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Law enforcement"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Washington_(state)", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Washington (state)"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Washington (state)"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chuck_Grassley", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Chuck Grassley"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Whistleblower", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Whistleblower"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Utah", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Utah"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Utah"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iowa", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Iowa"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Iowa"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ted_Cruz", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Ted Cruz"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Theft", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Theft", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Fraud", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Fraud", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Government_Operations", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Government Operations", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Government/Intelligence", "label": "dmoz/Society/Government/Intelligence", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 95}], "image": "https://images.foxtv.com/static.fox5dc.com/www.fox5dc.com/content/uploads/2024/07/1280/720/GettyImages-2162428697-scaled.jpg?ve=1&tl=1", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9772518", "eventUri": "eng-9772518", "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Washington (state)"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-07-13", "textStart": 432, "textEnd": 441, "freq": 2}], "sentiment": -0.1137254901960785, "wgt": 152, "relevance": 1}

(Rebecca Droke/AFP via Getty Images)\n\nThe acting Secret Service director will face lawmakers for the first time Tuesday to testify about security failures that led up to the attempted assassination of former President Donald Trump.\n\nThe Senate Judiciary and Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs committees are set to convene the joint hearing at 10 a.m. ET.\n\nActing U.S. Secret Service Director Ronald Rowe is expected to offer more details about the communications with other law enforcement agencies and security arrangements made during the former president's campaign rally on July 13 in Butler, Pennsylvania.\n\nMr. Rowe is serving as interim chief of the Secret Service after Kimberly Cheatle stepped down as head of the agency. She resigned shortly after her testimony before the House Oversight and Accountability Committee, in which she frustrated lawmakers by repeatedly saying she would not answer questions before the FBI's investigation was complete.\n\nMr. Rowe started his career with the Secret Service in 1999. He previously served as a police officer in West Palm Beach, Florida.\n\nDuring his 25-year career with the Secret Service, he \"coordinated major security operations, collaborating with other government and law-enforcement agencies,\" according to his biography.\n\nFBI Deputy Director Paul Abbate is also expected to testify to provide an update on the FBI's probe into the assassination attempt. This comes after FBI Director Christopher Wray testified last week before the House Judiciary Committee. Mr. Wray revealed details about the gunman's actions leading up to the July 13 shooting in Pennsylvania.\n\nIn a speech on Monday from the Senate floor, U.S. Senate Majority Whip Dick Durbin (D-Ill.), Chair of the Senate Judiciary Committee, said Americans still need answers and hopes more information will be revealed in Tuesday's joint oversight hearing.\n\n\"There is an urgent need for bipartisan collaboration in Congress to provide these answers to the American people as soon as possible so that the Secret Service can begin to rebuild trust and more effectively fulfill its mission,\" Mr. Durbin said.\n\n\"The work has already begun, and tomorrow's joint hearing will help bring about transparency and accountability for Secret Service failures in Butler on July 13.\"\n\nMeanwhile, House leaders on Monday announced members of a bipartisan task force to investigate the shooting and make recommendations to prevent such an attack from happening again. The task force, which will have subpoena authority, is composed of seven Republicans and six Democrats. House Speaker Mike Johnson and Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries chose the members.\n\nA motive for the July 13 shooting remains unclear. In addition to former President Trump, two others were wounded, and one person was killed that day.", "source": {"uri": "ntd.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "NTD"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Secret_Service", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "United States Secret Service"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Senate", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "United States Senate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Bureau_of_Investigation", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Federal Bureau of Investigation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Butler,_Pennsylvania", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Butler, Pennsylvania"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Butler, Pennsylvania"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Attempted_assassination_of_Ronald_Reagan", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Attempted assassination of Ronald Reagan"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Senate_Committee_on_Homeland_Security_and_Governmental_Affairs", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States Senate Committee on Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Senate_Committee_on_the_Judiciary", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States Senate Committee on the Judiciary"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Law_enforcement", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Law enforcement"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kimberly_Cheatle", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Kimberly Cheatle"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_Abbate", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Paul Abbate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dick_Durbin", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Dick Durbin"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Director_of_the_Federal_Bureau_of_Investigation", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Director of the Federal Bureau of Investigation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christopher_A._Wray", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Christopher A.

As a career law enforcement officer and a 25-year Secret Service veteran, I cannot defend why that roof was not better secured,\" he said.\n\nThe testimony was the most detailed catalogue to date by the Secret Service of law enforcement failings and miscommunications, with Ronald Rowe accepting blame for his own agency's mistakes while also criticizing local law enforcement for not sharing information that a gunman, later identified as Thomas Matthew Crooks, 20, was spotted on a roof of a building less than 150 yards from the rally stage where Trump spoke.\n\nPeople are also reading...

Crooks turned and pointed his rifle at the officer, who retreated.\n\nEven though text messages among local snipers revealed anxiety about the man, Rowe said the only thing the Secret Service knew at the time of the shooting was that law enforcement was contending with a suspicious-looking man.\n\n\"No information regarding a weapon on a roof was ever passed to our personnel,\" Rowe said. At another point, he noted, \"It is troubling to me that we did not get that information as quickly as we should have. We didn't know that there was this incident going on.\"\n\nBut Rowe's willingness to assign blame to local law enforcement opened him up to harsh criticism from Senate Republicans, who saw him as failing to take sufficient responsibility.\n\n\"Isn't the fact that a former president was shot, that a good American is dead, that other Americans were critically wounded -- isn't that enough mission failure for you to say to the person who decided that that building should not be in the security perimeter, probably ought to be stepped down?\" said Sen. Josh Hawley, a Missouri Republican.\n\nRowe, raising his voice, responded that he has \"lost sleep over this for the last 17 days\" and that he would not be rushed \"to judgment\" by Congress. He assured lawmakers that \"people will be held accountable.\"\n\nThe FBI, meanwhile, disclosed new details about Crooks, with Deputy Director Paul Abbate saying a social media account believed to be associated with the gunman suspected in the assassination attempt espoused political violence and included antisemitic and anti-immigrant sentiment.\n\nThe posts were from the 20192020 timeframe, when Crooks would have been in high school.\n\nAbbate did not identify the social media platform, saying investigators were still trying to definitively determine that it belonged to Crooks. However, he indicated that it was separate from an account on a different platform called Gab that was active in 2021.\n\nLove 0 Funny 0 Wow 0 Sad 0 Angry 0\n\nBe the first to know\n\nGet local news

I'm Bill Thomas, we've got some very pivotal stories to get to, and here's what's going on.\n\nThe new director of the Secret Service says changes are underway, newly uncovered social media accounts may be linked to the Trump rally shooter, and the U.S. Senate passes bills aimed at protecting children's privacy. Also, Israel targets a terrorist commander, and Facebook owner Meta will settle a lawsuit with one state for more than $1 billion.\n\nRowe described the area, including the rooftop of the building where the shooter, Thomas Crooks, fired from, saying, \"As a career law enforcement officer, and a 25-year veteran with the Secret Service, I cannot defend why that roof was not better secured.\"\n\nLawmakers from both parties said the Secret Service should have secured the rooftop of the building, or made sure other law enforcement officers had that area protected.\n\nRowe told lawmakers he believed that the agents had plenty of time to plan for the rally, and called what happened a \"failure on multiple levels.\" He went on to say that the agency was making changes in order to prevent similar lapses from occurring in the future, which includes making sure that \"every event site security plan is thoroughly vetted by multiple experienced supervisors before it is implemented.\"\n\nAs you know, the former president survived the shooting with an injury to his right ear. Three other rallygoers were also hit, leaving one man dead and the other two men seriously injured.\n\nRowe assumed the position of acting Secret Service director after Kimberly Cheatle, the presidential appointee who was serving as director, stepped down last week.\n\nBefore she resigned, Cheatle had described the assassination attempt as the Secret Service's \"most significant operational failure in decades.\"\n\nIf you weren't already aware of this, snipers spotted Crooks 1 hour and 45 minutes before shots were fired, according to text messages disclosed this week, but for some reason, the suspect was not detained. He was eventually shot and killed by a Secret Service counter-sniper just seconds after opening fire on the president.\n\nYou should know that Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas appointed Rowe to serve as acting director and that Rowe has been part of the Secret Service for 24 years.\n\nPaul Abbate, deputy director of the FBI, testified yesterday before a joint hearing of the Senate Judiciary Committee and the Senate Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee that focused primarily on the security failures that led up to the Trump assassination attempt.\n\nAbbate said that the social media account has more than 700 posts made between 2019 and 2020, and described them as extreme in nature and supportive of political violence.\n\nAbbate went on to say that the FBI is still working to verify that this particular social media account belonged to Crooks. To refresh your memory, he was shot dead by a Secret Service counter-sniper after firing eight rounds, including one that hit Trump in the ear.\n\nInteresting to note, the shooter's digital footprint has been in focus since FBI Director Christopher Wray told lawmakers last week that Crooks did a Google search for \"how far away was Oswald from Kennedy.\" This is a reference to the assassination of President John F. Kennedy in 1963.\n\nOne of the two bills, the Children and Teens' Online Privacy Protection Act, expands the age limit for protected minors to 16 from 13, and requires social media platforms to obtain consent from users ages 13 to 16 before collecting their personal information. The bill also bans advertisements that focus on kids and teens.\n\nThe other bill, the Kids Online Safety Act (KOSA), is aimed at tech companies' algorithms that keep users continually consuming content. It will now require the companies to allow minors to limit the category of addictive recommendations or opt out of recommendation systems that facilitate endless scrolling.\n\nKOSA also requires that social media companies take action to prevent the spread of harmful content related to suicide, eating disorders, bullying, and drugs.\n\nSenate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer called yesterday's passage of the bills a \"momentous day.\" Both he and Sen. Richard Blumenthal (D-Conn.), the author of KOSA, praised parents who lost their children over online harm for turning their grief into action. Meanwhile, Sen. Josh Hawley (R-Mo.), a co-sponsor of the bill, said more needs to be done but that it's going in the right direction.\n\nInteresting to note, approximately 95 percent of teenagers and 40 percent of children between the ages of 8 and 12 use some form of social media.\n\nYou should also know that the U.S. surgeon general put out an advisory last year, which said that excessive use of social media might lead to anxiety and depression, and this past June, he even called for a warning label on social media platforms, similar to those labels found on tobacco products.\n\nHezbollah, the Iran-supported terrorist group controlling southern Lebanon, has been blamed for a soccer field rocket attack last Saturday that killed 12 Israeli children in the town of Majdal Shams.\n\nThe IDF strike hit Haret Hreik in Beirut's southern suburbs, a Hezbollah stronghold, and damaged several buildings, but it's not clear if any Hezbollah official was hit.\n\nHowever, Lebanon's state-run National News Agency reported that the strike killed one woman and wounded several others, some of them seriously. As a result, Lebanese officials say they plan to file an urgent complaint with the U.N. Security Council, saying Israel is affecting the safety of civil aviation in the airspace of Beirut's Rafic Hariri International Airport.\n\nIsraeli Defense Minister Yoav Gallant called Hezbollah's strike an escalation and the worst attack on Israel since Hamas's Oct. 7 cross-border massacre from Gaza.\n\nInteresting to note, Hezbollah has been attacking northern Israel in support of Hamas since Oct. 8.\n\nPaxton, in 2022, accused Facebook's parent company of using facial recognition technology to collect biometric data of more than 20 million Texans without their permission, and he says that information was captured in photos and videos uploaded to the social media platform.\n\nThe attorney general said he's \"proud to announce that we have reached the largest settlement ever obtained from an action brought by a single State,\" and went on to say that any abuse of the sensitive data of Texans will be met with the full force of the law.\n\nA Meta spokesperson told The Epoch Times that the company was glad to resolve the issue with the state of Texas and further clarified that the agreement was not an admission of any wrongdoing on the part of the company.\n\nYou should know that the Texas lawsuit was the first major case brought and settled under the state's 2009 Capture or Use of Biometric Identifier Act. The legislation made it illegal to use facial recognition software to capture and store data without lawful consent and provided damages of up to $25,000 for each violation.\n\nInteresting to note, Meta will pay the $1.4 billion settlement to the state of Texas over the next five years.\n\nAnd now, it looks like our time is just about up for today, so we're going to call it a wrap for the Wednesday edition of The Epoch Times News Brief.\n\nDuring your travels today, it would sure mean a great deal to us if you could tell some folks you know about our program, and that's because we're always trying to grow the News Brief family -- and in our family, there's always room for one more.\n\nWe heard from Jackie in Virginia.\n\nB Lee, Suze Zoo, Ann-Marie -- and Wireflight checked in from Brandon, Mississippi.\n\nAlso, thanks a million to the folks who continue to leave feedback for us regarding this program on the Epoch Times app and on our website.\n\n*(Don't forget the News Brief Motto): We're portable, affordable, and always on-demand.\n\nAnd finally, as we do each and every day on this program, we wrap everything up with a very notable quote and this one comes to us from entertainer Dolly Parton, who said: \"The way I see it, if you want the rainbow, you gotta put up with the rain.\"\n\nDolly is a legendary singer-songwriter, and she can play 20 different instruments including fiddle, mandolin, and pan-flute.\n\nBefore you go and because this is the last day of the month, you should know that July is National Lasagna Month.

They did not.\n\n\"They should have been on the roof,\" the acting director of the Secret Service, Ronald L. Rowe Jr., told senators Tuesday.\n\nBut Rowe also acknowledged to lawmakers that it was the Secret Service's responsibility to make that expectation clear to the local countersnipers there that day and that his agency might have failed to do so.\n\nIt was the most straightforward explanation yet of what led to the glaring security failure that allowed a would-be assassin to fire eight shots at Trump, injuring him and others and killing a rally attendee, at the Butler Farm Show grounds on July 13. Yet Rowe often acknowledged to lawmakers that he was baffled by some of the decisions made before and on the day of the shooting, including some by his own agency.\n\nHis testimony about the delineation of responsibility for protecting a roof that was within a rifle bullet's range of Trump highlighted a weak link in the protection of the country's leaders.\n\nUltimately, Rowe said, the events of July 13 were a result of \"a failure of imagination\" to see that \"we actually do live in a very dangerous world where people do actually want to do harm to our protectee.\"\n\nIn Butler, Rowe said, two local countersnipers were in one of the warehouses, watching the crowd from windows at the time the shooter, later identified as Thomas Crooks of Bethel Park, Pennsylvania, ascended to the roof of the adjacent warehouse. He said that, in his view, the countersnipers would have been able to see Crooks on the roof if they had looked left out the window.\n\n\"We are looking at this, and they should have been on the roof, and the fact they were in the building is something I'm still trying to understand,\" Rowe said, adding that in the future, the Secret Service would ensure that local and state law enforcement are on roofs.", "source": {"uri": "nytimes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The New York Times"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Secret_Service", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "United States Secret Service"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pennsylvania", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Pennsylvania"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Pennsylvania"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assassination", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Assassination"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Butler_County,_Pennsylvania", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Butler County, Pennsylvania"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Butler County, Pennsylvania"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thomas_Crooks", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Thomas Crooks"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Garth_Crooks", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Garth Crooks"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Law_enforcement", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Law enforcement"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bethel_Park,_Pennsylvania", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Bethel Park, Pennsylvania"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Bethel Park, Pennsylvania"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Business/Business_Services/Fire_and_Security", "label": "dmoz/Business/Business Services/Fire and Security", "wgt": 9}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Guns", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Guns", "wgt": 9}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Water_Sports/Rowing", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Water Sports/Rowing", "wgt": 24}, {"uri": "dmoz/Home/Home_Improvement/Exterior", "label": "dmoz/Home/Home Improvement/Exterior", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Guns/Reloading", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Guns/Reloading", "wgt": 9}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 75}], "image": "https://www.sandiegouniontribune.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/unnamed-file-2062.jpg?w=640", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9772518", "eventUri": "eng-9772518", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-07-13", "textStart": 842, "textEnd": 849, "freq": 2}], "sentiment": -0.09019607843137256, "wgt": 148, "relevance": 1}

But Pat Young, the chief of detectives for Beaver County who was tasked with securing the area around Trump's rally, said they had no communication with the federal authorities that day.\n\n\"Somehow, that we should have had a line of sight on not only the crowd but the area to the side of the building where the shooter was eventually located is kind of ridiculous,\" Young told NewsNation. \"The ability to redeploy to another area is also kind of this ridiculous notion that's out there that somehow our guys, despite guidance from Secret Service, could somehow relocate to a better vantage point is almost laughable in some regards.\"\n\nYoung insists that it was his team that spotted the shooter, Thomas Matthew Crooks, roughly an hour before the actual shooting took place. He said they raised it up the chain of command, and said what happens beyond that is up to the Secret Service.\n\nRowe's testimony was the most detailed catalog to date by the Secret Service of law enforcement failings and miscommunications. While he pointedly criticized the local law enforcement during the proceedings, he also accepted blame for his own agency's mistakes.\n\n\"What I saw made me ashamed.

Ted Cruz. Cruz, during his questioning, tried to elicit from Rowe operation procedural details about what differences in the number of agents there are for the actual President of the United States and a candidate who likes to delude himself is still one. Rowe did his best to answer, beginning to explain that the personal protective details, those closest to their charges, were comparable, but (and here I have to conjecture that he was about to explain to Cruz what was different in the coverages), because Cruz was badgering him for numbers - numbers which I and anyone else with half a brain, assume are kept under wraps for operational security.\n\nFinally an exasperated Rowe informed Cruz that the actual President has the \"Actual command authority to launch a nuclear strike!\"\n\nBut even that was not enough to stop Raphael from trying to ferret out details bout the sizes of the two teams.\n\nTed Cruz is not only a coward that will not protect his family when they are insulted and threatened by Trump, he is also an idiot who tries to undercut the protection we offer all candidates by trying to reveal the details of procedures used in those operations.", "source": {"uri": "politizoom.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "PolitiZoom"}, "authors": [{"uri": "dino_durrati@politizoom.com", "name": "Dino Durrati", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ronald_Rowe", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Ronald Rowe"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Secret_Service", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "United States Secret Service"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Butler,_Pennsylvania", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Butler, Pennsylvania"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Butler, Pennsylvania"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_Abbate", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Paul Abbate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Attempted_assassination_of_Ronald_Reagan", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Attempted assassination of Ronald Reagan"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_House_Committee_on_Homeland_Security", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States House Committee on Homeland Security"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MSN", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "MSN"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Senate_Committee_on_the_Judiciary", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States Senate Committee on the Judiciary"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ted_Cruz", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Ted Cruz"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Bureau_of_Investigation", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Federal Bureau of Investigation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Law_enforcement_officer", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Law enforcement officer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Senate", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United States Senate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nuclear_warfare", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Nuclear warfare"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Texas", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Texas"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Texas"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Warfare_and_Conflict", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Warfare and Conflict", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Theft", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Theft", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Fraud", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Fraud", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Job-Related", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Job-Related", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 68}], "image": "https://i0.wp.com/politizoom.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/IMG_0199.jpeg?fit=2201%2C1222&ssl=1", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9772518", "eventUri": "eng-9772518", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-07-13", "textStart": 226, "textEnd": 235}], "sentiment": -0.02745098039215688, "wgt": 147, "relevance": 1}

Mr. Rowe said the \"close protection shift\" of agents that work most closely with both the current and former president is the same size but he would have to get back to Mr. Cruz with a broader comparison of staffing for entire events.\n\n\"I will get you that number so you can see it with your own eyes,\" he told Mr. Cruz.\n\nMr. Rowe also promised several senators he would follow up on their questions about denials of additional security resources the Trump campaign requested in recent years. He disputed a report that he was personally involved in any of the denials but did not have specific details about the number of or reason for denied requests.\n\nMr. Cruz suggested at the press conference that the decision to withhold security resources for Mr. Trump was political.\n\nSEE ALSO: Secret Service chief blames agency's faulty drone tech for missed chance to stop Trump shooter\n\n\"I believe the rational inference from the evidence we know now is it was political bias at the top, at the leadership of the Secret Service, that led to insufficient agents and insufficient resources being devoted to protecting President Trump,\" he said.\n\nSenators at the press conference also bemoaned the number of questions that remain unanswered about the security failures at the rally, suggesting federal and congressional probes are falling short and an independent commission is needed to quickly uncover the facts.\n\n\"We don't have the time, nor the staff to get to the answers really quick like we need to,\" Mr. Marshall said of the congressional investigations. \"I think that this is something that the president could appoint [or] if the House and Senate leadership got together they could do as well.\"\n\nHe said the House and Senate are so far doing their own investigations and that the most important part of his call for an independent commission is that it be apolitical, comprised\n\nof \"experts in the field\" not associated with Republicans or Democrats.\n\nThe House is in recess until Sept. 9 and the Senate is scheduled to depart for a month-long break on Thursday afternoon, so there is no time for Congress to pass legislation setting up a commission before then.\n\nSen.

The acting director appeared before the Senate Judiciary and Homeland Security committees on Tuesday alongside FBI Deputy Director Paul Abbate.\n\nRowe detailed the failure of a drone detection system that was supposed to be online before shooter Thomas Matthew Crooks conducted his own reconnaissance the day of the rally.\n\nInvestigators say the drone system was reliant on public cellphone service and that there were bandwidth issues, causing the system to only go online at 5:20 pm. instead of 3 p.m.\n\nTRUMP SHOOTING: TIMELINE OF ASSASSINATION ATTEMPT RAISES QUESTIONS ABOUT HOW GUNMAN EVADED SECURITY\n\n\"Why is the Secret Service dependent upon local a cellular network? Does the Secret Service have a backup plan in place?\" asked Sen. Chuck Grassley, R-Iowa.\n\nTRUMP ASSASSINATION ATTEMPT: TEXTS REVEAL OFFICERS WERE AWARE OF THOMAS CROOKS 90 MINUTES BEFORE SHOOTING\n\n\"That is something ... that has cost me a lot of sleep because of the eventual outcome of the assailant. What if we had a geolocated him because that counter-UAS platform had been up?\" Rowe said. \"It is something that I have struggled with to understand, and I have no explanation for it. It is something that I feel as though could have perhaps found him. We could have maybe stopped him. Maybe on that particular day he would have decided this isn't the day to do it, because law enforcement just found me flying my drone.\"\n\n\"People fly drones all the time on the peripheries of our sites, and we go out and we talk to them and we ascertain what their intentions are. On this day, in particular, because of the connectivity challenge, as you noted, there was a delay and he flew his drone at 3:51, approximately. So moving forward, we are leveraging resources from the Department of Homeland Security and others to make sure that we have dedicated connectivity. So that we're not reliant on public domain so that we can ensure that whatever assets we have in place, those assets are operational, and that is my commitment to you that we are going to make sure we're going to do that,\" Rowe continued.\n\nTRUMPF RALLY SHOOTING VICTIMS' FAMILIES BREAK SILENCE, THANK COMMUNITY FOR 'OUTPOURING OF SUPPORT'\n\nAbbate revealed that the FBI has yet to gain full access to the apps on Crooks' phone, saying some content remains hidden on encrypted messaging apps.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nAbbate went on to say that the FBI believes it has identified one of Crooks' social media accounts, but they have yet to fully verify its ownership.\n\nThis is a developing story.

Ted Cruz (R-TX):\n\nCruz: Is your testimony that President Trump had the same size detail that President Biden has?\n\nRowe: On the day of, in Butler, the agents surrounding him, it is the same number of agents surrounding the president today. There is a difference between a sitting president who also not only --\n\nCruz: You're using \"president\" in a way that is not clear. Is it your testimony that in Butler, Pennsylvania, Donald Trump had the same number of agents protecting him that Joe Biden has at a comparable event?\n\nRowe: I'm telling you the shift. The close protection shifts around. That's what you asked me, Senator, and I'm trying to answer it.\n\nCruz: You are not answering it. Is it the same number of agents or not?\n\nRowe: Senator, there is a difference between the sitting president of the United States --\n\nCruz: Then what's the difference? 2x, 3x, 5x, 10x.?\n\nRowe: National command authority to launch a nuclear strike. Sir, there are other assets that travel with the president -- that the former president will get. But the number of Secret Service agents protecting him\n\nWhile the hearing was contentious at times, in his opening statement Rowe made no excuses for the failure to secure the building that provided the sniper a clear shot at Trump.\n\n\"One of my first actions as acting director was traveling to the Butler Farm Show site to better understand how our protection failed. I went to the roof of the AGR Building where the assailant fired shots and I laid in a prone position to evaluate his line of sight,\" Rowe testified. \"What I saw made me ashamed. As a career Site Security Plan and a 25-year veteran with the Secret Service, I cannot defend why that roof was not better secured.\"\n\nIn this exchange, Sen. Josh Hawley (R-MO) demands to know why no one has been fired:\n\nHawley: \"What more do you need to investigate to know that there were critical enough failures that some individuals ought to be held accountable? I mean, what more do you need to know?\n\nRowe: What I need to know is exactly what happened, and I need my investigators to do their job. And I can not --\n\nHawley: A lot of people didn't do their jobs.\n\nRowe: I cannot put my thumb on the scale. Otherwise, the objective -- you're asking me Senator to completely make a rush to judgment about somebody failing. I acknowledge this was a failure of --\n\nHawley: Is it not prima facie that somebody has failed? A former president was shot.\n\nRowe: Sir, this could have been our Texas School Book Depository. I have lost sleep over that for the last 17 days.\n\nCONSPIRACY THEORIES GAIN TRACTION AFTER TRUMP ASSASSINATION ATTEMPT\n\n'THIS IS A FAILURE OF THE SECRET SERVICE': Besides failing to include the building in the inner security perimeter, Rowe admitted there was a significant communications breakdown between local law enforcement and the Secret Service team protecting Trump.\n\n\"Based on what I know right now, neither the Secret Service Counter Sniper Teams nor members of the former president's security detail had any knowledge that there was a man on the roof of the AGR Building with a firearm,\" Rowe said. \"It is my understanding that those personnel were not aware the assailant had a firearm until they heard gunshots. Prior to that, they were operating with the knowledge that local law enforcement was working on an issue of a suspicious individual prior to the shots being fired.\"\n\n\"To prevent similar lapses from occurring in the future, I directed our personnel to ensure every event site security plan is thoroughly vetted by multiple, experienced supervisors before it is implemented,\" Rowe testified. \"I have directed the expanded use of Unmanned Aerial Systems at protective sites to help detect threats on roofs and other elevated threats. I've also directed resources to facilitate our protective site communications particularly our communications with our state and local partners.\"\n\nRowe made no attempt to shift blame to local police. \"This is a failure of the Secret Service,\" he said.\n\nSECRET SERVICE AGENTS DIDN'T SEE TRUMP SHOOTER 'UNTIL THEY HEARD GUNSHOTS': ACTING DIRECTOR\n\nWALTZ: 'WE DIDN'T GET TO THE BOTTOM OF THE CORE ISSUE': In a mid-hearing appearance on CNN, Rep. Mike Waltz (R-FL) noted that Rowe struck a \"completely different\" tone from the former director Cheatle, who he said was \"obtuse, frankly, smug.\"\n\nBut he said, \"We didn't get to the bottom of what I think is the core issue ... Was President Trump denied resources? Obviously, he is not your average former president like a Jimmy Carter or a [George] W. Bush.\n\n\"I want to emphasize that President Trump was given the same size detail for a former president that all other former presidents are given, that there were no additional considerations for the foreign threats, for the additional domestic threats,\" Waltz said. \"And the biggest piece was the number of rallies that he's doing. And at least what these agents are telling me is kind of the tone from headquarters was, we're not going to burn through our budget for all of these extra agents and all of this extra overtime and travel because the former president wants to have a lot of rallies.\"\n\nKEY TAKEAWAYS: SECRET SERVICE HEARING HIGHLIGHTS COMMUNICATION FAILURES BETWEEN LOCAL AND FEDERAL AGENCIES\n\nGood Wednesday morning and welcome to Jamie McIntyre's Daily on Defense, written and compiled by Washington Examiner National Security Senior Writer Jamie McIntyre (@jamiejmcintyre) and edited by Christopher Tremoglie.

There has been no claim of responsibility, but Israel, which killed one of Hezbollah's senior leaders in an airstrike in Beirut yesterday -- immediately became a prime suspect.\n\nHaniyeh has been Hamas' political leader since 2017, and had been living in exile in Qatar, according to the Associated Press, which noted Israel has vowed to kill Haniyeh and other leaders of Hamas over the group's Oct. 7 attack on Israel that killed 1,200 people and saw some 250 others taken hostage.\n\nThe Israeli strike in Lebanon targeted Fuad Shukr, a high-ranking Hezbollah leader, who Israel said played a role in last weekend's rocket attack that killed 12 young people in the Israel-controlled Golan Heights.\n\nU.S. Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin, traveling in Asia, said the U.S. supports Israel, while seeking diplomatic solutions that would avoid escalation to wider war. \"I don't think war is inevitable. I maintain that. I think there's always room and opportunities for diplomacy, and I'd like to see parties pursue those opportunities,\" Austin told reporters traveling with him, adding, \"If Israel is attacked, we certainly will help defend Israel.\"\n\nHAMAS CHIEF ISMAIL HANIYEH KILLED IN IRAN\n\nTRUMP: BIDEN DEPOSED IN A 'COUP': In a segment of Laura Ingraham's interview with Donald Trump that aired last night on Fox, the former president promoted the theory that President Joe Biden was forced to step aside against his will.\n\n\"I mean, look at what they just did. They just took over the presidency from a president. This was a coup. Biden is a very angry man right now. You know that. They took the presidency away. His wife didn't want it to happen. They took the presidency away, like he was a child.\"\n\n\"Who's making the decisions right now in the White House, do you think?\" Ingraham asked. \"A group of people that are fascists, communists, Marxists. They circle the beautiful Resolute Desk in the Oval Office.\"\n\n\"You're saying Biden isn't making any of the big decisions?\" Ingraham asked.\n\n\"I don't think so, no. I don't think he knows he's alive,\" Trump replied.\n\nRUBIO ALLEGEDLY VYING FOR SECRETARY OF STATE ROLE AFTER TRUMP HINTS BURGUM COULD GET CABINET PRIZE\n\nCARDIN TO MOSCOW: WHERE ARE THE PRISONERS?: Sen. Ben Cardin (D-MD), chairman of the Foreign Relations Committee, is calling Russian President Vladimir Putin to account for Russian political prisoners who have abruptly gone missing from their cells.\n\n\"The Kremlin's secretive transfer of Russian political prisoners Lilia Chanysheva, Ksenia Fedeyeva, Sasha Skochilenko, Oleg Orlov, Ilya Yashin, and Kevin Lik is yet another brazen violation of human rights,\" Cardin said in a statement. \"Covertly moving these patriots to unknown locations without cause and without notifying their family or legal counsel is unacceptable, and I call upon the Russian government to immediately disclose their whereabouts.\n\n\"While Putin's reign will undoubtedly end, the heroism of these brave Russian citizens will continue to endure,\" Cardin said. \"The United States stands strong with them today and every day.\"\n\nA LESSON IN OVERMATCHING RUSSIA OVER THE BLACK SEA\n\nWHAT GIVES? Meanwhile, House Foreign Affairs Committee Chairman Michael McCaul (R-TX) and Senate Foreign Relations Committee Ranking Member Jim Risch (R-ID) are increasingly frustrated that they are not getting any answers as to why the security clearance was suspended for the Biden administration's Special Envoy for Iran Robert Malley.\n\n\"The Department's failure to cooperate with our repeated inquiries dating back to June 2023 into the suspension of Mr. Robert Malley's security clearance is deeply troubling,\" McCaul and Risch wrote in a letter to Secretary of State Antony Blinken. Mr. Malley's alleged misconduct is serious, and the Department's lack of transparency and blatant disregard for the urgency of our requests is unacceptable.\"\n\n\"Please provide fulsome answers to our questions, with classified attachments as necessary, by no later than close of business on August 2, 2024,\" the lawmakers requested, under threat of subpoena. \"Should the Department miss this deadline, we will be compelled to pursue compulsory processes to secure any documents, materials, and testimony relevant to our investigations from key members of your team.\"\n\nONE STEP CLOSER: The Senate Armed Services Committee advanced a long list of military promotions and sent them to the floor for final confirmation. The voice vote approved 3,135 military nominations in the Army, Navy, Air Force, Marine Corps, and Space Force.\n\nThe committee also advanced two following civilian nominations: Tonya Wilkerson to be undersecretary of defense for intelligence and security, and Michael Sulmeyer to be assistant secretary of defense for cyber policy.\n\nCLICK HERE TO READ MORE FROM THE WASHINGTON EXAMINER\n\nWashington Examiner: Israel targets Hezbollah commander behind soccer attack with strike in Beirut\n\nWashington Examiner: Opinion: Israel's clever strategy in strike on Hezbollah leader\n\nWashington Examiner: Israel carries out strikes against Hezbollah targets amid concerns of escalation\n\nWashington Examiner: Trump assassination attempt task force to be led by Republican from Butler\n\nWashington Examiner: Secret Service agents didn't see Trump shooter 'until they heard gunshots': Acting director\n\nWashington Examiner: Key takeaways: Secret Service hearing highlights communication failures between local and federal agencies\n\nWashington Examiner: Conspiracy theories gain traction after Trump assassination attempt\n\nWashington Examiner: Social media account believed to be owned by Trump's shooter displayed antisemitic and anti-immigrant themes\n\nWashington Examiner: Controversial Venezuelan election could lead to US sanctions\n\nWashington Examiner: Venezuelan military high command throws support behind Maduro as loyalty of military brought into question\n\nWashington Examiner: Venezuelan opposition leader says Maduro's 'departure is irreversible'\n\nWashington Examiner: Trump's first anti-Harris ad pummels her border record: 'Dangerously liberal'\n\nWashington Examiner: US announces $500 million in funding for Philippines over China threat\n\nWashington Examiner: A lesson in overmatching Russia over the Black Sea\n\nWashington Examiner: Rubio allegedly vying for secretary of state role after Trump hints Burgum could get Cabinet prize\n\nReuters: US Carries Out Strike in Iraq as Regional Tensions Worsen\n\nNew York Times: Iraq Is Caught In Middle As U.S. And Iran Are Increasingly At Odds\n\nWashington Post: Hobbled Hamas Government Clings To Power Amid Collapse Of Law And Order\n\nWall Street Journal: American Weapons To Boost Capability Of Ukraine F-16 Jets\n\nInside Defense: Kendall: The Next Air Force Tanker Could Be Part of an FY25 Quick-Start\n\nBreaking Defense: US Needs More Nuclear Subs, Mobile ICBMs, and Tactical Nukes: Heritage Report\n\nAir Force Times: Boeing's KC-46 Has a New Top-Tier Deficiency\n\nAir & Space Forces Magazine: F-16s Not a 'Golden Bullet' for Ukraine, But They Are an Upgrade, USAFE's Hecker Says\n\nDefense One: Quick Satellite Replacement Should Send a Message to China, Air Force No. 2 Says\n\nStars and Stripes: PACAF Commander Tours US-Funded 'Power Projection Platforms' in Northern Australia\n\nAir & Space Forces Magazine: Rebuffing Beijing, US and Philippines Vow to Operate in South China Sea\n\nDefenseScoop: Marines Get Green Light To Be 'Phantoms' at Air Force's AI Accelerator\n\nMilitary.com: A Nearly $3 Billion Shortfall in VA Benefits Is Looming.

Josh Hawley (R-Mo.) mentioned the RCP report during a heated exchange with the acting director.\n\n\"RealClearPolitics reports this morning that you were directly involved in denying additional security resources and personnel, including counter-snipers, not just to this event, but over the last two years, that President Trump's team repeatedly asked for these additional resources, and you personally were involved in denying them,\" Hawley stated. \"Is that true?\"\n\n\"Senator, as I stated earlier, that is not true,\" Rowe replied.\n\nWhen Hawley asked again whether Rowe was involved in denying the Trump campaign more security, Rowe continued to deny the allegations: \"Uh no, not me. No, sir.\"\n\nSen. Roger Marshall (R-Kan.) likewise pressed Rowe on who made the call to deny Trump added security, prompting a strange response from the acting Secret Service director.\n\n\"You've stated that on multiple occasions, President Trump's team was denied more the detail, more assets,\" Marshall said. \"Who denies that? Who's the person that denies that, generally speaking?\"\n\nRowe answered: \"So, Senator, there, uh, there's a process, uh, again, there's a conversation had with the detail.\"\n\nRather than name names, Rowe kept referring to a \"process,\" a \"conversation,\" and even a nebulous group called \"the war room,\" making Marshall so exasperated about all the seeming obfuscation that he eventually quipped, \"So, it is a room that makes the decision?\"\n\nRowe's refusal to identify the personnel responsible for making decisions regarding security at Trump rallies also seemed to contradict his opening statement, during which he pledged to hold \"accountable\" any of his employees who \"violated agency protocols.\"\n\nIn fact, Sen. Hawley managed to get Rowe to admit that not a single agent affiliated with securing the July 13 rally had yet been fired. \"I will tell you, Senator, that I will not rush to judgment,\" Rowe stubbornly insisted, \"that people will be held accountable, and I will do so with integrity and not rush to judgment and put people unfairly persecuted.\"\n\n\"I have been forthcoming, sir,\" Rowe later added.\n\n\"That remains to be seen,\" Hawley shot back. \"You've been on the job a few days so far. You fired nobody.\"\n\nRowe became acting director of the Secret Service after former Director Kimberly Cheatle resigned last week.", "source": {"uri": "theblaze.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "TheBlaze"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RealClearPolitics", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "RealClearPolitics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Senate", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "United States Senate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Secret_Service", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "United States Secret Service"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump_2016_presidential_campaign", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump 2016 presidential campaign"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Director_of_the_United_States_Secret_Service", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Director of the United States Secret Service"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Attempted_assassination_of_Ronald_Reagan", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Attempted assassination of Ronald Reagan"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joint_session_of_the_United_States_Congress", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Joint session of the United States Congress"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Senate_Committee_on_Homeland_Security_and_Governmental_Affairs", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States Senate Committee on Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Senate_Committee_on_the_Judiciary", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States Senate Committee on the Judiciary"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Josh_Hawley", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Josh Hawley"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Butler,_Pennsylvania", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Butler, Pennsylvania"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Butler, Pennsylvania"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kimberly_Cheatle", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Kimberly Cheatle"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roger_Marshall_(politician)", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Roger Marshall (politician)"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Terrorism", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Terrorism", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Warfare_and_Conflict", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Warfare and Conflict", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Theft", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Theft", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Fraud", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Fraud", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 89}], "image": "https://www.theblaze.com/media-library/image.jpg?id=53022990&width=1200&height=600&coordinates=0%2C1%2C0%2C170", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9772518", "eventUri": "eng-9772518", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-07-13", "textStart": 532, "textEnd": 539, "freq": 2}], "sentiment": -0.207843137254902, "wgt": 143, "relevance": 1}

And I think the Biden administration has been suffused with partisan politics... Did the same person who denied the request for additional security to President Trump also repeatedly deny the requests for security to Robert F. Kennedy Jr., whose father was murdered by an assassin and whose uncle was murdered by an assassin? Did the same person make that decision?\"\n\nRowe: \"Senator, what I will tell you is that Secret Service agents are not political.\"\n\nEven though he requested it in advance, Biden did not provide Secret Service protection for Independent presidential candidate Robert F. Kennedy Jr. until after the Trump murder attempt.\n\nCruz: \"I have a simple question: yes or no. Did the same person deny the Trump request that also denied the RFK request? That's a yes or no question.\"\n\nRowe: \"Senator, that is not a yes or no question. One, there's a process for a candidate nominee to receive protection... That is a bicameral, bipartisan process.\"\n\nAs the two continued to converse and talk over one another, Cruz informed Rowe that his usage of the term \"bicameral\" was incorrect because he is not a member of Congress.\n\nAccording to sources within the Secret Service, there weren't enough personnel available to defend Trump due to the NATO summit taking place in Washington, D.C., as well as first lady Jill Biden's campaign event taking place in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, according to the Daily Caller.\n\nCruz: \"What was the relative size of the Trump detail compared to the detail that is assigned to the President and the First Lady?\"\n\nRowe: \"Senator, the former president travels with a full shift, just like the president.\"\n\nCruz then asked Rowe to clarify if it was \"the exact same size.\"\n\nRowe: \"On the day of, in Butler, the agents surrounding him, it is the same number of agents surrounding the president today.\"\n\nThe Texas senator chimed in after the last statement to clarify his use of the term \"president,\" asking for a second time if \"it is [his] testimony that in Butler, Pennsylvania, Donald Trump had the same number of agents protecting him that Joe Biden has at a [comparable] event.\"\n\nRowe grew frustrated and insisted he was \"trying to answer.\"\n\nCruz: \"You are not answering it. Is it the same number of agents or not? Sir, you are refusing to answer straight.\n\nRowe tries to interject.\n\nCruz: \"Sir, stop interrupting me. Stop interrupting me. You are refusing to answer clear and direct questions. I am asking the relative difference in the number of agents between those assigned to Donald Trump and those assigned to Joe Biden. I'm not asking why you assign more to Joe Biden.\"\n\nAs the testimony and discussion became more heated, Rowe finally informed Cruz that he would give him the precise number so he could see it with \"own eyes.\"\n\nMeanwhile, Rowe emphasized the breakdowns in communication that occurred during the Butler event throughout Tuesday's hearing, claiming that data regarding Crooks was \"stuck\" and \"siloed\" in local law enforcement channels.\n\nRowe: \"The only thing we had was that locals were working an issue at the three o'clock, which would have been the former president's right-hand side, which is where the shot came... Nothing about man on the roof, nothing about man with a gun. None of that information ever made it over our net.\"\n\nHowever, Rowe's last statement highly contradicts other news reports and testimonies by local law enforcement.\n\nAlthough the FBI still hasn't disclosed a motive for the failed assassination attempt, CNN reported on Tuesday that the CEO of the website \"Gab,\" Andrew Torba, claimed last week that law enforcement contacted him and said there's a chance the would-be assassin had an account on his alternative social media platform. The aforementioned account, according to Torba, was \"pro-Biden.\"\n\nStay informed! Receive breaking news blasts directly to your inbox for free.

Her replacement, acting director Ronald Rowe, showed up at the Senate today to take questions about the failures that allowed a local nutcase to gain access to a rooftop 130 yards away from the stage and fire eight shots at Trump, wounding him and killing Corey Comparetore.\n\nRowe showed up prepared to provide solid answers about what transpired, who was responsible, and how the Secret Service issued false declarations in the hours and days after the attack. Ha! Just kidding. Rowe followed the same obfuscatory strategy that Cheatle tried, and Sen. Ted Cruz wasn't having any of it:\n\nWe are now more than two weeks past the assassination attempt. The US Secret Service has had plenty of time to get answers to these questions; the issue of conflicts over the requests for more resources came up within hours of the attack. The USSS also has had plenty of time to get the name of the people responsible for the false denial highlighted by Cruz here and hold them accountable.\n\nRowe apparently doesn't have any interest in accountability. And he seems pretty angry about Congress demanding it, too.\n\nSen. John Kennedy didn't get answers to the more basic question in the assassination attempt. How, Kennedy wonders, could the snipers have missed Crooks climbing onto the roof?\n\nIt's not just the 20-minute issue, which Rowe doesn't do much to answer. Spectators were trying to alert police when Crooks started climbing on the roof, where he would have been visible from the sniper positions. Wouldn't that activity have caught their attention, regardless of whether the people on the ground got the attention of police at that same time? Kennedy's correct about the positioning of those snipers and their vantage point to Crooks' position. If the snipers didn't see Crooks until he started shooting, why didn't they see him? Their mission was to watch for threats that could emerge before those threats took action.\n\nSen. John Cornyn also got a few \"no explanation\" answers from Rowe, and not much else:\n\nAnd this raises more questions than it answers:\n\nCORNYN: \"Why would the President be allowed to take to the stage while a suspicious person had been identified and before the Secret Service or local law enforcement were able to investigate the circumstances?\"\n\nROWE: \"At that time, Senator, suspicion had not risen to the level of threat or imminent harm.\"\n\nWell ... why not? And given that he'd been identified as at least suspicious, why didn't the snipers scrutinize the vulnerable and unsecured positions, such as that rooftop?\n\nAt least Kennedy got a straight answer from the FBI's deputy director on the wound to Trump's ear. After Christopher Wray suggested that the FBI didn't know for sure that it was a bullet or shrapnel that hit Trump's ear, Paul Abbate testified that the FBI has \"absolutely no doubt\" that it was a bullet:\n\nIf \"there never has been\" any doubt about that, why did Wray testify otherwise? Perhaps the same committee will demand Wray answer that question.\n\nThe hearing will continue, and apparently so will the Secret Service's lack of accountability for the failures of July 13. Rowe's defensive dissembling does nothing to restore confidence in an agency that failed in its most basic tasks in Butler County, and apparently won't set any disincentives against further failure.", "source": {"uri": "hotair.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "HotAir"}, "authors": [{"uri": "ed_morrissey@hotair.com", "name": "Ed Morrissey", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Attempted_assassination_of_Ronald_Reagan", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Attempted assassination of Ronald Reagan"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sniper", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Sniper"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ted_Cruz", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Ted Cruz"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Secret_Service", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "United States Secret Service"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kimberly_Cheatle", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Kimberly Cheatle"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_F._Kennedy", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "John F.

Trump missed a fatal headshot by millimeters, though a bullet grazed his right ear. The incident has become a source of extreme embarrassment for the Secret Service, who presided over what appears to be an epic breakdown of communications and security lapses that almost got Trump killed.\n\nIt cost Kimberley Cheatle her job after her shambolic testimony last week, where lawmakers on both sides grew increasingly frustrated with her non-answers over the incident. Yet, while Rowe appears to be a bit more forthcoming about the details of the assassination attempt, Susan Crabtree at RealClearPolitics had an article about Mr. Rowe being involved in limiting security resources to Mr. Trump despite repeated requests to enhance his detail, a position the agency denied but later had to admit was true. Crabtree's reporting was mentioned during this hearing by Sen. Ron Johnson (R-WI). Rowe denied the allegation in the piece, but Crabtree stands by her sources.\n\n\"Okay, that's the kind of information you need to refute with documentation,\" replied Johnson.\n\nWe'll see if the Secret Service provides such materials in refuting this claim.\n\nActing Secret Service Director Ronald Rowe was directly involved in denying additional security resources and personnel, including counter snipers, to former President Trump's rallies and events - despite repeated requests by the agents assigned to Trump's detail in the two years leading up to his July 13 attempted assassination, according to several sources familiar with the decision-making.\n\nRowe succeeded former Secret Service Director Kimberly Cheatle, who resigned last week after bipartisan calls following her widely panned testimony before the House Oversight Committee. But both Rowe and Cheatle were directly involved in decisions denying requests for more magnetometers, additional agents, and other resources to help screen rallygoers at large, outdoor Trump campaign gatherings.\n\nIt was Rowe's decision alone to deny counter sniper teams to any Trump event outside of driving distance from D.C., these sources asserted.\n\nJohnson and other members of the committee are expected to focus on Rowe's role in the Secret Service's repeated denials of extra security requested by agents assigned to Trump's protective detail and about decisions regarding the number of placement of snipers assigned to some of Trump's events.\n\nAssigning counter snipers based on the ability to drive to an event may sound far-fetched, but knowledgeable sources explained that there's a limited number of these highly trained Uniform Division officers. It's easier for counter sniper teams to carry their guns and gear in a van they can all use to transport the teams to the site for advance work for the event and then use the same vehicles, referred to by the Secret Service as \"push vehicles,\" to return to D.C.\n\nThe alternative is for counter sniper teams to board commercial flights or Amtrak (if the event is in the Northeast corridor) with all their gear, find a rental vehicle once on the ground, and then do it all in reverse on the way home. It's all possible under the \"needs of the Service,\" one source contends, but in reality, it's much easier and far more cost-effective for counter snipers to drive to and from a site.\n\n\"They can carry their guns and gear on airplanes - there's an efficient process for that - but it's going to be much easier, because they have all their gear with them, to drive rather than fly because then they have a push vehicle to take the whole team to and from a hotel to the site each day,\" a source in the Secret Service Community told RCP. \"They would always rather drive than fly.\"\n\nThe Secret Service has not responded to several questions from RCP about decisions to deny or limit security resources and personnel, including counter snipers, to Trump's events.\n\nThis hearing comes after damning text messages were leaked to The New York Times, showing the extent of the communications breakdown. Counter snipers knew about shooter Thomas Matthew Crooks almost 100 minutes before he opened fire on Trump. The thread is disconcerting since Crooks seemed to be a step ahead of the security apparatus at the event.\n\nLocal SWAT teams had previously spotted Crooks, providing photos and a description which got lost in the white noise.

Senators reviewed the lapses in communications, placement of the parameter in Butler, Pennsylvania and where the buck stops for the failures.\n\nDiscussed was how the shooter was known minutes before the shooting to be suspicious with a rangefinder before being seen with a gun.

Rowe said they didn't have their anti-drone systems in place until later in the day.\n\n\"It appears that there was an offer by a state or local agency to fly a drone on our behalf and I'm getting to the bottom of why we turned that down,\" Rowe said.\n\nThe motive of the shooter, who was shot and killed, is still being investigated.\n\nU.S. Sen.

Marsha Blackburn on Tuesday asked the Secret Service's new acting director why the \"public has lost trust\" in the agency's \"mission to protect\" following a July 13 assassination attempt against former President Trump at his rally in Butler, Pennsylvania.\n\n\"This agency needs to change, and if not now, when? The next assassination in 30 days?\" Blackburn read from an email, reportedly sent by a Secret Service counter sniper, during a Senate hearing involving testimony from Acting U.S. Secret Service (USSS) Director Ronald Rowe and FBI Deputy Director Paul Abbate.\n\nBlackburn also read the last portion of the email, obtained by Real Clear Politics reporter Susan Crabtree and reportedly sent within the agency by the counter sniper, stating that the \"motto\" of the USSS is \"CYA,\" an acronym for \"cover your a--.\"\n\nThe Tennessee senator continued: \"The public has lost trust in the ability to execute the mission to protect, and I want to know how you feel about the fact that employees in your agency are worried about \"covering their behind and not worried about protecting a former president.\"\n\nTRUMP SHOOTING: TIMELINE OF ASSASSINATION ATTEMPT\n\nThe counter sniper who wrote the email apparently sent it to the entire Uniform Division as more information about the assassination attempt became public, according to Crabtree.\n\nFor example, Republican Iowa Sen. Chuck Grassley on Monday released text messages from Butler County, Pennsylvania, showing that snipers spotted shooter Thomas Crooks approximately 90 minutes prior to the moment he fired multiple rounds toward the former president, ultimately killing 50-year-old Corey Comperatore and injuring 74-year-old James Copenhaver and 57-year-old David Dutch.\n\nTRUMP ASSASSINATION ATTEMPT: SENATE TO GRILL SECRET SERVICE, FBI OFFICIALS\n\nRowe, who took on the position of director after Kimberly Cheatle resigned last week, told Blackburn he is \"hurt\" by the email.\n\n\"I'm hurt because my people are hurting right now,\" Rowe told Blackburn. \"We need them.\"\n\nTRUMP ASSASSINATION ATTEMPT: TEXTS REVEAL OFFICERS WERE AWARE OF THOMAS CROOKS 90 MINUTES BEFORE SHOOTING\n\nThe acting director added that \"emotions are raw\" within the agency right now, and he wants to \"hear more\" from the agent who wrote the email and described himself as a U.S. Marine as well as a 20-year veteran with the USSS. Rowe added that he is committed to reviewing things and being a \"change agent.\"\n\nWhen reached for comment, the Secret Service referred Fox News Digital to Rowe's testimony.\n\nRowe was also grilled on Monday by Sen. Mike Lee, R-Utah, who asked how it was possible that Trump was allowed on stage 17 minutes after reports of a suspicious person.\n\n\"No information regarding a weapon on the roof was ever passed to our personnel,\" Rowe said.\n\n\"How is that even possible?\" Lee asked.\n\nThat information was \"in local law enforcement channels but did not cross over and make it to Secret Service awareness,\" Rowe responded. \"I think that they were in the midst of dealing with a very critical situation and they articulated that over the radio, as I understand it. However, it was never relayed over to us.\"\n\nTRUMP ASSASSINATION ATTEMPT: FBI SAYS GUNMAN CLIMBED HVAC, TRAVERSED ROOFTOPS TO SHOOTING PERCH\n\nThe USSS letter comes after the FBI on Monday morning told reporters in a conference call that Crooks accessed the roof of a building near former President Trump's rally in Butler using HVAC equipment and piping.\n\nCrooks then traversed multiple rooftops before he found his shooting position on top of a building owned by American Glass Research (AGR), located near the Butler Farm Show fairgrounds about 150 yards from where the former president spoke at his rally.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nOn the day of the rally, Crooks parked his vehicle and flew a drone between about 3:50 p.m. and 4 p.m. about 200 yards from where the former president would be speaking on July 13. FBI Director Christopher Wray testified during a July 17 congressional hearing that Crooks had been at the rally site for about 70 minutes the morning of the assassination attempt.\n\nIt is still unclear how Crooks evaded security even after being noticed by law enforcement approximately 90 minutes before shots rang out, but the FBI said more than 300 agents and staff are working \"round the clock\" to gather facts and put together a clearer timeline of Crooks' actions.", "source": {"uri": "foxnews.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Fox News"}, "authors": [{"uri":

The question about rangefinders, however, might tell you all you need to know about the sense of urgency felt by the Secret Service following their catastrophic failures that ended in Donald Trump getting shot, one man being murdered, and two others critically wounded. Get ready.\n\nWe found out in Tuesday's testimony that the Secret Service turned down a local law enforcement offer to provide a drone for overwatch. Why would that be? The shoulder-shrug answer was as vague and unsatisfactory as the \"answer\" for why local law enforcement and the Secret Service couldn't talk to each other. Or, try this one on for size: Secret Service teams were too busy texting information back and forth -- taking their eyes off of the crowd -- instead of just picking up the phone or radio and calling the comms guys to relay intelligence.\n\nActing Secret Service Director Ronald Rowe said, \"It was great there was a text chain, but that communication needs to go over the net. It needs to go over a radio channel so that everyone has situational awareness.\" He added, \"I want people using the radio.\" But, of course, there were no comms between the locals and the feds. Another dumb and catastrophic mistake.\n\nRelated: Why Are the Feds Hiding the Would-Be Trump Assassin's Left-Wing Radicalism?\n\nWe still don't have a definitive answer about why none of the teams of local law enforcement tasked with being on the roof of the AGR building had been called off. During Tuesday's testimony, Rowe said the personnel were off looking around for the suspicious character who had been spotted carrying a rangefinder. That suspicious character turned out to be the murderous 20-year-old Thomas Crooks. We found out through a more thorough timeline that there were at least 30 seconds between law enforcement seeing Crooks with his rifle and when he started firing. He got off eight shots before the Secret Service sharpshooter took him out. Eight shots. The FBI is still studying where all the shots went.\n\nRowe said they were watching multiple suspicious characters that day.\n\nSuspicious characters, however, don't rise to the level of immediate threats -- even when they're spotted with golf rangefinders. Why would someone need a laser rangefinder at a Trump event? Was Crooks testing the tolerance of the Secret Service?\n\nUtah Republican Senator Mike Lee was gobsmacked.\n\nCrooks was allowed to take it through the magnetometers and then leave the perimeter to station himself on the unwatched roof that had been abandoned by teams ordered to leave their posts to search for him, we're told.\n\nRelated: Secret Service Sniper Warns of Another Assassination Attempt Before Election\n\nRowe testified that these catastrophic mistakes were a \"failure of imagination\" and a \"failure to challenge our assumptions.\"\n\nAnd we know where that starts. How's this for failure of imagination and assumptions: the Secret Service has yet to ban rangefinders from events. No, really.\n\nWe discovered that tidbit during questioning by Arkansas Senator Tom Cotton.\n\nCotton: Mr. Rowe we found out that the shooter had on him a golf range finder. Was that not on the list of prohibited items?\n\nRowe: Currently it is not on the list of prohibited items but we're going to make that change, Senator.\n\nHere's lil' ol' me asking, why have you not done this already? Secret Service Acting Director 'It's a Process, Senator' Rowe could, with a pen and a phone, make that change.\n\nCotton continued:\n\nCotton: John Kennedy can't get into the LSU football game with a flask. It just seems common sense that you don't need a rangefinder at an event like this. And it seems that it was just a lack of common sense being exercised. Are officers not empowered on the front line to use common sense to say if a guy has a laser rangefinder, he should be detained to at least stop and asked why he's carrying it around?\n\nIf you have a building like this that's not secured 150 meters away, someone, even the front-line lowest-level most junior officer should be able to kind of like send up the red flag immediately and say we need to halt everything right now until we can figure out what the hell is going on.\n\nRowe assured Cotton that they have common sense and are empowered to use it.\n\nIf the junior-level operators are taking their cues on imagination, assumptions, and common sense from the brass, then that's a big problem.", "source": {"uri": "pjmedia.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "PJ Media"}, "authors": [{"uri": "victoria_taft@pjmedia.com", "name": "Victoria Taft", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rangefinder", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Rangefinder"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Law_enforcement", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Law enforcement"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Secret_Service", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "United States Secret Service"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Bureau_of_Investigation", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Federal Bureau of Investigation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Attempted_assassination_of_Ronald_Reagan", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Attempted assassination of Ronald Reagan"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assassination", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Assassination"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unmanned_aerial_vehicle", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Unmanned aerial vehicle"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sharpshooter", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Sharpshooter"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laser_rangefinder", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Laser rangefinder"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Situation_awareness", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Situation awareness"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Senate", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United States Senate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cotton", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Cotton"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rifle", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Rifle"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golf", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Golf"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mike_Lee", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Mike Lee"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Penalty_kick_(association_football)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Penalty kick (association football)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tom_Cotton", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Tom Cotton"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brass", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Brass"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LSU_Tigers_football", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "LSU Tigers football"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hell", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Hell"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnetometer", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Magnetometer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_F._Kennedy", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "John F.

Judiciary and Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committees.\n\nHe provided an update to the investigation into the attempted assassination of Donald Trump, revealing new details about 20-year-old Crooks.\n\nTrump was rallying in the town of Butler on July 13 when Crooks fired multiple shots from an AR-15 style rifle.\n\n\"While the investigation has not determined motive, the investigative team continues to review information from legal returns, including online and social media accounts,\" Abbate said.\n\n\"Something just very recently uncovered is a social media account, which is believed to be associated with the shooter in the 2019 to 2020 timeframe.\"\n\nAbbate revealed the agency has uncovered more than 700 comments posted from this account that are \"extreme in nature\" containing anti-Semitic and anti-immigration themes.\n\nComments posted from the account also appear to promote political violence.\n\n\"While the investigative team is still working to verify this account to determine if it did belong to the shooter, we believe it important to note, particularly given the general absence of information to date reflecting on the shooter's potential

The account posted more than 700 comments around 2019-2020.\n\n\"Some of these comments, if ultimately attributable to the shooter, appear to reflect anti-Semitic and anti-immigration themes, to espouse political violence, and are described as extreme in nature,\" Abbate said.\n\nSecret Service Acting Director Ronald Rowe also testified at the hearing that the service's counter sniper \"neutralized\" Crooks within seconds after Crooks fired, and that the counter sniper had full discretion to use deadly force without having to seek authorization to fire.\n\nRowe took over as acting director of the service after Kimberly Cheatle resigned from the role July 23, following mounting pressure from lawmakers and many in the public.\n\nThe visit by Crooks to the site took place one day after he registered for the rally on July 6. The rally wasn't announced until July 3.\n\nCrooks traveled from his home to a sportsman club to practice shooting the day before the attack, according to Abbate. On the morning of the attack, he returned to the rally grounds for about 70 minutes.

(Allison Bailey/Middle East Images/AFP)\n\nActing Secret Service Director Ronald Rowe was directly involved in denying additional security resources and personnel, including countersnipers, to former President Donald Trump's rallies and events -- despite repeated requests by the agents assigned to Trump's detail in the two years leading up to his July 13 attempted assassination, according to several sources familiar with the decision-making.\n\nRowe succeeded former Secret Service Director Kimberly Cheatle, who resigned last week after bipartisan calls following her widely panned testimony before the House Oversight Committee. But both Rowe and Cheatle were directly involved in decisions denying requests for more magnetometers, additional agents, and other resources to help screen rallygoers at large, outdoor Trump campaign gatherings.\n\nIt was Rowe's decision alone to deny countersniper teams to any Trump event outside of driving distance from Washington, these sources asserted.\n\nRowe and FBI Deputy Director Paul Abbate appeared Tuesday before a joint hearing of the Senate Judiciary and Homeland Security and Government Affairs committees.\n\nSenators on both sides of the aisle have vowed to press for answers on the assassination attempt on Trump that took the life of rallygoer Corey Comperatore and wounded two others. Sen. Richard Blumenthal, D-Conn., who chairs the Homeland Security panel, said he planned to grill Rowe and Abbate on the \"litany of gaps and failures.\"\n\n\"There are monumental, critical questions that so far the leadership in these two agencies have failed to answer [for, and] even to begin to respond to,\" Blumenthal said.\n\nSen. Ron Johnson, R-Wis., a senior member of the Homeland Security committee, told Real Clear Politics he was initially impressed by Rowe's willingness to answer senators' questions late last week, but pledged to question him closely about the denying of resources to protect Trump.\n\n\"I will also hold him fully accountable for being 100% transparent and honest in cooperating with our investigation and oversight,\" Johnson said Thursday.\n\nJohnson and other members of the committee were expected to focus on Rowe's role in the Secret Service's repeated denials of extra security requested by agents assigned to Trump's protective detail and about decisions regarding the number of placement of snipers assigned to some of Trump's events.\n\nAssigning countersnipers based on the ability to drive to an event may sound far-fetched, but knowledgeable sources explained that there's a limited number of these highly trained Uniform Division officers. It's easier for countersniper teams to carry their guns and gear in a van they can all use to transport the teams to the site for advance work for the event and then use the same vehicles, referred to by the Secret Service as \"push vehicles,\" to return to Washington.\n\nThe alternative is for countersniper teams to board commercial flights or Amtrak (if the event is in the Northeast corridor) with all their gear, find a rental vehicle once on the ground, and then do it all in reverse on the way home. It's all possible under the \"needs of the Service,\" one source contends, but in reality, it's much easier and far more cost-effective for countersnipers to drive to and from a site.\n\n\"They can carry their guns and gear on airplanes -- there's an efficient process for that -- but it's going to be much easier, because they have all their gear with them, to drive, rather than fly, because then they have a push vehicle to take the whole team to and from a hotel to the site each day,\" a source in the Secret Service Community told RCP. \"They would always rather drive than fly.\"\n\nThe Secret Service has not responded to several questions from RCP about decisions to deny or limit security resources and personnel, including countersnipers, to Trump's events.\n\nAt first, the Trump rally in Butler, Pennsylvania, on July 13 had no Secret Service sniper teams assigned to it, but at the last minute, agency officials reversed course and decided to add two snipers to the outdoor event. It's still unclear whether there were just two countersnipers or two two-man teams for a total of four individuals. (Two-man teams usually include one spotter and one sniper.)\n\nSo far, there has been no explanation as to why agency officials made the late countersniper assignments to the Butler event, though it could be in response to the increased threat level Trump has faced in recent weeks. The Secret Service has said the agency increased security for Trump for an unknown time period before the Butler rally in response to an Iranian plot against the former president.\n\nAs RCP previously reported, the late decision to add the two countersnipers cut short the time the team had to conduct a detailed on-site survey in advance of the Butler rally. Such a survey would usually take two to three days to complete, but the countersnipers had only one day to complete that critical advance work.\n\nSources familiar with countersniper advance work also said an outdoor forum, such as the farm show site in Butler, should require at least three two-man countersniper teams.\n\nInstead, the Secret Service sent two countersnipers and then relied on a local law enforcement countersniper team to man the American Glass Research (AGR) building, placing that structure outside the official Secret Service perimeter.\n\nThe decision to rely on local law enforcement to man the AGR building has come under scrutiny in the weeks after the shooting -- especially as new details have emerged about local law enforcement's tracking of gunman Thomas Matthew Crooks more than an hour and a half before he opened fire and its communications breakdown with the Secret Service.\n\nLocal law enforcement snipers and their superior officers have said that they tried to keep the Secret Service informed about their concerns about Crooks, but their communications were siloed from the agency, even though they said they notified the site's Secret Service command center of Crooks' suspicious activity.\n\nThe Secret Service command center is supposed to be manned with both senior Secret Service agents and local law enforcement bosses to facilitate coordination and \"interoperability,\" as Cheatle testified during last week's congressional hearing.\n\nBut a breakdown in communication occurred, and the Secret Service was tracking several suspicious persons that day and apparently never deemed Crooks a threat until he was crawling on top of the AGR roof with a rifle. The Secret Service countersniper killed Crooks as soon as he had him in his line of sight, Rowe told senators in a closed-door briefing last week.\n\nJohnson, the Wisconsin Republican, told Real Clear Politics, that Rowe told senators during the briefing that Crooks was hiding behind the lip of the edge of the building, and the Secret Service countersniper shot and killed him as soon as he could detect his forehead above that lip on the building's roof edge.\n\nSeveral members of Congress have questioned the role poor communications played in allowing Crooks the opportunity to shoot at Trump and the crowd and why local law enforcement snipers were tracking Crooks as early as 4:26 p.m., more than 100 minutes before he opened fire.\n\nLawmakers have repeatedly asked why, if local law enforcement was tracking Crooks so closely, didn't the Secret Service agents detailed to Trump whisk him off the stage or prevent him from going on stage in the first place?\n\nBut those familiar with Secret Service protocol under similar circumstances say there are always multiple suspicious persons being tracked at Trump's rallies and they often do not rise to the level of alerting the president's security detail, those five to 10 agents whose sole job is to provide immediate security for Trump and act as a human shield if and when a threat emerges.\n\nOn the day of the rally, more than 100 people needed medical attention for heat exhaustion, and there were three other suspicious people besides Crooks that the Secret Service and/or local law enforcement were tracking, according to testimony by Christopher Paris, head of the Pennsylvania State Police, before the House Homeland Security panel last week.\n\nEven if Secret Service received notification that local law enforcement was tracking Crooks and considered him suspicious, Secret Service agents wouldn't go into high alert unless they knew he was armed or on top of a roof, which texts show local law enforcement never observed or notified the Secret Service command center about -- even though they appear to have flagged Crooks as engaging in suspicious activity, including pointing a range finder toward the stage at one point in the hour leading up to the shooting.\n\n\"Use of the word 'threat' would have changed things, and Trump would not have been allowed on stage,\" a source in the Secret Service community told Real Clear Politics. \"A suspicious person on the far outer perimeter where eight cops are looking for him would not make 99% of agents keep the president offstage.\"\n\nIf that suspicious person were reported crawling on a roof before Trump went on stage, then most likely the Secret Service would have prevented Trump from beginning his rally. If Crooks was spotted with a gun, then Trump definitely would have been held back, the source asserted. If Crooks was reported as running from police, then it would be more a Secret Service judgment call in the moment.\n\nBut Crooks apparently put the rifle together after scrambling up to the rooftop, leaving the Secret Service possibly only minutes or even just seconds to react once they learned that he had a gun and was crawling on the roof. Crooks' position at the lip of the rooftop's edge further hindered the Secret Service's ability to shoot him before he opened fire, according to Rowe's briefing with senators last week.\n\nAt least one knowledgeable source blames the local law enforcement countersnipers for what appears to be at least one officer's failure to remain in his position and keep an eye on the AGR rooftop.\n\n\"The Butler ESU was told where to be and what their job was likely by a supervisor who had been in meetings with the Secret Service,\" the source said. \"They had one job. They should have kept their eyes on the rooftop they were assigned to man.\"\n\nSeveral local law enforcement officers assigned to a building on the outer perimeter of the Butler rally appeared on ABC News over the weekend and accused the Secret Service of failing to coordinate with them or even meet with them before the rally.\n\n\"We were supposed to get a face-to-face briefing with the Secret Service members whenever they arrived, and that never happened,\" said Jason Woods, lead sharpshooter on the SWAT team in Beaver County, Pa. \"So, I think that was probably a pivotal point, where I started thinking things were wrong because it never happened,\" he added. \"We had no communication.\"\n\nThe first communication between the local law enforcement group and the Secret Service, Woods said, was not until after the shooting. By then, he said, \"it was too late.\"\n\nSecret Service spokesman Anthony Guglielmi declined to respond directly to the assertions by the Beaver County SWAT team.\n\nInstead, he said that the agency \"is committed to better understanding what happened before, during, and after the assassination attempt of former President Donald Trump to ensure that never happens again. That includes complete cooperation with Congress, the FBI, and other relevant investigations.\"\n\nA timeline released by the office of Sen. Chuck Grassley, R-Iowa, of local law enforcement's activity in the 45 minutes before shots rang out sheds some light on their activity and efforts to keep track of Crooks.\n\nAt 4:26 p.m., a Beaver County countersniper assigned to the AGR building left it after finishing his shift and spotted Crooks at a picnic table outside. The countersniper alerted the remaining Beaver and Butler snipers in the AGR building about Crooks' presence, according to texts released by Grassley.\n\nAt 5:38 p.m. a Beaver County sniper sent photos of Crooks to the Beaver, Butler, and Washington snipers in a group chat, with the Beaver sniper noting that Crooks was using \"a range finder\" looking toward the stage. He then recommended that the group notify Secret Service to \"look out,\" according to the texts. It's unclear if that range finder information was ever conveyed to the Secret Service.\n\nAdditional texts among local law enforcement officers and a timeline of local law enforcement activity Grassley made public Monday further detail that the local law enforcement officers called into a local Butler law enforcement \"command\" radio frequency at 5:41 p.m. communicating Crooks' description. They also conveyed that Crooks had a range finder and was \"lurking\" near the AGR building.\n\nThen at 5:45 p.m. a Beaver County sniper sent photos of Crooks to a local law enforcement group chat with one Beaver law enforcement officer recommending that they alert \"command,\" though it's unclear whether that reference is to the official Secret Service command center. The Grassley timeline, portions of which are redacted, indicates a text was sent at 5:45 p.m. to \"Beaver ESU Command\" about Crooks and \"to relay to command.\"\n\nA Beaver County after-action report released by Grassley also indicates that the local law enforcement officers lost sight of Crooks in the minutes before he climbed up to the roof, then spotted him again at 6:05 p.m. at \"picnic tables\" with a backpack.\"\n\nThen from 6:06 to 6:12 p.m., a local law enforcement officer appears to have left his assigned post at a building to meet a local patrol \"to let them know suspect is around the building on the side of fairgrounds,\" according to the Grassley timeline.\n\nBut by that time, Crooks was already crawling on top of the AGR building, and at 6:12 p.m. opened fire on Trump and the crowd.\n\nOriginally published by RealClear Wire", "source": {"uri": "dailysignal.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Daily Signal"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

The tense exchange highlighted concerns that the Secret Service has been unfairly persecuted for the incident.\n\nThe hearing, which took place on July 30, 2024, was part of a series of congressional hearings dedicated to the shooting that occurred on July 13 in Butler, Pennsylvania. Rowe, who became acting director of the agency after his predecessor resigned, faced tough questions from lawmakers about the Secret Service's role in the security failures that allowed the gunman, 20-year-old Thomas Matthew Crooks, to get close to Trump.\n\nDuring the hearing, Senator Hawley pressed Rowe on why no one from the Secret Service had been fired or relieved of duty in the aftermath of the assassination attempt. Rowe, visibly frustrated, played the victim, claiming that the agency was being unfairly persecuted for the incident.\n\n\"I think it's unfair to say that we're not taking this seriously or that we're not holding people accountable,\" Rowe said. \"We're doing everything we can to get to the bottom of what happened and to make sure it never happens again.\"\n\nThe Gateway Pundit reported:\n\nDuring the hearing Acting Director Rowe said it was \"unfair persecution\" to relieve officials who were responsible for the breakdown of security at the Trump Butler rally where President Trump was shot and another man was murdered.\n\nSenator Hawley: Is that the person who is in charge of the interoperability of radio frequencies between local law enforcement and secret service? Has that person been relieved of duty?\n\nActing Director Rowe: No, Senator, because interoperability is a challenge, is a greater challenge than just one person. On that day, we had a counterpart system. It failed spectacularly.\n\nSenator Hawley: As the person who decided, who made the decision to send Donald Trump onto stage knowing that you had a security situation, has that person been relieved of duty?\n\nActing Director Rowe: No, sir, they haven't.\n\nSenator Hawley: Has the person who decided not to pull the former President off of stage when you knew that, in your words, the locals were working a serious security situation, has that person been relieved of duty?\n\nActing Director Rowe: No, sir. Again, I refer you back to my original answer that we are investigating this through a mission assurance As opposed to zeroing in on one or two individuals.\n\nSenator Hawley: What more do you need to investigate to know what the decision-making process was? What more do you need to investigate to know that there were critical enough failures that some individuals ought to be held accountable? What more do you need to know?\n\nActing Director Rowe: What I need to know is exactly what happened, and I need my investigators to do their job, and I cannot- A lot of people didn't do their jobs. I cannot put my thumb on the scale.\n\nSenator Hawley: Otherwise- What do you mean put your thumb on the scale?\n\nActing Director Rowe: You're asking me, Senator, to completely make a rush to judgment about somebody failing. I acknowledge this was a failure of the secret service.\n\nSenator Hawley: Is it not prima facia that somebody has failed? The former president was shot.\n\nActing Director Rowe: Sir, this could have been our Texas schoolbook depository. I have lost sleep over that for the last 17 days, just like you have.\n\nSenator Hawley: Then fire somebody to hold them accountable.\n\nActing Director Rowe: I will tell you, Senator, that I will not rush to judgment, that people will be held accountable, and I will do so with integrity and not rush to judgment and put people unfairly persecuted.\n\nActing Director Rowe: Sir, this could have been our Texas schoolbook depository. I have lost sleep over that for the last 17 days, just like you have.\n\nSenator Hawley: Then fire somebody to hold them accountable.\n\nActing Director Rowe: I will tell you, Senator, that I will not rush to judgment, that people will be held accountable, and I will do so with integrity and not rush to judgment and put people unfairly persecuted.\n\nRowe also defended the Secret Service's actions leading up to the shooting, stating that the agency was not aware of the gunman's presence on the roof of a nearby building until it was too late. He also claimed that local law enforcement was responsible for providing security for the area where Crooks was located.\n\n\"We were relying on the local law enforcement to provide the security for that area,\" Rowe said. \"We were not aware of the individual on the roof until it was too late.\"\n\nHowever, Hawley was not satisfied with Rowe's response, accusing the Secret Service of failing to take responsibility for its failures.\n\n\"It seems to me that you're more interested in playing the victim than in taking responsibility for what happened,\" Hawley said. \"The American people deserve answers, and they deserve accountability.\"\n\nThe exchange between Rowe and Hawley highlighted the ongoing tensions between the Secret Service and Congress over the agency's handling of the assassination attempt.

Hmm.", "body": "I never for a moment bought that the Secret Service wanted Trump to get assassinated.\n\nProtection is in their blood and ingrained in their souls.\n\nBut their boss, Alejandro Mayorkas? I suspect that he would be quite happy to see Donald Trump murdered, which may explain why Trump's Secret Service team was under-resourced and unable to do its job properly.\n\nWas Mayorkas responsible for the attempted assassination's near success? I think there is a good argument that he is.\n\nJust to be clear, I don't think Mayorkas arranged a hit on Donald Trump. Even for him this would be a bridge too far.\n\nRather, he has been a key part of the campaign to demonize Trump and fully on board with ramping up the political temperature, and he likely was involved in ensuring that Trump's team was denied the resources it needed and requested to protect the once and former president.\n\nWe are all focused on the wrong target when it comes to the grotesque failures of the Secret Service, or at least we are missing the fact that the top of the chain of command for the Secret Service wasn't Kimberly Cheatle, but Alejandro Mayorkas. It is he who ultimately ran the Secret Service, and he should be held responsible.\n\nThe Acting Director after Cheatle's resignation is the man DIRECTLY responsible for setting the protection priorities that nearly got Donald Trump killed.\n\nHere is what the CURRENT Director of the Secret Service, saying that he didn't imagine that anybody wanted to harm Donald Trump.\n\nYes, that is right: Cheatle was the top boss, but the guy in charge of the protective division that failed now runs the agency. Mayorkas put him in that position, suggesting that the Secretary of Homeland Security was quite happy with his performance on July 13th.\n\nThink about that.\n\nEffective July 23, 2024, Ronald L. Rowe, Jr. serves as the Acting Director of the Secret Service. As Acting Director, he is responsible for successfully executing the agency's integrated mission of protection and investigations by leading a diverse workforce composed of more than 7,800 Special Agents, Uniformed Division Officers, Technical Law Enforcement Officers, and Administrative, Professional, and Technical personnel.\n\nPrior to this appointment, he served as Deputy Director of the Secret Service in April 2023. In this role, Mr. Rowe was responsible for the direct oversight of the agency's daily investigative and protective operations. Mr. Rowe also guided the agency's policies and was responsible for introducing state-of-the-art technologies to enhance the agency's protective countermeasures.\n\nPrior to his appointment as Deputy Director, Mr. Rowe served as the agency's Assistant Director for the Office of Intergovernmental and Legislative Affairs. He was responsible for leading the Secret Service's engagement with Congress, the Department of Homeland Security and other government partners.\n\nMr. Rowe's previous executive experience within the Secret Service includes serving as the Chief of Staff to the Director (2021), Deputy Assistant Director for the Office of Protective Operations (2018-2021) and as the Deputy Assistant Director for the Office of Intergovernmental and Legislative Affairs (2017-2018).\n\nAgain, think about that. This was the man whose job it was to directly supervise protective services and the one who denied the security resources necessary to protect Donald Trump.\n\nRowe succeeded former Secret Service Director Kimberly Cheatle, who resigned last week after bipartisan calls following her widely panned testimony before the House Oversight Committee. But both Rowe and Cheatle were directly involved in decisions denying requests for more magnetometers, additional agents, and other resources to help screen rallygoers at large, outdoor Trump campaign gatherings.\n\nIt was Rowe's decision alone to deny counter sniper teams to any Trump event outside of driving distance from D.C., these sources asserted.\n\nRowe and FBI Deputy Director Paul Abbate are set to appear Tuesday before a joint hearing of the Senate Judiciary and Homeland Security and Government Affairs committees.\n\nSenators on both sides of the aisle have vowed to press for answers on the assassination attempt of former President Trump that took the life of rally-goer Corey Comperatore and wounded two others. Sen. Richard Blumenthal, who chairs the Homeland Security panel, said he plans to grill Rowe and Abbate on the \"litany of gaps and failures.\"\n\nHe is now Director of the Secret Service, appointed by Alejandro Mayorkas. If that doesn't raise your suspicions, I am not sure what would. Alejandro Mayorkas has done more to undermine the security of the United States than any other single person. More than any foreign intelligence officer ever could.\n\nJohnson and other members of the committee are expected to focus on Rowe's role in the Secret Service's repeated denials of extra security requested by agents assigned to Trump's protective detail and about decisions regarding the number of placement of snipers assigned to some of Trump's events.\n\nAssigning counter snipers based on the ability to drive to an event may sound far-fetched, but knowledgeable sources explained that there's a limited number of these highly trained Uniform Division officers. It's easier for counter sniper teams to carry their guns and gear in a van they can all use to transport the teams to the site for advance work for the event and then use the same vehicles, referred to by the Secret Service as \"push vehicles,\" to return to D.C.\n\nAnd he is the guy whose sole responsibility is protecting the country and also presidential candidates...like Donald Trump.\n\nCongress, of course, should press forward with a comprehensive investigation into the failures that led to the murder and wounding of civilians on July 13th and the shooting of President Trump, but it should put special focus on Mayorkas' role in the running of the Secret Service.\n\nHe is, after all, the big boss responsible for running it. He is the one who has promoted the man most responsible for allowing it to happen to the slot of Director.

Some of these comments, if ultimately attributable to the shooter, appear to reflect antisemitic and anti-immigration themes, to espouse political violence and are described as extreme in nature.\"\n\nCrooks, 20, killed one man, seriously injured two others and grazed Trump's ear. Abbate said that while the FBI has treated the incident as an attempted assassination and act of domestic terrorism from the outset, the shooter's motive remains unknown.\n\nThe apparent failure of law enforcement to prevent the shooting prompted the resignation last week of U.S. Secret Service director Kimberly Cheatle after she faced withering, bipartisan criticism from House lawmakers.\n\nOne criticism of Cheatle was that in the nine days between the shooting and her resignation, she had not visited the crime scene. Acting Secret Service director Ronald Rowe, who also testified at Tuesday's hearing, said one of his first acts on taking up the role was to go to the rooftop crime scene.\n\n\"I laid in a prone position to evaluate his line of sight,\" he said. \"What I saw made me ashamed. As a career law-enforcement officer and a 25-year veteran with the Secret Service, I cannot defend why that roof was not better secured.\"\n\nIn his testimony, Abbate described Crooks's actions leading up to the shooting and how law enforcement had identified him as a suspicious person nearly two hours before he fired eight shots from a rooftop near the rally, including the one that struck the former president.\n\n\"On July 6, the shooter registered to attend the rally and performed a search for 'How far was Oswald from Kennedy?'\" Abbate said. \"On July 7, the shooter traveled from his home to the Butler farm show grounds and remained there for approximately 20 minutes. We assess this shows advanced planning and reconnaissance on his part.\"\n\n\"The first reported sighting of the shooter by local law enforcement was at approximately 4:26 p.m. At approximately 5:10 p.m., the shooter was again identified by local law enforcement as a suspicious person around the AGR building.\"\n\n\"Recently discovered video from a local business shows the shooter pulling himself up onto the AGR building rooftop at approximately 6:06 p.m.,\" he continued. \"At approximately 6:08 p.m., the subject was observed on the roof by local law enforcement. At approximately 6:11 p.m., a local police officer was lifted to the roof by another officer, saw the shooter and radioed that he was armed with 'a long gun.' Within approximately the next 30 seconds, the shots were fired.\"\n\nMultiple investigations into the assassination attempt, including a bipartisan House task force whose members were announced on Monday, remain ongoing.", "source": {"uri": "tjvnews.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Jewish Voice"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Secret_Service", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "United States Secret Service"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_Abbate", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Paul Abbate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Director_of_the_Federal_Bureau_of_Investigation", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Director of the Federal Bureau of Investigation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Opposition_to_immigration", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Opposition to immigration"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Law_enforcement", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Law enforcement"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Political_violence", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Political violence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antisemitism", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Antisemitism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Judiciary", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Judiciary"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Senate", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States Senate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Department_of_Homeland_Security", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States Department of Homeland Security"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ronald_Rowe", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Ronald Rowe"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kimberly_Cheatle", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Kimberly Cheatle"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domestic_terrorism", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Domestic terrorism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Attempted_assassination_of_Ronald_Reagan", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Attempted assassination of Ronald Reagan"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bipartisanship", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Bipartisanship"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Bureau_of_Investigation", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Federal Bureau of Investigation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reconnaissance", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Reconnaissance"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_F._Kennedy", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "John F.

Some of these comments, if ultimately attributable to the shooter, appear to reflect antisemitic and anti-immigration themes, to espouse political violence and are described as extreme in nature.\"\n\nCrooks, 20, killed one man, seriously injured two others and grazed Trump's ear. Abbate said that while the FBI has treated the incident as an attempted assassination and act of domestic terrorism from the outset, the shooter's motive remains unknown.\n\nThe apparent failure of law enforcement to prevent the shooting prompted the resignation last week of U.S. Secret Service director Kimberly Cheatle after she faced withering, bipartisan criticism from House lawmakers.\n\nOne criticism of Cheatle was that in the nine days between the shooting and her resignation, she had not visited the crime scene. Acting Secret Service director Ronald Rowe, who also testified at Tuesday's hearing, said one of his first acts on taking up the role was to go to the rooftop crime scene.\n\n\"I laid in a prone position to evaluate his line of sight,\" he said. \"What I saw made me ashamed. As a career law-enforcement officer and a 25-year veteran with the Secret Service, I cannot defend why that roof was not better secured.\"\n\nIn his testimony, Abbate described Crooks's actions leading up to the shooting and how law enforcement had identified him as a suspicious person nearly two hours before he fired eight shots from a rooftop near the rally, including the one that struck the former president.\n\n\"On July 6, the shooter registered to attend the rally and performed a search for 'How far was Oswald from Kennedy?'\" Abbate said. \"On July 7, the shooter traveled from his home to the Butler farm show grounds and remained there for approximately 20 minutes. We assess this shows advanced planning and reconnaissance on his part.\"\n\n\"The first reported sighting of the shooter by local law enforcement was at approximately 4:26 p.m. At approximately 5:10 p.m., the shooter was again identified by local law enforcement as a suspicious person around the AGR building.\"\n\n\"Recently discovered video from a local business shows the shooter pulling himself up onto the AGR building rooftop at approximately 6:06 p.m.,\" he continued. \"At approximately 6:08 p.m., the subject was observed on the roof by local law enforcement. At approximately 6:11 p.m., a local police officer was lifted to the roof by another officer, saw the shooter and radioed that he was armed with 'a long gun.'

In partnership with the Senate Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee (HSGAC), the committees will hear testimony from U.S. Secret Service (USSS) and Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) officials.\n\nKey Quotes:\n\n\"This assassination attempt has exposed more than just the continued threat of gun violence in America. It has also revealed unacceptable security failures in the operations of the United States Secret Service.\"\n\n\"Despite the implementation of a security plan to secure the rally site on July 13, the shooter involved was able to fly a drone outside of the security perimeter for 11 minutes. His suspicious activity was reported twice, and he was spotted on the roof of a building prior to taking his first shot -- yet his violent plan continued unimpeded, and he was able to fire eight shots before a Secret Service countersniper killed him.\"\n\n\"The implications are terrifying, when a mere two days after the shooting, the Secret Service needed to secure the Republican National Convention in Milwaukee. And in less than a month, the Secret Service must secure the Democratic National Convention in Chicago, in our home state of Illinois.\"\n\n\"Between now and November 5, Vice President Harris and former President Trump will hold countless political events with thousands of Americans across the country. The Secret Service will need to secure all of these major events, but the agency needs first to restore our trust in its ability to do so.\"\n\n\"During this hearing, we will hear from Acting U.S. Secret Service Director Ronald Rowe about the security failures on July 13 and what the Secret Service is doing to rectify those issues. We will also hear from FBI Deputy Director Paul Abbate, who will provide an update on the FBI's investigation into the assassination attempt.\"\n\n\"There are many questions which the American public deserves answers to, including:\n\n\"There is an urgent need for bipartisan collaboration in Congress to provide these answers to the American people as soon as possible, so that the Secret Service can begin to rebuild trust and more effectively fulfill its mission. The work has already begun, and tomorrow's joint hearing will help bring about transparency and accountability for Secret Service failures in Butler on July 13.\"\n\n\"The hearing is a joint hearing of the two committees, and it is bipartisan ... Partisanship has nothing to do with keeping our elected officials and those running for office in a safe mode throughout their conduct ... Political violence and vandalism is never, ever acceptable.\"\n\nLast week, Durbin announced the joint Judiciary-HSGAC hearing in a speech on the Senate floor.\n\nThe hearing follows a joint briefing on Thursday, July 25 for the Committees with USSS and FBI, where the agencies assured Senators that they will do everything in their power to ensure proper coordination with local and state authorities and address all potential vulnerabilities at the Democratic National Convention in Chicago, among other things. The Judiciary Committee has jurisdiction and oversight authority over the United States Secret Service and the Federal Bureau of Investigation.", "source": {"uri": "foreignaffairs.co.nz", "dataType":

Chuck Grassley (R-Iowa) today pressed Secret Service Acting Director Ronald Rowe about the failed vetting and communications procedures that led to the near-assassination of former President Trump.\n\nRowe admitted to Grassley that he \"had no explanation\" for some of the Secret Service's shortcomings at the July 13 campaign rally in Butler, Pennsylvania. He additionally committed to improving certain agency procedures and providing transparent updates to Congress and the American people.\n\nGrassley: \"Mr. Rowe, in your written testimony, you stated that to prevent similar lapses like the one on July 13 from happening again, you'll ensure every event site's security plan is thoroughly vetted by multiple experienced supervisors before it's implemented. Based on your testimony, the security plan for the Butler event deviated from the [Secret Service's] standards. How would vetting by multiple experienced supervisors fix that?\"\n\nRowe affirmed that \"having many eyes on a particular problem set helps\" prevent the Secret Service from having \"tunnel vision\" when assessing and staffing an event.\n\nGrassley: \"In your written testimony, you stated that you 'regret that information wasn't passed to Congress and the public sooner and with greater frequency.' What's your communication plan going forward to ensure that the American people and Congress are fully informed?\"\n\nRowe testified that the Secret Service has begun providing rolling productions to Congress with updates on its investigation of the assassination attempt. He added, \"My view is that sunshine is the best disinfectant. We intend to provide information to Congress as it carries out its oversight function.\"\n\nGrassley plans to follow up with the Secret Service to ensure all members of Congress receive access to the productions, not just committee chairs and ranking members.\n\nRowe stated the Secret Service's failure to detect the shooter's drone has \"cost [him] a lot of sleep.\" Had the Secret Service's Counter UAS platform been operational, Rowe noted, Secret Service might have been able to geo-locate the drone and intervene before the shooter proceeded with his assassination plot. This failure, Rowe said, \"is something that I have struggled with to understand. And I have no explanation for it. It is something that I feel as though we could have perhaps found him. We could have maybe stopped him.\"\n\nTo ensure the Secret Service's Counter UAS platform remains fully operational going forward, Rowe committed to leveraging Department of Homeland Security resources to provide the Secret Service guaranteed connectivity.", "source": {"uri": "foreignaffairs.co.nz", "dataType": "news", "title": "foreignaffairs.co.nz"}, "authors": [{"uri": "mil_osi_publisher@foreignaffairs.co.nz", "name": "Mil-Osi Publisher", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chuck_Grassley", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Chuck Grassley"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Secret_Service", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "United States Secret Service"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Congress", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "United States Congress"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Butler,_Pennsylvania", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Butler, Pennsylvania"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Butler, Pennsylvania"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ronald_Rowe", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Ronald Rowe"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Senate", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States Senate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iowa", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Iowa"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Iowa"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unmanned_aerial_vehicle", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Unmanned aerial vehicle"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Attempted_assassination_of_Ronald_Reagan", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Attempted assassination of Ronald Reagan"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assassination_of_John_F._Kennedy", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Assassination of John F.

I have conveyed these thoughts to not only supervisors (to include the current Captain of CS, but those responsible for training us (SOTS/CS). Only to be brushed off as those with less experience somehow knew more than me.\"\n\n\"The team I was once proud to be a part of, is something I have to somehow hide as I move into my next career,\" the counter sniper continued. \"Who wants to hire a USSS CS guy who failed? That's the public perception I'm not faced with. The USSS CS team is a stain I will never be able to cleanse.\"\n\nHe concluded with these two lines: \"The motto of the USSS...CYA. And every supervisor is doing it right now.\"\n\nThe agency quickly deleted the email, a knowledgeable source told RealClearPolitics.\n\nActing Secret Service Director Ronald Rowe was directly involved in denying additional security resources and personnel, including counter snipers, to former President Trump's rallies and events -- despite repeated requests by the agents assigned to Trump's detail in the two years leading up to his July 13 attempted assassination, according to several sources familiar with the decision-making.\n\nRowe succeeded former Secret Service Director Kimberly Cheatle, who resigned last week after bipartisan calls following her widely panned testimony before the House Oversight Committee. But both Rowe and Cheatle were directly involved in decisions denying requests for more magnetometers, additional agents, and other resources to help screen rallygoers at large, outdoor Trump campaign gatherings.\n\nIt was Rowe's decision alone to deny counter sniper teams to any Trump event outside of driving distance from D.C., these sources asserted.\n\n\"I believe that the Secret Service leadership made a political decision to deny these requests. And I think the Biden administration has been suffused with partisan politics,\" Cruz said. \"Did the same person who denied the request for additional security to President Trump also repeatedly deny the requests for security to Robert F. Kennedy Jr., whose father was murdered by an assassin and whose uncle was murdered by an assassin? Did the same person make that decision?\"\n\n\"Senator, what I will tell you is that Secret Service agents are not political,\" Rowe responded.\n\nIndependent presidential candidate Robert F. Kennedy Jr. did not receive Secret Service protection from Biden until after the Trump assassination attempt, despite requesting it beforehand.\n\nCruz asserted the leadership Biden appointed is \"political.\"\n\n\"I have a simple question: yes or no. Did the same person deny the Trump request that also denied the RFK request? That's a yes or no question,\" he said.\n\n\"Senator, that is not a yes or no question. One, there's a process for a candidate nominee to receive protection,\" Rowe responded. \"That is a bicameral, bipartisan process.\"\n\n...\n\nSecret Service whistleblowers said there were limited resources to protect Trump due to the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) summit in Washington, D.C, and First Lady Jill Biden's campaign rally in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, the Daily Caller reported.\n\n\"What was the relative size of the Trump detail compared to the detail that is assigned to the President and the First Lady?\" Cruz asked later in the hearing.\n\n\"Senator, the former president travels with a full shift, just like the president,\" he said.\n\nCruz asked him to clarify if it was \"the exact same size.\"\n\n\"On the day of, in Butler, the agents surrounding him, it is the same number of agents surrounding the president today,\" Rowe said.\n\nCruz interrupted to clarify his use of the word \"president,\" asking again if \"it is [his] testimony that in Butler, Pennsylvania, Donald Trump had the same number of agents protecting him that Joe Biden has at a [comparable] event.\" Rowe insisted he was \"trying to answer.\"\n\n\"You are not answering it. Is it the same number of agents or not?\" Cruz asked, later asking \"how many more agents\" Biden has than Trump.\n\n\"Sir, you are refusing to answer straight,\" Cruz said. \"Sir, stop interrupting me. Stop interrupting me. You are refusing to answer clear and direct questions. I am asking the relative difference in the number of agents between those assigned to Donald Trump and those assigned to Joe Biden. I'm not asking why you assign more to Joe Biden.\"\n\nSusan Crabtree\n\n@susancrabtree\n\nFinally! @TedCruz asks why the Secret Service spokesman still has his job after he lied to the press and the public in the 48 hours after the assassination attempt against Trump and no longer has credibility.\n\nThe spokesperson specifically lied about reports that the Secret Service denied more security requests for Trump.\n\nCruz: \"Your spokesperson put something out that is false on its face, by the way, did you approve this statement when it went out?\n\nRowe: \"I don't know if I did or didn't.\n\nCruz: \"Is this spokesperson, is he still employed?\n\nRowe indicates that he is.\n\nCruz: \"So he lied on behalf of the Secret Service? He still has a job? Did your predecessor, the former director, did she approve this statement?\"\n\nRowe: \"Senator, our comms team sends out statements. They do de-conflict them, and they put them out.\"\n\nCruz: \"Did she approve this statement?\"\n\nRowe: \"I don't know if she did or did not...I don't recall approving it, senator.\"\n\nWas Mayorkas responsible for the attempted assassination's near success? I think there is a good argument that he is.\n\nJust to be clear, I don't think Mayorkas arranged a hit on Donald Trump. Even for him this would be a bridge too far.\n\nRather, he has been a key part of the campaign to demonize Trump and fully on board with ramping up the political temperature, and he likely was involved in ensuring that Trump's team was denied the resources it needed and requested to protect the once and former president.\n\nWe are all focused on the wrong target when it comes to the grotesque failures of the Secret Service, or at least we are missing the fact that the top of the chain of command for the Secret Service wasn't Kimberly Cheatle, but Alejandro Mayorkas. It is he who ultimately ran the Secret Service, and he should be held responsible.\n\nThe Acting Director after Cheatle's resignation is the man DIRECTLY responsible for setting the protection priorities that nearly got Donald Trump killed.\n\nRowe testified before the U.S. Senate Judiciary Committee on Tuesday about the handling of the assassination attempt during a July 13 rally in Butler, Pennsylvania. Hawley pressed Rowe on the lack of firings that occurred over the failures to surveil the rooftop where the would-be assassin, Thomas Matthew Crooks, opened fire.\n\n\"You're asking me, senator, to completely make a rush to judgment about somebody failing. I acknowledge, this was a failure--\" Rowe said during the questioning.\n\n\"Is it not prima facie that somebody has failed? The former president was shot!\" Hawley interjected.\n\nRowe said he has \"lost sleep\" over the handling of the assassination attempt since the incident occurred, and assured Hawley that he would hold people accountable \"with integrity\" and not \"rush to judgement.\"\n\n\"Then fire somebody to hold them accountable!\" Hawley shouted.\n\n\"And I will do so with integrity and not rush to judgment and put people unfairly persecuted,\" Rowe said.", "source": {"uri": "acecomments.mu.nu", "dataType": "news", "title": "acecomments.mu.nu"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Attempted_assassination_of_Ronald_Reagan", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Attempted assassination of Ronald Reagan"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Czechoslovakia", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Czechoslovakia"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Czechoslovakia"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Serbia and montenegro"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Biden", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assassination", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Assassination"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RealClearPolitics", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "RealClearPolitics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sniper", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Sniper"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Secret_Service", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "United States Secret Service"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Senate", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "United States Senate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Butler,_Pennsylvania", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Butler, Pennsylvania"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Butler, Pennsylvania"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Captain_(United_States_O-3)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Captain (United States O-3)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_F._Kennedy_Jr.", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Robert F.

Deputy FBI Director Paul Abbate also appeared before the Committee on Tuesday.\n\nOn July 13, Crooks, 20, was identified as the individual who shot at the former president at a campaign rally while he was on stage, injuring his ear in an assassination attempt. Crooks was later killed by the Secret Service while one rally attendee also died and two others were in critical condition.\n\nDuring the hearing, Abbate explained to Senators that the FBI discovered two different social media accounts that they believe may belong to Crooks. According to Abbate, one account shared \"antisemitic\" topics and thoughts, but a second account on the platform Gab, shared \"differing points of view.\"\n\n\"While the investigative team is still working to verify this account to determine if it did in fact belong to the shooter, we believe it important to share and note it today, particularly given the general absence of other information to date from social media and other sources of information that reflect on the shooter's potential motive and mindset,\" Abbate said during the hearing, while speaking about the social media accounts.\n\nHowever, in a post to X, formerly Twitter on Tuesday, Gab CEO Andrew Torba said, \"The FBI is now claiming that the Trump shooter Thomas Matthew Crooks had an unspecified 'social media account' in 2019/2020 (when he was 14/15 years old) that posted 'anti-immigrant and anti-semitic' content.\"\n\n\"This is not consistent with Gab's understanding of the shooter's motives based on an Emergency Disclosure Request (\"EDR\") we received from the FBI last week for the Gab account 'EpicMicrowave' which, based on the content of that EDR, the FBI appeared to think belonged to Thomas Crooks,\" Torba said. \"The story is this: the account for which data was requested was, UNEQUIVOCALLY, pro-Biden and in particular pro-Biden's immigration policy.\"\n\n\"To the best of Gab's knowledge, as of 2021, Crooks was a pro-lockdown, pro-immigration, left-wing Joe Biden supporter,\" Torba added in his post.\n\nRowe recently took over as acting Secret Service Director after Kimberly Cheatle resigned from the role. Cheatle faced widespread calls to step down following the shooting, with many criticizing her for the shooting.", "source": {"uri": "newsweek.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Newsweek"}, "authors": [{"uri": "matthew_impelli@newsweek.com", "name": "Matthew Impelli", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Garth_Crooks", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Garth Crooks"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_media", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Social media"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gab_(social_network)", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Gab (social network)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Secret_Service", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "United States Secret Service"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thomas_Crooks", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Thomas Crooks"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_Abbate", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Paul Abbate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Director_of_the_Federal_Bureau_of_Investigation", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Director of the Federal Bureau of Investigation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Senate_Committee_on_the_Judiciary", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States Senate Committee on the Judiciary"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assassination", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Assassination"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Bureau_of_Investigation", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Federal Bureau of Investigation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Butler,_Pennsylvania", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Butler, Pennsylvania"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Butler, Pennsylvania"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antisemitism", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Antisemitism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Senate", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United States Senate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kimberly_Cheatle", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Kimberly Cheatle"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Opposition_to_immigration", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Opposition to immigration"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Biden", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immigration", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Immigration"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Left-wing_politics", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Left-wing politics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twitter", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Twitter"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Torba_Province", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Torba Province"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Torba Province"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Vanuatu"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society", "label": "dmoz/Society", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Activism", "label": "dmoz/Society/Activism", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Death/Suicide", "label": "dmoz/Society/Death/Suicide", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 85}], "image": "https://d.newsweek.com/en/full/2439427/paul-abbate.webp?w=1600&h=900&q=88&f=6b817d756ea09aff79e9382fda7cdd30", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9772518", "eventUri": "eng-9772518", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-07-13", "textStart": 349, "textEnd": 356, "freq": 2}], "sentiment": -0.09019607843137256, "wgt": 129, "relevance": 1}

Ted Cruz (R-TX) got his turn to ask questions. The exchange descended into a shouting match as Cruz eviscerated the acting director for his failed decisions -- including his refusal to provide more security despite the Trump team repeatedly requesting it.\n\n\"I believe that the Secret Service leadership made a political decision to deny these requests. And I think the Biden administration has been suffused with partisan politics,\" Cruz said. \"Did the same person who denied the request for additional security to President Trump also repeatedly deny the requests for security to Robert F. Kennedy Jr., whose father was murdered by an assassin and whose uncle was murdered by an assassin? Did the same person make that decision?\"\n\n\"Senator, what I will tell you is that Secret Service agents are not political,\" Rowe responded.\n\nWatch:\n\nCruz wasn't buying it. He grew increasingly exasperated as Rowe continued to duck the questions. Things got really heated toward the end of this lengthy exchange:\n\nCruz: By the way, is it true that on the day of the Butler event, that Secret Service transferred agents from President Trump to the First Lady?\n\nRowe: No, sir, that's not true.\n\nCruz: That's been widely reported.\n\nRowe: It's not true. There was one airport agent that actually went on the manpower request for the Trump detail. They handled the arrival at the airport for the First Lady.\n\nCruz: What is the rally? What was the relative size of the Trump detail compared to the detail that is assigned to the president or the First lady?\n\nRowe: Senator, the former president travels with a full shift, just like the president.\n\nCruz: What's the, so, the exact same size. Is that your testimony, that President Trump had the same size detail that President [Joe Biden] has?\n\nRowe: On the day of in Butler, the agents surrounding him, it is the same number of agents surrounding the president today. There is a difference between a sitting president who also not only --\n\nCruz: Hold on, you're using \"president\" in a way that is not clear. Is it your testimony that in Butler, Pennsylvania, Donald Trump had the same number of agents protecting him that Joe Biden has at a comparable event?\n\nRowe: I'm telling you the shift, the close protection shifts surrounding --\n\nCruz: That's a yes or no.\n\nIt's at this point, at the 6:34 mark of the above clip, that Cruz's frustration grows and he really lets loose on Rowe:\n\nRowe: That's what you asked me, Senator, and I'm trying to answer it.\n\nCruz: You are not answering it! Is it the same number of agents or not?\n\nRowe: Senator, there is a difference between the sitting president of the United States --\n\nCruz: What's the difference?\n\nRowe: The difference?\n\nCruz: 2X, 3X, 5X, 10X?\n\nRowe: National command authority to launch a nuclear strike, sir, there are other assets --\n\nCruz: How many more agents?\n\nRowe: That travel with the president that --\n\nCruz: Sir! sir!\n\nRowe: The former president will not get --\n\nCruz: Well, you're refusing to answer the --\n\nRowe: Number of secret service agents protecting him --\n\nCruz: Stop interrupting! Stop interrupting me!\n\nRowe: Go ahead, Senator.\n\nCruz: You are refusing to answer clear and direct questions. I am asking the relative difference in the number of agents between those assigned to Donald Trump and those assigned to Joe Biden. I'm not asking why you assigned more to Joe Biden! I'm asking is the difference, is it 2X, is it 3X, is it 5X, is it 10X?\n\nRowe: Senator, I will get you that number so you can see it with your own eyes.\n\nRough day for Rowe: Josh Hawley Wrecks Acting Secret Service Director Over Agency's Trump Assassination Attempt Posturing\n\nREPORT: Acting Secret Service Director 'Played Key Role' in Denying Extra Resources for Trump Rallies\n\nActing Secret Service Director 'Ashamed' Roof Unsecured in Trump Assassination Attempt -- 'Cannot Defend'\n\nThe more that is learned about the Secret Service's failures to prevent the attack, the worse they look.

Ted Cruz rebuked acting Secret Service Director Ronald Rowe Jr. on Tuesday for not answering his questions.\n\nRowe testified during a Senate Judiciary Committee hearing on the assassination attempt against former President Donald Trump after U.S. Secret Service Director Kimberly Cheatle recently resigned her role following her own evasive testimony before Congress. Cruz accused the acting director of not directly answering questions about decision-making in the agency and the number of agents Trump has compared to President Joe Biden.\n\nWATCH:\n\n\"I believe that the Secret Service leadership made a political decision to deny these requests.

Did the same person make that decision?\"\n\n\"Senator, what I will tell you is that Secret Service agents are not political,\" Rowe responded.\n\nIndependent presidential candidate Robert F.

Today was really a terrible, horrible, no good, very bad day for acting Secret Service Director Ronald Rowe, appearing before the United States Senate.\n\nTwitchy has already reported how Senators Ted Cruz and Mike Lee tore Rowe a new ... uhhh ... opening for lying to Congress, hiding information, and not being forthcoming in any of his answers about the attempted assassination of Donald Trump on July 13 in Pennsylvania. Rand Paul got into it as well, laying into the Secret Service for its 'monumental failure.'\n\nTo all that, we say: Good.\n\nEven though Rowe has only been acting director for a few days, since the disgraceful resignation of Kim Cheatle, Jill Biden's handpicked selection for Secret Service director, it's not as though he just fell out of a coconut tree into the job. He was previously the Deputy Director, Assistant Director, and held various other senior political positions over 25 years.\n\nWhen it came time for Senator Josh Hawley to question Rowe, he focused on one glaringly obvious question: Why has no one lost their job for this abject failure?\n\nWatch:\n\nAs he did with the other senators, Rowe tried all of the usual bureaucratic deflections. 'It's an ongoing investigation.' 'We have to follow protocols.' Et cetera.\n\nHawley wasn't buying any of it. Rowe claimed to have lost sleep, to which Hawley yelled back, 'Then FIRE somebody!'\n\nBut it was when Rowe tried to claim that he and the Secret Service were being 'persecuted' that Hawley brought some real thunder: 'Unfairly persecuted? People are DEAD!'\n\nNo one in the deep state ever feels like they should be accountable. And after the last four years, why should they? As Joe Biden has refused to acknowledge any failures, including the Afghanistan withdrawal, not one person has been fired from his administration.\n\n... then there is no chain of command.\n\nWhen you have trouble figuring out who is accountable after 17 days, it means no one was accountable.\n\nIf I was running the agency, I would definitely know who was accountable within a few days at the most.\n\nBureaucrats are used to moving at the speed of Washington. But that is not going to fly this time.\n\nAt the end of this exchange, Hawley embarrassed Rowe by telling him that the Senate is learning more from whistleblowers than from him. When Rowe tried to respond that he has been 'transparent and forthcoming,' Hawley wasn't having that either, 'Your agency has NOT been transparent and forthcoming, so please, let's not go there.'\n\nRowe tried to defend himself by claiming he is not a political appointee, but that is not true either (and Hawley told him so). As Mike Davis of the Internet Accountability Project pointed out, Rowe is a political appointee and (mostly) a career bureaucrat.\n\nIn addition to all of that, Rowe did serve as part of George W. Bush's protective detail and we have no reason to believe he didn't fulfill those responsibilities honorably.\n\nBut he is not a field agent now, and he can't hide behind the false veneer of being a 'non-partisan law enforcement officer.'\n\nNo one was buying that defense, least of all Hawley.\n\nInsane, but all too predictable in the Washington, DC, swamp.\n\nThis is why the stonewalling is dangerous. You don't have to be a wild conspiracy theorist to start asking questions when the people who failed don't provide any answers and suffer no consequences.\n\nUnfortunately, this was a common theme on the right. For all the fire and brimstone from Ted Cruz, Mike Lee, Rand Paul, and Josh Hawley today, people are concerned that ultimately, there will be no punishment for the Secret Service's failure.\n\nThe reality is that if House Republicans can unite, they could withhold funding from the Secret Service pending a swift outcome to the investigation and people losing their jobs. But there is not much that the Senate can do except get everything on the record. They can't really even hold up other executive nominations from Biden if the Democrats are united.\n\nBut all that means is that conservatives need to get fired up. Vote. And get others to vote.

Tuesday, Fox News host Jesse Watters ran through the latest revelations that included an email distributed throughout the U.S. Secret Service Uniform Division demanding his supervisors be given the boot to prevent another tragedy.\n\n\"A Secret Service counter-sniper is predicting another assassination attempt before November. In an email obtained by RealClearPolitics, a Secret Service agent with 20 years' experience on the counter-sniper team is announcing he's going to blow the whistle until all of his supervisors are fired,\" explained Watters. \"The counter-sniper says his mission is to prevent another JFK-style assassination, and the only reason that hasn't happened is because they've gotten lucky.\"\n\n\"He says Secret Service leadership is corrupt and states clearly, 'We all should expect another assassination attempt to happen before November. We've exposed our inability to protect our leaders due to our leadership,'\" the \"Jesse Watters Primetime\" host went on. \"After this email went public, it was wiped off the Secret Service servers. There's a massive cover-up underway, and it's spilled over into Congress.\"\n\nRCP national political correspondent Susan Crabtree shared the email on social media and noted how Tennessee Sen. Marsha Blackburn (R) had challenged Acting Secret Service Director Ronald Rowe about it during a Tuesday hearing.\n\nWhen asked why it was deleted, the fill-in for resigned USSS Director Kimberly Cheatle said, \"I'll look, I'll get back to you on that [question of why the] agency deleted the email,\" and contended he was \"committed to being a change agent.\"\n\nAs Watters contrasted the conflicting reports of the Secret Service with that of the Beaver County SWAT team on instructions to cover the roof where the would-be assassin had fired from, he also shared testimony from Rowe regarding the agency not using a drone or handling the suspect's use of one prior to the rally.\n\n\"You had a drone system but you had bandwidth problems,\" said Texas Sen. John Cornyn (R). \"The bandwidth apparently was adequate for the shooter's drone but not for the Secret Service. Can you explain that?\"\n\n\"I have no explanation for it, sir,\" said Rowe who went on, \"People fly drones all the time on the peripheries of our sites, and we go out and we talk to them and we ascertain what their intentions are. On this day in particular, because of the connectivity challenge, as you noted, there was a delay and he flew his drone at 3:51 approximately.\"\n\nMeanwhile, as FBI Deputy Director Paul Abbate contended, by Watters analysis, that the suspect \"wrote right-wing things online,\" that included \"antisemitic and anti-immigration themes to espouse political violence.\" The host reminded that the CEO of Gab said the would-be assassin had an account on the platform where he defended President Joe Biden's policies on the border and COVID mandates.\n\nBuilding to a pivotal question about accountability, Watters shared some of the tense exchange between Rowe and Missouri Sen. Josh Hawley (R) where the acting director refused to provide the name of the official in charge the day of the Trump rally.\n\n\"Senator, I cannot give you that name,\" asserted Rowe. \"This person is operational. They're still doing investigations. They're still doing protective visits.\"\n\nHawley made clear that he knew the name of the supervisor as he sought to get the director on the record and Watters had some follow-up questions of his own on what the Secret Service is up to.\n\n\"Why hasn't the Secret Service site supervisor for the Butler rally been suspended? Why is he still in charge of protecting politicians? Why isn't he under investigation? They're keeping him around to help do the investigation? Are they going to keep him around for Trump's next Butler rally? And the senators know the guy's name. Why hasn't the Senate subpoenaed the Secret Service site supervisor for Butler?\" wondered the host. \"That's the guy who they should drag in to testify under oath about what happened, not these squirrelly bureaucrats.\"\n\n\"Why is everybody protecting this guy? Who is this guy?\" he asked. \"The politicians won't even tell us what the guy's name is. Something stinks, and you know what I'm talking about.\"\n\nWe have no tolerance for comments containing violence, racism, profanity, vulgarity, doxing, or discourteous behavior.

Ted Cruz rebuked acting Secret Service Director Ronald Rowe Jr. on Tuesday for not answering his questions.\n\nRowe testified during a Senate Judiciary Committee hearing on the assassination attempt against former President Donald Trump after U.S. Secret Service Director Kimberly Cheatle recently resigned her role following her own evasive testimony before Congress. Cruz accused the acting director of not directly answering questions about decision-making in the agency and the number of agents Trump has compared to President Joe Biden. (RELATED: Security Had Reportedly Been Stationed On Rooftop Used By Trump Rally Shooter, But Abandoned It Due To 'Hot Weather')\n\n\"I believe that the Secret Service leadership made a political decision to deny these requests. And I think the Biden administration has been suffused with partisan politics,\" Cruz said. \"Did the same person who denied the request for additional security to President Trump also repeatedly deny the requests for security to Robert F. Kennedy Jr., whose father was murdered by an assassin and whose uncle was murdered by an assassin? Did the same person make that decision?\"\n\n\"Senator, what I will tell you is that Secret Service agents are not political,\" Rowe responded.\n\nIndependent presidential candidate Robert F. Kennedy Jr. did not receive Secret Service protection from Biden until after the Trump assassination attempt, despite requesting it beforehand.\n\nCruz asserted the leadership Biden appointed is \"political.\"\n\n\"I have a simple question: yes or no. Did the same person deny the Trump request that also denied the RFK request? That's a yes or no question,\" he said.\n\n\"Senator, that is not a yes or no question. One, there's a process for a candidate nominee to receive protection,\" Rowe responded. \"That is a bicameral, bipartisan process.\"\n\nCruz told Rowe his use of the word \"bicameral\" is inaccurate because he's not in Congress as the two talked over each other.\n\nSecret Service whistleblowers said there were limited resources to protect Trump due to the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) summit in Washington, D.C, and First Lady Jill Biden's campaign rally in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, the Daily Caller reported.\n\n\"What was the relative size of the Trump detail compared to the detail that is assigned to the President and the First Lady?\" Cruz asked later in the hearing.\n\n\"Senator, the former president travels with a full shift, just like the president,\" he said.\n\nCruz asked him to clarify if it was \"the exact same size.\"\n\n\"On the day of, in Butler, the agents surrounding him, it is the same number of agents surrounding the president today,\" Rowe said.\n\nCruz interrupted to clarify his use of the word \"president,\" asking again if \"it is [his] testimony that in Butler, Pennsylvania, Donald Trump had the same number of agents protecting him that Joe Biden has at a [comparable] event.\" Rowe insisted he was \"trying to answer.\"\n\n\"You are not answering it. Is it the same number of agents or not?\" Cruz asked, later asking \"how many more agents\" Biden has than Trump.\n\n\"Sir, you are refusing to answer straight,\" Cruz said. \"Sir, stop interrupting me. Stop interrupting me. You are refusing to answer clear and direct questions. I am asking the relative difference in the number of agents between those assigned to Donald Trump and those assigned to Joe Biden. I'm not asking why you assign more to Joe Biden.\"\n\nRowe told Cruz he will provide him with the number so he can view it with his \"own eyes.\"\n\nAll content created by the Daily Caller News Foundation, an independent and nonpartisan newswire service, is available without charge to any legitimate news publisher that can provide a large audience.

That's part of the problem.\"\n\nRepublican Texas Sen. Ted Cruz accused Rowe of not directly answering questions regarding decision-making in the Secret Service and the number of agents Trump has compared to President Joe Biden. Cruz eventually told the acting director to \"stop interrupting\" him as he loudly talked over the senator.\n\nStarapoli also called for a \"housecleaning\" of the Secret Service.\n\n\"The director of the Secret Service did not put on anywhere near the performance that she should have two weeks ago.

She should have resigned rather than sit there and make the situation worse. Instead, she quit yesterday.\n\nTrump thankfully survived, but rallygoer Corey Comperatore died, as did a lot of the agency's credibility and Cheatle's reputation.\n\nCheatle said in her opening statement: \"The Secret Service's solemn mission is to protect our nation's leaders. On July 13, we failed. As the director of the United States Secret Service, I take full responsibility for any security lapse.\" At that point she should have announced that she was leaving her job.\n\nThe rancor at her was appropriately bipartisan, as she either refused or was unable to answer basic questions about how the assassin with a bulky AR-15 got on the roof and managed to fire eight shots; about why warnings from rallygoers were not heeded about the man on the roof; about how after local law enforcement knew about the suspicious person on the roof, Trump wasn't removed from the stage; about the failure of the Secret Service, which is the lead agency, to coordinate more effectively with other law enforcement to secure the area and the perimeter with clear sightlines to the podium that Trump was using.\n\nWhen Monday's hearing ended, the Republican Chairman James Comer and Ranking Democrat Jamie Raskin wrote a joint letter calling for Cheatle to resign. She didn't, but waited until the next morning to pack it in, as Speaker Mike Johnson and Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries teamed up to present a bipartisan task force to investigate the Trump shooting. That special new panel, with seven Republicans and six Democrats, will hopefully use its subpoena authority to get some answers.\n\nBeside the particulars of the July 13 assassination attempt, of which the FBI is conducting a full review, does the Secret Service need more money, more agents and officers, more equipment, more authority? Do the policies and procedures need to be changed? Emptying out Cheatle's office is not going to be enough if her replacement has the same approach.\n\nThe job of director is appointed by the president, without Senate confirmation. There is now a bill to change that makes the post subject to a confirmation vote. We don't know if a Senate hearing would have weeded out Cheatle or prevented the Pennsylvania mishaps and tragedy that nearly became a national catastrophe, but the added scrutiny of the service is welcome.\n\nNow the agency wants the Trump campaign to avoid outdoor rallies. While we support the utmost security for presidents and presidential candidates, how about just making the outdoor rallies safer?\n\nTrump and Vice President Kamala Harris must be protected and allowed to campaign as they wish. That protection has been the job of the Secret Service since 1902.

Josh Hawley (R-MO) got into a shouting match with U.S. Secret Service acting director Ronald Rowe during a Tuesday hearing in the Senate.\n\nHawley demanded that there be firings over security failures on the day of the assassination attempt on Donald Trump -- and put focus on the person heading the team on the ground in Butler, Pennsylvania.\n\n\"Why don't you relieve everybody of duty who made bad judgment?\" Hawley asked at hearing to discuss failures on the day.\n\nRead Also: Trump owes money to media outlets and Secret Service -- after not paying his bills: report\n\n\"I will not rush to judgment,\" Rowe, who had already admitted to being ashamed of the failures, replied. \"I will do so with integrity and not rush to judgment and put people unfairly persecuted.\"\n\n\"Unfairly persecuted?\" exclaimed Hawley. \"We have people who are dead!\"\n\n\"We have to have a proper investigation into this, senator,\" said Rowe, who took over the agency after former Secret Service Director Kimberly Cheatle resigned last week.\n\nHe went on to explain that the investigation is going on to understand faults and failures fully.\n\nBoth Hawley and colleague U.S. Sen. Ted Cruz (R-TX) claimed to have \"whistle-blowers\" who have said that the Secret Service denied staffing requests for an increase in manpower. On the day of the shooting, Rowe said that the number of people on the security team equaled that of the current president of the United States. Trump's detail asked for an expansion of manpower and they got it.\n\nAccording to Hawley, his whistle-blower \"is telling us more than you are.\" Rowe is bound by rules restricting what can and can't be said during an active investigation.\n\nRowe said that he has been \"transparent and forthcoming,\" which appeared to trigger Hawley, who began shouting.\n\n\"Your agency has not been transparent and forthcoming! Please, let's not go there,\" said Hawley.\n\n\"I have been forthcoming,\" Rowe said.\n\n\"That remains to be seen. You have been on the job a few days. You fired nobody.

Direct to your inbox. Sign up for the Morning Report newsletter\n\nGlaring security failures by the Secret Service allowed a 20-year-old Pennsylvania gunman armed with an AR 15-style rifle to elude law enforcement even after he was seen on campaign rally grounds and identified as suspicious. He gained access to an unprotected warehouse roof, fired eight sharpshooter shots, struck former President Trump in the ear, killed a rallygoer and wounded two others before a Secret Service sniper killed him.\n\nThe Secret Service expected local counter-snipers to protect the warehouse roof where the gunman took up his position on July 13. They did not.\n\n\"They should have been on the roof,\" Secret Service Acting Director Ronald Rowe told angry senators during a hearing Tuesday.\n\nRowe, who has been in the acting position for a week following his predecessor's resignation, acknowledged his agency may have failed to make that expectation clear to the local counter-snipers.\n\nA cascade of mistakes and security gaps amounted to \"a failure of imagination,\" Rowe told senators.\n\nThe shooter's weapon was not seen before he was on the roof. His access to the roof was not detected until minutes before he fired his weapon. He surveilled the rally with a drone beforehand and was not caught. Secret Service and local law enforcement communications were not in sync. And the gunman's motive remains unclear.\n\n\"I have lost sleep over that for the last 17 days, just like you have,\" Rowe said during a tense and emotional exchange with Sen. Josh Hawley (R-Mo.), who questioned why no one in the Secret Service had been fired. \"People will be held accountable and I will do so with integrity and not rush to judgment and put people [out there to be] unfairly persecuted,\" Rowe said.\n\nHarris called out Trump over hot-button issues including border security, vowing to get the bipartisan immigration legislation that was negotiated in the Senate signed into law if she is elected.\n\n\"The momentum in this race is shifting and there are signs that Donald Trump is feeling it -- you may have noticed,\" the vice president told the crowd. Harris also challenged Trump to debate after he backtracked from a September face-off initially scheduled with President Biden.\n\n\"If you got something to say,\" she challenged Trump, \"say it to my face.\"\n\nThe rally marked the latest sign of the cultural momentum behind Harris barely a week into her presidential campaign.\n\nHarris was the only candidate to earn enough delegates to qualify for the virtual roll call for the nomination, according to Democratic Party officials. It's a process that will kick off Thursday. Harris plans campaign stops in battlegrounds states next week, including Tuesday in Philadelphia, accompanied by her as-yet-to-be-selected running mate. A week from today, the Democratic duo will join forces for a sweep through western Wisconsin; Detroit; Raleigh, N.C.; Savannah, Ga.; Phoenix; and Las Vegas, the campaign announced.\n\nThe Democratic trail: \ud83d\udc49 Harris returns to Houston today for a campaign event.\n\nAmong the veepstakes hopefuls? Sen. Mark Kelly (D-Ariz.), the swing state senator and former astronaut who's uncomfortable in the role of attack dog and has eschewed politics for most of his time in the Senate. His clean-cut reputation and focus on policy raise questions about whether he can play the traditional role of running mate.\n\nAnd then there's Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz, who has seen his national profile skyrocket as one of Democrats' most prominent critics of the GOP. Walz, who leads a blue-leaning state that Trump hopes to flip this fall, snagged national attention when he labeled the former president and his running mate, Ohio Sen. JD Vance, \"weird,\" prompting other high-profile Democrats to seize on the same line of attack.\n\nHarris's quick pivot to her White House bid has prompted an about-face on multiple key issues that could affect outcomes in battleground states, handing Trump and Republicans lines of attack. The Hill's Al Weaver and Brett Samuels report that in the first week of her White House bid, her campaign has moved to distance her from a series of positions she took when she was a primary candidate in 2019. Republicans say the policy pivots are her vulnerability. Harris's allies argue the electorate will care more about her vision for the future than stances she took five years ago.\n\n\"They need to let Kamala go out there and win people over. Talk about the issues that matter to swing-state voters, the economy, childcare, abortion and fertility treatment rights,\" said one Democratic strategist who has worked with Harris. \"Let Kamala be Kamala and she'll win people over like she always does.\"\n\nThe GOP trail: \ud83d\udc49 Trump will hold a rally in Harrisburg, Pa., at 6 p.m., his first in Pennsylvania since the July 13 rally in Butler. On Wednesday, he will take questions in Chicago at a conference of the National Association of Black Journalists, an appearance that is not without controversy. On Saturday, Trump and Vance will appear in Atlanta.\n\nPROJECT 2025's director departed from the conservative transition planning effort that Trump's campaign disavowed as distinct from the former president's transition thinking after Biden and Democrats wielded its ideas as a campaign weapon. Harris's team said the director's departure doesn't mean Project 2025 is going \"anywhere.\"\n\nTHE SENATE OVERWHELMINGLY passed bills to expand online privacy and safety protections for children Tuesday, delivering a major win for activists who have advocated for action against tech companies. The legislation, approved 91-3, would force digital platforms to take \"reasonable\" steps to prevent harms to children and it would broaden existing federal privacy protections to include kids and teens 16 years old and younger. The bills -- the Kids Online Safety Act, or KOSA, and the Children and Teens' Online Privacy Protection Act, referred to as COPPA 2.0. -- represent the most significant restrictions on tech platforms to clear a chamber of Congress in decades.\n\nThey now face an uncertain future in the House, where they've gained bipartisan support, but negotiations publicly unraveled amid infighting between House Republican leaders (The Washington Post).\n\nThe Hill: Here are the three senators who voted against the bills.\n\nBUDGET WOES: Speaker Mike Johnson (R-La.) has remained in his post longer than his predecessor McCarthy, who was ousted in part due to frustration with how he handled spending issues. But he's not closer to pleasing hardline conservatives on spending matters. Despite efforts from leadership to push through 12 regular appropriations bills, as hard-liners wished, several of the spending bills have been derailed and the House headed into an early recess. But unlike with McCarthy the hardliners seem resigned to the fact that their spending bill goals will not be met (The Hill).\n\n\"I believed that we were going to actually do something on the budget, on the spending bills. That's what we were told last year,\" said Rep. Andy Biggs (R-Ariz.). \"When Kevin became Speaker, that didn't happen. And we were told it's going to happen this year, and if it didn't happen, we're gonna stay through August. That's not happening... Don't say that stuff to me if you don't mean it.\"\n\nHAMAS POLITICAL LEADER Ismail Haniyeh was killed in the Iranian capital Tehran, Iranian state media reported Wednesday. Hamas issued a statement shortly after, saying Haniyeh was killed in what it said was an Israeli \"raid\" on his residence in Tehran. In response to the claim, the Israeli military said it \"doesn't respond to reports in the foreign media.\" The White House did not immediately issue a response. The attack on Haniyeh builds on a years-long proxy war between Iran and Israel and comes at a delicate time for the region amid concerns that the Israel-Hamas war will spread beyond Gaza (NBC News and CNN).\n\nISRAEL LAUNCHED A STRIKE on Beirut, Lebanon, on Tuesday that targeted a senior Hezbollah commander as tensions along Israel's northern border and fears of a wider war continue to escalate. Fuad Shukr, also known as Al-Hajj Mohsen, was targeted in the strike, though it remains unclear if he was killed. The attack follows a Saturday rocket strike into Israeli-occupied Golan Heights that killed 12, mostly teenagers and children. State Department deputy spokesperson Vedant Patel said he didn't have \"any updates on any specific activity that we're seeing\" and did not say whether Israel had given the U.S. a heads-up about a potential retaliatory strike (ABC News).\n\nIn Georgia, Harris said Israel has \"the right to defend itself against the terrorist organization, which is exactly what Hezbollah is. But all of that being said, we still must work on a diplomatic solution to end these attacks, and we will continue to do that work.\"\n\nCBS News: Ultra-right-wing Israeli nationalists stormed two military facilities late Monday, protesting the detention and questioning of nine Israel Defense Forces reservists suspected of raping and abusing a Palestinian prisoner.\n\nPROTESTS SPREAD Tuesday in Venezuela's capital, with hundreds of young people marching through the streets over a presidential election in which the incumbent, Nicol\u00e1s Maduro, declared victory despite widespread accusations of fraud. The opposition, which considers the election body to be in the pocket of a dictatorial government, said the 73 percent of vote tallies to which it has access showed its candidate Edmundo Gonz\u00e1lez had more than twice as many votes as Maduro (The New York Times and Reuters).\n\n\u25aa The Washington Post: At least 16 reported dead as Maduro meets Venezuelan protests with force.\n\n\u25aa CNN: Venezuela is wracked with protests and election uncertainty. Here's what to know.\n\nTHE CLOSER\n\nAnd finally ... \ud83d\udd2d A skyscraper-sized asteroid will whiz harmlessly past Earth on Saturday. With the right equipment and timing, it's possible to spot it.\n\nCalled 2024 MK, the space rock will make its closest approach to Earth, passing by at about three-quarters the distance from Earth to the moon. It was first spotted two weeks ago by a South African observatory and is about 393 feet to 853 feet (120 meters to 260 meters) wide.\n\nSmaller objects shoot past Earth all the time, according to asteroid expert Davide Farnocchia with NASA's Center for Near-Earth Object Studies. Asteroids the size of this latest one fly by about every 25 years or so. \"We're going to see a few of those during our lifetimes, but it's not something that happens every other day,\" he said.",

Ted Cruz of Texas at a Senate hearing Tuesday, acting Secret Service Director Ronald Rowe Jr. showed that he could obfuscate as well as anyone in politics. But his failure to keep cool while doing so suggested repressed feelings of guilt sure to torpedo any bureaucrat's career.\n\nFor more than seven minutes, Cruz grilled Rowe on the July 13 assassination attempt against former President Donald Trump. Specifically, the Texas senator focused on matters pertaining to resources and accountability.\n\nDuring Congressional testimony, bureaucrats regularly stonewall elected officials with non-answers and promises of future information.\n\nWhen not wasting time with platitudes about how hard everyone in their agency has worked and how much credit they deserve, bureaucrats defer uncomfortable questions with answers such as \"I don't recall at this time,\" or \"I'll have to get back to you on that.\" Rowe was no different.\n\n\"Secret Service leadership committed catastrophic security failures,\" Cruz said in a clip posted to the social media platform X.\n\nIndeed it did. Thus, the senator asked whether the Secret Service had denied requests for additional resources from Trump's team.\n\nRowe answered by dismissing media reporting on the subject of additional requests as \"not accurate.\"\n\nThen the acting director began painting himself into a corner by awkwardly describing \"a process that is made\" before appearing to lose his train of thought while crafting the next part of the obfuscation.\n\nRemarkably, Rowe could not say how many such requests the Trump team had made. Nor could he even confirm that he had approved an official Secret Service social media post on that topic that was sent out the day after the assassination attempt.\n\n\"I can get you that number,\" Rowe replied to the first question.\n\nTo the question about approving the social media post, he answered, \"I don't know if I did or didn't, Senator.\"\n\nSee how this works?\n\nUnderstandably, Cruz became frustrated. He pressed Rowe to identify the individual ultimately responsible for approving or denying security requests. But the senator got nowhere.\n\nFinally, in the most eye-opening sequence of the entire exchange, Cruz accused Secret Service leadership of making \"political decisions.\"\n\n\"Who makes the decision to deny those requests? Did you make that decision?\" Cruz asked.\n\nAgain, Rowe began talking about \"process.\"\n\n\"OK. So there's a bureaucracy. Is there a decision maker? Give me the person that's the decision maker. Is there one?\" Cruz interjected.\n\n\"Senator, it's a conversation,\" the bureaucrat began before Cruz again interrupted.\n\n\"So let me tell you what I believe. I believe that the Secret Service leadership made a political decision to deny these requests. And I think the Biden administration has been suffused with partisan politics,\" the senator said.\n\nCruz then asked if the same person denied security requests to independent presidential candidate Robert F. Kennedy Jr. as well as to Trump.\n\nIncredibly, Rowe responded by assuring Cruz that \"Secret Service agents are not political.\" Cruz asked for a name. Instead, he got another platitude.\n\nThe acting director, however, grew increasingly agitated. He even said something nonsensical about a \"bicameral, bipartisan process.\"\n\nFinally, having failed to elicit a direct answer, Cruz turned to the relative size of security details assigned to Trump, President Joe Biden and first lady Jill Biden.\n\nFor some reason, the line of questioning about the relative size of security details made Rowe flip into combative mode.\n\n\"Is it your testimony that in Butler, Pennsylvania, Donald Trump had the same number of agents protecting him that Joe Biden has at a comparable event?\" Cruz asked.\n\n\"I'm telling you the shift, the close-protection shift surrounding him.

It is equally unfathomable that public reporting suggests that U.S. Secret Service had identified the building as a potential vulnerability and failed to include that vulnerability within the security perimeter or otherwise ensure the security of the roof,\" the lawmakers wrote of the July 13 shooting at Trump's rally in Butler, Pennsylvania.\n\nTRUMP SHOOTING: TIMELINE OF ASSASSINATION ATTEMPT RAISES QUESTIONS ABOUT HOW GUNMAN EVADED SECURITY\n\nThe letter then pivoted to a Politico report, stating, \"Public reporting indicates that the Secret Service is in possession of a draft report by the Department of Homeland Security's Office of Inspector General (DHS OIG) focused on Secret Service's preparation for and response to events on January 6, 2021.\"\n\n\"The story specifically states that the release of the report 'could cast light on a series of embarrassing security lapses for the agency,'\" the letter said.\n\n\"Congress, and the American people, deserve to understand whether the security lapses at the July 13, 2024, rally are part of a larger pattern of negligence on the part of the Secret Service.\"\n\nTRUMP ASSASSINATION ATTEMPT: TEXTS REVEAL OFFICERS WERE AWARE OF THOMAS CROOKS 90 MINUTES BEFORE SHOOTING\n\nRepublicans are asking Rowe for a summary of the DHS watchdog report's findings and recommendations for the Secret Service, and how those steps were carried out ahead of the Trump rally shooting, by July 31.\n\nThe letter is also signed by Reps. Eli Crane, R-Ariz., and Harriet Hageman, R-Wyo.\n\nThe Secret Service has been under a mountain of scrutiny in the wake of the shooting, which saw a 20-year-old gunman kill one rally attendee and critically injure two others.

One, there's a process for a candidate nominee to receive protection,\" Rowe responded. \"That is a bicameral, bipartisan process.\"\n\n\"Does the buck stop anywhere?! Does the buck stop anywhere?!\" Cruz fired back.\n\nCruz asked Rowe Jr. about Secret Service whistleblowers who said there were limited resources to protect Trump due to the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) summit in Washington, D.C, and First Lady Jill Biden's campaign rally in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania.\n\n\"What was the relative size of the Trump detail compared to the detail that is assigned to the President and the First Lady?\" Cruz asked later in the hearing.\n\n\"Senator, the former president travels with a full shift, just like the president,\" Rowe Jr. said, adding \"On the day of, in Butler, the agents surrounding him, it is the same number of agents surrounding the president today.\"\n\nCruz continued to press Rowe Jr. for refusing to provide clear answers.\n\n\"Sir, you are refusing to answer straight,\" Cruz said. \"Sir, stop interrupting me.

Vance Claims His 'Childless Cat Lady' Remarks Were 'Radically' Misinterpreted by Democrats: 'They Aggressively Lied'\n\nFormer President Donald Trump opened up about the harrowing experience of his assassination attempt and how his wife, Melania Trump, watched the traumatic event unfold live on television. Trump's revelations shed light on the emotional toll of the incident on the former first family.\n\nOn July 13, Trump survived an assassination attempt by 20-year-old Thomas Matthew Crooks during a rally in Butler, Pennsylvania. The chilling event was broadcast live, and Melania, watching from home, experienced it in real time.\n\nTrump described Melania's reaction as one of profound distress. He noted that she has been unable to discuss the incident with him, a silence he interprets as a sign of her deep care and love for him. The former president emphasized that Melania's inability to speak about that day underscores the gravity of her emotions and its impact on her.\n\nMelania's fear reached its peak when she saw the Secret Service swiftly take down the shooter, leading her to believe the worst had happened to her husband. Trump expressed sympathy for the Secret Service agents despite the critical security lapse that allowed the gunman to get so close. He acknowledged their bravery, recounting how they shielded him with their bodies as bullets flew overhead.\n\nTrump highlighted the critical moments when the Secret Service counter-sniper neutralized Crooks but lamented that it should have happened sooner. He pointed out the significant lapses in security, including the absence of agents on the roof and the lack of communication with local police about the suspicious individual.\n\nIn the aftermath of the attempt on his life, Secret Service Director Kimberly Cheatle resigned amid mounting criticism over the agency's failures. While acknowledging the counter-sniper's effectiveness, Trump maintained that the security measures in place were insufficient and poorly executed.\n\nThe details surrounding the gunman's activities before the attack were startling. Crooks had been spotted and reported by the Secret Service multiple times before the rally, yet he was allowed to remain close to the event. His preparations included searching online about the distance Lee Harvey Oswald was from John F. Kennedy when he shot him and flying a drone near the rally stage just hours before the attack. These actions highlighted the extent of his planning and the critical oversights in security.\n\nTrump's account of the event and Melania's reaction provide a personal perspective on the impact of such threats on public figures and their families. The former president's willingness to discuss these details underscores the ongoing emotional and psychological repercussions of the assassination attempt.\n\nAs the investigation continues, the FBI maintains that Crooks acted alone. However, the incident has sparked a broader conversation about the effectiveness and preparedness of security measures for high-profile political figures.", "source": {"uri": "econotimes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "EconoTimes"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Melania_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Melania Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Secret_Service", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "United States Secret Service"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/J._D._Vance", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "J.

I have lost sleep over that for the last 17 days just like you have!\" Rowe Jr. said.\n\nHawley pushed back, insisting the Secret Service \"fire somebody and hold them accountable.\"\n\n\"I'll tell you, senator, that I will not rush to judgment, that people will be held accountable and I will do so with integrity and not rush to judgment and [make] people unfairly persecuted,\" Rowe Jr. said.\n\n\"Unfairly persecuted?!\" an incensed Hawley exclaimed.\n\nRowe Jr. continued to insist a thorough and fair investigation is taking place, and it would be irresponsible to point blame before those findings.\n\n\"I don't really care much about your protocols,\" Hawley said. \"I think if your protocols don't provide for the fact that when a former president is shot, when an American is killed, when other rally goers -- innocent people who just showed up on the day -- when they are shot at and critically wounded, if that isn't a protocol violation... you should revise your protocols.\"\n\nRowe Jr. said the failure in protocol is somewhere the two \"agree.\"\n\n\"This was a failure and we will get to the bottom of it,\" he said.\n\n\"Well, I hope you're going to do something about it,\" Hawley replied.", "source": {"uri": "mediaite.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Mediaite"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Senate", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "United States Senate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kimberly_Cheatle", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Kimberly Cheatle"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Butler,_Pennsylvania", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Butler, Pennsylvania"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Butler, Pennsylvania"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lee_Harvey_Oswald", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Lee Harvey Oswald"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_F._Kennedy", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "John F.

Federal investigators still need to verify whether the account belonged to Crooks. Abbate also didn't name a specific platform. But the FBI suspects Crooks used the account during the 2019-2020 time frame, when he was around 14 to 15 years old.\n\n\"There were over 700 comments posted from this account,\" Abbate said. \"Some of these comments, if ultimately attributable to the shooter, appear to reflect antisemitic and anti-immigration themes to espouse political violence and are described as extreme in nature.\"\n\nAgents are still working to determine a motive for the shooting. The FBI deputy director noted the \"absence\" of other information pointing to Crooks' reasoning. The FBI has been examining Crooks' electronic devices, including a laptop and Samsung smartphone.\n\nIn addition, federal investigators have sent legal requests to tech companies for more information about Crooks' online activities. One request discovered that Crooks conducted a Google search on July 6 related to the assassination of former President John F. Kennedy. Meanwhile, right-wing social media platform Gab also claims to have received an FBI subpoena for a pro-Biden account potentially tied to Crooks.\n\nFederal agents have also been trying to crack Crooks' accounts on messaging apps. But the end-to-end encryption has prevented investigators from accessing them, even through a legal subpoena, Abbate said in Tuesday's hearing.\n\n\"How do we solve this problem?\" asked Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-SC), who raised the concern that a \"foreign power\" could plan a similar attack using encrypted messaging apps.\n\n\"As we've been saying, we need a solution that provides lawful access,\" Abbate said before being interrupted by Graham.\n\n\"We have encrypted apps of an assassin, a murderer,\" Graham added. \"And we can't get into them all these days after? That needs to be fixed, folks. I'm all for privacy, but to a point.\"\n\nThe FBI and Justice Department have long called on the tech industry to create a backdoor to help them access encrypted devices and communications. But major companies, including Apple and Facebook, have pushed back, saying developing such a backdoor would undermine the privacy for all users, not just suspected criminals, making it easier for state-sponsored spies and cybercriminals to hack online accounts and devices.", "source": {"uri": "uk.pcmag.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "PCMag UK"}, "authors": [{"uri": "social_media@uk.pcmag.com", "name": "Social Media", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}, {"uri": "i_ve_been@uk.pcmag.com", "name": "I've Been", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}, {"uri": "including_consumer_electronics@uk.pcmag.com", "name": "Including Consumer Electronics", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_Abbate", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Paul Abbate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Bureau_of_Investigation", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Federal Bureau of Investigation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_media", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Social media"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Opposition_to_immigration", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Opposition to immigration"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antisemitism", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Antisemitism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assassination", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Assassination"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Senate", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States Senate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lindsey_Graham", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Lindsey Graham"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subpoena", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Subpoena"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Political_violence", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Political violence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Right-wing_politics", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Right-wing politics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_F._Kennedy", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "John F.

She failed to answer nearly every question posed to her concerning the July 13 assassination attempt on former President Donald Trump.\n\nNow her boss should do the same. Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas was not only in charge of the worst Secret Service failure since 1981, but has also failed to secure the southern U.S. border, for which the U.S. House has already voted to impeach him.\n\nCheatle served under Mayorkas' direction, and there are no more assurances national security vulnerabilities are secure under his watch--even with her gone.\n\nDuring the House Oversight Committee hearing, Cheatle failed to answer basic questions, and the little information she did provide was nonsensical.\n\n\"I have a timeline that does not have specifics,\" Cheatle said in response to a question from Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene (R-Ga.) when exactly the Secret Service knew about the threat of the shooter.\n\nHer ridiculous answer was met with laughter from the audience as she accomplished the rare feat of uniting both Democrats and Republicans in vocal condemnation of her testimony.\n\nCheatle repeatedly said she would not answer questions before the FBI's investigation is complete--which could be 60 days. In the meantime, those who oversaw the failure, chiefly Mayorkas, will be helping pick the replacement.\n\nCheatle said while the Secret Service does typically have recordings of radio communications, they don't have recordings of the July 13 rally. That's convenient.\n\nCheatle said the rooftop Matthew Thomas Crooks shot from was outside the perimeter of their watch, but they were going to provide \"overwatch.\" She has since admitted the Secret Service should not have relied on local law enforcement to secure that building.\n\nBut most people can see plainly that a sniper could easily shoot well from such a position. Bystanders' videos have prompted further questions about the Secret Service's failure to take out the shooter.\n\nIf Cheatle was hoping to dispel conspiracy theories, all she did was fuel them.

Federal investigators still need to verify whether the account belonged to Crooks. Abbate also didn't name a specific platform. But the FBI suspects Crooks used the account during the 2019-2020 time frame, when he was around 14 to 15 years old.\n\n\"There were over 700 comments posted from this account,\" Abbate said. \"Some of these comments, if ultimately attributable to the shooter, appear to reflect antisemitic and anti-immigration themes to espouse political violence and are described as extreme in nature.\"\n\nAgents are still working to determine a motive for the shooting. The FBI deputy director noted the \"absence\" of other information pointing to Crooks' reasoning. The FBI has been examining Crooks' electronic devices, including a laptop and Samsung smartphone.\n\nIn addition, federal investigators have sent legal requests to tech companies for more information about Crooks' online activities. One request discovered that Crooks conducted a Google search on July 6 related to the assassination of former President John F. Kennedy. Meanwhile, right-wing social media platform Gab also claims to have received an FBI subpoena for a pro-Biden account potentially tied to Crooks.\n\nFederal agents have also been trying to crack Crooks' accounts on messaging apps. But the end-to-end encryption has prevented investigators from accessing them, even through a legal subpoena, Abbate said in Tuesday's hearing.\n\n\"How do we solve this problem?\" asked Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-SC), who raised the concern that a \"foreign power\" could plan a similar attack using encrypted messaging apps.\n\n\"As we've been saying, we need a solution that provides lawful access,\" Abbate said before being interrupted by Graham.\n\n\"We have encrypted apps of an assassin, a murderer,\" Graham added. \"And we can't get into them all these days after? That needs to be fixed, folks. I'm all for privacy, but to a point.\"\n\nThe FBI and Justice Department have long called on the tech industry to create a backdoor to help them access encrypted devices and communications. But major companies, including Apple and Facebook, have pushed back, saying developing such a backdoor would undermine the privacy for all users, not just suspected criminals, making it easier for state-sponsored spies and cybercriminals to hack online accounts and devices.", "source": {"uri": "pcmag.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "PC Magazine"}, "authors": [{"uri": "michael_kan@pcmag.com", "name": "Michael Kan", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Bureau_of_Investigation", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Federal Bureau of Investigation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_media", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Social media"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assassination", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Assassination"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_Abbate", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Paul Abbate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Senate", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States Senate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gab_(social_network)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Gab (social network)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Opposition_to_immigration", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Opposition to immigration"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lindsey_Graham", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Lindsey Graham"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subpoena", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Subpoena"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Political_violence", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Political violence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Right-wing_politics", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Right-wing politics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antisemitism", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Antisemitism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_F._Kennedy", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "John F.

Sheila Jackson Lee's death and Trump rally shooting spread online", "body": "Statement: The death of Rep. Sheila Jackson Lee, D-Houston, six days after the Trump rally shooting was linked to her \"Oversight of the Secret Service.\"\n\nKimberly Cheatle resigned July 23 as U.S. Secret Service director after lawmakers sharply criticized her agency's actions leading up to the July 13 assassination attempt on former President Donald Trump.\n\nA day before she resigned, Cheatle deflected many questions from lawmakers on both sides of the aisle as she testified before the Republican-led House Oversight Committee and faced bipartisan calls to step down.\n\n\"Secret Service Director Kimberly Cheatle confirmed that Rep. Shiela Jackson was involved in the Oversight of the Secret Service,\" said a July 22 X post in what appeared to be a misspelled reference to Rep. Sheila Jackson Lee, D-Houston. \"Rep. Jackson passed away 6 days after the assassination attempt on Donald Trump. This is one of the strangest coincidences of the year.\"\n\nThe post included a clip of Cheatle's testimony in which she gave her condolences over Jackson Lee's death. It was shared by \"Dom Lucre,\" an X account known to promote misinformation and the QAnon conspiracy theory, which posits that powerful, left-leaning politicians and entertainers are involved with a Satan-worshipping pedophile ring.\n\nAnother X account known to promote QAnon and misinformation also shared the clip of Cheatle's testimony, noting Secret Service oversight by Jackson Lee and saying that she \"was confirmed dead six days after the attempted assassination of President Donald Trump. Just another coincidence right?\"\n\nClaims like these were also shared on Facebook and Instagram.\n\nJackson Lee died July 19 at age 74. She had served as a Houston judge and City Council member before being elected to Texas' 18th Congressional District seat in 1994, CNN reported. She was a mother and grandmother and was among the first women to graduate from Yale University. She had served as whip of the Congressional Black Caucus and at the time of her death was a vice chair of the Congressional Progressive Caucus and a chief deputy whip for House Democrats.\n\n\"Today, with incredible grief for our loss yet deep gratitude for the life she shared with us, we announced the passing of United States Representative Sheila Jackson Lee of the 18th Congressional District of Texas,\" a July 19 statement from her family said. \"She will be dearly missed, but her legacy will continue to inspire all who believe in freedom, justice, and democracy.\"\n\nAlthough a cause of death has not been publicly reported, Jackson Lee said in June that she had been diagnosed with pancreatic cancer. We contacted a spokesperson for Jackson Lee's office and received no response before publication.\n\nThere is no evidence that her death is considered suspicious. The claims that Jackson Lee's death was somehow linked to oversight of the U.S. Secret Service followed remarks in Cheatle's congressional testimony.\n\nIn her opening statement, Cheatle first acknowledged that the assassination attempt was \"the most significant operational failure of the Secret Service in decades.\"\n\nShe offered condolences to the family of rally attendee Corey Comperatore, who was killed in the attack, and wished the other two men injured in Butler, Pa., \"a speedy recovery.\"\n\n\"I would be remiss if I did not also extend my condolences on the passing of your colleague, Congresswoman Sheila Jackson Lee,\" Cheatle said. \"Ms. Jackson Lee was always engaged in the oversight of the Secret Service, and her passing is a great loss to this body.\"\n\nCheatle was addressing a room of Jackson Lee's fellow House members, but Jackson Lee was not a member of the Oversight Committee when she died.\n\nSocial media users seized on Cheatle's comments about Jackson Lee, who had been a senior member of the House Judiciary, Homeland Security and Budget committees.\n\nWe searched using Google and Nexis and found no reliable news reports claiming that Jackson Lee's death was connected to Secret Service oversight work or the Trump rally shooting.\n\nThe Secret Service is part of the Department of Homeland Security, so some of Jackson Lee's Homeland Security Committee work might have involved the Secret Service. But we found no reports showing Jackson Lee's work focused specifically on the Secret Service.

(The Bethel Park School District via AP)\n\nA top FBI official said on July 30 that investigators have discovered that a social media account possibly linked to former President Donald Trump's would-be assassin featured hundreds of comments reflecting anti-Semitic and anti-immigration views.\n\nPaul Abbate, deputy director of the FBI, made the remark while testifying before a joint hearing of the Senate Judiciary Committee and the Senate Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee on July 30, which was focused on the security failures leading up to the Trump assassination attempt.\n\nThomas Matthew Crooks, the gunman who fired multiple shots in the former president's direction at a July 13 rally in Butler, Pennsylvania, is believed to have made multiple posts on social media between 2019 and 2020 that revealed anti-Semitic and anti-immigration themes.\n\n\"There were over 700 comments posted from this account,\" Mr. Abbate said. \"Some of these comments, if ultimately attributable to the shooter, appear to reflect anti-Semitic and anti-immigration themes, to espouse political violence, and are described as extreme in nature.\"\n\nMr. Abbate said the FBI is still working to verify that the account belonged to Mr. Crooks, who was shot dead by a counter-sniper after firing eight rounds, including one that hit former President Trump in the ear, left two other men injured, and killed a former fire chief.\n\nThe FBI said on July 15 that it had been able to gain access to Mr. Crooks's phone, with the agency saying at the time that investigators were working to analyze its contents.\n\nDuring the hearing, Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.) asked the FBI's deputy director whether the agency had managed to break into some of the gunman's encrypted apps.\n\n\"We've experienced a range of returns,\" Mr. Abbate replied. \"Some of the applications that he was using online were encrypted in nature.\"\n\nMr. Graham interjected, asking again if they had been successfully broken into.\n\n\"We've received returns, there are some that we have not been able to get information back because of their encrypted nature,\" Mr. Abbate said.\n\nAsked by the South Carolina senator whether there was a way to \"solve that problem,\" referring to the difficulty of breaking into encrypted apps, Mr. Abbate called for legislation that would allow just that.\n\n\"We need a solution that provides lawful access to law enforcement,\" he said.\n\nMr. Graham concurred, saying: \"We have encrypted apps of an assassin, a murderer, and we can't get into them all these days after. That needs to be fixed, folks.

Bush administration in the aftermath of the 9/11 terrorist attacks, will be forming an \"independent\" panel to investigate what happened in Butler.\n\nMayorkas, along with Joe Biden, both said they are \"grateful\" to Cheatle for her \"decades of public service,\" meaning she, along with Biden, are political fossils who have been on the taxpayer dole for most of their lives.\n\n\"Jill and I are grateful to Director Kim Cheatle for her decades of public service,\" reads a July 23 memo from Biden's ghostwriters. \"She has selflessly dedicated and risked her life to protect our nation throughout her career in the United States Secret Service.\"\n\n\"We especially thank her for answering the call to lead the Secret Service during our Administration and we are grateful for her service to our family.\"\n\nRep.

Comperatore was shot and died at the scene, President Joe Biden directed the U.S. Department of Homeland Security to conduct a full and independent review. Ms. Townsend has been named as one of four prominent individuals on the panel.\n\nCEP Chief Executive Officer Ambassador Mark D. Wallace said:\n\n\"We congratulate Fran on her appointment to this distinguished panel of national security and law enforcement experts tasked with reviewing the shocking and tragic events of July 13. There is no place for political violence in the United States, and it is essential that the Secret Service be able to effectively carry out its mission protecting current and former Presidents. Fran's phenomenal expertise, impartiality, and wealth of experience make her the ideal candidate for this role, and the Counter Extremism Project is proud that one of our own has been tasked with the serious task of ensuring the Secret Service's efficacy and integrity.\"\n\nSecretary of Homeland Security Alejandro N. Mayorkas has convened the panel to conduct an independent review of the U.S. Secret Service's governing policies and procedures and a thorough examination of the actions taken by the Secret Service, as well as state and local authorities -- before, after, and during the Trump rally on July 13. Last week, Director of the Secret Service Kimberley Cheatle resigned from her position. Today, House Foreign Affairs Committee Chairman Michael McCaul revealed that the gunman had a detonation device on his body and two bombs in his vehicle.\n\nThe results of the review will be shared

Cheatle served as Biden's Secret Service Director beginning in 2022 and resigned after 45th President Trump was shot on her watch.\n\nAccording to an article published in Kim Cheatle's hometown newspaper, The News-Gazette:\n\nCheatle was in the Executive Building while Cheney was in the West Wing of the White House on the morning of Sept. 11, 2001, when she watched the first of two planes crash into the World Trade Center on television.\n\nShortly after, she received a call on her radio notifying her and her team that another plane looked as if it may be headed to the White House.\n\nAlong with other agents, Cheatle rushed to the West Wing to shuttle the vice president to a security bunker\n\nIn another report, published this May in Cheatle's home state media, ABC 7 out of Chicago touted her 9/11 experience, reporting that 9/11 \"still guides her planning\" as she leads \"vast Secret Service operation[s].\"\n\nIronically, the ABC 7 report lauded Cheatle as the woman tasked with securing August's Democratic National Convention in Chicago, just over two months before 45th President Trump was shot under her watch at a campaign rally in Butler, Pennsylvania.\n\n\"Our job in the Secret Service is to make sure that we cover off on all of those potentials, whether that be, you know, demonstrations, whether that be intelligence threats that are driven out there, or whether that be, you know, biological hazards,\" Cheatle told ABC 7. \"We kind of have to make sure that we're putting a plan in place to mitigate all of those possible factors.\"\n\n\"We are always monitoring, you know, what threat streams are out there,\" she went on to say.\n\nCheatle's background and actions as Secret Service Director have come under scrutiny after the assassination attempt on President Trump that led to her resignation, and to accusations that the Secret Service, and other elements of the federal government, were involved in the shooting have become widespread.",

Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.) asked the FBI's deputy director whether the agency had managed to break into some of the gunman's encrypted apps.\n\n\"We've experienced a range of returns,\" Mr. Abbate replied. \"Some of the applications that he was using online were encrypted in nature.\"\n\nMr. Graham interjected, asking again if they had been successfully broken into.\n\n\"We've received returns, there are some that we have not been able to get information back because of their encrypted nature,\" Mr. Abbate said.\n\nAsked by the South Carolina senator whether there's a way to \"solve that problem,\" referring to the difficulty of breaking into encrypted apps, Mr. Abbate called for legislation that would allow just that.\n\n\"We need a solution that provides lawful access to law enforcement,\" he said.\n\nMr. Graham concurred, saying: \"We have encrypted apps of an assassin, a murderer, and we can't get into them all these days after,\" he said. \"That needs to be fixed, folks. I'm all for privacy, but to a point.\"\n\nThe South Carolina senator supported his call for a legislative solution by noting the hypothetical situation where someone with ill intentions would use encrypted apps to communicate with a hostile foreign power.\n\n\"I think we need to know these things and we need to know them in real-time,\" Mr. Graham said.\n\nThere have been debates about whether such legislation would be constitutional.\n\nThe would-be Trump assassin's digital footprint has been in focus since FBI Director Christopher Wray told lawmakers last week that Mr. Crooks did a Google search for \"how far away was Oswald from Kennedy,\" in reference to the circumstances of the assassination of President John F. Kennedy.\n\n\"That's obviously significant in terms of his state of mind,\" Mr. Wray added. \"That is the same day that he registered for the Butler rally.\"", "source": {"uri": "theepochtimes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "www.theepochtimes.com"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Opposition_to_immigration", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Opposition to immigration"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antisemitism", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Antisemitism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Encryption", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Encryption"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Bureau_of_Investigation", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Federal Bureau of Investigation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_media", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Social media"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lindsey_Graham", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Lindsey Graham"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assassination", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Assassination"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Senate", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United States Senate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Butler,_Pennsylvania", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Butler, Pennsylvania"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Butler, Pennsylvania"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Carolina", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "South Carolina"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "South Carolina"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assassination_of_John_F._Kennedy", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Assassination of John F.

Theresa has moved on from Gerry and the lies he told her.\"\n\nAlongside the photos of her taking out the trash, Theresa poked fun at the media coverage surrounding their split by sharing a caption that was seemingly inspired by an article. \"The Golden Bachelor star Theresa Nist was seen taking out her trash inside her office. Theresa wore a short dress from Zara and a hint of berry lipstick to do the chore but left her cell phone on her desk,\" she wrote. \"This was the second time Theresa was spotted since she and Gerry announced their divorce. The trash can appeared to be empty.\"\n\nTheresa and Gerry, 72, revealed they were \"dissolving [their] marriage\" during a joint Good Morning America interview on April 12, which took place just three months after they got married during a televised wedding ceremony on January 4. The former couple explained that they decided to end their marriage when they both realized they didn't want to move away from their families.\n\nDespite insisting that they still loved each other, many fans speculated that The Hollywood Reporter's November 2023 expos\u00e9 - which revealed Gerry's secret three-year romantic relationship with an ex - may have caused the split. Many viewers grew upset with the news, as Gerry implied on the show that he hadn't dated since his wife Toni's death in 2017.\n\nA source exclusively told Life & Style that the scandal was a \"red flag\" for Theresa.

The Buffaloes topped 2022 College Football Playoff runner-up TCU before blowing out Nebraska in the first game of the Sanders era at Folsom Field. They beat Colorado State the next week.\n\nCU would win one game the rest of the season.\n\nNow the Buffs enter Year Two in a similar situation to Year One. There has been another exodus and influx of transfers. Two new coordinators have arrived in Boulder, and CU is once again a subject of attention and source of controversy with a Week Two matchup at Nebraska growing ever-so-slightly nearer.\n\nFormer defensive coordinator Charles Kelly left for the same position at Auburn and offensive coordinator Sean Lewis, demoted partway through last season, is now the head coach of San Diego State. Their respective replacements are Robert Livingston and Pat Shurmur. Livingston was hired after 12 years as the Cincinnati Bengals' secondary coach, and Shurmur was an analyst at CU after a lengthy career in the NFL.\n\n\"You have 127 years of NFL experience up under this roof,\" Deion Sanders told reporters after Colorado's spring game. \"It's on you. We are a tremendous navigation system to the game that you want to play. We know what we're doing. We know how to get there because we've been there, especially as a collective group.\n\n\"Now, what separates me from everyone else is I've sat in three seats. I gave you a dramatic pause so you can follow me. I'm the parent, right? A couple kids in college football. I've been the kid, right? A straight dog. And now I'm the coach.\"\n\nThey'll be tasked with improving a team that's still rebuilding after the shine of last September faded. Colorado's hot start and Sanders' bravado briefly masked the glaring holes remaining in a roster that went 1-11 in 2022. Even with new personnel, the Buffaloes' defense allowed 6.3 yards per play and almost 35 points per game last season.\n\nMeanwhile, a shoddy offensive line struggled to keep Shedeur Sanders upright and healthy. He was sacked 52 times and missed the final game of the season with a fracture in his back. Former NFL veteran tackle and Oklahoma grad Phil Loadholt -- who played against Nebraska in 2008 -- is now the position coach in the trenches.\n\nFor as much change as the coaching staff has undergone, the roster turnover is more dramatic. Forty-one players have left CU through the transfer portal since the end of last season, according to 247 Sports, and 42 have arrived.\n\nAmong the notable departures is Dylan Edwards, a quick, shifty running back who accounted for 620 total yards as a freshman, and Cormani McClain, once a five-star cornerback prospect. He'll spend next season at Florida.\n\nEthan Boyd is in the fold on the offensive line, the redshirt junior from Michigan State bringing some much-needed stability and Power Five experience to a paper-thin unit. Wyatt Hummel was solid at Villanova. He'll make the jump to the FBS level. Others, like Payton Kirkland and Zack Owens, were highly recruited out of high school but haven't gotten significant playing time in college.\n\nThey're additions to a roster that's gotten a makeover for the second straight offseason, representing a program still seeking the right combination.\n\n\"Whatever 11 players is out there, we're gonna make the most of it, so if they gotta do what's best for them, that's what's best for them,\" Shedeur Sanders said during the spring. \"And the guys that's coming in, they already know, I tell them straight-up what the mentality is. It's no jealousy, it's no anything in the locker room.\"\n\nAfter 13 seasons in the Pac-12, CU is back in the Big 12, with home games against Baylor, Kansas State, Cincinnati, Utah and Oklahoma State, and road games at UCF, Arizona, Texas Tech and Kansas.\n\nTags Lee-national\n\nBe the first to know\n\nGet local news delivered to your inbox!\n\nSign up!\n\n* I understand and agree that registration

He otherwise often has displayed his necklaces more like his father and coach, Deion Sanders. who wears expensive chains over his shirts, not underneath. That's the point in his case:\n\nWhy would you have this kind of jewelry if you're not going to show it?\n\nBut in Shilo's case, it turns out there are big reasons to bury the bling these days.\n\n\"He needs to be laying low because that (bling) is going to raise questions,\" said Nicole Stanton, a bankruptcy attorney in Atlanta.\n\nBlame it on his troubling legal situation. Shilo Sanders declared bankruptcy in October, hoping to discharge about $11 million in debt from a court judgment against him in Texas. It's up to the court whether to discharge that debt. But if it denies the discharge, that judgment is owed to a man who has been closely monitoring any of Sanders' possessions that could be sold to collect on it, including Shilo's necklaces and especially the business deals that bring him income from his name, image and likeness (NIL).\n\nWhy Shilo Sanders should watch what he wears\n\nThe necklaces alone show some of the strange dimensions of this situation for Shilo Sanders, 24, who comes from a famous family that is known for its displays of wealth and luxury. Flashing bling is part of the Sanders family brand, including custom-made diamond necklaces and his quarterback brother's famous wristwatch.\n\nBut because of the bankruptcy, Shilo now has incentive to look like he's poor while still being truthful in disclosing all that he owns in court, as required by law.\n\nIt's because he's being watched. The attorneys for the man seeking to collect on that judgment have been looking for public displays of his wealth and have questioned if he's illegally hiding assets that could be sold to pay off his debt - which Sanders' attorneys have denied.\n\nSo he needs to heed some advice, legal experts said - Disclose all you own in court but don't give any potential debt collector more reasons to question where you're getting the money to buy new things or whether certain necklaces you're wearing were properly included in your court disclosures.\n\n\"If the bling-bling is his, you don't wear it,\" said Mechele Dickerson, a law professor at the University of Texas. \"If the bling-bling is part of an NIL deal that is with a jeweler, he could give it back. You don't own it anyway (in that case), so just give it back. A good lawyer would say you need to show up looking like a bum from now until the case is dismissed.\"\n\nHis necklaces on loan\n\nIn the Instagram video, Shilo appears to touch the necklace at one point to make sure it's tucked in place, though his intent for tucking it in is not known. The University of Colorado has said Shilo and his father declined comment on the pending bankruptcy case.\n\n\"Love how he tucked in the jewelry. Read the room,\" one commenter said about it on Instagram.\n\nHow he discloses his jewelry has been an issue in his bankruptcy case from the start. In his initial Chapter 7 bankruptcy filing in October, he listed $478,000 in assets, including necklaces he valued at $75,000. His attorney then amended the value of his assets in December down to about $320,000 and removed the necklaces from the list of assets he owned, changing it to say he had $75,000 in necklaces that were on loan pursuant to an NIL deal with Saki Diamonds.\n\n\"They're going to have to prove that,\" said Stanton, who is not involved in the case. \"How do you prove that? Affidavits. Testimony. Give it back.\"\n\nIn late February, the trustee overseeing Sanders' bankruptcy estate requested access to Sanders' home to complete an inventory of his assets. The trustee also requested an inventory of the jewelry with the name, telephone number and addresses of the alleged owners, the trustee's attorney said in a court filing in February.\n\n\"The Trustee further requested any contracts between the Debtor (Sanders), Debtor-affiliated entities and third parties that would show that the jewelry was used for promotional purpose,\" the court filing said. \"No information has been provided.\"\n\nSanders' attorney replied that Sanders \"is cooperating in all respects\" with the trustee, but it's not clear if he provided what was sought. His attorney and Saki Diamonds didn't return messages seeking comment.\n\nHis 'valuable jewelry collection'\n\nAfter Sanders' attorney removed his necklaces from his list of assets, it raised eyebrows with attorneys for the man who is trying to collect on the judgment against him. That man is John Darjean, a security guard at Sanders' old high school in Dallas.\n\nDarjean sued Sanders in 2016, claiming Sanders assaulted him and caused him permanent injuries in an incident at the school in 2015, when Sanders was just 15 years old. Sanders disputed the allegations but didn't show up for the trial in March 2022 after he dropped his attorneys in 2020 and then didn't receive a notice in the mail about the trial because it went to his old address.\n\nWithout Sanders there to contest the allegations in person, the Dallas County court accepted Darjean's version of what happened and awarded him the $11.89 million judgment by default. Sanders's attorney said he didn't even know about the judgment until last year but filed for bankruptcy soon after he did.\n\nIt was hard to miss after Darjean's attorneys started aggressively pursuing debt collection efforts against Sanders and cited his displays of wealth on social media.\n\nIn a court filing in Texas on Oct. 19, 2023, Darjean's attorney even took steps to get a court-appointed receiver to collect on the judgment, noting that Sanders hadn't paid the debt but had shown plenty of property that could be subject to seizure to help satisfy the judgment.\n\n\"Mr. Sanders displays his valuable jewelry collection, which should be considered non-exempt (for seizure) as he wears it publicly and never mentions that such jewelry is owned by anyone else but himself or on loan from any sponsors,\" Darjean's attorney wrote in that filing. \"In the below (Instagram) pages, Mr. Sanders is wearing diamond necklaces that are non-exempt assets and he is proud of it, too.\"\n\nThe Instagram posts showed Sanders wearing flashy necklaces. Four days after that filing, Sanders filed for bankruptcy.\n\nThe big risk of hiding assets in a bankruptcy case\n\nSanders is seeking to have the debt discharged and has disputed whether the injury claimed by Darjean came from the alleged assault, according to court records. But Darjean, a former pro baseball player, is fighting that in court and says it should not be discharged because he said Sanders acted \"willfully and maliciously\" with respect to Darjean's alleged injuries - which would prevent such a discharge under the law.\n\nIf it's not discharged, Sanders' non-exempt possessions could be rounded up and sold to pay Darjean.\n\nSanders just has to be careful in the meantime. Though it might be tempting to hide non-exempt assets away from Darjean's potential grasp, it's against the law and could prevent a discharge of his debt if he ever transferred, destroyed or concealed such property within a year before the date of his bankruptcy filing in October. He also can't do that after the filing if those assets were owned before then, such as jewelry or cash. Darjean's attorney declined comment.\n\nThe mansion he never helped buy for Deion Sanders\n\nBy contrast, money earned after the filing is off-limits to creditors, said Angela Littwin, a bankruptcy expert and law professor at the University of Texas.\n\n\"But if a debtor used non-exempt cash from before he filed for bankruptcy to buy new assets, the trustee would try to trace the new assets to the old cash and thus access the new assets for the benefit of the creditors,\" Littwin said.\n\nDarjean is watching Shilo for that, too. In January, for example, Shilo's older brother Deion Jr. posted a video on YouTube that suggested Deion Sanders' sons were buying their father a new mansion in Colorado. Darjean's attorneys saw it and said in a bankruptcy court filing that it \"raises a plethora of questions regarding the resources of Shilo used in the acquisition, whether those resources were disclosed in the schedules or at the creditors meeting, and the timing of the deployment of such resources to acquire the property.\"\n\nThe purchase of the mansion never happened, however. Shilo Sanders' attorneys said the allegation of buying a house was based on \"pure conjecture and media hype.\"\n\nThe case goes on in the meantime as Darjean seeks to have the court determine that Sanders' debt to him is not dischargeable. Those proceedings are expected to drag on well into the summer unless it's settled before then.\n\nFollow reporter Brent Schrotenboer @Schrotenboer.

He otherwise often has displayed his necklaces more like his father and coach, Deion Sanders. who wears expensive chains over his shirts, not underneath. That's the point in his case:\n\nWhy would you have this kind of jewelry if you're not going to show it?\n\nBut in Shilo's case, it turns out there are big reasons to bury the bling these days.\n\n\"He needs to be laying low because that (bling) is going to raise questions,\" said Nicole Stanton, a bankruptcy attorney in Atlanta.\n\nBlame it on his troubling legal situation. Shilo Sanders declared bankruptcy in October, hoping to discharge about $11 million in debt from a court judgment against him in Texas. It's up to the court whether to discharge that debt. But if it denies the discharge, that judgment is owed to a man who has been closely monitoring any of Sanders' possessions that could be sold to collect on it, including Shilo's necklaces and especially the business deals that bring him income from his name, image and likeness (NIL).\n\nWhy Shilo Sanders should watch what he wears\n\nThe necklaces alone show some of the strange dimensions of this situation for Shilo Sanders, 24, who comes from a famous family that is known for its displays of wealth and luxury. Flashing bling is part of the Sanders family brand, including custom-made diamond necklaces and his quarterback brother's famous wristwatch.\n\nBut because of the bankruptcy, Shilo now has incentive to look like he's poor while still being truthful in disclosing all that he owns in court, as required by law.\n\nIt's because he's being watched. The attorneys for the man seeking to collect on that judgment have been looking for public displays of his wealth and have questioned if he's illegally hiding assets that could be sold to pay off his debt - which Sanders' attorneys have denied.\n\nSo he needs to heed some advice, legal experts said - Disclose all you own in court but don't give any potential debt collector more reasons to question where you're getting the money to buy new things or whether certain necklaces you're wearing were properly included in your court disclosures.\n\n\"If the bling-bling is his, you don't wear it,\" said Mechele Dickerson, a law professor at the University of Texas. \"If the bling-bling is part of an NIL deal that is with a jeweler, he could give it back. You don't own it anyway (in that case), so just give it back. A good lawyer would say you need to show up looking like a bum from now until the case is dismissed.\"\n\nHis necklaces on loan\n\nIn the Instagram video, Shilo appears to touch the necklace at one point to make sure it's tucked in place, though his intent for tucking it in is not known. The University of Colorado has said Shilo and his father declined comment on the pending bankruptcy case.\n\n\"Love how he tucked in the jewelry. Read the room,\" one commenter said about it on Instagram.\n\nHow he discloses his jewelry has been an issue in his bankruptcy case from the start. In his initial Chapter 7 bankruptcy filing in October, he listed $478,000 in assets, including necklaces he valued at $75,000. His attorney then amended the value of his assets in December down to about $320,000 and removed the necklaces from the list of assets he owned, changing it to say he had $75,000 in necklaces that were on loan pursuant to an NIL deal with Saki Diamonds.\n\n\"They're going to have to prove that,\" said Stanton, who is not involved in the case. \"How do you prove that? Affidavits. Testimony. Give it back.\"\n\nIn late February, the trustee overseeing Sanders' bankruptcy estate requested access to Sanders' home to complete an inventory of his assets. The trustee also requested an inventory of the jewelry with the name, telephone number and addresses of the alleged owners, the trustee's attorney said in a court filing in February.\n\n\"The Trustee further requested any contracts between the Debtor (Sanders), Debtor-affiliated entities and third parties that would show that the jewelry was used for promotional purpose,\" the court filing said. \"No information has been provided.\"\n\nSanders' attorney replied that Sanders \"is cooperating in all respects\" with the trustee, but it's not clear if he provided what was sought. His attorney and Saki Diamonds didn't return messages seeking comment.\n\nHis 'valuable jewelry collection'\n\nAfter Sanders' attorney removed his necklaces from his list of assets, it raised eyebrows with attorneys for the man who is trying to collect on the judgment against him. That man is John Darjean, a security guard at Sanders' old high school in Dallas.\n\nDarjean sued Sanders in 2016, claiming Sanders assaulted him and caused him permanent injuries in an incident at the school in 2015, when Sanders was just 15 years old. Sanders disputed the allegations but didn't show up for the trial in March 2022 after he dropped his attorneys in 2020 and then didn't receive a notice in the mail about the trial because it went to his old address.\n\nWithout Sanders there to contest the allegations in person, the Dallas County court accepted Darjean's version of what happened and awarded him the $11.89 million judgment by default.

We know how to get there because we've been there, especially as a collective group.\n\n\"Now, what separates me from everyone else is I've sat in three seats. I gave you a dramatic pause so you can follow me. I'm the parent, right? A couple kids in college football. I've been the kid, right? A straight dog. And now I'm the coach.\"\n\nThey'll be tasked with improving a team that's still rebuilding after the shine of last September faded. Colorado's hot start and Sanders' bravado briefly masked the glaring holes remaining in a roster that went 1-11 in 2022. Even with new personnel, the Buffaloes' defense allowed 6.3 yards per play and almost 35 points per game last season.\n\nMeanwhile, a shoddy offensive line struggled to keep Shedeur Sanders upright and healthy. He was sacked 52 times and missed the final game of the season with a fracture in his back. Former NFL veteran tackle and Oklahoma grad Phil Loadholt -- who played against Nebraska in 2008 -- is now the position coach in the trenches.\n\nFor as much change as the coaching staff has undergone, the roster turnover is more dramatic. Forty-one players have left CU through the transfer portal since the end of last season, according to 247 Sports, and 42 have arrived.\n\nAmong the notable departures is Dylan Edwards, a quick, shifty running back who accounted for 620 total yards as a freshman, and Cormani McClain, once a five-star cornerback prospect. He'll spend next season at Florida.\n\nEthan Boyd is in the fold on the offensive line, the redshirt junior from Michigan State bringing some much-needed stability and Power Five experience to a paper-thin unit. Wyatt Hummel was solid at Villanova. He'll make the jump to the FBS level. Others, like Payton Kirkland and Zack Owens, were highly recruited out of high school but haven't gotten significant playing time in college.\n\nThey're additions to a roster that's gotten a makeover for the second straight offseason, representing a program still seeking the right combination.\n\n\"Whatever 11 players is out there, we're gonna make the most of it, so if they gotta do what's best for them, that's what's best for them,\" Shedeur Sanders said during the spring. \"And the guys that's coming in, they already know, I tell them straight-up what the mentality is. It's no jealousy, it's no anything in the locker room.\"\n\nAfter 13 seasons in the Pac-12, CU is back in the Big 12, with home games against Baylor, Kansas State, Cincinnati, Utah and Oklahoma State, and road games at UCF, Arizona, Texas Tech and Kansas.\n\nPhotos: Nebraska football takes on No. 22 Colorado Tags Lee-national Be the first to know\n\nGet local news delivered to your inbox!\n\nSign

This significant debt stems from a 2015 incident when Sanders, then just 15, allegedly assaulted high school security guard John Darjean. The resulting lawsuit led to a 2022 judgment in favor of Darjean. Now, through bankruptcy, Sanders aims to discharge this debt and protect his assets.\n\nSanders filed for Chapter 7 bankruptcy in October 2023. According to his attorney, Sanders has complied to requirements in the bankruptcy filing.\n\n\"(Sanders) has taken no action to hide, transfer, destroy, or mutilate assets, either on a pre- or post-Petition Date basis, and even went so far as to voluntarily turnover over $210,000 to the (bankruptcy) Trustee without waiting for further order of the Bankruptcy Court, or even a stipulation for turnover.\" Sanders' attorney said in a court filing obtained by USA Today.\n\n2. What Led To Sanders' Legal Trouble\n\nIn 2015, Sanders, then 15, allegedly assaulted Darjean after being asked to hand over his cellphone. The lawsuit claims Sanders caused severe injuries to Darjean, including a broken neck and permanent neurological damage. Sanders' parents were initially part of the lawsuit but were later dropped. Sanders' attorneys withdrew from the case in 2020 due to his inability to fund his defense, leading to a default judgment in favor of Darjean in 2022, CBS Sports reported.\n\n3. Missed Trial And Default Judgment\n\nDue to outdated address information, Sanders said he did not receive the trial notice and did not appear in court. As a result, the court ruled in Darjean's favor, ordering Sanders to pay $11.89 million. Sanders only learned of the default judgment in 2023.\n\n4. Financial Disclosures And Allegations\n\nIn his bankruptcy filing, Sanders disclosed $320,000 in assets, including a 2023 Mercedes GLE valued at $75,900. His income from name, image, and likeness (NIL) deals was reported at $193,713 for 2023, down from $216,950 in 2022. Darjean's lawyers allege Sanders did not fully disclose his assets, claiming he transferred funds to his LLCs. Sanders' lawyers deny these allegations, stating his NIL agreements were transparent, The New York Times reported.\n\n5. What's Next In Shilo Sanders' Legal Saga\n\nSanders' bankruptcy filing has put a temporary halt on debt payments until a final decision by the bankruptcy court. Sanders' motion for summary judgment, if granted, could prevent Darjean from collecting the Texas judgment.", "source": {"uri": "moguldom.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Moguldom"}, "authors": [{"uri": "ann_brown@moguldom.com", "name": "Ann Brown", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deion_Sanders", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Deion Sanders"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bankruptcy", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Bankruptcy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chapter_7,_Title_11,_United_States_Code", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Chapter 7, Title 11, United States Code"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lawsuit", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Lawsuit"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guard_(gridiron_football)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Guard (gridiron football)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colorado_Buffaloes_football", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Colorado Buffaloes football"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_Colorado_Boulder", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "University of Colorado Boulder"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/High_school_football", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "High school football"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Defensive_back", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Defensive back"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Head_coach", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Head coach"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lawyer", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Lawyer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Default_judgment", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Default judgment"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/USA_Today", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "USA Today"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mobile_phone", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Mobile phone"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Texas", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Texas"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Texas"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Summary_judgment", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Summary judgment"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CBS_Sports", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "CBS Sports"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_bankruptcy_court", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "United States bankruptcy court"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Default_(finance)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Default (finance)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mercedes-Benz", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Mercedes-Benz"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_New_York_Times", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "The New York Times"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Limited_liability_company", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Limited liability company"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Law/Legal_Information", "label": "dmoz/Society/Law/Legal Information", "wgt": 8}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Business", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Business", "wgt": 8}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Software/File_Management", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Software/File Management", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Law/Organizations", "label": "dmoz/Society/Law/Organizations", "wgt": 8}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Agriculture_and_Forestry/Import_and_Export", "label": "dmoz/Business/Agriculture and Forestry/Import and Export", "wgt": 8}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 61}], "image": "https://i0.wp.com/moguldom.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/1200Son-of-Deion-Sanders-Files-For-Bankruptcy-To-Protect-Assets-Against-Lawsuit-5-Things-To-Know.jpg?resize=1024%2C576&ssl=1", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9620177", "eventUri": "eng-9620177", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.08235294117647063, "wgt": 199, "relevance": 1}

To achieve this, Sanders has employed an unconventional training regimen. Well Off Media posted a video on Friday showcasing the team, including star players Travis Hunter and Shedeur Sanders, engaging in Navy SEAL training activities.\n\nThe video captures the team participating in rigorous water training exercises such as holding their breath underwater, swimming across a pool while keeping hold of their backpacks, and racing to swim the pool's length as quickly as possible.\n\nThis unique approach is part of Coach Prime's broader strategy to expose his team to the varied and demanding training routines of the United States Armed Forces. Earlier in January, Sanders had already introduced the team to a grueling session led by U.S. Marines. With only a few months left before the season starts, Sanders plans to complete this comprehensive military-style training by incorporating elements from the Army, Air Force, and Space Force. This method aims to test and build the players' resilience, discipline, and teamwork, traits that Sanders believes are crucial for success on the football field.\n\nThe hope is that these demanding training sessions will translate into better performance during the 2024 season. Sanders' first year saw the Buffaloes finish with a disappointing 4-8 record, losing the final six games after a promising 3-0 start. The upcoming season also marks Colorado's return to the Big 12 Conference after 14 years in the Pac-12. The team's opener against North Dakota State on August 29 at Folsom Field will be a critical test of their preparedness and the effectiveness of their offseason training.\n\nBy pushing his team through these intense training programs, Sanders aims to instill a level of mental toughness and physical endurance that could make a significant difference in their performance.

He otherwise often has displayed his necklaces more like his father and coach, Deion Sanders. who wears expensive chains over his shirts, not underneath. That's the point in his case:\n\nWhy would you have this kind of jewelry if you're not going to show it?\n\nBut in Shilo's case, it turns out there are big reasons to bury the bling these days.\n\n\"He needs to be laying low because that (bling) is going to raise questions,\" said Nicole Stanton, a bankruptcy attorney in Atlanta.\n\nBlame it on his troubling legal situation. Shilo Sanders declared bankruptcy in October, hoping to discharge about $11 million in debt from a court judgment against him in Texas. It's up to the court whether to discharge that debt. But if it denies the discharge, that judgment is owed to a man who has been closely monitoring any of Sanders' possessions that could be sold to collect on it, including Shilo's necklaces and especially the business deals that bring him income from his name, image and likeness (NIL).\n\nThe necklaces alone show some of the strange dimensions of this situation for Shilo Sanders, 24, who comes from a famous family that is known for its displays of wealth and luxury. Flashing bling is part of the Sanders family brand, including custom-made diamond necklaces and his quarterback brother's famous wristwatch.\n\nBut because of the bankruptcy, Shilo now has incentive to look like he's poor while still being truthful in disclosing all that he owns in court, as required by law.\n\nIt's because he's being watched. The attorneys for the man seeking to collect on that judgment have been looking for public displays of his wealth and have questioned if he's illegally hiding assets that could be sold to pay off his debt - which Sanders' attorneys have denied.\n\nSo he needs to heed some advice, legal experts said - Disclose all you own in court but don't give any potential debt collector more reasons to question where you're getting the money to buy new things or whether certain necklaces you're wearing were properly included in your court disclosures.\n\n\"If the bling-bling is his, you don't wear it,\" said Mechele Dickerson, a law professor at the University of Texas. \"If the bling-bling is part of an NIL deal that is with a jeweler, he could give it back. You don't own it anyway (in that case), so just give it back. A good lawyer would say you need to show up looking like a bum from now until the case is dismissed.\"\n\nIn the Instagram video, Shilo appears to touch the necklace at one point to make sure it's tucked in place, though his intent for tucking it in is not known. The University of Colorado has said Shilo and his father declined comment on the pending bankruptcy case.\n\n\"Love how he tucked in the jewelry. Read the room,\" one commenter said about it on Instagram.\n\nHow he discloses his jewelry has been an issue in his bankruptcy case from the start. In his initial Chapter 7 bankruptcy filing in October, he listed $478,000 in assets, including necklaces he valued at $75,000. His attorney then amended the value of his assets in December down to about $320,000 and removed the necklaces from the list of assets he owned, changing it to say he had $75,000 in necklaces that were on loan pursuant to an NIL deal with Saki Diamonds.\n\n\"They're going to have to prove that,\" said Stanton, who is not involved in the case. \"How do you prove that? Affidavits. Testimony. Give it back.\"\n\nIn late February, the trustee overseeing Sanders' bankruptcy estate requested access to Sanders' home to complete an inventory of his assets. The trustee also requested an inventory of the jewelry with the name, telephone number and addresses of the alleged owners, the trustee's attorney said in a court filing in February.\n\n\"The Trustee further requested any contracts between the Debtor (Sanders), Debtor-affiliated entities and third parties that would show that the jewelry was used for promotional purpose,\" the court filing said. \"No information has been provided.\"\n\nSanders' attorney replied that Sanders \"is cooperating in all respects\" with the trustee, but it's not clear if he provided what was sought. His attorney and Saki Diamonds didn't return messages seeking comment.\n\nAfter Sanders' attorney removed his necklaces from his list of assets, it raised eyebrows with attorneys for the man who is trying to collect on the judgment against him. That man is John Darjean, a security guard at Sanders' old high school in Dallas.\n\nDarjean sued Sanders in 2016, claiming Sanders assaulted him and caused him permanent injuries in an incident at the school in 2015, when Sanders was just 15 years old. Sanders disputed the allegations but didn't show up for the trial in March 2022 after he dropped his attorneys in 2020 and then didn't receive a notice in the mail about the trial because it went to his old address.\n\nWithout Sanders there to contest the allegations in person, the Dallas County court accepted Darjean's version of what happened and awarded him the $11.89 million judgment by default. Sanders's attorney said he didn't even know about the judgment until last year but filed for bankruptcy soon after he did.\n\nIt was hard to miss after Darjean's attorneys started aggressively pursuing debt collection efforts against Sanders and cited his displays of wealth on social media.\n\nIn a court filing in Texas on Oct. 19, 2023, Darjean's attorney even took steps to get a court-appointed receiver to collect on the judgment, noting that Sanders hadn't paid the debt but had shown plenty of property that could be subject to seizure to help satisfy the judgment.\n\n\"Mr. Sanders displays his valuable jewelry collection, which should be considered non-exempt (for seizure) as he wears it publicly and never mentions that such jewelry is owned by anyone else but himself or on loan from any sponsors,\" Darjean's attorney wrote in that filing. \"In the below (Instagram) pages, Mr. Sanders is wearing diamond necklaces that are non-exempt assets and he is proud of it, too.\"\n\nThe Instagram posts showed Sanders wearing flashy necklaces. Four days after that filing, Sanders filed for bankruptcy.\n\nSanders is seeking to have the debt discharged and has disputed whether the injury claimed by Darjean came from the alleged assault, according to court records. But Darjean, a former pro baseball player, is fighting that in court and says it should not be discharged because he said Sanders acted \"willfully and maliciously\" with respect to Darjean's alleged injuries - which would prevent such a discharge under the law.\n\nIf it's not discharged, Sanders' non-exempt possessions could be rounded up and sold to pay Darjean.\n\nSanders just has to be careful in the meantime. Though it might be tempting to hide non-exempt assets away from Darjean's potential grasp, it's against the law and could prevent a discharge of his debt if he ever transferred, destroyed or concealed such property within a year before the date of his bankruptcy filing in October. He also can't do that after the filing if those assets were owned before then, such as jewelry or cash. Darjean's attorney declined comment.\n\nBy contrast, money earned after the filing is off-limits to creditors, said Angela Littwin, a bankruptcy expert and law professor at the University of Texas.\n\n\"But if a debtor used non-exempt cash from before he filed for bankruptcy to buy new assets, the trustee would try to trace the new assets to the old cash and thus access the new assets for the benefit of the creditors,\" Littwin said.\n\nDarjean is watching Shilo for that, too. In January, for example, Shilo's older brother Deion Jr. posted a video on YouTube that suggested Deion Sanders' sons were buying their father a new mansion in Colorado. Darjean's attorneys saw it and said in a bankruptcy court filing that it \"raises a plethora of questions regarding the resources of Shilo used in the acquisition, whether those resources were disclosed in the schedules or at the creditors meeting, and the timing of the deployment of such resources to acquire the property.\"\n\nThe purchase of the mansion never happened, however. Shilo Sanders' attorneys said the allegation of buying a house was based on \"pure conjecture and media hype.\"\n\nThe case goes on in the meantime as Darjean seeks to have the court determine that Sanders' debt to him is not dischargeable. Those proceedings are expected to drag on well into the summer unless it's settled before then.\n\nFollow reporter Brent Schrotenboer @Schrotenboer.

The Buffaloes topped 2022 College Football Playoff runner-up TCU before blowing out Nebraska in the first game of the Sanders era at Folsom Field. They beat Colorado State the next week.\n\nCU would win one game the rest of the season.\n\nNow the Buffs enter Year Two in a similar situation to Year One. There has been another exodus and influx of transfers. Two new coordinators have arrived in Boulder, and CU is once again a subject of attention and source of controversy with a Week Two matchup at Nebraska growing ever-so-slightly nearer.\n\nPeople are also reading...

Their respective replacements are Robert Livingston and Pat Shurmur. Livingston was hired after 12 years as the Cincinnati Bengals' secondary coach, and Shurmur was an analyst at CU after a lengthy career in the NFL.\n\n\"You have 127 years of NFL experience up under this roof,\" Deion Sanders told reporters after Colorado's spring game. \"It's on you. We are a tremendous navigation system to the game that you want to play. We know what we're doing. We know how to get there because we've been there, especially as a collective group.\n\n\"Now, what separates me from everyone else is I've sat in three seats. I gave you a dramatic pause so you can follow me. I'm the parent, right? A couple kids in college football. I've been the kid, right? A straight dog. And now I'm the coach.\"\n\nThey'll be tasked with improving a team that's still rebuilding after the shine of last September faded. Colorado's hot start and Sanders' bravado briefly masked the glaring holes remaining in a roster that went 1-11 in 2022. Even with new personnel, the Buffaloes' defense allowed 6.3 yards per play and almost 35 points per game last season.\n\nMeanwhile, a shoddy offensive line struggled to keep Shedeur Sanders upright and healthy. He was sacked 52 times and missed the final game of the season with a fracture in his back. Former NFL veteran tackle and Oklahoma grad Phil Loadholt -- who played against Nebraska in 2008 -- is now the position coach in the trenches.\n\nFor as much change as the coaching staff has undergone, the roster turnover is more dramatic. Forty-one players have left CU through the transfer portal since the end of last season, according to 247 Sports, and 42 have arrived.\n\nAmong the notable departures is Dylan Edwards, a quick, shifty running back who accounted for 620 total yards as a freshman, and Cormani McClain, once a five-star cornerback prospect. He'll spend next season at Florida.\n\nEthan Boyd is in the fold on the offensive line, the redshirt junior from Michigan State bringing some much-needed stability and Power Five experience to a paper-thin unit. Wyatt Hummel was solid at Villanova. He'll make the jump to the FBS level. Others, like Payton Kirkland and Zack Owens, were highly recruited out of high school but haven't gotten significant playing time in college.\n\nThey're additions to a roster that's gotten a makeover for the second straight offseason, representing a program still seeking the right combination.\n\n\"Whatever 11 players is out there, we're gonna make the most of it, so if they gotta do what's best for them, that's what's best for them,\" Shedeur Sanders said during the spring. \"And the guys that's coming in, they already know, I tell them straight-up what the mentality is. It's no jealousy, it's no anything in the locker room.\"\n\nAfter 13 seasons in the Pac-12, CU is back in the Big 12, with home games against Baylor, Kansas State, Cincinnati, Utah and Oklahoma State, and road games at UCF, Arizona, Texas Tech and Kansas.\n\nPhotos: Nebraska football takes on No. 22 Colorado 0 Comments Tags Lee-national Be the first to know\n\nGet local news delivered to your

Despite the team's struggles, there has been no speculation about Sanders' departure from Boulder.\n\nThat is, until now, with many surprised by rumors emerging that Sanders isn't fully secure in his position, even with the team having started last season so strongly.\n\nSanders signed a five-year contract worth a staggering 29.5 million dollars. His arrival brought significant attention and revenue to the program.\n\nIn the 2023 season alone, his influence helped the school rake in $45 million in revenue and media money.\n\nHe warned that a 5-7 season could lead to the organization considering a coaching change. McChesney further emphasized that Sanders' reputation alone might not suffice if the team continues to underperform.\n\n\"Take away his name, go 4-8 and 5-7, and lose your best players, and you can't refill the coffers with a five-star quarterback if they don't get the kid from SC that they got all their money on,\" he remarked.\n\nMcChesney's comments highlight a growing sentiment among some Colorado fans and alumni. If the Buffaloes don't see a significant improvement this season, the pressure on Sanders will be immense heading into 2025.\n\nCompounding the issue, key players like Travis Hunter, Shedeur, and Shilo Sanders are expected to enter the NFL in 2025.

The Buffaloes topped 2022 College Football Playoff runner-up TCU before blowing out Nebraska in the first game of the Sanders era at Folsom Field. They beat Colorado State the next week.\n\nCU would win one game the rest of the season.\n\nNow the Buffs enter Year Two in a similar situation to Year One. There has been another exodus and influx of transfers. Two new coordinators have arrived in Boulder, and CU is once again a subject of attention and source of controversy with a Week Two matchup at Nebraska growing ever-so-slightly nearer.\n\nPeople are also reading...

Their respective replacements are Robert Livingston and Pat Shurmur. Livingston was hired after 12 years as the Cincinnati Bengals' secondary coach, and Shurmur was an analyst at CU after a lengthy career in the NFL.\n\n\"You have 127 years of NFL experience up under this roof,\" Deion Sanders told reporters after Colorado's spring game. \"It's on you. We are a tremendous navigation system to the game that you want to play. We know what we're doing. We know how to get there because we've been there, especially as a collective group.\n\n\"Now, what separates me from everyone else is I've sat in three seats. I gave you a dramatic pause so you can follow me. I'm the parent, right? A couple kids in college football. I've been the kid, right? A straight dog. And now I'm the coach.\"\n\nThey'll be tasked with improving a team that's still rebuilding after the shine of last September faded. Colorado's hot start and Sanders' bravado briefly masked the glaring holes remaining in a roster that went 1-11 in 2022. Even with new personnel, the Buffaloes' defense allowed 6.3 yards per play and almost 35 points per game last season.\n\nMeanwhile, a shoddy offensive line struggled to keep Shedeur Sanders upright and healthy. He was sacked 52 times and missed the final game of the season with a fracture in his back. Former NFL veteran tackle and Oklahoma grad Phil Loadholt -- who played against Nebraska in 2008 -- is now the position coach in the trenches.\n\nFor as much change as the coaching staff has undergone, the roster turnover is more dramatic. Forty-one players have left CU through the transfer portal since the end of last season, according to 247 Sports, and 42 have arrived.\n\nAmong the notable departures is Dylan Edwards, a quick, shifty running back who accounted for 620 total yards as a freshman, and Cormani McClain, once a five-star cornerback prospect. He'll spend next season at Florida.\n\nEthan Boyd is in the fold on the offensive line, the redshirt junior from Michigan State bringing some much-needed stability and Power Five experience to a paper-thin unit. Wyatt Hummel was solid at Villanova. He'll make the jump to the FBS level. Others, like Payton Kirkland and Zack Owens, were highly recruited out of high school but haven't gotten significant playing time in college.\n\nThey're additions to a roster that's gotten a makeover for the second straight offseason, representing a program still seeking the right combination.\n\n\"Whatever 11 players is out there, we're gonna make the most of it, so if they gotta do what's best for them, that's what's best for them,\" Shedeur Sanders said during the spring. \"And the guys that's coming in, they already know, I tell them straight-up what the mentality is. It's no jealousy, it's no anything in the locker room.\"\n\nAfter 13 seasons in the Pac-12, CU is back in the Big 12, with home games against Baylor, Kansas State, Cincinnati, Utah and Oklahoma State, and road games at UCF, Arizona, Texas Tech and Kansas.\n\nPhotos: Nebraska football takes on No. 22 Colorado Tags Lee-national Be the first to know\n\nGet local news delivered to your inbox!\n\nSign

Their respective replacements are Robert Livingston and Pat Shurmur. Livingston was hired after 12 years as the Cincinnati Bengals' secondary coach, and Shurmur was an analyst at CU after a lengthy career in the NFL.\n\n\"You have 127 years of NFL experience up under this roof,\" Deion Sanders told reporters after Colorado's spring game. \"It's on you. We are a tremendous navigation system to the game that you want to play. We know what we're doing. We know how to get there because we've been there, especially as a collective group.\n\n\"Now, what separates me from everyone else is I've sat in three seats. I gave you a dramatic pause so you can follow me. I'm the parent, right? A couple kids in college football. I've been the kid, right? A straight dog. And now I'm the coach.\"\n\nThey'll be tasked with improving a team that's still rebuilding after the shine of last September faded. Colorado's hot start and Sanders' bravado briefly masked the glaring holes remaining in a roster that went 1-11 in 2022. Even with new personnel, the Buffaloes' defense allowed 6.3 yards per play and almost 35 points per game last season.\n\nMeanwhile, a shoddy offensive line struggled to keep Shedeur Sanders upright and healthy. He was sacked 52 times and missed the final game of the season with a fracture in his back. Former NFL veteran tackle and Oklahoma grad Phil Loadholt -- who played against Nebraska in 2008 -- is now the position coach in the trenches.\n\nFor as much change as the coaching staff has undergone, the roster turnover is more dramatic. Forty-one players have left CU through the transfer portal since the end of last season, according to 247 Sports, and 42 have arrived.\n\nAmong the notable departures is Dylan Edwards, a quick, shifty running back who accounted for 620 total yards as a freshman, and Cormani McClain, once a five-star cornerback prospect. He'll spend next season at Florida.\n\nEthan Boyd is in the fold on the offensive line, the redshirt junior from Michigan State bringing some much-needed stability and Power Five experience to a paper-thin unit. Wyatt Hummel was solid at Villanova. He'll make the jump to the FBS level. Others, like Payton Kirkland and Zack Owens, were highly recruited out of high school but haven't gotten significant playing time in college.\n\nThey're additions to a roster that's gotten a makeover for the second straight offseason, representing a program still seeking the right combination.\n\n\"Whatever 11 players is out there, we're gonna make the most of it, so if they gotta do what's best for them, that's what's best for them,\" Shedeur Sanders said during the spring. \"And the guys that's coming in, they already know, I tell them straight-up what the mentality is. It's no jealousy, it's no anything in the locker room.\"\n\nAfter 13 seasons in the Pac-12, CU is back in the Big 12, with home games against Baylor, Kansas State, Cincinnati, Utah and Oklahoma State, and road games at UCF, Arizona, Texas Tech and Kansas.\n\nPhotos: Nebraska football takes on No. 22 Colorado Tags Lee-national Be the first to know\n\nGet local news delivered to your inbox!\n\nSign

We know how to get there because we've been there, especially as a collective group.\n\n\"Now, what separates me from everyone else is I've sat in three seats. I gave you a dramatic pause so you can follow me. I'm the parent, right? A couple kids in college football. I've been the kid, right? A straight dog. And now I'm the coach.\"\n\nThey'll be tasked with improving a team that's still rebuilding after the shine of last September faded. Colorado's hot start and Sanders' bravado briefly masked the glaring holes remaining in a roster that went 1-11 in 2022. Even with new personnel, the Buffaloes' defense allowed 6.3 yards per play and almost 35 points per game last season.\n\nMeanwhile, a shoddy offensive line struggled to keep Shedeur Sanders upright and healthy. He was sacked 52 times and missed the final game of the season with a fracture in his back. Former NFL veteran tackle and Oklahoma grad Phil Loadholt -- who played against Nebraska in 2008 -- is now the position coach in the trenches.\n\nFor as much change as the coaching staff has undergone, the roster turnover is more dramatic. Forty-one players have left CU through the transfer portal since the end of last season, according to 247 Sports, and 42 have arrived.\n\nAmong the notable departures is Dylan Edwards, a quick, shifty running back who accounted for 620 total yards as a freshman, and Cormani McClain, once a five-star cornerback prospect. He'll spend next season at Florida.\n\nEthan Boyd is in the fold on the offensive line, the redshirt junior from Michigan State bringing some much-needed stability and Power Five experience to a paper-thin unit. Wyatt Hummel was solid at Villanova. He'll make the jump to the FBS level. Others, like Payton Kirkland and Zack Owens, were highly recruited out of high school but haven't gotten significant playing time in college.\n\nThey're additions to a roster that's gotten a makeover for the second straight offseason, representing a program still seeking the right combination.\n\n\"Whatever 11 players is out there, we're gonna make the most of it, so if they gotta do what's best for them, that's what's best for them,\" Shedeur Sanders said during the spring. \"And the guys that's coming in, they already know, I tell them straight-up what the mentality is. It's no jealousy, it's no anything in the locker room.\"\n\nAfter 13 seasons in the Pac-12, CU is back in the Big 12, with home games against Baylor, Kansas State, Cincinnati, Utah and Oklahoma State, and road games at UCF, Arizona, Texas Tech and Kansas.\n\nPhotos: Nebraska football takes on No. 22 Colorado Tags Lee-national Can't get enough High School sports?

The Buffaloes topped 2022 College Football Playoff runner-up TCU before blowing out Nebraska in the first game of the Sanders era at Folsom Field. They beat Colorado State the next week.\n\nCU would win one game the rest of the season.\n\nNow the Buffs enter Year Two in a similar situation to Year One. There has been another exodus and influx of transfers. Two new coordinators have arrived in Boulder, and CU is once again a subject of attention and source of controversy with a Week Two matchup at Nebraska growing ever-so-slightly nearer.\n\nPeople are also reading...

Tcl Jsu\n\nDeion Sanders has lived his life out loud and free, and one of the most telling reflections of this is his car collection. Over the years, he has collected a beautiful array of cars, ranging from absurdly expensive vehicles to nice, economical ones. However, one car that he specifically modified for himself back in the '90s, arguably suiting his personality, is still a topic of conversation, with Sanders himself recently sharing it as a throwback video.\n\nIt was a modified Marcedes golf cart, which Deion Sanders showcased in his throwback video. When the Cowboys assigned golf carts to their players to get around the facility, Sanders had to level up and bring his own. And level up he did, with a $30,000 golf cart complete with a built-in boom box and even air conditioning.\n\n\"Coach Prime in '96 at training camp,\" wrote the Buffaloes head coach in the caption, reminiscing about his time trying his hand at the receiver position. Notably, Prime had clinched his first Super Bowl a year back with the Niners and went on to add another ring in the upcoming season with America's Team.\n\nInterestingly, the love for vehicles isn't just limited to the CU head coach. His sons have also been indoctrinated with Prime's love for vehicles. For his son Shedeur's 15th birthday, Coach Prime went on to gift him a $40,000 truck.\n\nOver the years, the young QB has continued to indulge in his love for cars, adding several more vehicles to his garage. These include the luxurious Mercedes EQB and Corvette Stingray, along with additions such as the Mercedes-Maybach GLS 600, Lamborghini Urus, Rolls Royce Cullinan, and Dodge Durango Hellcat.\n\nAs the throwback video went viral, fans flocked to the comments to express their fascination with the peculiar vehicle that Sanders was driving. While some noted that Deion Sanders is likely the reason why his sons share his passion for vehicles, others weren't at all surprised that the CU head man had such a vehicle. See for yourselves:\n\nNevertheless, Deion Sanders and his Buffaloes are going into the 2024 season on the back of a disappointing debut, which saw them at the bottom of the Pac-12. Surely, Prime aims to secure a Bowl Game this season, which might potentially impact his QB son's draft slot. Off the field, Prime has been stealing hearts, and the hungry fans will expect the same when his second season at Boulder starts in August.", "source": {"uri": "thesportsrush.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The SportsRush"}, "authors": [{"uri": "aditya_rajput@thesportsrush.com", "name": "Aditya Rajput", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deion_Sanders", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Deion Sanders"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golf_cart", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Golf cart"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Head_coach", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Head coach"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coach_Prime", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Coach Prime"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shedeur_Sanders", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Shedeur Sanders"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Veterans_Memorial_Stadium_(Troy_University)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Veterans Memorial Stadium (Troy University)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jackson_State_University", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Jackson State University"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jacksonville_State_University", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Jacksonville State University"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quarterback", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Quarterback"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jackson,_Mississippi", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Jackson, Mississippi"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Jackson, Mississippi"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colorado_Buffaloes_football", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Colorado Buffaloes football"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Training_camp", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Training camp"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_Colorado_Boulder", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "University of Colorado Boulder"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Super_Bowl", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Super Bowl"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Air_conditioning", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Air conditioning"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mercedes-Benz_EQB", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Mercedes-Benz EQB"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pac-12_Conference", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Pac-12 Conference"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lamborghini_Urus", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Lamborghini Urus"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chrysler_Hemi_engine", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Chrysler Hemi engine"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chevrolet_Corvette_(C3)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Chevrolet Corvette (C3)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dodge_Durango", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Dodge Durango"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maybach", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Maybach"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mercedes-Benz", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Mercedes-Benz"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boulder,_Colorado", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Boulder, Colorado"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Boulder, Colorado"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Classifieds/Automotive", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Classifieds/Automotive", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Alternative/Coaching", "label": "dmoz/Health/Alternative/Coaching", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Financial_Services/Automobile_Buying_and_Financing", "label": "dmoz/Business/Financial Services/Automobile Buying and Financing", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Automotive/Electric_Vehicles", "label": "dmoz/Business/Automotive/Electric Vehicles", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Coaching", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Coaching", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 95}], "image": "https://cdn-wp.thesportsrush.com/2023/12/7b21e37d-fi-11.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9620177", "eventUri": "eng-9620177", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.3254901960784313, "wgt": 180, "relevance": 1}

The Buffaloes topped 2022 College Football Playoff runner-up TCU before blowing out Nebraska in the first game of the Sanders era at Folsom Field. They beat Colorado State the next week.\n\nCU would win one game the rest of the season.\n\nNow the Buffs enter Year Two in a similar situation to Year One. There has been another exodus and influx of transfers. Two new coordinators have arrived in Boulder, and CU is once again a subject of attention and source of controversy with a Week Two matchup at Nebraska growing ever-so-slightly nearer.\n\nPeople are also reading...

Their respective replacements are Robert Livingston and Pat Shurmur. Livingston was hired after 12 years as the Cincinnati Bengals' secondary coach, and Shurmur was an analyst at CU after a lengthy career in the NFL.\n\n\"You have 127 years of NFL experience up under this roof,\" Deion Sanders told reporters after Colorado's spring game. \"It's on you. We are a tremendous navigation system to the game that you want to play. We know what we're doing. We know how to get there because we've been there, especially as a collective group.\n\n\"Now, what separates me from everyone else is I've sat in three seats.

And now I'm the coach.\"\n\nListen now and subscribe: Apple Podcasts | Google Podcasts | Spotify | RSS Feed | Omny Studio\n\nThey'll be tasked with improving a team that's still rebuilding after the shine of last September faded. Colorado's hot start and Sanders' bravado briefly masked the glaring holes remaining in a roster that went 1-11 in 2022. Even with new personnel, the Buffaloes' defense allowed 6.3 yards per play and almost 35 points per game last season.\n\nMeanwhile, a shoddy offensive line struggled to keep Shedeur Sanders upright and healthy. He was sacked 52 times and missed the final game of the season with a fracture in his back. Former NFL veteran tackle and Oklahoma grad Phil Loadholt -- who played against Nebraska in 2008 -- is now the position coach in the trenches.\n\nFor as much change as the coaching staff has undergone, the roster turnover is more dramatic. Forty-one players have left CU through the transfer portal since the end of last season, according to 247 Sports, and 42 have arrived.\n\nAmong the notable departures is Dylan Edwards, a quick, shifty running back who accounted for 620 total yards as a freshman, and Cormani McClain, once a five-star cornerback prospect. He'll spend next season at Florida.\n\nEthan Boyd is in the fold on the offensive line, the redshirt junior from Michigan State bringing some much-needed stability and Power Five experience to a paper-thin unit. Wyatt Hummel was solid at Villanova. He'll make the jump to the FBS level. Others, like Payton Kirkland and Zack Owens, were highly recruited out of high school but haven't gotten significant playing time in college.\n\nThey're additions to a roster that's gotten a makeover for the second straight offseason, representing a program still seeking the right combination.\n\n\"Whatever 11 players is out there, we're gonna make the most of it, so if they gotta do what's best for them, that's what's best for them,\" Shedeur Sanders said during the spring. \"And the guys that's coming in, they already know, I tell them straight-up what the mentality is. It's no jealousy, it's no anything in the locker room.\"\n\nAfter 13 seasons in the Pac-12, CU is back in the Big 12, with home games against Baylor, Kansas State, Cincinnati, Utah and Oklahoma State, and road games at UCF, Arizona, Texas Tech and Kansas.\n\nPhotos: Nebraska football takes on No. 22 Colorado Tags Lee-national", "source": {"uri": "richmond.com", "dataType": "news", "title":

The Navy's official website states the second phase of training is combat diving and it takes seven weeks:\n\n\"This phase introduces underwater skills that are unique to Navy SEALs. During this phase, candidates become basic combat swimmers and learn open and closed-circuit diving. Successful Second Phase candidates demonstrate a high level of comfort in the water and the ability to perform in stressful and often uncomfortable environments. candidates who are not completely comfortable in the water often struggle to succeed.\"\n\nCoach Prime is apparently using the offseason to put his team his way through every branch of United States Armed Forces training. He brought in a group of U.S. Marines for a training session in January.\n\nSanders only has a couple of months left to bring in someone from the Army, Air Force and Space Force to see how many of his players can make it through those training regimens.\n\nCoach Prime will be hoping the unique training for his team leads to better results on the field in 2024. He led the Buffaloes to a 4-8 record in his first season, but they lost eight of their final nine games after a 3-0 start.\n\nThe 2024 season will mark Colorado's return to the Big 12 after spending the past 13 seasons in the Pac-12. It will open the season on Aug. 29 against North Dakota State at Folsom Field.", "source": {"uri": "bleacherreport.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Bleacher Report"}, "authors": [{"uri": "adam_wells@bleacherreport.com", "name": "Adam Wells", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deion_Sanders", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Deion Sanders"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Navy_SEALs", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "United States Navy SEALs"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shedeur_Sanders", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Shedeur Sanders"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Travis_Hunter_(American_football)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Travis Hunter (American football)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colorado_Buffaloes_football", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Colorado Buffaloes football"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frogman", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Frogman"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/College_football", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "College football"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colorado", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Colorado"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Colorado"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coach_Prime", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Coach Prime"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diving_(sport)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Diving (sport)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Space_Force", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "United States Space Force"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pac-12_Conference", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Pac-12 Conference"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Folsom_Field", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Folsom Field"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_Dakota_State_Bison_football", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "North Dakota State Bison football"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_12_Conference", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Big 12 Conference"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Air_Force", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "United States Air Force"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Army", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "United States Army"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Marine_Corps", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "United States Marine Corps"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Armed_Forces", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "United States Armed Forces"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Business/Education_and_Training", "label": "dmoz/Business/Education and Training", "wgt": 22}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Education/Commercial_Services", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Education/Commercial Services", "wgt": 24}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Management/Education_and_Training", "label": "dmoz/Business/Management/Education and Training", "wgt": 24}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Human_Resources/Education_and_Training", "label": "dmoz/Business/Human Resources/Education and Training", "wgt": 24}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Internet/Training", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Internet/Training", "wgt": 23}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 61}], "image": "https://media.bleacherreport.com/image/upload/c_fill,g_faces,w_3800,h_2000,q_95/v1717179572/grynk3strxzm2vvt6mwl.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9620177", "eventUri": "eng-9620177", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "date": "-08-29", "textStart": 1964, "textEnd": 1971}], "sentiment": 0.04313725490196085, "wgt": 176, "relevance": 1}

The Buffaloes topped 2022 College Football Playoff runner-up TCU before blowing out Nebraska in the first game of the Sanders era at Folsom Field. They beat Colorado State the next week.\n\nCU would win one game the rest of the season.\n\nNow the Buffs enter Year Two in a similar situation to Year One. There has been another exodus and influx of transfers. Two new coordinators have arrived in Boulder, and CU is once again a subject of attention and source of controversy with a Week Two matchup at Nebraska growing ever-so-slightly nearer.\n\nPeople are also reading...

Their respective replacements are Robert Livingston and Pat Shurmur. Livingston was hired after 12 years as the Cincinnati Bengals' secondary coach, and Shurmur was an analyst at CU after a lengthy career in the NFL.\n\n\"You have 127 years of NFL experience up under this roof,\" Deion Sanders told reporters after Colorado's spring game. \"It's on you. We are a tremendous navigation system to the game that you want to play. We know what we're doing. We know how to get there because we've been there, especially as a collective group.\n\n\"Now, what separates me from everyone else is I've sat in three seats. I gave you a dramatic pause so you can follow me. I'm the parent, right? A couple kids in college football. I've been the kid, right? A straight dog. And now I'm the coach.\"\n\nThey'll be tasked with improving a team that's still rebuilding after the shine of last September faded. Colorado's hot start and Sanders' bravado briefly masked the glaring holes remaining in a roster that went 1-11 in 2022. Even with new personnel, the Buffaloes' defense allowed 6.3 yards per play and almost 35 points per game last season.\n\nMeanwhile, a shoddy offensive line struggled to keep Shedeur Sanders upright and healthy. He was sacked 52 times and missed the final game of the season with a fracture in his back. Former NFL veteran tackle and Oklahoma grad Phil Loadholt -- who played against Nebraska in 2008 -- is now the position coach in the trenches.\n\nFor as much change as the coaching staff has undergone, the roster turnover is more dramatic. Forty-one players have left CU through the transfer portal since the end of last season, according to 247 Sports, and 42 have arrived.\n\nAmong the notable departures is Dylan Edwards, a quick, shifty running back who accounted for 620 total yards as a freshman, and Cormani McClain, once a five-star cornerback prospect. He'll spend next season at Florida.\n\nEthan Boyd is in the fold on the offensive line, the redshirt junior from Michigan State bringing some much-needed stability and Power Five experience to a paper-thin unit. Wyatt Hummel was solid at Villanova. He'll make the jump to the FBS level. Others, like Payton Kirkland and Zack Owens, were highly recruited out of high school but haven't gotten significant playing time in college.\n\nThey're additions to a roster that's gotten a makeover for the second straight offseason, representing a program still seeking the right combination.\n\n\"Whatever 11 players is out there, we're gonna make the most of it, so if they gotta do what's best for them, that's what's best for them,\" Shedeur Sanders said during the spring. \"And the guys that's coming in, they already know, I tell them straight-up what the mentality is. It's no jealousy, it's no anything in the locker room.\"\n\nAfter 13 seasons in the Pac-12, CU is back in the Big 12, with home games against Baylor, Kansas State, Cincinnati, Utah and Oklahoma State, and road games at UCF, Arizona, Texas Tech and Kansas.\n\nPhotos: Nebraska football takes on No. 22 Colorado Love 0 Funny 0 Wow 0 Sad 0 Angry 0\n\nTags Lee-national Colorado Buffaloes Football Deion

The Buffaloes topped 2022 College Football Playoff runner-up TCU before blowing out Nebraska in the first game of the Sanders era at Folsom Field. They beat Colorado State the next week.\n\nCU would win one game the rest of the season.\n\nNow the Buffs enter Year Two in a similar situation to Year One. There has been another exodus and influx of transfers. Two new coordinators have arrived in Boulder, and CU is once again a subject of attention and source of controversy with a Week Two matchup at Nebraska growing ever-so-slightly nearer.\n\nPeople are also reading...

Their respective replacements are Robert Livingston and Pat Shurmur. Livingston was hired after 12 years as the Cincinnati Bengals' secondary coach, and Shurmur was an analyst at CU after a lengthy career in the NFL.\n\n\"You have 127 years of NFL experience up under this roof,\" Deion Sanders told reporters after Colorado's spring game. \"It's on you. We are a tremendous navigation system to the game that you want to play. We know what we're doing. We know how to get there because we've been there, especially as a collective group.\n\n\"Now, what separates me from everyone else is I've sat in three seats. I gave you a dramatic pause so you can follow me. I'm the parent, right? A couple kids in college football. I've been the kid, right? A straight dog. And now I'm the coach.\"\n\nThey'll be tasked with improving a team that's still rebuilding after the shine of last September faded. Colorado's hot start and Sanders' bravado briefly masked the glaring holes remaining in a roster that went 1-11 in 2022. Even with new personnel, the Buffaloes' defense allowed 6.3 yards per play and almost 35 points per game last season.\n\nMeanwhile, a shoddy offensive line struggled to keep Shedeur Sanders upright and healthy. He was sacked 52 times and missed the final game of the season with a fracture in his back. Former NFL veteran tackle and Oklahoma grad Phil Loadholt -- who played against Nebraska in 2008 -- is now the position coach in the trenches.\n\nFor as much change as the coaching staff has undergone, the roster turnover is more dramatic. Forty-one players have left CU through the transfer portal since the end of last season, according to 247 Sports, and 42 have arrived.\n\nAmong the notable departures is Dylan Edwards, a quick, shifty running back who accounted for 620 total yards as a freshman, and Cormani McClain, once a five-star cornerback prospect. He'll spend next season at Florida.\n\nEthan Boyd is in the fold on the offensive line, the redshirt junior from Michigan State bringing some much-needed stability and Power Five experience to a paper-thin unit. Wyatt Hummel was solid at Villanova. He'll make the jump to the FBS level. Others, like Payton Kirkland and Zack Owens, were highly recruited out of high school but haven't gotten significant playing time in college.\n\nThey're additions to a roster that's gotten a makeover for the second straight offseason, representing a program still seeking the right combination.\n\n\"Whatever 11 players is out there, we're gonna make the most of it, so if they gotta do what's best for them, that's what's best for them,\" Shedeur Sanders said during the spring. \"And the guys that's coming in, they already know, I tell them straight-up what the mentality is. It's no jealousy, it's no anything in the locker room.\"\n\nAfter 13 seasons in the Pac-12, CU is back in the Big 12, with home games against Baylor, Kansas State, Cincinnati, Utah and Oklahoma State, and road games at UCF, Arizona, Texas Tech and Kansas.\n\nPhotos: Nebraska football takes on No. 22 Colorado 0 Comments Love 0 Funny 0 Wow 0 Sad 0 Angry 0\n\nTags Lee-national Be the first to

He otherwise often has displayed his necklaces more like his father and coach, Deion Sanders. who wears expensive chains over his shirts, not underneath. That's the point in his case:\n\nWhy would you have this kind of jewelry if you're not going to show it?\n\nBut in Shilo's case, it turns out there are big reasons to bury the bling these days.\n\n\"He needs to be laying low because that (bling) is going to raise questions,\" said Nicole Stanton, a bankruptcy attorney in Atlanta.\n\nBlame it on his troubling legal situation. Shilo Sanders declared bankruptcy in October, hoping to discharge about $11 million in debt from a court judgment against him in Texas. It's up to the court whether to discharge that debt. But if it denies the discharge, that judgment is owed to a man who has been closely monitoring any of Sanders' possessions that could be sold to collect on it, including Shilo's necklaces and especially the business deals that bring him income from his name, image and likeness (NIL).\n\nThe necklaces alone show some of the strange dimensions of this situation for Shilo Sanders, 24, who comes from a famous family that is known for its displays of wealth and luxury. Flashing bling is part of the Sanders family brand, including custom-made diamond necklaces and his quarterback brother's famous wristwatch.\n\nBut because of the bankruptcy, Shilo now has incentive to look like he's poor while still being truthful in disclosing all that he owns in court, as required by law.\n\nIt's because he's being watched. The attorneys for the man seeking to collect on that judgment have been looking for public displays of his wealth and have questioned if he's illegally hiding assets that could be sold to pay off his debt - which Sanders' attorneys have denied.\n\nSo he needs to heed some advice, legal experts said - Disclose all you own in court but don't give any potential debt collector more reasons to question where you're getting the money to buy new things or whether certain necklaces you're wearing were properly included in your court disclosures.\n\n\"If the bling-bling is his, you don't wear it,\" said Mechele Dickerson, a law professor at the University of Texas. \"If the bling-bling is part of an NIL deal that is with a jeweler, he could give it back. You don't own it anyway (in that case), so just give it back. A good lawyer would say you need to show up looking like a bum from now until the case is dismissed.\"\n\nIn the Instagram video, Shilo appears to touch the necklace at one point to make sure it's tucked in place, though his intent for tucking it in is not known. The University of Colorado has said Shilo and his father declined comment on the pending bankruptcy case.\n\n\"Love how he tucked in the jewelry. Read the room,\" one commenter said about it on Instagram.\n\nHow he discloses his jewelry has been an issue in his bankruptcy case from the start. In his initial Chapter 7 bankruptcy filing in October, he listed $478,000 in assets, including necklaces he valued at $75,000. His attorney then amended the value of his assets in December down to about $320,000 and removed the necklaces from the list of assets he owned, changing it to say he had $75,000 in necklaces that were on loan pursuant to an NIL deal with Saki Diamonds.\n\n\"They're going to have to prove that,\" said Stanton, who is not involved in the case. \"How do you prove that? Affidavits. Testimony. Give it back.\"\n\nIn late February, the trustee overseeing Sanders' bankruptcy estate requested access to Sanders' home to complete an inventory of his assets. The trustee also requested an inventory of the jewelry with the name, telephone number and addresses of the alleged owners, the trustee's attorney said in a court filing in February.\n\n\"The Trustee further requested any contracts between the Debtor (Sanders), Debtor-affiliated entities and third parties that would show that the jewelry was used for promotional purpose,\" the court filing said. \"No information has been provided.\"\n\nSanders' attorney replied that Sanders \"is cooperating in all respects\" with the trustee, but it's not clear if he provided what was sought. His attorney and Saki Diamonds didn't return messages seeking comment.\n\nAfter Sanders' attorney removed his necklaces from his list of assets, it raised eyebrows with attorneys for the man who is trying to collect on the judgment against him. That man is John Darjean, a security guard at Sanders' old high school in Dallas.\n\nDarjean sued Sanders in 2016, claiming Sanders assaulted him and caused him permanent injuries in an incident at the school in 2015, when Sanders was just 15 years old. Sanders disputed the allegations but didn't show up for the trial in March 2022 after he dropped his attorneys in 2020 and then didn't receive a notice in the mail about the trial because it went to his old address.\n\nWithout Sanders there to contest the allegations in person, the Dallas County court accepted Darjean's version of what happened and awarded him the $11.89 million judgment by default. Sanders's attorney said he didn't even know about the judgment until last year but filed for bankruptcy soon after he did.\n\nIt was hard to miss after Darjean's attorneys started aggressively pursuing debt collection efforts against Sanders and cited his displays of wealth on social media.\n\nIn a court filing in Texas on Oct. 19, 2023, Darjean's attorney even took steps to get a court-appointed receiver to collect on the judgment, noting that Sanders hadn't paid the debt but had shown plenty of property that could be subject to seizure to help satisfy the judgment.\n\n\"Mr. Sanders displays his valuable jewelry collection, which should be considered non-exempt (for seizure) as he wears it publicly and never mentions that such jewelry is owned by anyone else but himself or on loan from any sponsors,\" Darjean's attorney wrote in that filing. \"In the below (Instagram) pages, Mr. Sanders is wearing diamond necklaces that are non-exempt assets and he is proud of it, too.\"\n\nThe Instagram posts showed Sanders wearing flashy necklaces. Four days after that filing, Sanders filed for bankruptcy.\n\nSanders is seeking to have the debt discharged and has disputed whether the injury claimed by Darjean came from the alleged assault, according to court records. But Darjean, a former pro baseball player, is fighting that in court and says it should not be discharged because he said Sanders acted \"willfully and maliciously\" with respect to Darjean's alleged injuries - which would prevent such a discharge under the law.\n\nIf it's not discharged, Sanders' non-exempt possessions could be rounded up and sold to pay Darjean.\n\nSanders just has to be careful in the meantime. Though it might be tempting to hide non-exempt assets away from Darjean's potential grasp, it's against the law and could prevent a discharge of his debt if he ever transferred, destroyed or concealed such property within a year before the date of his bankruptcy filing in October. He also can't do that after the filing if those assets were owned before then, such as jewelry or cash. Darjean's attorney declined comment.\n\nBy contrast, money earned after the filing is off-limits to creditors, said Angela Littwin, a bankruptcy expert and law professor at the University of Texas.\n\n\"But if a debtor used non-exempt cash from before he filed for bankruptcy to buy new assets, the trustee would try to trace the new assets to the old cash and thus access the new assets for the benefit of the creditors,\" Littwin said.\n\nDarjean is watching Shilo for that, too. In January, for example, Shilo's older brother Deion Jr. posted a video on YouTube that suggested Deion Sanders' sons were buying their father a new mansion in Colorado. Darjean's attorneys saw it and said in a bankruptcy court filing that it \"raises a plethora of questions regarding the resources of Shilo used in the acquisition, whether those resources were disclosed in the schedules or at the creditors meeting, and the timing of the deployment of such resources to acquire the property.\"\n\nThe purchase of the mansion never happened, however. Shilo Sanders' attorneys said the allegation of buying a house was based on \"pure conjecture and media hype.\"\n\nThe case goes on in the meantime as Darjean seeks to have the court determine that Sanders' debt to him is not dischargeable. Those proceedings are expected to drag on well into the summer unless it's settled before then.", "source": {"uri": "usatoday.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "USA Today"}, "authors": [],

This Bernie Sanders is 73, nine years younger than his congressional counterpart, and spent his career working in New York's garment industry. He moved to Israel in 2019 with his wife, Ruthie.\n\nAbout the only thing he has in common with the senator from Vermont, besides the name, is that they share a gruff \"tell-it-like-it-is\" attitude they both nurtured in their native Brooklyn.\n\n\"Whatever he goes for, I go the other way,\" said the Sanders in front of me, dressed in a gray polo shirt and a black baseball hat framing his salt-and-pepper beard. \"I've got more seichel than him,\" he said using the Yiddish word for intelligence.\n\nThe senatorial Sanders, who spent several months in 1963 volunteering on a kibbutz, called Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu \"a war criminal\" over the weekend. What does the Sanders in Beit Shemesh think of his famous namesake? \"He's an antisemite.\"\n\nThe bearded Sanders, who holds dual American-Israeli citizenship, said his primary source of news about the U.S. is Fox News, and thinks last month's hush money trial, in which Trump became the first U.S. president to be convicted of a felony, was \"a sham\" and that taxpayers' money spent on the prosecution would have been better used to help homeless veterans.\n\n\"I think Trump is good for America,\" Sanders said, citing issues that are important to him: the economy, immigration and Israel.\n\nSanders' views seem to echo those of other Orthodox Americans who made aliyah that I met during a visit last week to Israel. They believe Trump is a better choice for Jews and praise him for following through on his promise to move the U.S. embassy from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem.\n\nSanders thinks America, where he has more than a dozen grandchildren and where he believes colleges are \"basically brainwashing\" students, is facing an existential crisis with President Joe Biden at the helm. \"If there's no change,\" he opined, \"I don't see the light at the end of the tunnel for America.\"\n\nBurlington, Vermont, and Beit Shemesh are around 5,500 miles apart, so there's not much chance that the two Bernie Sanders will ever bump into each other, the old Jewish man equivalent of tinkering with the space-time continuum. Asked if he would like to meet the senator, the Sanders in the back of the synagogue said he has no interest.\n\n\"His views are completely different than mine,\" Sanders said. \"Look at Bernie Sanders' records and what he's for. And I'm exactly the opposite.\" He called the politician's policies \"crazy ideas,\" especially on issues like student loan forgiveness. \"I don't think it's fair because what about all the people that had to go through college and are still paying through the nose for it?\"\n\nMy conversation with Sanders winded around -- about who Trump should pick for vice president (Nikki Haley), the war in Ukraine (\"Why can they do whatever they want, even though it's American arms and ammunitions?\") and Hunter Biden, whose trial in a federal gun case begins today. We eventually ended up talking about retired life in Israel, where Sanders said he enjoys better healthcare than he would have had in the U.S.\n\n\"So you like socialized medicine?\" I asked.\n\n\"I'm very pleasantly surprised,\" he said with a smile.", "source": {"uri": "forward.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Forward"}, "authors": [{"uri": "benyamin_cohen@forward.com", "name": "Benyamin

Known for being an iconic figure in sports, Coach Prime has left his mark on the football world. But he recently transcended back into the world of entertainment.\n\nSanders' ambitions extend beyond the football field. In 1994, he ventured into the music industry with his rap album \"Prime Time.\" Although his musical career did not achieve the same level of success as his football endeavors, it remains a noteworthy chapter in his diverse journey. The hit \"Must be the Money\" was even performed on Saturday Night Live.\n\nPrime and his son, Bucky, spent time in the Death Row Records studio, a nostalgic visit that allowed them to reflect on Sanders' brief foray into the rap game. The studio, once a hub for legendary artists like Dr. Dre, Snoop Dogg, and Tupac Shakur, who each holds a special place in hip hop history.\n\nIronically, Sanders was signed to the famed record label back in the height of the mid-90s, according to Suge Knight. In a previous interview with Nick Cannon's The Daily Cannon, he talked about setting up Prime Time as a lyricist.\n\n\"Deion Sanders -- when Prime wanted to be a rapper, he said, 'I want to be a rapper,'\" Suge recalled. \"I spent over half a million dollars of my own money. I put guys in the studio, I paid Dallas Austin, I did all these songs -- did everything. He went on say, \"Then one day he came to me and said, 'Well, y'know, Prime deal with Nike and Death Row is a Black-owned company, and we don't really want to deal with a Black-owned company. Even though you paid for everything and we signed to you, put us on the Interscope brand.'\"\n\nDuring their visit to SoCal, Sanders enjoyed revisiting tracks from the \"Prime Time\" album, reliving memories from that unique period. Their enthusiasm highlighted Sanders' enduring connection to music and his appreciation for the artistry involved. In an exciting twist, it appears that Sanders and Snoop Dogg are collaborating on new music. The Doggfather has lent his vocals to a remix of Sanders' song \"Must be the Money,\" adding a contemporary flair to the original track. Additionally, Yella Beezy is featured on the remix, further enhancing its appeal.\n\nWhile it remains uncertain if Sanders plans to release the remix on streaming platforms, the possibility has generated significant anticipation.

Deion Sanders' future in Colorado not as secure as his contract says it is\n\nBoth Travis Hunter and Shedeur Sanders had their first try at NCAA footbal last season and they struggled to find their footing. While Travis suffered with an injury that cut short his entire season, Shedeur had to be the man responsible to take the lead on his own. Noen of them had a successful year but they are now ready for more and they are having a ball with their teammates. In a recent video from June 3rd's 'Well Off Media' episode, you can see both Travis Hunter and Shedeur Sanders getting trolled by their younger teammates. At a certain point, they make fun of Travis Hunter's speed or lack there of due to the injury he suffered.\n\nIn a different part of the footage, you can see Shedeur Sanders justifying why he is not running as fast as he can during practice. While he talks about not having so much top speed available, he also confirms he is saving his best sprints for when they play official games. Probably a good tactic because you want to keep most of your cards close to the vest. Both Shedeur Sanders and Travis Hunter are the biggest hope the Colorado Buffaloes have to do something incredible next season. Coach Deion Sanders started off on the right foot last season but that injury was the main reason they didn't do as well as they hoped.\n\nIn the upcoming season, not getting any of these two stars injured will mean that the Buffaloes will have a better chance to do something memorable next season. At least in spirit, both of these players seem ready to take on this new challenge. For now, they need to worry about playing well for their current team and think about a potential NFL Draft later. Coach Prime will also have a complicated task to integrate all the new recruits and find their best skills in order to exploit them. In the past, Sanders has proven to be great at that.

The Buffaloes topped 2022 College Football Playoff runner-up TCU before blowing out Nebraska in the first game of the Sanders era at Folsom Field. They beat Colorado State the next week.\n\nCU would win one game the rest of the season.\n\nNow the Buffs enter Year Two in a similar situation to Year One. There has been another exodus and influx of transfers. Two new coordinators have arrived in Boulder, and CU is once again a subject of attention and source of controversy with a Week Two matchup at Nebraska growing ever-so-slightly nearer.\n\nPeople are also reading...

Their respective replacements are Robert Livingston and Pat Shurmur. Livingston was hired after 12 years as the Cincinnati Bengals' secondary coach, and Shurmur was an analyst at CU after a lengthy career in the NFL.\n\n\"You have 127 years of NFL experience up under this roof,\" Deion Sanders told reporters after Colorado's spring game. \"It's on you. We are a tremendous navigation system to the game that you want to play. We know what we're doing. We know how to get there because we've been there, especially as a collective group.\n\n\"Now, what separates me from everyone else is I've sat in three seats. I gave you a dramatic pause so you can follow me. I'm the parent, right? A couple kids in college football. I've been the kid, right? A straight dog. And now I'm the coach.\"\n\nThey'll be tasked with improving a team that's still rebuilding after the shine of last September faded. Colorado's hot start and Sanders' bravado briefly masked the glaring holes remaining in a roster that went 1-11 in 2022. Even with new personnel, the Buffaloes' defense allowed 6.3 yards per play and almost 35 points per game last season.\n\nMeanwhile, a shoddy offensive line struggled to keep Shedeur Sanders upright and healthy. He was sacked 52 times and missed the final game of the season with a fracture in his back. Former NFL veteran tackle and Oklahoma grad Phil Loadholt -- who played against Nebraska in 2008 -- is now the position coach in the trenches.\n\nFor as much change as the coaching staff has undergone, the roster turnover is more dramatic. Forty-one players have left CU through the transfer portal since the end of last season, according to 247 Sports, and 42 have arrived.\n\nAmong the notable departures is Dylan Edwards, a quick, shifty running back who accounted for 620 total yards as a freshman, and Cormani McClain, once a five-star cornerback prospect. He'll spend next season at Florida.\n\nEthan Boyd is in the fold on the offensive line, the redshirt junior from Michigan State bringing some much-needed stability and Power Five experience to a paper-thin unit. Wyatt Hummel was solid at Villanova. He'll make the jump to the FBS level. Others, like Payton Kirkland and Zack Owens, were highly recruited out of high school but haven't gotten significant playing time in college.\n\nThey're additions to a roster that's gotten a makeover for the second straight offseason, representing a program still seeking the right combination.\n\n\"Whatever 11 players is out there, we're gonna make the most of it, so if they gotta do what's best for them, that's what's best for them,\" Shedeur Sanders said during the spring. \"And the guys that's coming in, they already know, I tell them straight-up what the mentality is. It's no jealousy, it's no anything in the locker room.\"\n\nAfter 13 seasons in the Pac-12, CU is back in the Big 12, with home games against Baylor, Kansas State, Cincinnati, Utah and Oklahoma State, and road games at UCF, Arizona, Texas Tech and Kansas.\n\nPhotos: Nebraska football takes on No. 22 Colorado 0 Comments Love 0 Funny 0 Wow 0 Sad 0 Angry 0\n\nTags Lee-national Be the first to

The Buffaloes started hot going 3-0 to open the 2023 campaign, but then the wheels fell off in humiliating fashion.\n\nColorado and Sanders finished an abysmal 1-8 in the team's final nine games to finish the season 4-8. You'd think that the only kind of content you'd see coming out of Boulder ahead of week one would be related to football.\n\nWell, you'd be wrong.\n\nWell Off Media, which is run by Deion Sanders Jr., released a video showing the Colorado coach in a recording studio rapping a song that he appears to have written.\n\nTo put it politely, the song is absolutely terrible. It's every bit as bad as his son Shedeur attempting to rap. Give it a watch below starting around 5:00, and hit me with your thoughts at David.Hookstead@outkick.com.\n\nDoes this look like a guy who went 1-8 to finish out his team's final nine games last season? Not to me. This looks like a guy who wants to have a good time.\n\nNo problem with that. We all like to have a good time. The difference is, most of us aren't being paid millions to coach a football team that is coming off a terrible season.\n\nIf I'm a Colorado fan, Deion Sanders is the last thing I want to see. I want to see only things about football, and literally nothing else until the team does something of significance.\n\nYet, it seems like Colorado is intent on being a circus. Here are a few quick hitters:\n\nDoes that sound like a group of people interested in being celebrities or simply winning football games? Looks like it might be the former.\n\nI could be totally wrong once week one rolls around. Perhaps Colorado destroys every team it faces. It's possible, but we've seen nothing to indicate that will be the case.

The Buffaloes topped 2022 College Football Playoff runner-up TCU before blowing out Nebraska in the first game of the Sanders era at Folsom Field. They beat Colorado State the next week.\n\nCU would win one game the rest of the season.\n\nNow the Buffs enter Year Two in a similar situation to Year One. There has been another exodus and influx of transfers. Two new coordinators have arrived in Boulder, and CU is once again a subject of attention and source of controversy with a Week Two matchup at Nebraska growing ever-so-slightly nearer.\n\nPeople are also reading...

Their respective replacements are Robert Livingston and Pat Shurmur. Livingston was hired after 12 years as the Cincinnati Bengals' secondary coach, and Shurmur was an analyst at CU after a lengthy career in the NFL.\n\n\"You have 127 years of NFL experience up under this roof,\" Deion Sanders told reporters after Colorado's spring game. \"It's on you. We are a tremendous navigation system to the game that you want to play. We know what we're doing. We know how to get there because we've been there, especially as a collective group.\n\n\"Now, what separates me from everyone else is I've sat in three seats. I gave you a dramatic pause so you can follow me. I'm the parent, right? A couple kids in college football. I've been the kid, right? A straight dog. And now I'm the coach.\"\n\nThey'll be tasked with improving a team that's still rebuilding after the shine of last September faded. Colorado's hot start and Sanders' bravado briefly masked the glaring holes remaining in a roster that went 1-11 in 2022. Even with new personnel, the Buffaloes' defense allowed 6.3 yards per play and almost 35 points per game last season.\n\nMeanwhile, a shoddy offensive line struggled to keep Shedeur Sanders upright and healthy. He was sacked 52 times and missed the final game of the season with a fracture in his back. Former NFL veteran tackle and Oklahoma grad Phil Loadholt -- who played against Nebraska in 2008 -- is now the position coach in the trenches.\n\nFor as much change as the coaching staff has undergone, the roster turnover is more dramatic. Forty-one players have left CU through the transfer portal since the end of last season, according to 247 Sports, and 42 have arrived.\n\nAmong the notable departures is Dylan Edwards, a quick, shifty running back who accounted for 620 total yards as a freshman, and Cormani McClain, once a five-star cornerback prospect. He'll spend next season at Florida.\n\nEthan Boyd is in the fold on the offensive line, the redshirt junior from Michigan State bringing some much-needed stability and Power Five experience to a paper-thin unit. Wyatt Hummel was solid at Villanova. He'll make the jump to the FBS level. Others, like Payton Kirkland and Zack Owens, were highly recruited out of high school but haven't gotten significant playing time in college.\n\nThey're additions to a roster that's gotten a makeover for the second straight offseason, representing a program still seeking the right combination.\n\n\"Whatever 11 players is out there, we're gonna make the most of it, so if they gotta do what's best for them, that's what's best for them,\" Shedeur Sanders said during the spring. \"And the guys that's coming in, they already know, I tell them straight-up what the mentality is. It's no jealousy, it's no anything in the locker room.\"\n\nAfter 13 seasons in the Pac-12, CU is back in the Big 12, with home games against Baylor, Kansas State, Cincinnati, Utah and Oklahoma State, and road games at UCF, Arizona, Texas Tech and Kansas.\n\nPhotos: Nebraska football takes on No. 22 Colorado Love 0 Funny 0 Wow 0 Sad 0 Angry 0\n\nTags Lee-national Be the first to know\n\nGet local

Multiple teams have changed their program's trajectory with massive additions from the transfer portal.\n\nMost notably, LSU landed former Ohio State quarterback Joe Burrow before the 2018 season. Burrow would lead the Tigers to the CFP National Championship and put together one of the most impressive seasons in college football history.\n\n247Sports ranked the 10 most impactful transfers in the transfer portal era, and Colorado quarterback Shedeur Sanders was ranked No. 10.\n\n\"The younger Sanders ranked eighth nationally with a 69.3% completion rate, and his three interceptions tied for the fewest among all FBS quarterbacks with at least 400 pass attempts,\" 247Sports' Cody Nagel wrote.\n\n\"Sanders threw for 3,230 yards with 27 touchdowns. He did all that despite having one of the worst offensive lines in front of him as the Buffaloes gave up 56 sacks, second-most among all FBS teams.\"\n\nNagel determined the four-win Colorado Buffaloes would have been much worse if it wasn't for Sanders a season ago. Many have ranked Sanders as one of the top quarterbacks for the 2025 NFL Draft.\n\nNow, the Buffaloes head back to familiar territory in the Big 12, and Sanders is looking to solidify himself as the top quarterback prospect.\n\nBelow are 247Sports' most impactful transfers.\n\n9.

The Buffaloes topped 2022 College Football Playoff runner-up TCU before blowing out Nebraska in the first game of the Sanders era at Folsom Field. They beat Colorado State the next week.\n\nCU would win one game the rest of the season.\n\nNow the Buffs enter Year Two in a similar situation to Year One. There has been another exodus and influx of transfers. Two new coordinators have arrived in Boulder, and CU is once again a subject of attention and source of controversy with a Week Two matchup at Nebraska growing ever-so-slightly nearer.\n\nPeople are also reading...

Their respective replacements are Robert Livingston and Pat Shurmur. Livingston was hired after 12 years as the Cincinnati Bengals' secondary coach, and Shurmur was an analyst at CU after a lengthy career in the NFL.\n\n\"You have 127 years of NFL experience up under this roof,\" Deion Sanders told reporters after Colorado's spring game. \"It's on you. We are a tremendous navigation system to the game that you want to play. We know what we're doing. We know how to get there because we've been there, especially as a collective group.\n\n\"Now, what separates me from everyone else is I've sat in three seats. I gave you a dramatic pause so you can follow me. I'm the parent, right? A couple kids in college football. I've been the kid, right? A straight dog. And now I'm the coach.\"\n\nThey'll be tasked with improving a team that's still rebuilding after the shine of last September faded. Colorado's hot start and Sanders' bravado briefly masked the glaring holes remaining in a roster that went 1-11 in 2022. Even with new personnel, the Buffaloes' defense allowed 6.3 yards per play and almost 35 points per game last season.\n\nMeanwhile, a shoddy offensive line struggled to keep Shedeur Sanders upright and healthy. He was sacked 52 times and missed the final game of the season with a fracture in his back. Former NFL veteran tackle and Oklahoma grad Phil Loadholt -- who played against Nebraska in 2008 -- is now the position coach in the trenches.\n\nFor as much change as the coaching staff has undergone, the roster turnover is more dramatic. Forty-one players have left CU through the transfer portal since the end of last season, according to 247 Sports, and 42 have arrived.\n\nAmong the notable departures is Dylan Edwards, a quick, shifty running back who accounted for 620 total yards as a freshman, and Cormani McClain, once a five-star cornerback prospect. He'll spend next season at Florida.\n\nEthan Boyd is in the fold on the offensive line, the redshirt junior from Michigan State bringing some much-needed stability and Power Five experience to a paper-thin unit. Wyatt Hummel was solid at Villanova. He'll make the jump to the FBS level. Others, like Payton Kirkland and Zack Owens, were highly recruited out of high school but haven't gotten significant playing time in college.\n\nThey're additions to a roster that's gotten a makeover for the second straight offseason, representing a program still seeking the right combination.\n\n\"Whatever 11 players is out there, we're gonna make the most of it, so if they gotta do what's best for them, that's what's best for them,\" Shedeur Sanders said during the spring. \"And the guys that's coming in, they already know, I tell them straight-up what the mentality is. It's no jealousy, it's no anything in the locker room.\"\n\nAfter 13 seasons in the Pac-12, CU is back in the Big 12, with home games against Baylor, Kansas State, Cincinnati, Utah and Oklahoma State, and road games at UCF, Arizona, Texas Tech and Kansas.\n\nPhotos: Nebraska football takes on No. 22 Colorado 0 Comments Love 0 Funny 0 Wow 0 Sad 0 Angry 0\n\nTags Lee-national Be the first to know\n\nGet local news delivered to your inbox!\n\nSign up! * I understand and agree that registration on or use of this site constitutes agreement to its user agreement and privacy policy.", "source": {"uri": "magicvalley.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Magic Valley"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_Colorado_Boulder", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "University of Colorado Boulder"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deion_Sanders", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Deion Sanders"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nebraska", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Nebraska"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Nebraska"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Murders_of_Tylee_Ryan_and_J._J._Vallow", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Murders of Tylee Ryan and J.

Pictures taken from: Deion Sanders Jr.'s LinkedIn\n\nIn the ever-evolving media landscape, Deion Sanders Jr.'s journey with his start-up \"Well Off Media\" has taken flight, soaring to new heights with an unwavering determination to expand his brand's reach. The young entrepreneur recently sought counsel from Coach Prime himself, recognizing the need for wisdom and direction.\n\nIn a recently posted vlog, the father-son duo engaged in a candid conversation, exploring avenues for Deion Jr. to turn up his brand's impact. With a substantial 451K subscriber base, the viewership numbers have yet to match the platform's potential, prompting Jr. to declare, \"Right now is the time to expand the brand.\"\n\nHaving diligently covered the Colorado Buffaloes and his family's endeavors, Deion Jr. eagerly awaits the upcoming season, brimming with anticipation for what lies ahead. Coach Prime, beaming with paternal pride, commended his son's tireless efforts during the conversation.\n\nHe asserted that through \"Well Off Media,\" his eldest son has reshaped perceptions and offered an authentic point of view into the lives of college football athletes.\n\nWhile Sanders Jr. expressed heartfelt appreciation for his father's unwavering support, Coach Prime offered another piece of sage advice: to delve deeper into the truths and realities faced by collegiate athletes, showcasing their journeys through an unfiltered lens.\n\nThis honest exchange between father and son resonated with a shared vision -- to elevate \"Well Off Media\" to unprecedented heights. As the 2024 college season draws to a close, the anticipation builds for Deion Sanders Jr. to seize the opportunities that lie ahead, fueled by his father's guidance and an unyielding drive to succeed.\n\nDeion Sanders Jr.'s musical talents are nothing short of remarkable. His laid-back approach to music videos -- \"I just don't really care about rapping, so I just shoot vlog-style music videos\" -- has struck a chord with fans. It even earned him a coveted cameo alongside his dad and Snoop Dogg in the highly anticipated \"Must Be the Money 24\" music video.\n\nWhile Shedeur's \"Perfect Timing\" garnered mixed reviews, Sanders Jr.'s unique rap style and infectious beats on \"IGGY\" took the internet by storm, even if some critiqued the low-key video production. But for this multi-talented artist, the music speaks for itself, and his rising fame has propelled him onto the same stage as rap legend Snoop Dogg.\n\nAs the buzz around \"Must Be the Money 24\" reaches a fever pitch, fans eagerly await Sanders Jr.'s confirmed appearance.

After getting off to a hot start, the Buffaloes went 0-6 over their final six games. Still, Klatt believes Sanders has been a massive success in Boulder, no matter what metric you use.\n\nHe added that in his opinion, Colorado had the \"worst\" and \"most irrelevant\" program in Power 5 before Sanders arrived.\n\n\"The point of hiring Deion Sanders, among other things, was relevance.

Sanders was hired by the institution, which is prominent for producing football legends such as Walter Payton and the renowned Sonic Boom of the South. Following a short Spring season in 2021, disrupted by COVID-19's cancellation of the Fall season, Sanders guided the Tigers to tremendous achievements in the Fall 2021 and 2022 seasons.\n\nHis teams won consecutive SWAC championships and remained undefeated in conference games in 2021 and 2022. They boasted the top defense in the FCS last season, limiting opponents to just 13.5 points, 135.3 passing yards, and 117 rushing yards per game. Additionally, Sanders guided two of his defensive players, LB James Houston IV and DB Isaiah Bolden, to the NFL.\n\nHowever, Deion Sanders's departure from Jackson State in December 2022 following the Celebration Bowl shook up the HBCU community. While anticipated, his decision to depart for Colorado seemed surreal and, to many, ill-timed. Just as rumors began circulating, the Tigers were preparing for a rematch against their rivals, the Southern University Jaguars, in the SWAC Championship at the Mississippi Veterans Memorial Stadium.\n\nHe later revealed his departure to take on the role of head coach at the Colorado Buffaloes. His exit sparked debates about his intentions: Was his aim truly to uplift HBCUs? Or did he view Jackson State merely as a stepping stone to his next career move?\n\nIn the book \"Elevate and Dominate: 21 Ways to Win On and Off the Field,\" co-authored by Sanders and Don Yeager, which was published on March 12th, Sanders seemed fully committed to transforming Jackson State into a consistent title contender.\n\n\"My goal for Jackson State was clear from Day One -- we wanted to win, and win RIGHT NOW. We wanted to wake it up and capture some of its potential. But we also wanted to challenge the belief that HBCUs were some sort of inferior product. THEY ARE NOT... and we proved that. I never thought too deeply about my next step because my focus was on turning Jackson State into a powerhouse.\"\n\nAmidst fervent discussions about his departure from Jackson State and the challenge of revitalizing Colorado's potential during their shift to the Big 12, he seems to cherish his experiences with the Tigers and the lasting memories they hold.", "source": {"uri": "clutchpoints.com",

The Buffaloes topped 2022 College Football Playoff runner-up TCU before blowing out Nebraska in the first game of the Sanders era at Folsom Field. They beat Colorado State the next week.\n\nCU would win one game the rest of the season.\n\nNow the Buffs enter Year Two in a similar situation to Year One. There has been another exodus and influx of transfers. Two new coordinators have arrived in Boulder, and CU is once again a subject of attention and source of controversy with a Week Two matchup at Nebraska growing ever-so-slightly nearer.\n\nPeople are also reading...

Their respective replacements are Robert Livingston and Pat Shurmur. Livingston was hired after 12 years as the Cincinnati Bengals' secondary coach, and Shurmur was an analyst at CU after a lengthy career in the NFL.\n\n\"You have 127 years of NFL experience up under this roof,\" Deion Sanders told reporters after Colorado's spring game. \"It's on you. We are a tremendous navigation system to the game that you want to play. We know what we're doing. We know how to get there because we've been there, especially as a collective group.\n\n\"Now, what separates me from everyone else is I've sat in three seats. I gave you a dramatic pause so you can follow me. I'm the parent, right? A couple kids in college football. I've been the kid, right? A straight dog. And now I'm the coach.\"\n\nThey'll be tasked with improving a team that's still rebuilding after the shine of last September faded. Colorado's hot start and Sanders' bravado briefly masked the glaring holes remaining in a roster that went 1-11 in 2022. Even with new personnel, the Buffaloes' defense allowed 6.3 yards per play and almost 35 points per game last season.\n\nMeanwhile, a shoddy offensive line struggled to keep Shedeur Sanders upright and healthy. He was sacked 52 times and missed the final game of the season with a fracture in his back. Former NFL veteran tackle and Oklahoma grad Phil Loadholt -- who played against Nebraska in 2008 -- is now the position coach in the trenches.\n\nFor as much change as the coaching staff has undergone, the roster turnover is more dramatic. Forty-one players have left CU through the transfer portal since the end of last season, according to 247 Sports, and 42 have arrived.\n\nAmong the notable departures is Dylan Edwards, a quick, shifty running back who accounted for 620 total yards as a freshman, and Cormani McClain, once a five-star cornerback prospect. He'll spend next season at Florida.\n\nEthan Boyd is in the fold on the offensive line, the redshirt junior from Michigan State bringing some much-needed stability and Power Five experience to a paper-thin unit. Wyatt Hummel was solid at Villanova. He'll make the jump to the FBS level. Others, like Payton Kirkland and Zack Owens, were highly recruited out of high school but haven't gotten significant playing time in college.\n\nThey're additions to a roster that's gotten a makeover for the second straight offseason, representing a program still seeking the right combination.\n\n\"Whatever 11 players is out there, we're gonna make the most of it, so if they gotta do what's best for them, that's what's best for them,\" Shedeur Sanders said during the spring. \"And the guys that's coming in, they already know, I tell them straight-up what the mentality is. It's no jealousy, it's no anything in the locker room.\"\n\nAfter 13 seasons in the Pac-12, CU is back in the Big 12, with home games against Baylor, Kansas State, Cincinnati, Utah and Oklahoma State, and road games at UCF, Arizona, Texas Tech and Kansas.\n\nPhotos: Nebraska football takes on No. 22 Colorado Tags Lee-national Be the first to know\n\nGet local news delivered to your inbox!\n\nSign

The Buffaloes got their 2023 season started on an elite note, going an undefeated 3-0 to have them sitting pretty. But then things went south ... waaay south ... finishing the season 4-8 and losing their last six games. In their last nine, they went 1-8.\n\nYeah, it was pretty bad, and as a result, you'd think that Coach Prime and the Buffs would be more focused on football. (RELATED: New York Giants' Darren Waller Releases Another Weird Rap Song Amid Retirement Rumors)\n\nNope.\n\nRan by Deion Sanders Jr. (obviously Coach Prime's son), Well Off Media dropped a video that showed the Colorado head coach rapping a song in the studio that he recorded, and judging by the lyrics, wrote too. And here's the kicker: Snoop Dogg was also on the song! Which makes this whole thing even more hilarious!\n\nBut here was the problem, and y'all know how much I love Prime: It was TRASH.\n\nI tell you what ... this season for the Buffaloes is either going to go really well, or it's going to be really bad.

The Buffaloes topped 2022 College Football Playoff runner-up TCU before blowing out Nebraska in the first game of the Sanders era at Folsom Field. They beat Colorado State the next week.\n\nCU would win one game the rest of the season.\n\nNow the Buffs enter Year Two in a similar situation to Year One. There has been another exodus and influx of transfers. Two new coordinators have arrived in Boulder, and CU is once again a subject of attention and source of controversy with a Week Two matchup at Nebraska growing ever-so-slightly nearer.\n\nFormer defensive coordinator Charles Kelly left for the same position at Auburn and offensive coordinator Sean Lewis, demoted partway through last season, is now the head coach of San Diego State. Their respective replacements are Robert Livingston and Pat Shurmur. Livingston was hired after 12 years as the Cincinnati Bengals' secondary coach, and Shurmur was an analyst at CU after a lengthy career in the NFL.\n\n\"You have 127 years of NFL experience up under this roof,\" Deion Sanders told reporters after Colorado's spring game. \"It's on you. We are a tremendous navigation system to the game that you want to play. We know what we're doing. We know how to get there because we've been there, especially as a collective group.\n\n\"Now, what separates me from everyone else is I've sat in three seats. I gave you a dramatic pause so you can follow me. I'm the parent, right? A couple kids in college football. I've been the kid, right? A straight dog. And now I'm the coach.\"\n\nThey'll be tasked with improving a team that's still rebuilding after the shine of last September faded. Colorado's hot start and Sanders' bravado briefly masked the glaring holes remaining in a roster that went 1-11 in 2022. Even with new personnel, the Buffaloes' defense allowed 6.3 yards per play and almost 35 points per game last season.\n\nMeanwhile, a shoddy offensive line struggled to keep Shedeur Sanders upright and healthy. He was sacked 52 times and missed the final game of the season with a fracture in his back. Former NFL veteran tackle and Oklahoma grad Phil Loadholt -- who played against Nebraska in 2008 -- is now the position coach in the trenches.\n\nFor as much change as the coaching staff has undergone, the roster turnover is more dramatic. Forty-one players have left CU through the transfer portal since the end of last season, according to 247 Sports, and 42 have arrived.\n\nAmong the notable departures is Dylan Edwards, a quick, shifty running back who accounted for 620 total yards as a freshman, and Cormani McClain, once a five-star cornerback prospect. He'll spend next season at Florida.\n\nEthan Boyd is in the fold on the offensive line, the redshirt junior from Michigan State bringing some much-needed stability and Power Five experience to a paper-thin unit. Wyatt Hummel was solid at Villanova. He'll make the jump to the FBS level. Others, like Payton Kirkland and Zack Owens, were highly recruited out of high school but haven't gotten significant playing time in college.\n\nThey're additions to a roster that's gotten a makeover for the second straight offseason, representing a program still seeking the right combination.\n\n\"Whatever 11 players is out there, we're gonna make the most of it, so if they gotta do what's best for them, that's what's best for them,\" Shedeur Sanders said during the spring. \"And the guys that's coming in, they already know, I tell them straight-up what the mentality is. It's no jealousy, it's no anything in the locker room.\"\n\nAfter 13 seasons in the Pac-12, CU is back in the Big 12, with home games against Baylor, Kansas State, Cincinnati, Utah and Oklahoma State, and road games at UCF, Arizona, Texas Tech and Kansas.\n\nPhotos: Nebraska football spring game 2024", "source": {"uri": "omaha.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Omaha.com"}, "authors": [{"uri":

Or brother Shedeur's.", "body": "Welcome to the Deion Sanders Era, where the CU Buffs are last in the Pac-12 but first in irony. Because to hear scouts tell it, the notion that Shilo Sanders needs cash is ... probably costing him money.\n\n\"The bankruptcy and the fact that he has been playing under his father with the last two programs has not (helped),\" Dave Syvertsen, longtime scout and senior draft analyst with the Ourlads.com scouting service, told me Monday. \"He does not grade out athletically at an extremely high level. He's going to be an older rookie.\n\n\"I would say that (Shilo) is going to fight a very uphill battle against the entire pre-draft process, and the off-field concerns can easily kind of push him off a lot of teams' boards. Because maturity is a bigger deal to some teams than others.\"\n\nLong story short: The one-time No. 1 son of Coach Prime has got lawyers sifting through his Instagram posts and debt collectors circling. CU's sixth-year safety last October declared bankruptcy, according to The Athletic. Why? To make a Texas court judgment of roughly $11 million in damages, related to a 2015 altercation at Coach Prime's old prep school, go away.\n\nSee what we mean about irony? This thing's dripping with it. If you're a Sanders, you were born flexing. You wake up flexing. A family brand steeped in swagger and rooted in being as flashy as possible, now needs to play down the jewelry, fancy watches and fast cars?\n\nMust be the motions.\n\n\"I think building a culture is important in the NFL,\" Syvertsen continued. \"And if a guy that hasn't done anything without his dad around comes in and thinks that he's entitled to anything beyond what a normal rookie would be, that's the quickest route to breaking up a culture-slash-locker room.\"\n\nShilo's a Day 3 pick, assuming he's healthy. No, the breadwinner-to-be among CU's Sanders brothers is Shedeur, who - again, health permitting - is earmarked to be no worse than the second quarterback taken in the 2025 NFL Draft.\n\nAlthough that last one depends on the team. It depends on the front office, the ownership -- and their comfort level with hosting a circus.\n\nBeing Coach Prime's kid is a double-edged sword, the kind of key that opens doors but locks others tight. I asked Syvertsen if all this off-field business with the Sanders family -- the TV shows, the cameras, the concerts, the court filings -- could spill over into Shedeur's NFL prospects as well.\n\n\"I don't want to use it against Shedeur, (but) I do think he's going to have to know he's going to have a bullseye on him that, 'Daddy got you everywhere you went in life,'\" he replied.\n\n\"Now that you're a professional, you've got to do this on your own, you'll have the opportunity to do it -- no more following Dad. You're on your own once you're in the league.\"\n\nBut just as Deion doesn't necessarily want his sons plying their trades in, say, Green Bay, there are several NFL franchises that don't want The Prime Show any more than they'd want to see a camera crew from \"Hard Knocks.\" Teams that won't enjoy coughing uncomfortably or looking the other way, as CU has often had to whenever anything awkward or questionable has come to light.\n\nFor Shedeur, it's not a question of talent. Or tools. Or speed of the game. Or grown men on the other team trying to tear him apart.\n\nOh, no. Actually, it's more about the grown men in the locker NEXT to him.\n\n\"I loved what Tom Brady said to (FOX Sports' Colin) Cowherd, (that) quarterbacks have to 'endear' themselves to their teammates,\" FOX Sports analyst and former NFL QB Brock Huard said of Shedeur. \"I'll be curious if he can.\"\n\nWhether the inner thoughts of Harrison Butker or Colin Kaepernick make you more uncomfortable, know this: The color that matters most, that's always mattered most, to the NFL is green. Money always talks and bull junk, to paraphrase Coach Prime, almost always walks.\n\nUnless you walk the 40 in about 4.25 flat.\n\n\"What (Shilo) is going through (off the field), and the fact he's not a standout football player, could leave him being pushed off some boards,\" Syvertsen said.\n\n\"It's simply just another unknown fact -- we don't know how (either Shilo or Shedeur) handle humility at the end of the day. You can answer that question with a lot of prospects. But you can't answer that question with them.\"\n\nTalk is cheap. Attorneys aren't. And we're all about to find out pretty soon, for better or worse, who Coach Prime's true NFL friends really are.", "source": {"uri": "denverpost.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Denver Post"}, "authors": [{"uri": "sean_keeler@denverpost.com", "name": "Sean Keeler", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deion_Sanders", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Deion Sanders"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scout_(sport)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Scout (sport)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coach_Prime", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Coach Prime"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rookie", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Rookie"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bankruptcy", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Bankruptcy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Athletic", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "The Athletic"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pac-12_Conference", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Pac-12 Conference"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colorado_Buffaloes", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Colorado Buffaloes"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Draft_(sports)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Draft (sports)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Instagram", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Instagram"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Texas", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Texas"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Texas"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quarterback", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Quarterback"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hard_Knocks_(2001_TV_series)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Hard Knocks (2001 TV series)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harrison_Butker", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Harrison Butker"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brock_Huard", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Brock Huard"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fox_Sports", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Fox Sports"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colin_Kaepernick", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Colin Kaepernick"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_Colorado_Boulder", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "University of Colorado Boulder"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bull", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Bull"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tom_Brady", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Tom Brady"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Base_on_balls", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Base on balls"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_football", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "American football"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Green_Bay,_Wisconsin", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Green Bay, Wisconsin"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Green Bay, Wisconsin"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Football/American", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Football/American", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Alternative/Coaching", "label": "dmoz/Health/Alternative/Coaching", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Financial_Services/Automobile_Buying_and_Financing", "label": "dmoz/Business/Financial Services/Automobile Buying and Financing", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Coaching", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Coaching", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Theme_Merchandise", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Theme Merchandise", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 83}], "image": "https://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/TDP-L-BUFFALOES-TCU_DSC2089.jpg?w=640", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9620177", "eventUri": "eng-9620177", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.03529411764705881, "wgt": 119, "relevance": 1}

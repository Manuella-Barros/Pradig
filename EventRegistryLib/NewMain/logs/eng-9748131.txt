Jackson has spent his entire six-year career with the Chicago Bears, but will now head to Baltimore.\n\nA fourth-round pick out of Alabama in the 2017 NFL Draft, Jackson burst onto the scene in Chicago and became an All-Pro in 2018. He also made the Pro Bowl that season, a feat he again reached in 2019. For his career, Jackson has 459 total tackles, 15 interceptions and 44 passes defensed. He also has 10 forced fumbles in his career.\n\nIn Baltimore, he'll join a safety group that also features Marcus Williams and Kyle Hamilton. Jackson can provide veteran leadership and serve as a mentor to a budding star in Hamilton while also rotating in to give those two a breather.\n\nIt's a savvy pickup at this point for the Ravens, who are looking to repeat their success last season when they won the AFC North and went to the AFC Conference Championship Game before losing to the Kansas City Chiefs. Adding a veteran who's played at a high level in Jackson in late July is a good move to shore up some depth.\n\nBehind Williams and Hamilton, the Ravens currently have rookie Sanoussi Kane and Ar'Darius Washington, as well as undrafted free agents Beau Brade and Jordan Toles. Jackson provides a big upgrade to their depth and should be an asset for Baltimore's defense.\n\nHis play has declined over the past few seasons, but in a backup role, Jackson could look to elevate his game without the responsibilities of being a starting safety and one of the best players on the Bears' defense. Jackson has experience playing on a talented defense too, as Chicago's defense during the 2018 season when he was an All-Pro allowed just 17.7 points per game.\n\nJackson will put on a Ravens uniform for the first time when Baltimore's training camp kicks off on Sunday.\n\nRelated Items:Adam Schefter, Baltimore Ravens, Eddie Jackson Recommended for you Ranking The Rooms: AFC North Overall Rankings Ravens Rumored To Have Interest In Former Roquan Smith Teammate Eddie Jackson Garafolo: Brandon Aiyuk Officially Requested Trade From 49ers After Failing To Reach Terms On Extension", "source": {"uri": "steelersdepot.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Steelers Depot"}, "authors": [{"uri": "joe_clark@steelersdepot.com", "name": "Joe Clark", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baltimore_Ravens", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Baltimore Ravens"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/All-Pro", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "All-Pro"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jackson,_Mississippi", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Jackson, Mississippi"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Jackson, Mississippi"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baltimore", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Baltimore"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Baltimore"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hamilton,_Ontario", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Hamilton, Ontario"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Hamilton, Ontario"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Canada"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eddie_Jackson_(safety)", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Eddie Jackson (safety)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adam_Schefter", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Adam Schefter"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chicago_Bears", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Chicago Bears"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pro_Bowl", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Pro Bowl"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fumble", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Fumble"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ESPN", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "ESPN"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interception", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Interception"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tackle_(football_move)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Tackle (football move)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chicago", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Chicago"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Chicago"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alabama", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Alabama"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Alabama"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AFC_North", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "AFC North"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Football_Conference", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "American Football Conference"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rookie", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Rookie"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kansas_City_Chiefs", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Kansas City Chiefs"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_agent", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Free agent"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brandon_Aiyuk", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Brandon Aiyuk"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roquan_Smith", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Roquan Smith"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/San_Francisco_49ers", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "San Francisco 49ers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Washington_(state)", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Washington (state)"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Washington (state)"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Instructors", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Instructors", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Duckpin", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Duckpin", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 97}], "image": "https://steelersdepot.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Eddie-Jackson-Stock2.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9748131", "eventUri": "eng-9748131", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.2156862745098038, "wgt": 202, "relevance": 1}

Mandatory Credit: Daniel Bartel-USA TODAY Sports / Daniel Bartel-USA TODAY Sports\n\nThe Baltimore Ravens have finally found their No. 3 safety as they've signed 2018 All-Pro Eddie Jackson to a one-year deal, ESPN's Adam Schefter reports.\n\nJackson, 30, was a 2017 fourth-round pick by the Chicago Bears, and he quickly established himself as an impact player. He was outstanding in coverage, could tackle well and had a nose for the end zone with six touchdowns in four seasons. A Pro Bowl selection in 2018 and 2019, Jackson was rewarded with a four-year, $58.4 million extension that made him the highest-paid safety in the league at the time of signing.\n\nIn an all-too familiar tale, though, Jackson's play began to decline due to a combination of age and injuries. Last season was the toughest of his career, as the former Alabama star recorded just 37 total tackles, five passes defended and one interception in 12 games. He suffered a Lisfranc injury late in 2022, and it clearly still affected him last season.\n\nWith Jackson set to make $14 million in base salary this season, the Bears decided to move on from the veteran safety back in February. He then remained on the market without much reported interest, until the Ravens came calling just recently.\n\nIt's no secret that Baltimore has been looking for safety depth, as Geno Stone's departure left the depth behind depth looking shaky. The Ravens have shown confidence in fourth-year safety Ar'Darius Washington, a former undrafted free agent out of TCU, but now Jackson gives them such much-needed experience at the position.\n\nJackson should slot in right behind starters Kyle Hamilton and Marcus Williams, widely considered to be the best safety duo in the league. The Ravens used plenty of three-safety sets, which often featured Hamilton lining up in the slot, and now they have the depth they need to continue using those sets without cause for concern.\n\nIf Jackson can bounce back from last-year's injury riddled campaign, then the Ravens will undoubtedly have the best safety trio in the NFL.", "source": {"uri": "si.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Sports Illustrated"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eddie_Jackson_(safety)", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Eddie Jackson (safety)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chicago_Bears", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Chicago Bears"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jackson,_Mississippi", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Jackson, Mississippi"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Jackson, Mississippi"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soldier_Field", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Soldier Field"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adam_Schefter", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Adam Schefter"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baltimore_Ravens", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Baltimore Ravens"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carolina_Panthers", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Carolina Panthers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/All-Pro", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "All-Pro"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Defensive_back", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Defensive back"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ESPN", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "ESPN"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chicago", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Chicago"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Chicago"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tackle_(gridiron_football_position)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Tackle (gridiron football position)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lisfranc_injury", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Lisfranc injury"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alabama_Crimson_Tide_football", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Alabama Crimson Tide football"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pro_Bowl", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Pro Bowl"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/End_zone", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "End zone"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interception", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Interception"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tackle_(football_move)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Tackle (football move)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Touchdown", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Touchdown"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TCU_Horned_Frogs_football", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "TCU Horned Frogs football"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_agent", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Free agent"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Washington_(state)", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Washington (state)"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Washington (state)"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baltimore", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Baltimore"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Baltimore"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Ten-Pin", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Ten-Pin", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Candlepin", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Candlepin", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 99}], "image": "https://images2.minutemediacdn.com/image/upload/c_crop,w_5198,h_2923,x_0,y_443/c_fill,w_1440,ar_16:9,f_auto,q_auto,g_auto/images/ImagnImages/mmsport/raven_country/01j3685g5q701a3jp6y7.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9748131", "eventUri": "eng-9748131", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.2156862745098038, "wgt": 199, "relevance": 1}

The Athletic's Jeff Zrebiec reported that the Ravens had been in the market for a third safety to enhance their depth.\n\nIn seven seasons with the Chicago Bears, Jackson accumulated 15 interceptions, 10 forced fumbles, 2 sacks, and 6 total defensive touchdowns. He last made the Pro Bowl in 2019.

There are rumors that the defending AFC North champions are angling toward signing the former Chicago Bear before training camp. Although they don't need a starting safety, he would offer valuable depth in the secondary.\n\nA former fourth-round pick, Eddie Jackson is a seven-year veteran with 100 career starts. He has 16 career interceptions to his name with 44 passes defensed, but he is past his prime. The Bears released him back in February and he has not found a new home since.\n\nThe Ravens, however, seem to have a relatively settled secondary. At safety, they have third-year Kyle Hamilton paired with veteran Marcus Williams. They still have Marlon Humphrey at cornerback, now alongside first-round rookie Nate Wiggins. In the slot, they brought back Arthur Maulet, and they also drafted T.J. Tampa.\n\nOn the other hand, the Ravens did lose S Geno Stone to the Cincinnati Bengals, so they could use a player like Jackson. While we await more concrete reports and further corroboration, signing Jackson does align with the organization's history.\n\nBut what would it cost to sign him? Jackson signed a four-year deal in 2020 worth nearly $60 million, but he's obviously not approaching those numbers. Given his decline in recent years, including due to injury, it's fair to question how much he has left.\n\nEddie Jackson is a former Pro Bowler and All-Pro, and he can play either safety spot or in the slot. He might not be that same player at 30 years old, but he can be a quality fifth or sixth defensive back for a defense like the Ravens.\n\nAnd let's be honest, Marcus Williams has struggled to stay on the field since signing with the Ravens in 2022. They needed Geno Stone last year, but who is their third safety now, Ar'Darius Washington? Surely Eddie Jackson would make for a better emergency starting option.\n\nOf course, we don't even know if the Ravens truly plan to meet with Jackson. You know how the internet is these days. The only reason I'm comfortable writing this is because it sounds like a logical possibility given the organization. It wouldn't surprise me in the slightest if this ends up being true.\n\nThe older veteran defensive backs are starting to sign, as well, such as Jamal Adams, so we are seeing movement. Jackson is in that group, though most would more readily name Justin Simmons, who has yet to sign anywhere.\n\nThe Ravens are in win-now mode and will be for the foreseeable future, though, we know that much. That is just another reason to accept the plausibility of their interest in a veteran safety like Jackson. And their front office can be pretty convincing in getting people to sign. Plus, Jackson would get to play with Roquan Smith again.\n\nRelated Items:Baltimore Ravens, Eddie Jackson, Roquan Smith Recommended for you Spectator Sport: Ravens' Lamar Jackson 'Cheering Like The Fans' When He Hands Off To Derrick Henry 'As A Defender, You Love It -

Mandatory Credit: Daniel Bartel-USA TODAY Sports / Daniel Bartel-USA TODAY Sports\n\nThe Baltimore Ravens have been searching for safety depth throughout the offseason, and now, they may have their answer in sight.\n\nAccording to rumors that began circulating on Tuesday night, the Ravens are hosting former All-Pro safety Eddie Jackson for a visit on Wednesday. If the rumors are true, then it's very possible that he signs a deal soon after his visit.\n\nJackson, 30, spent seven seasons with the Chicago Bears before his release earlier this offseason. The former fourth-round pick out of Alabama enjoyed plenty of success in the Windy City, earning two Pro Bowl selections and a first-team All-Pro nod in 2018.\n\nHowever, Jackson's play has declined in recent years, and last season was his worst yet with just 37 total tackles, five passes defended and one interception. A Lisfranc injury in 2022 has definitely impacted his play, and with him now over 30 and taking up a huge percent of the salary cap, it's not hard to see why the Bears parted ways with him.\n\nThat said, Jackson could still be serviceable depth in Baltimore. The Ravens have an outstanding starting safety duo in Kyle Hamilton and Marcus Williams, but after Geno Stone left in free agency this offseason, the depth behind that duo has been a major concern. Jackson, despite being past his prime, would fill that role perfectly.\n\nJackson also has experience playing alongside star linebacker Roquan Smith from their days in Chicago, which is a huge point in his favor.\n\nThe Ravens hosted Jamal Adams for a visit back in May, but he left without a contract and eventually signed with the Tennessee Titans last week. If Jackson is indeed coming in for a visit, then they won't want to make the same mistake twice. If they do, names like Justin Simmons and Quandre Diggs are still on the open market.", "source": {"uri": "si.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Sports Illustrated"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baltimore_Ravens", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Baltimore Ravens"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eddie_Jackson_(safety)", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Eddie Jackson (safety)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chicago_Bears", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Chicago Bears"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interception", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Interception"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chicago", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Chicago"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Chicago"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Safety_(gridiron_football_position)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Safety (gridiron football position)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soldier_Field", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Soldier Field"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Houston_Texans", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Houston Texans"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/All-Pro", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "All-Pro"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jackson,_Mississippi", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Jackson, Mississippi"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Jackson, Mississippi"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lisfranc_injury", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Lisfranc injury"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alabama_Crimson_Tide_football", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Alabama Crimson Tide football"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pro_Bowl", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Pro Bowl"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tackle_(football_move)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Tackle (football move)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kyle_Hamilton_(American_football)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Kyle Hamilton (American football)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quandre_Diggs", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Quandre Diggs"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roquan_Smith", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Roquan Smith"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tennessee_Titans", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Tennessee Titans"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salary_cap", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Salary cap"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_agent", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Free agent"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linebacker", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Linebacker"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baltimore", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Baltimore"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Baltimore"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jamal_Adams", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Jamal Adams"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Advice", "label": "dmoz/Society/Advice", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 99}], "image": "https://images2.minutemediacdn.com/image/upload/c_crop,w_6199,h_3486,x_0,y_339/c_fill,w_1440,ar_16:9,f_auto,q_auto,g_auto/images/ImagnImages/mmsport/raven_country/01j309my5k84tdajey08.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9748131", "eventUri": "eng-9748131", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.419607843137255, "wgt": 194, "relevance": 1}

One of the most heated aspects of it is each team's defense.\n\nBoth the Steelers and Ravens boast elite defenses year after year. It's a calling card for both franchises and pivotal in pursuing a Super Bowl trophy. Heading into training camp and the 2024 season right behind, the Ravens made a sneaky, yet huge move to bolster their defense. NFL insider Adam Schefter reported that the team signed 30 year-old safety Eddie Jackson to a one-year contract. Schefter did not include any financial information in the contract.\n\nJackson brings a huge boost to the Ravens' secondary. Originally selected by the Chicago Bears in the fourth round of the 2017 NFL Draft, Jackson vastly outplayed his draft selection placement. With the Bears, he became an All-Pro safety and one of the best at his position. In 2018, he earned his lone All-Pro honors and the first of two Pro Bowl selections.\n\nDuring his tenure in Chicago, he became an integral piece of the defense, excelling at both stopping the ball and protecting the pass. He amassed 459 total tackles, 355 of those were unassisted and 14 of which were tackles for loss.\n\nHis biggest playmaking ability came on pass defense. He recorded 15 interceptions over seven seasons with the Bears. He also had 44 passes deflected and 10 forced fumbles.\n\nIn Baltimore, Jackson will likely pair up with young safety and star-on-the-rise, Kyle Hamilton and the steady Marcus Williams. Over the last few seasons, the Ravens have made a habit of bringing in veterans to help fill gaps on their defense. Players like Jason Pierre-Paul, Kyle Van Noy, and Jadaveon Clowney all joined the Ravens on cheap, one-year deals after being released from their former teams.

Below are the reactions from the Baltimore Beatdown staff.\n\nThe Ravens didn't need to add a third safety from the market as Ar'Darius Washington looked solid in minicamp and early expectations had him slotted to fill the No. 3 role. But adding Eddie Jackson is a savvy move to bolster their depth, free up Kyle Hamilton to play all across the field and maybe resurrect the dominant play Jackson delivered in 2018-2019 which earned him First Team All-Pro and two Pro Bowls.\n\nGeneral Manager Eric DeCosta has been nearly perfect in his late free agency additions for more than a season now. Jackson could be yet another with high upside that midway through the season teams will be kicking themselves over not signing him themselves. -- Kyle Phoenix\n\nJackson is the ideal player to fill what was the Ravens most glaring positional need before training camp. Eddie has the range to play two-high coverage and ball skills to replicate Geno Stone's takeaway production. With three capable safeties, Kyle Hamilton can confidently be deployed as the nickel defender to maximize his impact closer to the line of scrimmage. Excellent choice by general manager Eric DeCosta to fill the only position that didn't boast a quality two-deep with a proven performer of Jackson's pedigree and skillset. -- Vasilis Lericos\n\nAfter losing 2023 interception leader Geno Stone to a division rival in free agency, the Ravens addressed one of their most underrated off-season needs with this signing.\n\nThis has the potential to be just as impactful as the Jadeveon Clowney or Kyle Van Noy signings were last year when outside linebacker was the oversaturated veteran free agent market heading into training camp.\n\nAs much faith as the Ravens still have in 2021 undrafted free agent Ar'Darius Washington, they needed additional depth at safety with both experience and the ability to backup Marcus Williams at free safety while also still giving them the schematic flexibility to come on the field and allow Kyle Hamilton to star in the hybrid nickel role that made him a First Team All Pro last season. Jackson provides all the above from proven pedigree to a true ball-hawking presence in the backend comparable to what Stone provided in multiple safety packages. -- Joshua Reed\n\nMy first reaction is I'm sad for Ar'Darius Washington and the snaps this takes from him. But holy lord, the Ravens now have the clear cut number one secondary in the league. The safety combo of Marcus Williams and Eddie Jackson would already be one of the best and rangiest safety tandem in the league. Throw in budding star Kyle Hamilton is arguable the best safety in the league and you've got a monster on your hands.\n\nThe rotation will be curious to see as both Williams and Jackson are both more of the free safety variety and the Ravens will want to move Hamilton around everywhere, both in the box, slot, and deep. Jackson also provides depth behind Williams who has missed significant time in his first two years with the Ravens. -- Zach Canter\n\nThe addition of Eddie Jackson bolsters what was already considered one of the best secondaries in the NFL. In Baltimore's defense, the greatness and full potential of Kyle Hamilton is somewhat dependent on the teams three safety looks. With the emergence of Geno Stone last year, Hamilton was able to roam around the defense and be the ultimate chess piece for Mike MacDonald. After the departure of Stone, the Ravens desperately needed a 3rd safety to fill the void. In typical Ravens fashion, they add a two time Pro Bowler who should bring even more experience and playmaking ability to an already lethal secondary. -- Stephen Bopst", "source": {"uri": "baltimorebeatdown.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Baltimore Beatdown"}, "authors": [{"uri": "kyle_phoenix@baltimorebeatdown.com", "name": "Kyle Phoenix", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kyle_Hamilton_(American_football)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Kyle Hamilton (American football)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eddie_Jackson_(safety)", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Eddie Jackson (safety)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baltimore_Ravens", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Baltimore Ravens"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_agent", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Free agent"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jackson,_Mississippi", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Jackson, Mississippi"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Jackson, Mississippi"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ar'Darius_Washington", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Ar'Darius Washington"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eric_DeCosta", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Eric DeCosta"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_manager", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "General manager"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geno_Stone", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Geno Stone"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Safety_(gridiron_football_position)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Safety (gridiron football position)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Training_camp", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Training camp"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/All-Pro", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "All-Pro"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phoenix,_Arizona", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Phoenix, Arizona"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Phoenix, Arizona"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baltimore", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Baltimore"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Baltimore"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kyle_Van_Noy", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Kyle Van Noy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jadeveon_Clowney", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Jadeveon Clowney"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pro_Bowl", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Pro Bowl"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Line_of_scrimmage", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Line of scrimmage"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linebacker", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Linebacker"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interception", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Interception"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secondary_school", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Secondary school"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hamilton,_Ontario", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Hamilton, Ontario"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Hamilton, Ontario"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Canada"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Softball/Slowpitch", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Softball/Slowpitch", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Lacrosse", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Lacrosse", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Advice", "label": "dmoz/Society/Advice", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 96}], "image": "https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/1-NndLfCgE6tB31YkhBf0j7LNHc=/0x285:2599x1585/fit-in/1200x600/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/25538464/usa_today_19167460.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9748131", "eventUri": "eng-9748131", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.3960784313725489, "wgt": 171, "relevance": 1}

The cuts helped the Bears to the third-most cap space in the NFL. Jackson's $5.5 million dead cap price is the highest dead money the Bears will carry this season.\n\nThe moves to cut both the veterans was a cap-saving strategy by the front office. Ryan Poles shared details behind his thought process of the moves at the NFL Combine in March.\n\n\"I know we put a piece out on them, but I just wanted to say thank you to them for what they've done for the Bears,\" Poles said. \"We felt like it was the right time to give them an opportunity to test the market and see what's out there for them. I wanted to do right by them and do it as early as possible so they can put their plans in place.\"\n\nJackson was once an All-Pro cornerback in 2019. And despite struggling between 2020-21, he bounced back with a four-interception season in 2022. He didn't have a stellar year in 2023, but he finished with an interception, five pass breakups and 37 tackles.\n\nHe's played all seven seasons of his NFL career with the Bears. Under former GM Ryan Pace's management, the Bears selected Jackson in the fourth round of the 2017 NFL Draft with the No. 112 overall pick. It was undoubtedly one of the best draft selections of Pace's tenure.\n\nJackson joins the league's best defense from the 2023 season in the Ravens. They allowed a league-leading 16.2 points per game to their opponents last season. Jackson will also reunite with former Bears teammate Roquan Smith, who finished sixth in tackles last season, recording 158 takedowns.", "source": {"uri": "sports.yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo Sports"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eddie_Jackson_(safety)", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Eddie Jackson (safety)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/All-Pro", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "All-Pro"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baltimore_Ravens", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Baltimore Ravens"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cody_Whitehair", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Cody Whitehair"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lineman_(gridiron_football)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Lineman (gridiron football)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBC_Sports_Chicago", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "NBC Sports Chicago"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ryan_Poles", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Ryan Poles"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NFL_Scouting_Combine", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "NFL Scouting Combine"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ryan_Pace", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Ryan Pace"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roquan_Smith", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Roquan Smith"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_manager", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "General manager"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interception", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Interception"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cornerback", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Cornerback"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tackle_(football_move)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Tackle (football move)"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Ten-Pin", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Ten-Pin", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Instructors", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Instructors", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Candlepin", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Candlepin", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 96}], "image": "https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/pwq6kaeQLJI9yIUXRE_NQQ--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyMDA7aD02NzU7Y2Y9d2VicA--/https://media.zenfs.com/en/csnchicago.com/f05b46739c6731a006261e1320c70c17", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9748131", "eventUri": "eng-9748131", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.02745098039215677, "wgt": 170, "relevance": 1}

According to NFL insider Adam Schefter, former Chicago Bears safety Eddie Jackson is signing a one-year deal with Baltimore for the 2024 season.\n\nJackson began his career by playing seven seasons for the Chicago Bears. The team drafted him in the fourth round of the 2017 NFL Draft out of Alabama. He made the Pro Bowl twice in seven seasons, one in 2018 and one in 2019. He also earned first-team All-Pro recognition in 2018 under Matt Nagy and defensive coordinator Vic Fangio.\n\nDespite his consistency for the Bears, Jackson hasn't played a full season of games since the 2020 season. He played 14 in 2021, then 12 in each of the 2022 and 2023 seasons. He posted a career-low 37 tackles last season with one interception and 1.5 tackles for loss. In 2022, despite missing games, he tallied 80 tackles and four interceptions.\n\nThrough his first seven seasons in the league, Jackson has six touchdowns, including fumbles returned for scores and pick-sixes. He also has 15 career interceptions. His tackle tracker is up to 459 in regular-season games and he has another six tackles in postseason games.\n\nAfter playing out his rookie contract with the Bears, Chicago signed Jackson to a four-year deal for $58.4 million. By cutting him in February, the team saved $12.56 million in cap space.\n\nThe NFL 2024 calendar year began at 4 p.m. ET on March 13. At that time, contracts running through 2023 officially ran out, making those players free agents. Prior to the beginning of free agency, teams had a chance to designate one franchise or transition tag player, starting on Feb. 20 at 4 p.m. ET and ending on March 5.

Her new car was stolen from outside and although it turned up months later elsewhere in the country \u2013 with new registration plates and being used as a commercial vehicle - the saga rumbled on. \u201cIt seemed to be 100 per cent opportunism,\u201d she says of the theft. \u201cI\u2019d parked in the city centre and went to the gym. One of the trainers came to me after about 20 minutes to tell me my wallet had been found outside on the street.\u201d Harris, who runs the Dublin-based Harris PR agency, was initially confused. But for staff at the gym, this was not their first rodeo. They knew to check her locker and found it had been broken into, with Harris\u2019s keys and wallet stolen. And though the bunch of keys was quickly found discarded, the car key was gone. \u201cI ran around the corner to Townsend Street and the car was gone,\u201d she says. \u201cThe car wasn\u2019t close enough that you could just use the key to find it. So he must have seen me parking it and then watched me going into the gym and using the locker.\u201d Harris \u201cpanicked\u201d, as the Dacia Duster was new and she had personal items worth thousands in the boot \u201cincluding about eight pairs of shoes, make-up bag, car seats for the kids\u201d. She said garda\u00ed at Pearse Street station were \u201cbrilliant and really kind to me\u201d when she went to explain. Weeks later, after the insurance company had paid out, the car turned up close to the Border. Garda\u00ed secured CCTV from the street outside the gym and a suspect was identified and charged. But when the case went to court, shortcomings with time stamps on some of the CCTV derailed the prosecution. The suspect \u2013 a prolific criminal involved in chaotic but non-violent offending \u2013 walked free. Harris says the man lived not far from her home and she was nervous about bumping into him for months afterwards, given \u201che and all of his family got a good look at me during three days in court\u201d. \u201cIt all went on for about 18 months and it was just one of these nightmare scenarios,\u201d she said, though she never saw the suspect again. Harris is one of a growing number of people falling victim to car theft, which surged to a 10-year high last year, with some 4,976 recorded cases across the State. That figure was up 21 per cent on 2022 and 40 per cent above 2019\u2032s total. Garda sources who have investigated car thefts in different parts of the country say two clear and distinct trends are at play. Many of those behind the spike in thefts are described by garda\u00ed as \u201cdisorganised criminals\u201d. But there are also mafia-style for-profit operators with significant international contacts, especially among the Russian-speaking community in Ireland and abroad. But what is a \u201cdisorganised\u201d car theft? \u201cYou are talking about guys, mostly young fellas, robbing cars for joyriding and maybe other crimes like ram-raiding shops. But they are certainly not in it for the money,\u201d said one source. \u201cBut these are the ones behind what we call \u2018high-volume\u2019 thefts. They\u2019re very prolific and they are often going for Japanese imports which have very poor security features, no immobilisers, so they are easy pickings. And those thefts, by these Irish guys, have surged.\u201d Some vehicles stolen by the \u201cdisorganised\u201d criminals eventually turn up undamaged and are returned to their owners. Many are found crashed and are ultimately written off. A different trend has emerged more recently, which garda\u00ed say involves sophisticated gangs investing in technology that enables them to hijack a car fob inside a target\u2019s home. The signal from the fob is activated and amplified, which enables a criminal to open the vehicle and drive away. The hand-held amplifier devices, available online for between \u20ac7,000 and \u20ac9,000, can be used by someone outside a house to activate a fob the owner believed was safe inside. Across Ireland \u2013 especially in Dublin, Meath and Louth \u2013 more and more vehicles are being stolen in this way. More worryingly, very few, if any, of these are being recovered. Instead, they are brought to industrial units, known as \u201cchop shops\u201d, and taken apart for spare parts, which are exported for resale in eastern Europe. \u201cYou\u2019ve heard of the movie Gone in 60 seconds? Well, these cars are gone in 10 seconds,\u201d said one source. \u201cWe\u2019ve seen CCTV of some of these thefts and, literally, you\u2019re talking 10 seconds \u2013 car opened, started, gone. But if they see a steering lock in a car, they\u2019ll just turn and walk away and try another house. Anything that will slow them down, make it more awkward for them ... they\u2019re gone.\u201d For those using an amplifier, the signal can only be boosted to open and start a car once, and that is provided the fob is close enough to be accessed. \u201cOnce they start the car and drive it off, they can\u2019t stop it and start it again,\u201d said one source. \u201cSo they are driving to a particular location and parking the car, maybe on the side of a road or in a supermarket car park. They keep an eye on it to make sure it\u2019s not located through any tracker in the vehicle. And once it\u2019s not found after about 48 hours, they\u2019ll arrange for it to be collected. But they\u2019ll never drive it straight to one of their chop shops.\u201d Garda\u00ed have, at times, intercepted tow truck drivers collecting cars stolen in this way. However, the drivers regularly say they were contacted by phone by someone they did not know who claimed their car had broken down and needed collection. \u201cThat\u2019s their cover story,\u201d said one garda. \u201cAnd we\u2019ve found those guys taking these cars away in areas where we know there is a suspect chop shop close by.\u201d When the numbers of those callers who contact tow companies are examined, they prove to be untraceable pay-as-you-go phones, meaning the caller cannot be identified. Sources add that several chop shops had been found in Longford and Westmeath, areas where commercial units are cheaper and easily accessible from the motorway network. Many of those identified as running these enterprises are members of Lithuanian gangs, with garda sources saying other Russian speakers \u2013 including some Georgians \u2013 are also involved. They appear to have extensive contacts abroad, with as many as one in five vehicles stolen \u2013 up to 1,000 at last year\u2019s pace \u2013 suspected of ending up in chop shops and their parts exported. \u201cThese cars are vanishing into thin air,\u201d said one Garda source. \u201cAnd we\u2019re getting no evidence, no queries from police in Europe about cars they\u2019ve recovered. Nothing like that is coming back to us.\u201d Police in Lithuania have carried out searches and discovered significant stashes of car parts. When the serial numbers from airbags, gear boxes, engines and other parts have been checked with manufacturers, it has been confirmed they were from cars first reported stolen in Ireland. \u201cEveryone thinks the cars being targeted here are the expensive BMWs or high-end Mercedes but that\u2019s not the case,\u201d said one source. \u201cAnything in the Volkswagen-Audi group ... those parts are all interchangeable really. That also includes Skodas, the typical family cars.\u201d Garda\u00ed say the Russian-speaking suspects often only work with people from their own communities. The fact they have no need for lower-level Irish criminal involvement means the networks are difficult to penetrate from a policing perspective, with the language barrier alone insulating them. The fact stolen vehicles are dismantled and exported for parts mean there is very little \u2013 if anything \u2013 in terms of evidence available to be pursued. \u201cNo forensics, no CCTV, nothing; it\u2019s all gone into thin air,\u201d said one source. Garda headquarters did not respond to a series of questions about the issue of organised car thefts. However, sources said suspects had been identified and several investigations were under way. Overall, while the sophisticated for-profit end of the car theft sector was expanding, garda\u00ed remain worried that there is scope for further significant growth. \u201cIf you look at the guys involved in the disorganised end of car thefts, a lot of them generally progress on to other things, whether that\u2019s organised burglaries or armed robberies,\u201d said one source. \u201cIf they realise there\u2019s money to be made stealing cars and they move up the food chain, that\u2019s a big, big worry. We\u2019re in serious trouble then because there\u2019s a lot of them.\u201d Sign up for push alerts and have the best news, analysis and comment delivered directly to your phoneJoin The Irish Times on WhatsApp and stay up to dateListen to our Inside Politics podcast for the best political chat and analysis", "summary": "Vehicle thefts jumped to a 10-year high in the Republic last year, with growing concern about both the chaotic and the increasingly organised criminals involved", "url": "https://www.irishtimes.com/crime-law/2024/06/29/disorganised-criminals-and-russian-speaking-mafias-why-car-thefts-are-surging-in-ireland/", "image": "https://www.irishtimes.com/resizer/CQBaLlpm4iSrnHUJHk5jmzjgoLE=/1600x900/filters:format(jpg):quality(70)/cloudfront-eu-central-1.images.arcpublishing.com/irishtimes/WGYLTL6J2BCTRD74NCCHRGIZ7M.jpg", "video": null, "publish_date": "2024-06-29 05:00:00", "author": "Conor Lally", "authors": ["Conor Lally"], "language": "en", "catgory": "politics", "source_country": "ie", "sentiment": -0.199}

AP Photo/Mary Schwalm\n\nLeonard Fournette is not short on confidence going into his first NFL season.\n\nWith just one game of preseason football under his belt, Fournette is already saying that playing at the pro level isn't that much of a challenge. Speaking with NFL.com after the Jaguars 31-24 win over the Patriots to start the preseason, Fournette said of the league, \"It's a lot slower than I really thought.\"\n\n\"That's how I've been since I first got into the NFL,\" Fournette continued. \"A lot of people were like, 'It's going to be fast.' But by me playing in the SEC, that kind of helped me a lot. I think, to me, it was really easy.\"\n\nIn his first taste of NFL preseason action, Fournette had nine carries for 31 yards and a touchdown.\n\nFournette was picked fourth overall by the Jaguars and is currently a favorite to win the rookie of the year award. When asked if he could pull off a similar season to Cowboys breakout star Ezekiel Elliott, Fournette replied simply, \"Yeah. I think so.\"\n\nBut Fournette's high thinking of himself isn't necessarily braggadocio. Instead, it can be seen an important belief for any player in the league to have, especially for younger players. Simply put, in order to be the best you have to think you are first.\n\n\"I'm a confident guy and I try to give my offensive line confidence, too,\" Fournette said. \"You have to feel like you can't be stopped.\"", "time": "17:31:00"}

Standing in the middle of the visiting locker room at Gillette Stadium on Thursday night, I asked Jacksonville Jaguars rookie running back Leonard Fournette, the fourth overall pick in this year's draft who had just completed his first preseason game, if he could do what Elliott had done during his rookie season.\n\n\"Yeah. I think so,\" Fournette said very matter-of-factly, without the slightest smile, following the Jags' 31-24 win.\n\nKeep in mind Elliott's 1,631 yards were the third-most for a rookie running back in NFL history.\n\n\"I believe in him,\" Jaguars second-year linebacker Myles Jack told me. \"I think he has that type of talent. I think he's capable of that. He comes in, he works hard every day. Takes care of himself. He's a hard worker, so I think he's capable -- and if his mind is set on that, I wouldn't bet against him.\"\n\nNow, Elliott was running behind the best offensive line in football last year, and how Jacksonville plays up front will have a lot to do with how successful Fournette's season will be from a numbers standpoint. And the men up front are aware.\n\n\"If we go out there and get our job done and there is a guy in the backfield with that type of talent that can turn regular plays into huge plays, it's always fun to have a talented back like that behind you,\" said rookie left tackle Cam Robinson, who's known Fournette since before they were squaring off against one another during their college days in the SEC (Robinson attended Alabama, Fournette LSU).\n\nWhen he entered the game on Jacksonville's second series, Fournette had his number called four straight times. Four yards, 5 yards and then no gain on third-and-1. Jacksonville went for it on fourth-and-1, and again it was Fournette. The 228-pound back went up the middle for 8 yards and a first down.\n\n\"I'm a confident guy and I try to give my offensive line confidence, too,\" Fournette said. \"You have to feel like you can't be stopped.\"\n\nJaguars head coach Doug Marrone was excited because he had never seen Fournette from the sidelines in a live game before.\n\n\"I think you can see he is a powerful kid, powerful running back and I just wanted to make sure about ball security,\" Marrone said after the game. \"Things like you don't see when you are at this level, you want to see -- obviously it is a physical game, and you want to see how he reacts to it, and he had no issue with that at all.\"\n\nNo issue at all in the eyes of his head coach. But Fournette, who finished with 31 yards and a touchdown on nine carries, was more to the point when I asked him about the ever-present belief that it takes rookies time to adjust to the speed of the NFL.\n\n\"It's a lot slower than I really thought,\" Fournette told me. \"That's how I've been since I first got into the NFL. A lot of people were like, 'It's going to be fast.' But by me playing in the SEC, that kind of helped me a lot. I think, to me, it was really easy.\"\n\nThere are high expectations -- many are predicting Fournette to win Offensive Rookie of the Year. And perhaps an even larger amount of pressure because of the Jaguars' struggles over the last several seasons. But you can feel when talking to the rookie back that he has a way of handling pressure that few people possess.\n\n\"I've had pressure my whole life,\" Fournette, a five-star recruit out of high school, told me. \"I'm built for it. No matter what the circumstances, I've never let the game get bigger than me and I've always stayed humble. That's No. 1.\"", "time": "09:15:00"}

Jags head coach Doug Marrone watched Fournette for the first time on the sidelines and saw him have no issue adjusting to the physical NFL game.\n\n\"I think you can see he is a powerful kid, powerful running back and I just wanted to make sure about ball security,\" Marrone said. \"Things like you don't see when you are at this level, you want to see, obviously it is a physical game, and you want to see how he reacts to it, and he had no issue with that at all.\"\n\nWhile everyone in the football world is watching him adjust in the NFL (some rooting for and others against), pressure is nothing new for Fournette. After all, he was the former No. 1 high school player in the country and arguably the top back in the country at LSU, so adjusting to added pressure isn't a big issue either, he says.\n\n\"I've had pressure my whole life,\" Fournette said. \"I'm built for it. No matter what the circumstances, I've never let the game get bigger than me and I've always stayed humble. That's number one.\"\n\nNo doubt Fournette has all the physical capabilities to be a big-time NFL back, but staying healthy will be paramount in the NFL where the shelf-life of a RB is short-lived.", "time": "11:31:00"}

When asked if he could pull off a similar season to Cowboys breakout star Ezekiel Elliott, Fournette replied simply, \"Yeah. I think so.\"\n\nBut Fournette's high thinking of himself isn't necessarily braggadocio. Instead, it can be seen an important belief for any player in the league to have, especially for younger players. Simply put, in order to be the best you have to think you are first.\n\n\"I'm a confident guy and I try to give my offensive line confidence, too,\" Fournette said. \"You have to feel like you can't be stopped.\"\n\nThe Jaguars open the season September 10 against the Houston Texans.\n\nNOW WATCH: People miss the real reason OJ Simpson got acquitted, says his former lawyer Alan Dershowitz\n\nSee Also:\n\n32-year-old NFL lineman reportedly wants to unretire after abruptly leaving Jaguars training camp one week agoOne of the NFL's largest players announced his retirement in a commercial for ribs and charcoalMuch-maligned Jets quarterback Christian Hackenberg was ordered off the practice field when he failed one his most basic tasks", "time": "06:54:00"}

"JACKSONVILLE, Fla. -- The expectations for Jacksonville Jaguars running back Leonard Fournette are sky high.\n\nHe's the odds-on favorite to be the NFL Rookie of the Year.\n\nThe best running back in franchise history called him a \"beast.\"\n\nExecutive VP of football operations Tom Coughlin told Fournette they drafted him fourth overall \"to put the ball in the end zone.\"\n\nWin awards. Surpass 1,200 yards. Score touchdowns. Elevate a franchise that hasn't had a winning record since 2007 and has lost 11 or more games each of the past six seasons. All that is falling upon the broad shoulders of a 22-year-old who will be playing in his first NFL preseason game on Thursday night.\n\nYet to Fournette, that's nothing new. He's been dealing with immense expectations on the football field since he first put on pads. He'll attack these the way he did when he was starring at LSU and St. Augustine High School in New Orleans: by shrugging them off.\n\n\"To me, it never was pressure,\" Fournette said. \"You expect that from yourself. All the work you put in, you expect to succeed.\n\n\"I'm a firm believer if you work hard, at the end of the day, you'll get what you came for.\"\n\nThat's not arrogance. That's acknowledging history, because Fournette has met -- and exceeded -- the enormous expectations at every level. The NFL is just the next logical step.\n\n\"This kid was a legend when he was 5-, 6-years-old when he started playing football,\" said David Johnson, Fournette's high school coach for three seasons and now the wide receivers coach at Memphis. \"He always had those expectations.\"\n\nFournette was a youth football star in New Orleans. He was bigger and faster and stronger than the other kids his age and was running around and over everyone so regularly that opposing coaches were demanding to see his birth certificate.\n\nAt 12-years-old, opposing parents signed a petition to get him banned, so it's easy to see why Fournette was already a football legend in New Orleans by the time he set foot at St. Augustine High School in 2008. It didn't take long for the legend to grow, either.\n\nFournette rushed for more than 1,000 yards over his first three games as a ninth-grader, and that's all Frank Wilson, the recruiting coordinator and running backs coach at LSU, needed to see. He offered the 14-year-old Fournette a scholarship.\n\n\"Everybody thought at the time that Frank Wilson was crazy,\" Johnson said. \"We are from New Orleans, and we coached at [Landry-Walker College and Career Prep] together and he asked me, 'Dave, how good is he?' I said, 'He is the best running back I've ever seen in my life. It's not even close.'\"\n\nBy the time Fournette was a senior, he was a consensus top-five recruit in the nation, and Scout.com ranked him No. 1 overall, one spot ahead of now-Jaguars teammate Cam Robinson and four spots ahead of Myles Garrett, who was the No. 1 overall pick in the 2017 NFL draft.\n\nHe also was the subject of a documentary produced and directed by Kenny Chenier. \"The Road to Stardom: The Leonard Fournette Story\" premiered on Louisiana Public Broadcasting two days before Fournette played in his first game for LSU.\n\nEven before his first practice with the Tigers, then-LSU head coach Les Miles compared him to one of the greatest athletes of all time.\n\n\"He expects himself to be something very special,\" Miles said at the annual SEC media days in 2014. \"I think if you look at Michael Jordan, he could not have been coached to be Michael Jordan. Michael Jordan accepted the role of expecting him to be better than any.\"\n\nAnd Fournette was. He broke the LSU freshman rushing record by gaining 1,034 yards and followed that up by breaking the school's single-season records for rushing yards (1,953) and rushing touchdowns (22). Though he struggled with an ankle injury in 2016, he still rushed for 843 yards in seven games before declaring he was skipping his senior season.\n\nFour months later, he was the fourth overall pick by a franchise that hasn't had a 1,000-yard rusher since 2011 and ranks last in the NFL in rushing yards per game (92.1) since then.\n\nAll the Jaguars need is for him to have the same kind of impact Ezekiel Elliott had for Dallas in 2016. Elliott led the NFL in rushing with 1,631 yards, but he did it running behind what's regarded as the best offensive line in the league. Fournette certainly doesn't have that advantage, but he's still saddled with immense expectations from a hungry fan base -- and even some of his teammates.\n\n\"I knew about Leonard since he was in high school. He's going to be very talented in this league,\" second-year linebacker Myles Jack said. \"He's very sturdy, very strong, good pass protector. He can catch; he can do it all. I wouldn't be surprised if he rushes for a good amount of yards. He'll be a big part of our offense. I expect big things from him.\n\n\"He's very talented, he's everything they say he is, and he'll be very valuable to this team.\"\n\nPressed for what he meant by \"a good amount,\" Jack responded: \"Hopefully over 1,000.\n\n\"I see big things for him and I'm sure he does himself. I'm sure that's not putting any pressure on him; I'm sure he wants the same thing, probably even more.\"\n\nThose expectations are no problem, says Fournette's former high school coach. He said he's never seen a player handle that kind of pressure the way Fournette does.\n\n\"That's unique,\" Johnson said. \"It's not even close, because most kids will fold or do some things to kind of act out, but this kid, even since he was 6-, 7-years-old, he was able to handle it and able to deliver.\"", "time": "13:29:00"}

During the 2017 NFL Draft, some clubs were willing to risk a lot -- and that includes jobs and reputations -- in order to (hopefully) land their quarterback of the future.\n\nIt's imperative to place a high value on what many consider to be the most important position in all of sports. Yet, the running back spot, on the other hand, tends to get de-valued. However, after watching Jacksonville's Leonard Fournette do his thing in his NFL preseason debut, it might be time to rethink that.\n\nIt's easy to see why the Jaguars selected the former LSU All-American with the fourth overall pick in the 2017 draft. At 6-foot-1, 230 pounds, Fournette has the size, strength, power, and brute force to be a special player in this league. And you better believe this was all on full display in Jacksonville's 31-24 victory over the New England Patriots on Thursday night. But what might've been more impressive than his performance on the field, which included nine carries for 31 yards and a touchdown, is how easily and quickly he's adjusted to the NFL game.\n\nMost first-year players struggle with the speed of the game in the NFL. Fournette, as we learned during his conversation with NFL.com following the game, isn't having the same difficulty:\n\nIt's a lot slower than I really thought. That's how I've been since I first got into the NFL. A lot of people were like, 'It's going to be fast.' But by me playing in the SEC, that kind of helped me a lot. I think, to me, it was really easy.\n\nIt's not often you hear rookies describe their initial introduction to the National Football League as \"really easy.\" Clearly, Fournette a different specimen all together; one who's not going to be overwhelmed by the spotlight or the size of the stage. Added the running back: \"I've had pressure my whole life. I'm built for it. No matter what the circumstances, I've never let the game get bigger than me and I've always stayed humble. That's No. 1.\"\n\nFournette is a rookie, but he certainly doesn't sound like one. And if his debut is any indication of things to come, you can expect his play will match his tone. The rest of the Jaguars would be wise to follow his lead.", "time": "14:58:00"}

running backs Leonard Fournette and Dalvin Cook, part of a 2017 NFL Draft class loaded with premier skill position players, have emerged as the two best candidates for Offensive Rookie of the Year after only one game in the preseason.\n\nThe first is obviously talent, which was on full display as the Jaguars first-rounder and the Vikings second-rounder made their respective, much-anticipated debuts Thursday night. The second is that both backs are in great situations and are set up for feature duty right away. Talent and volume lead to big numbers, which lead to OROY.\n\nFANTASY SOURCE: How to put RBs into tiers\n\nFournette's first task was to face the defending Super Bowl champs in New England. Granted, Jacksonville wasn't seeing the the Patriots' front-line defenders, but it didn't take long to see that expensive holdover veteran Chris Ivory starting ahead of him was just window dressing.\n\nAfter one series from Ivory, Fournette wasted no time going to work with the bruising running style that made him the No. 4 overall pick out of LSU. Behind solid interior blocking, the Jaguars pounded Fournette between the tackles on four consecutive carries, with the most impressive being an 8-yard run to convert on fourth-and-1. He delivered one more time in short yardage to set up a field goal.\n\nMORE: Dolphins LB McMillan likely has ACL tear\n\nT.J Yeldon got some first-half touches, and Ivory got back in the game, but their combined lack of power and pop quickly reminded the Jaguars why they needed someone like Fournette to grind out tough yards and deliver longer chunk runs, which they were sorely lacking last season.\n\nEnter Fournette again. After a long pass interference penalty on the Patriots, and with a few more runs off right guard, he finished in the red zone as advertised. He scored on a short but strong 1-yard run.\n\n\u1f64c\u1f64c\u1f64c\u1f64c\u1f64c\u1f64c\n\nWELCOME TO THE NFL, @_fournette! #JAXvsNE pic.twitter.com/VXYD7SyMFW -- NFL (@NFL)\n\nAugust 11, 2017\n\nFournette finished with 31 yards on nine carries and that touchdown, and the Jaguars didn't even tap into his underrated, improving receiving skills. Everything seen out of Fournette confirmed he can be beastly as a rookie.\n\nThe Vikings, meanwhile, haven't been dancing around with Cook. He was listed as No. 1 on the depth chart going into the game, and he had to extend himself as a starter against the Bills with veteran backs Latavius Murray and Jerick McKinnon both out with injuries. It would seem Cook has much more competition than Fournette in Murray vs. Ivory (early downs) and McKinnon vs. Yeldon (third downs), but in fact, durability has been a big early factor in Cook's favor, just as it was when he became Florida State's all-time leading rusher.\n\nCook didn't have any hype plays, and his debut numbers -- five carries for 13 yards, four receptions for 30 yards -- were modest on paper, but consider: He had the same number of touches as Fournette and was efficient in catching all of his targets.\n\nFANTASY RANKINGS: SN's Top 200\n\nBoth players are already being treated like seasoned pass protectors, too, which gives their teams little reason to take them off the field beyond the typical situational breathers.\n\nMinnesota is used to having a bell cow with Adrian Peterson. Jacksonville has been longing for one since the best days of Maurice Jones-Drew. As two teams whose strengths are on defense, Cook and Fournette are the ideal backs to help them regain/forge matching physical offensive identities.\n\nPanthers running back Christian McCaffrey and Texans quarterback Deshaun Watson took immediate star turns in their debuts Wednesday, but it's still unknown how much Carolina is willing to put on McCaffrey right away and Houston hasn't even thought about naming Watson a starter.\n\nFournette and Cook, on the other hand, have been lined up for monster workloads for a while. It's refreshing to see the Jaguars and Vikings letting them have at it right away. Their production is set up to be high and rival each other's in 2017, which will make for a most intriguing two-man race for Rookie of the Year -- and a most interesting decision in fantasy football.", "time": "02:31:00"}

I think so,\" matter-of-factly.\n\nIs that a fair question, though?\n\nThere's no denying that Fournette, one of the most dominant college running backs of this century, is set up for success in the pros. He has the power, size and speed to thrive at the NFL level, especially if he gets help up front.\n\nAnd that's exactly where the comparison between the Jaguars running back and the Dallas Cowboys tailback veers off the tracks.\n\nNot to discredit Elliott -- he earned it in his rookie season -- but he was taking carries with an offensive line that parts gaps better than Moses. The Cowboys sent three linemen to the Pro Bowl last season among a unit that Pro Football Focus ranked No. 2 for the 2016 regular season. Elliott had to be licking his chops when the Cowboys drafted him.\n\nThe Jaguars offensive line surprisingly ranked in the top half of the league when PFF drummed up its preseason list. It's still not going to be good enough to get Fournette more than 1,600 yards or close to Elliott's 1,631, the third-most by a rookie running back in NFL history.\n\nGood for the offensive line, though. That unit finally has motivation to block after trying to move bodies for a revolving door of running backs including Denard Robinson, T.J. Yeldon and Chris Ivory over recent memory.\n\nHere's to a thumbs-up rookie year for Fournette and a franchise trying to climb out of the shadows of the AFC South. Jacksonville wasted no time in the draft to find its franchise running back.\n\nHowever, racking up 1,600-some yards and impacting the game the way Elliott did in his rookie season would be surprising.\n\nFor a team that hasn't had a 1,000-yard rusher since 2011-12, maybe that's the ideal place to start.\n\nRelated Items:Dallas Cowboys, NFC East FanRag Sports Daily NFL Newsletter", "time": "18:52:00"}

back Leonard Fournette is one of the most ballyhooed runners to enter the NFL in some time. After a three-year college career in which he ran for 3,830 yards on 616 carries (6.2 yards per carry) with 40 touchdowns, it's easy to see where the hype comes from.\n\nBut the NFL is whole different ballgame, right Leonard?\n\n\"It's a lot slower than I really thought,\" Fournette told James Palmer of NFL.com after his Jacksonville Jaguars played their first preseason game Thursday night against the New England Patriots. \"That's how I've been since I first got into the NFL. A lot of people were like, 'It's going to be fast.' But by me playing in the SEC, that kind of helped me a lot. I think, to me, it was really easy.\"\n\nBefore Fournette anoints himself a Hall of Famer, he might do well to take stock of who he was playing against. The Patriots played very few starters Thursday, and Coach Bill Belichick isn't going to show one significant look in the preseason. Fournette probably will notice a huge difference in speed in four weeks when the regular season opens.\n\nAnd for someone who thought the NFL was easy, you'd figure he'd have gotten more than 31 yards on nine carries. He did score a touchdown on a 1-yard run.\n\nAlso, the NFL is not known as a place that takes kindly to rookies shooting off at the mouth. That quote probably won't be forgotten soon, and defenders might find an extra gear when they see the Jaguars on the schedule.\n\nHow about players whose careers are cut short from the ramifications.\n\nSan Francisco Giants' infielder/outfielder Michael Morse is likely out for the remainder of the season, reports Alex Pavlovic of NBC Sports Bay Area. Morse suffered a concussion and bruised ribs after a collision with teammate Jeff Samardzija during the infamous Hunter Strickland/Bryce Harper brawl on May 29, and he has not made a full recovery.\n\nHe's expected to join the team on its road trip in Miami this week, but his chances of making a full comeback -- in this season or any other -- seem slim.\n\nBefore the melee, Morse slashed .194/.250/.306 with 1 home run in 40 plate appearances with San Francisco. Even before his head collided with Samardzija as the two converged on the pileup, it looked like 2017 would be the final encore to a 13-year Major League career, one that had petered out after the 35-year-old took a six-game gig with the 2016 Pirates.\n\nHe was officially placed on the 10-day disabled list June 8 but, as of Aug. 11, he has yet to take any kind of rehab assignment with the team. According to the San Jose Mercury News' Andrew Baggarly, Manager Bruce Bochy told reporters he does not intend to reinstate Morse on the active roster come September.\n\nThis sad ending recalls the final game of longtime catcher Jason LaRue. On Aug. 10, 2010, the St. Louis Cardinals and Cincinnati Reds got into a brawl after Cardinals' catcher Yadier Molina and Reds' second baseman Brandon Phillips went nose to nose in the batter's box.\n\nDuring the scrum, LaRue took a kick to the head from Reds' pitcher Johnny Cueto, leaving him with a concussion. Faced with the possibility another blow to his head might ruin his life, the 12-year veteran retired about a month after the brawl.\n\nThe tales of Morse and LaRue show there can be real consequences to what often are considered harmless shove fests.\n\nSPORTS QUIZ\n\nWith what pick did the Jacksonville Jaguars select Leonard Fournette in the 2017 NFL Draft?", "time": "07:17:00"}

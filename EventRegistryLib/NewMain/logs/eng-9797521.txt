The illness which sent him into a coma is also undisclosed.\n\nPrincess Martha, whose first husband Ari Behn took his own life in December 2019, also claims to hold spiritual powers, and has previously recalled having what she says were 'psychic premonitions' when she was a child.\n\nSpeaking to the BBC last year, she said: 'When I was little I would see things in you. If you were sad or if you were happy... if you had a pain in your shoulder I would get a pain in my shoulder.\n\n'And I understood that that's a talent and, you know, I could help other people. And that's when the whole ball started rolling.'\n\nPrincess Martha Louise and Ari Behn married in 2002 and have three children together Maud Angelica, Leah Isadora and Emma Tallulah\n\nShe also revealed she had decided to step down as a working royal so she could earn her own money; something she has since pursued through a podcast and touring the nation giving spiritual talks and holding workshops.\n\nShe added that, in Norway, spiritual beliefs like the ones she holds are 'taboo'.\n\nAfter giving up her position in the royal family, the Princess revealed she has had to deal with 'lots of scrutiny' - particularly when she takes on new roles.\n\n'Everything you do that's a first, that goes out of the box that you're put in,' she said, adding that press scrutiny has 'continued'.\n\nThe approach to the wedding has hardly been smooth sailing thus far as, following outrage in Norway over Verrett's views, the shamanic healer has been embroiled in a furious row with his estranged mother over claims she made in an interview with a Norwegian tabloid.\n\nLast month, the couple confirmed they sent a cease-and-desist letter to Veruschka Urquhart, with Durek explaining on Instagram how they believe their decision is 'the only remaining option for change'.\n\nHe said his mother has 'repeatedly slandered our characters through false statements showing a significant lack of care and love towards M\u00e4rtha, myself, and our respective families'.\n\nIn interviews with celebrity magazine Se og H\u00f8r, Veruschka has labelled her son 'dangerous', alleging that he had 'brainwashed' the princess and that their family was not as wealthy as Durek has tried to make out.\n\nThe publication claimed on Thursday to be sharing the 'shock letter, word for word', in which M\u00e4rtha has reportedly threatened her future mother-in-law with a multimillion-dollar lawsuit, if she does not retract what she has said.\n\nThe letter from 'Shaman Durek and Princess Martha Louise' allegedly reads: 'We are writing to order you to refrain from defaming, disparaging and making false and provocative statements about Shaman Durek.\n\n'If you do not fully and loyally comply with this order, and choose not to deny your statements, Shaman Durek will use the civil remedies at his disposal against you to the extent possible under the law, including seeking damages of millions of dollars.

Marius allegedly attacked a woman in her 20s \"psychologically and physically,\" the magazine learned.\n\nPer Se og H\u00f8r, the woman eventually managed to get the Crown Princess' firstborn out of her apartment and called the police.

According to Se og H\u00f8r, Marius is now at Skaugum with his mother Mette-Marit, who was due to join her husband, Crown Prince Haakon, in Paris for the Olympics on Aug. 6. The future King of Norway was seen out at events on Tuesday. The palace's communications advisor Simen L\u00f8vberg Sund told Se og H\u00f8r (translated to English): \"The Crown Princess has temporarily postponed her departure and hopes to travel down later.\"\n\nMarius is the Crown Princess' son from a previous relationship. Mette-Marit was a single mother when she met Crown Prince Haakon, who is first in line to the Norwegian throne. The couple tied the knot in 2001. Mette-Marit and Haakon welcomed their first child together, Princess Ingrid Alexandra, in 2004, followed by their second child together, Prince Sverre Magnus, in 2005.\n\nBack in 2017, Mette-Marit revealed in an open letter that Marius was quitting his public life.

And I'm no better myself. As a mother, I often find myself having expectations of Marius's behavior that are unrealistic, and different from what I would have for his siblings.\"\n\nIn her letter, the mom of three admitted that she was glad that her \"youthful rebellion was not watched with arguable eyes.\" She noted, \"It had looked much worse. I would like to take this opportunity to thank all the media that have treated Marius' youth with wisdom.\"\n\nTowards the end of her letter, the Crown Princess shared that Marius did \"not want to live a life in the public eye,\" adding, \"My obligation to him as a mother is to take seriously the responsibility that was given to me at Aker hospital 20 years ago.\"", "source": {"uri": "hola.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Hola.com"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Se_og_H\u00f8r", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Se og H\u00f8r"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mette-Marit,_Crown_Princess_of_Norway", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Mette-Marit, Crown Princess of Norway"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haakon,_Crown_Prince_of_Norway", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Haakon, Crown Prince of Norway"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Victoria,_Crown_Princess_of_Sweden", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Victoria, Crown Princess of Sweden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Princess_Ingrid_Alexandra_of_Norway", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Princess Ingrid Alexandra of Norway"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prince_Sverre_Magnus_of_Norway", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Prince Sverre Magnus of Norway"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Crown", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "The Crown"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monarchy_of_Norway", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Monarchy of Norway"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/English_language", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "English language"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oslo", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Oslo"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Oslo"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Norway"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skaugum", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Skaugum"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paris", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aker,_Norway", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Aker, Norway"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Aker, Norway"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Sweden"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Home/Family/Parenting", "label": "dmoz/Home/Family/Parenting", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Death", "label": "dmoz/Society/Death", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Death/In_Memoriam", "label": "dmoz/Society/Death/In Memoriam", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Relationships/Marriage", "label": "dmoz/Society/Relationships/Marriage", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://www.hola.com/us/horizon/landscape/e8edf4f5d044-gettyimages-542381296.jpg?im=Resize=(1200)", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9797521", "eventUri": "eng-9797521", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-08-06", "textStart": 1066, "textEnd": 1072}], "sentiment": -0.1215686274509804, "wgt": 223, "relevance": 1}

Neither my client nor I have been informed of the full details of the case, and he has not yet given a statement, on my advice.'\n\nThe police's security service (PST), which is responsible for the security of the royal family, confirmed to Nettavisen that they are aware of the incident.\n\n'We can confirm that PST was informed shortly after the incident. But we do not want to comment on the case further and we refer the Oslo police district for statements', said Martin Bernsen, senior adviser in PST, to the newspaper.\n\nGrowing up, he made public appearances with his mother, stepfather and half sister Ingrid Alexandra (who is the future queen of Norway) and half brother Prince Sverre Magnus on occasions such as national day.\n\nHowever, when he turned 20 the royal court announced he was stepping away from public life and his profile was removed from the family's official website.\n\n'H\u00f8iby will not conduct any official activities on the Royal Family's behalf,' a statement said, 'on the basis of his wish to live outside the public eye.'\n\nHis mother Crown Princess Mette-Marit wrote also published an open letter on the court website, saying: 'Marius is, and will continue to be, a vital member of our family.'\n\n'He has always had a public role that has been very difficult to define.'\n\n'Unlike his siblings, he has no official duties. He won't have a public role and is not a public person.'\n\n'Marius became a symbol for the unusual choice we made when we married.'\n\nMarius was previously linked to heiress Linn Helena Nilsen, but the couple split in July 2017.\n\nFemail has contacted the Norwegian royal palace for comment.\n\nThe incident threatens to overshadow what should be a happy time for the Norwegian royal family as Princess Martha Louise, Crown Prince Haakon's older sister, is set to marry her husband, 'Shaman' Durek Verrett, on August 31 at the Union Hotel in Geirangerfjord.\n\nThe couple's relationship has not been without controversy itself, as the Norwegian royal, who had been the heir to the throne following stepped down as a working member of the royal family following backlash over her partner's controversial views.\n\nIn November 2022, Martha Louise announced she would no longer be a working royal after the American shamanic healer's previous assertions came to light.\n\nAmong his deeply controversial and pseudoscientific opinions, published in a book called 'Spirit Hacking', were claims that children 'can get cancer from being unhappy'.\n\nDurek has also claimed he once came back from the dead, recovering from a month-long coma, by letting his soul 'burn' and he has also spoken of having to undergo a kidney transplant from his sister as a child.\n\nIt is unclear why he needed the kidney or how he became wheelchair bound, as he has described. The illness which sent him into a coma is also undisclosed.\n\nPrincess Martha, whose first husband Ari Behn took his own life in December 2019, also claims to hold spiritual powers, and has previously recalled having what she says were 'psychic premonitions' when she was a child.\n\nSpeaking to the BBC last year, she said: 'When I was little I would see things in you. If you were sad or if you were happy... if you had a pain in your shoulder I would get a pain in my shoulder.\n\n'And I understood that that's a talent and, you know, I could help other people. And that's when the whole ball started rolling.'\n\nShe also revealed she had decided to step down as a working royal so she could earn her own money; something she has since pursued through a podcast and touring the nation giving spiritual talks and holding workshops.\n\nShe added that, in Norway, spiritual beliefs like the ones she holds are 'taboo'.\n\nAfter giving up her position in the royal family, the Princess revealed she has had to deal with 'lots of scrutiny' - particularly when she takes on new roles.\n\n'Everything you do that's a first, that goes out of the box that you're put in,' she said, adding that press scrutiny has 'continued'.\n\nThe approach to the wedding has hardly been smooth sailing thus far as, following outrage in Norway over Verrett's views, the shamanic healer has been embroiled in a furious row with his estranged mother over claims she made in an interview with a Norwegian tabloid.\n\nLast month, the couple confirmed they sent a cease-and-desist letter to Veruschka Urquhart, with Durek explaining on Instagram how they believe their decision is 'the only remaining option for change'.\n\nHe said his mother has 'repeatedly slandered our characters through false statements showing a significant lack of care and love towards M\u00e4rtha, myself, and our respective families'.\n\nIn interviews with celebrity magazine Se og H\u00f8r, Veruschka has labelled her son 'dangerous', alleging that he had 'brainwashed' the princess and that their family was not as wealthy as Durek has tried to make out.\n\nThe publication claimed on Thursday to be sharing the 'shock letter, word for word', in which M\u00e4rtha has reportedly threatened her future mother-in-law with a multimillion-dollar lawsuit, if she does not retract what she has said.\n\nThe letter from 'Shaman Durek and Princess Martha Louise' allegedly reads: 'We are writing to order you to refrain from defaming, disparaging and making false and provocative statements about Shaman Durek.\n\n'If you do not fully and loyally comply with this order, and choose not to deny your statements, Shaman Durek will use the civil remedies at his disposal against you to the extent possible under the law, including seeking damages of millions of dollars. To put it plainly, Shaman Durek will sue you.'", "source": {"uri": "internewscast.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Internewscast Journal"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

Neither my client nor I have been made aware of the full content of the case, nor has he explained himself yet, on my advice.\n\n\"It is important that the process is allowed to take its course in the right way, and that the media respects my client's need for privacy and tranquillity.\n\nREAD MORE: New memorial garden dedicated to Queen Elizabeth II to open\n\n\"The police must be allowed to do their job without the media deciding the facts and culpability.\"\n\nThe alleged attack took place inside an apartment in the suburb of Frogner in Oslo.\n\nAccording to Se og H\u00f8r, Hoiby is alleged to have attacked the woman \"psychologically and physically\".\n\nThe woman was taken to hospital but discharged on Monday.\n\nHoiby was arrested at a different address on Sunday and held by police for 30 hours in solitary confinement, the publication was told, before being released on Monday.\n\nA blood test was taken to determine whether drugs were involved.\n\nHe is now believed to be staying with his mother at Skaugum, the official residence of the Crown Prince family in Asker, south-west of Oslo.\n\nHoiby was raised by Crown Prince Haakon since he was three years old, when his mother married Norway's future King.\n\nAccording to Norwegian historian and author Trond Nor\u00e9n Isaksen, it is the first time a member of the royal family has been charged with a crime.\n\nHoiby was just four years old when his mother, a commoner, married Crown Prince Haakon, who will one day succeed the throne from his father King Harald.\n\nBefore the wedding at Oslo Cathedral in 2001, there was much attention on the bride-to-be due to her so-called scandalous past and that she was a single mother.\n\nDays before the ceremony, Mette-Marit apologised for her rebellious days in an emotional press conference.\n\n\"My youth rebellion was much stronger than many others,\" Mette-Marit said, the BBC reported at the rime.\n\n\"That resulted in me living quite a wild life.\"\n\nAddressing reports about attending parties where drugs were present she said: \"We overstepped the limits. It was a costly experience for me, that I took a long time to get over.\n\n\"I would like to take this opportunity to say that I condemn drugs,\" Mette-Marit said, but did not say whether she had taken them herself.\n\n\"I cannot make these choices again, even though I would wish I could.\"\n\nThe wedding was attended by royalty across Europe including then-Prince Charles of Britain, Denmark's Queen Margrethe II, Sweden's King Carl XVI Gustaf, Prince Albert of Monaco and then-Crown Prince Felipe of Spain.\n\nSince then, both Crown Princess Mette-Marit and her son have become much-loved members of the Norwegian royal family.\n\nHoiby was raised by Crown Prince Haakon as a son, but he does not have a royal title.\n\nCrown Princess Mette-Marit and Crown Prince Haakon have two other children, Princess Ingrid Alexandra, 20, and Prince Sverre Magnus, 18. Princess Ingrid will become Queen after her father.\n\nOver the years Hoiby has attended many family and official events with the Norwegian royals before temporarily moving to London.\n\nIn 2022, he stood by his sister's side at her 18th birthday celebrations along with Norway's King and Queen and prime minister.\n\nHoiby has an Instagram page with more than 65k followers where he shares photos from his travels and daily life. In 2012, he came under fire for using the account to post information on the whereabouts of the Norwegian royal family, prompting a security scare.", "source": {"uri": "honey.nine.com.au", "dataType":

On Sunday, he was arrested and held in a cell for 30 hours, and now he is accused of assaulting a woman.\n\nThe scandalized man's mother has not been seen in public since the incident. According to the Daily Mail, she decided to temporarily postpone her trip to Paris for the 2024 Olympics.\n\nNorwegian media reported that Marius was detained in an apartment in Oslo, where a 20-year-old woman called the police. The crown prince's stepson is preliminarily accused of assault. It is a case of psychological and physical violence, the journalists said.\n\nThe Norwegian publication reported that Marius was first charged with \"bodily harm\" and now with \"causing damage.\" The fact is that the apartment where the police arrived was allegedly badly damaged.\n\nThe victim was hospitalized and diagnosed with a concussion. At that time, Marius was held in solitary confinement for 30 hours while his blood was tested for drugs.\n\nAccording to rumors, the 27-year-old is now in the royal estate of Skaugum with his 50-year-old mother.

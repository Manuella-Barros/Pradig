These 3 adjustments would help", "body": "LOS ANGELES -- The Los Angeles Lakers' season is on the line in Thursday's Game 3 against the Denver Nuggets.\n\nA 3-0 series deficit would be a death knell. Los Angeles is already facing long odds of a series comeback against the defending champions: Teams with home-court advantage that are up 2-0 in a best-of-seven first-round series go on to win 94.7 percent of the time. But another loss would put the Lakers in unenviable company: Teams that are up 3-0 win 100 percent of the time, regardless of home-court status.\n\nWhile the Lakers can be better on both ends, their remaining defensive adjustments are limited. Other than ensuring Rui Hachimura does not guard Nikola Joki\u0107 one-on-one, mixing up the timing and location of double-teams against Joki\u0107 and boxing out more effectively, the Lakers have executed their defensive game plan as well as reasonably possible. There is a limit to how well any team can defend Denver.\n\nOffensively, however, the Lakers have underperformed, especially in the second half of both Games 1 and 2. Their focus entering Game 3 is maintaining the pace and execution that led to them holding double-digit leads in both games. They'd also like to convert more shots in the paint and around the rim, where they've been uncharacteristically subpar. Los Angeles shot a league-leading 68.9 percent within 5 feet of the basket during the regular season but is at just 53.8 percent through two games.\n\n\"We were great defensively,\" Lakers coach Darvin Ham said Wednesday when asked about the Lakers' Game 2 defeat. \"Offensively, there was a lot of shots we wish we could have back. We missed a lot of point-blank layups.\"\n\nWith that perspective, here are three realistic adjustments for the Lakers entering the most important game of their season.\n\nIf you want to know why the Lakers are down 2-0 in this series, look no further than their second-half collapses in both losses. Specifically, the Lakers abandoned everything that worked offensively: their organization, their finishing and especially their pace.\n\nAfter getting off to great starts -- leading by 12 points midway through the second quarter in Game 1 and by 20 early in the third quarter of Game 2 -- the Lakers started walking the ball up the floor, draining the shot clock and showing less discipline with their execution. It's human nature to ease up with a lead, but these are all bad habits that cost the Lakers during various points of the regular season. Now, they're showing up in the most critical moments of the season.\n\n\"Our pace has to continue,\" Ham said. \"You build a lead, you can't go to playing slow or playing the clock game. Like, you just have to stay aggressive, stay organized. Understand where we're trying to go with the ball. Being aggressive in the paint. The things we've been preaching all year.\"\n\nThe shift was obvious in both games. LeBron James, who has taken on a larger role as the lead ballhandler and maestro in the postseason, historically prefers a more deliberate style, especially when his team leads. But the Lakers aren't good enough to play like that against the Nuggets, who possess one of the league's best half-court offenses.\n\nThe numbers are drastic: Los Angeles' offensive rating has dropped from 121.4 points per 100 possessions in the first half to 92.2 in the second. In addition, the game's pace has slowed to a crawl, from 98.5 possessions per 48 minutes in the first half to just 89 in the second half. The Lakers' assist percentage has also nosedived from 68.1 percent in the first half to 46.7 percent in the second half. Essentially, they're significantly worse offensively, playing slower and generating fewer assisted buckets. It's surprising considering the Lakers' offensive turnaround over the second half of the regular season.\n\nThe unexpected decline led to an awkward back-and-forth between Davis and Ham between games.\n\nDavis, who was scoreless over the final 19 minutes of Game 2, seemingly took a shot at the team's preparation and execution.\n\n\"Just gotta focus on Game 3,\" Davis said in a news conference after Game 2's loss. \"We've shown that we're more than capable. We have stretches where we just don't know what we're doing on both ends of the floor. And those are the ones that cost us. So we have two days to get it right and come ready to win Game 3 on Thursday.\"\n\nThe \"We have stretches where we just don't know what we're doing on both ends of the floor\" line was especially telling. Regardless of the Lakers superstar's meaning or intent, that's not a comment that bodes well after the 86th game of the season.\n\nWhen asked about Davis' remark Wednesday, Ham pushed back against the assertion.\n\n\"I just think sometimes, when plays don't turn out the way you think they should, then the frustration sets in a little bit,\" Ham said. \"But I don't think it's [from] us not being organized. I think I have incredibly talented coaches all along my staff. We pride ourselves, whether it's a practice, a shootaround, a film session, a game or whatever, we pride ourselves on being highly efficient and organized. I just chalk that up to being frustrated. It's an emotional game, the way it ended and all of that. But I'll agree to disagree on that one.\"\n\nOne concerning trend for the Lakers: The Nuggets' bench, widely considered a shallow group, has outplayed the Lakers' reserves. Christian Braun and Peyton Watson have been the two best bench players in the series, largely due to their on-ball defense, rebounding and energy. It's reached the point where the Lakers have cut their bench players' minutes, barring foul trouble or an injury.\n\nTaurean Prince has been the only bench player contributing offensively. He's been a minus defensively, though and should probably play slightly less than the 21 minutes he's averaged over the first two games. (He certainly shouldn't play as a power forward considering Denver dominates the glass even when it uses smaller lineups.)\n\nThe Lakers have been outscored by 21 points in Spencer Dinwiddie's 23 minutes. They've been outscored by 10 points in Gabe Vincent's 23 minutes. Neither player has made a shot yet. Jaxson Hayes hasn't even attempted one.\n\nOf course, that could change at Crypto.com Arena in Games 3 and 4. Role players tend to feed off the energy of the home crowd and shoot better. But the reserves' leash needs to be short. A 10-2 Nuggets run at an inopportune time could bury the Lakers and end their season.\n\nHam is still projecting confidence in his bench.\n\n\"Just keep trusting them, help them stay organized and encourage them to be aggressive,\" Ham said.\n\nBefore Game 2, Ham said the Lakers were going back to their \"normal rotation.\" The substitution patterns were closer to those of the regular season, only with higher numbers for the starters. However, none of them cracked 40 minutes after three did so in Game 1 (Davis, James and D'Angelo Russell).\n\nAt this point, the Lakers should be playing all five starters at least 35 minutes, with Davis and James above 40 minutes. Austin Reaves should be in that range, too, since he is the team's best option to defend Jamal Murray. Russell and Hachimura have each had a stinker, but they're much better than their bench replacements, so even their bad games are worth keeping them on the floor.\n\nThe Lakers could add reinforcements at some point if forwards Jarred Vanderbilt and Christian Wood return during this series. However, both were ruled out ahead of Game 3, and Game 4 is only two days away.\n\nVanderbilt would immediately help with his defense, rebounding and energy, likely taking minutes from a combination of Hachimura, Prince and Dinwiddie. Wood's role and value is slightly less clear. Hayes is already barely playing, and the Lakers need Davis for 40-44 minutes. There's a chance Wood is capped by circumstance, if he even plays at all.\n\nDenver made an important defensive adjustment early in the second half of Game 2 that drove its second-half comeback.\n\nIn the first half, the Lakers continuously targeted Joki\u0107 in the pick-and-roll, with James calling up Davis, who was defended by Joki\u0107, to screen for him. That either gave James a lane to get downhill or created a runway for Davis to attack Joki\u0107 in space. The result was Davis' 14-for-15 start for 32 points in the game's first 29 minutes.\n\nAfter a timeout at the 10-minute mark of the third quarter, though, the Nuggets countered, switching Joki\u0107 off Davis and onto Hachimura. Aaron Gordon then slid from James over to Davis, with Kentavious Caldwell-Pope moving off Russell and onto James.\n\nThese matchup adjustments had a grand ripple effect. The Lakers had to make a choice between continuing to targeting Joki\u0107 with Hachimura as the screener or to keep feeding Davis against a better defender in Gordon. They decided on the former, which, in retrospect, was a mistake.\n\nHachimura doesn't have the same gravity as a roller and struggled to catch passes and finish at the rim in Game 2. The Lakers parked Davis in the corners to drag Gordon away from the fray, which simultaneously rendered Davis, the Lakers' primary offensive weapon in the game up to that point, ineffective.\n\nThere's a reasonable chance the Nuggets start with the same matchups in Game 3 or at least go back to them later in the game. In that case, the Lakers can't let Denver dictate the terms of engagement again. Los Angeles could have continued attacking Denver with James-Davis pick-and-rolls, forcing the Nuggets to switch the smaller Caldwell-Pope onto Davis or allow James to attack downhill against a more traditional pick-and-roll coverage.\n\nFor as good of a defender as Gordon is, the Lakers could've at least tested him. Instead, they treated the matchup as if Davis couldn't score one-on-one against Gordon. There isn't a player in the league Davis can't score against. Considering Davis had made 14 consecutive shots at one point, it's mind-boggling that he finished with only 19 field goal attempts and just one in the fourth quarter.\n\n\"Definitely keep him moving around and his points of attack and different places, whether it's an off-ball screen, him posting up or him in the pick-and-roll, but they also have other guys who we try to target,\" Ham said. \"And try to put them in difficult situations. The guys who aren't premiere defenders such as KCP or Aaron Gordon. Again, it's a healthy balance that you have to have in terms of when you're targeting someone and also trying to maintain your rhythm offensively with everyone else on the floor.\"\n\nAdditionally, the Lakers could've gone to James in the post or the elbow against the smaller Caldwell-Pope. The 31-year-old former Lakers guard is an elite perimeter defender hounding the ball and chasing around screens but is more vulnerable against bigger wings who can simply overpower him. James checks that box. The one time the Lakers posted up James, he ripped through and made an and-1 jumper over Caldwell-Pope.\n\n\"My approach hasn't changed throughout my 21-year career,\" James said. \"I've been guarded by smaller guys, bigger guys throughout my whole career. It's all about getting the best shots for my teammates, for myself. Especially in the fourth quarter.\"\n\nThe Lakers have planned for various counters to Denver's potential responses to those adjustments, but that is all theoretical. In Game 3, and the rest of the series, the Lakers need to implement those changes and go from there.\n\n\"We got to do better,\" James said. \"We know some of the things that we can do better. ... But there's only so much we can talk about. We got to go out and be about it too. So all the conversations and talk, 'OK, we got to do this, we got to do this,' but we got to go out on the floor and actually make it happen.\"", "source": {"uri": "theathletic.com", "dataType":

Game 1 was all about Jokic and how he controlled the matchup against Anthony Davis and the Lakers frontcourt. Game 2 was much more of a struggle, with the Nuggets trailing for a while until Murray put together a fourth quarter outburst to carry the Nuggets across the finish line.\n\nThrough two games in the first round this year, it looks much the same.\n\nYes, the details are different. Yes, Murray's field goal percentage isn't what Nuggets fans would like. Yes, Game 2 came down to the buzzer this time around while the Nuggets ended up pulling away from the Lakers last year.\n\nBut in both years, the Nuggets were 2-0 heading to Los Angeles, and there are many more similarities than Nuggets fans might remember.\n\nFor instance, the Nuggets scored 132 points in Game 1 last year. They were unstoppable offensively with Jokic putting up some unbelievable numbers. Anthony Davis was unbelievable as a scorer, but he got cooked defensively by Jokic, leading to the famed Rui Hachimura adjustment in the fourth quarter of that game. Jokic slowed down, and the Nuggets merely scored 26 points in that fourth quarter. Lakers fans thought they had a method to slow Denver's offense. Denver ultimately won, but because Denver still gave up 126 points, the Lakers had faith that they could score with Denver. All they had to do was slow down Denver's offense.\n\nGame 2 was a 108-103 defensive affair. Everyone knows that the Nuggets ultimately won, that Jamal Murray had 23 points in the fourth quarter after having 14 points on 5-of-17 shooting heading into the period. What they might forget is that the Nuggets trailed the Lakers heading into halftime. They trailed the Lakers heading into the fourth quarter. Jokic shot just 9-of-21 from the field for the game. There was no reason why the Lakers shouldn't have won that game. But Murray happened. And Michael Porter Jr., who made two clutch threes to give Denver the separation they desperately needed.\n\nThis might feel like a bit of a deja vu moment, because to me, those sound eerily close to the games that are happening right now.\n\nIn the series last year, the Lakers should have won one of the games. Plain and simple. It was a missed opportunity for LeBron James, Anthony Davis, and co. to not have stolen at least one of the contests. In Game 1, Davis dropped FORTY points, making many of the shots he was seen making over Jokic in Games 1 and 2 of this series. In Game 2, the Lakers got great production from Austin Reaves, who dropped 22 points on 5-of-9 from three and was a +13 in a game the Lakers somehow lost by five points. That sounds pretty similar to the game they got from D'Angelo Russell, who put up 23 points and was 7-of-11 from three, somehow a +4 in a game the Lakers lost by two.\n\nThe Lakers made adjustments from Game 1 to Game 2 in both years and nearly stole a game from the Nuggets. Both times, the Nuggets survived. This time, it was a closer call because the Nuggets had higher to climb, a 20-point deficit in the early third quarter. Murray was at the center of both Game 2 comebacks, hitting a litany of clutch shots last year and perhaps the most clutch shot of his career this year to win Monday's game at the buzzer.\n\nYes, both teams have different rosters. Bruce Brown and Jeff Green are no longer on the roster, replaced in Denver's rotation by Justin Holiday and Peyton Watson respectively (interestingly enough, both of Christian Braun and Reggie Jackson played in each Game 2). For the Lakers, it's not Dennis Schroder anymore but Gabe Vincent. It's not Jarred Vanderbilt either, but rather Jaxson Hayes. Taurean Prince is now playing the role of Lonnie Walker IV in LA's rotation.\n\nBut the main cast of characters remains the same, and the way that both teams reacted to adversity and pressure is also similar. The Nuggets fought through the pain and refused to lose. The Lakers couldn't withstand the onslaught.\n\nWhy do any of these comparisons matter?\n\nWell, the Nuggets now head to Crypto.com Arena for Game 3 tonight. The Lakers are hoping to defend their homecourt, win both of Games 3 and 4, and send the series back to Denver all tied up once again. The Nuggets have other ideas, and those ideas prevailed in both Games 3 and 4 at Crypto with the Nuggets never needing to come back to Ball Arena before Game 1 of the NBA Finals.\n\nThis time around, it's the first round of the playoffs. The NBA Finals dream is far off in the distance, still over a month away. 10 more wins away. The Nuggets can't get caught looking too far ahead or thinking too much about the past. While last year's storyline ended with two wins in Los Angeles, there's no guarantee this year will go the same way. In fact, it's extremely likely the Nuggets will drop at least one of the next two. Because after all, how probable is TEN straight Nuggets wins over the Lakers? Let alone 12 if the next two matchups go Denver's way?\n\nThe Lakers will do everything they can to prevent that from happening, and they will start by trying to rein in Jamal Murray again. The Nuggets point guard is shooting 18-of-48 (37.5%) from the field in the first two matchups combined, and the longer he struggles, the more likely it is the Lakers can break through. Remembering back to Game 3 though, that involved Murray scoring a staggering 30 points in the first half and 37 points for the game. It would be great if Murray could do that again or at least something similar, but expecting that would be a fool's errand. 30 points in a half has only happened 44 total times in the playoffs since 1997. Murray's done it three times, including twice in the bubble against Donovan Mitchell and the Utah Jazz.\n\nIf the Lakers can't slow down Murray, they will try to score more on their own. Being held to 99 points by the Nuggets when Davis was scoring at will in the first half was a bad sign for them. The Lakers got to the free throw line 29 times in last year's Game 3 compared to Denver's 19. It was the three-point shooting that did in the Lakers though as they shot 31.3% from three compared to Denver's 41.5% from distance. So far in the series, the Nuggets are shooting 26.2% on wide open threes, so that would be a welcome change to keep pace with a Lakers team that will score more than 99 tonight.\n\nWhatever happens, whether the Nuggets and Lakers repeat history or not, it's simply interesting to see how both series have mirrored each other so closely to this point. Maybe this is when the paths deviate.", "source": {"uri": "milehighsports.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Mile High Sports"}, "authors": [{"uri": "ryan_blackburn@milehighsports.com", "name": "Ryan

The Nuggets, led by the formidable Nikola Jokic, have asserted their dominance over the Lakers, winning their last 10 matchups, including last year's Western Conference finals sweep and a recent Game 2 victory in the first round.\n\n\"LeBron James is getting a taste of his own medicine. All of those years he played in the Eastern Conference when he played for Cleveland and Miami we kept calling the Finals the LeBron James invitational because no one else had a shot in the conference, no one else is getting there.\"\n\n\"That is what is happening with Nikola Jokic right now.\"\n\n\"The team that is built around him and the way they function, especially as games continue, they all know what they are supposed to do at the end of games. Jamal Murray obviously knows what he is supposed to do.\"\n\n\"Nikola Jokic cleared out the rest of those players on that last shot by Jamal Murray. Jokic had a hand in that play as well. This is exactly what LeBron used to do to everyone else.\"\n\nNichols draws parallels between Jokic's current reign in the Western Conference and LeBron's past domination of the Eastern Conference while playing for the Cleveland Cavaliers and Miami Heat.\n\nShe describes the Finals during LeBron's tenure in the East as the \"LeBron James invitational,\" where no other team had a shot at reaching the championship. Now, Jokic and the Nuggets seem to be replicating that dominance in the West.\n\nJokic's exceptional performance, coupled with a well-rounded supporting cast, has propelled the Nuggets to success. Nichols highlights the cohesion and understanding among Jokic's teammates, particularly Jamal Murray, whose buzzer-beating shot in Game 2 showcased the team's collective strength and understanding of their roles.\n\nAs the Lakers prepare for Game 3, LeBron James emphasizes the importance of protecting the home court and focusing on the immediate task at hand. Despite the disappointment of Game 2's outcome, James stresses the need to move forward and analyze how to improve against the Nuggets.\n\nFor the Lakers, bouncing back in Game 3 is essential to avoid falling further behind in the series. With the Nuggets holding a 10-game winning streak against them, the Lakers must regroup and strategize to break Denver's stronghold and turn the tide in their favor.\n\nAs the series intensifies, LeBron and the Lakers face a critical juncture in their playoff journey, with Game 3 shaping up to be a pivotal moment in their quest for success.\n\nCan Lakers Beat Nuggets At Home And Make Series More Interesting?\n\nThe Los Angeles Lakers face a daunting challenge as they prepare to host the Denver Nuggets in Game 3 of their playoff series. Despite holding home-court advantage, the Lakers find themselves trailing 0-2 in the series, with the Nuggets displaying a remarkable ability to overcome deficits and emerge victorious.\n\nThe Nuggets' dominance over the Lakers has been evident throughout the series, as they have demonstrated resilience and composure even when facing significant deficits. In Game 2, despite being down by 20 points, the Nuggets remained composed, steadily chipping away at the lead until they ultimately secured a dramatic victory with Jamal Murray's game-winning shot.\n\nFor the Lakers, breaking this pattern of defeat is imperative. They must find a way to overcome the Nuggets' stronghold and instill a sense of confidence in themselves. A win in Game 3 would not only narrow the series gap but also provide the Lakers with much-needed momentum and belief in their ability to compete at the highest level.\n\nTo achieve victory, the Lakers must optimize their lineup and rely heavily on their star players, LeBron James and Anthony Davis. Shortening the rotation and ensuring that James and Davis are on the court for extended minutes could prove crucial in neutralizing the Nuggets' strengths and exploiting potential weaknesses.\n\nThe significance of Game 3 cannot be overstated for the Lakers. A loss would not only deepen their deficit in the series but also increase the likelihood of a sweep by the Nuggets. Therefore, the Lakers must approach Game 3 with a sense of urgency and determination, recognizing the pivotal opportunity it presents to shift the momentum in their favor and make the series more competitive.\n\nUltimately, the Lakers' ability to overcome the Nuggets at home will depend on their ability to execute their game plan effectively, capitalize on scoring opportunities, and demonstrate resilience in the face of adversity.\n\nAs they prepare for this crucial matchup, the Lakers must channel their collective energy and focus on delivering a performance that will reignite their championship aspirations and keep their playoff hopes alive.", "source": {"uri": "fadeawayworld.net", "dataType": "news", "title": "Fadeaway World"}, "authors": [{"uri": "vishwesha_kumar@fadeawayworld.net", "name": "Vishwesha Kumar", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nikola_Joki\u0107", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Nikola Joki\u0107"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jamal_Murray", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Jamal Murray"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Denver_Nuggets", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Denver Nuggets"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los_Angeles_Lakers", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles Lakers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LeBron_James", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "LeBron James"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eastern_Conference_(NBA)", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Eastern Conference (NBA)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_Conference_(NBA)", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Western Conference (NBA)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cleveland_Cavaliers", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Cleveland Cavaliers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Basketball_Association", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "National Basketball Association"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miami", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Miami"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Miami"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miami_Heat", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Miami Heat"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Denver", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Denver"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Denver"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anthony_Davis", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Anthony Davis"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Browser_Based", "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Browser Based", "wgt": 19}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Downloads", "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Downloads", "wgt": 18}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Arts_and_Entertainment/Gaming", "label": "dmoz/Business/Arts and Entertainment/Gaming", "wgt": 18}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Play_Groups", "label": "dmoz/Games/Play Groups", "wgt": 18}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Board_Games/Developers_and_Publishers", "label": "dmoz/Games/Board Games/Developers and Publishers", "wgt": 18}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 87}], "image": "https://fadeawayworld.net/.image/ar_1.91%2Cc_fill%2Ccs_srgb%2Cfl_progressive%2Cg_faces:center%2Cq_auto:good%2Cw_1200/MjA1OTg5ODMyNjA4OTgyNjM0/435226448_456959773510043_8245488101629542548_n.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9512740", "eventUri": "eng-9512740", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.01960784313725494, "wgt": 198, "relevance": 1}

Los Angeles led by as many as 19 in the third quarter before ultimately falling by a bucket (101-99).\n\nNow the Lakers have to regroup as they head back home to Los Angeles for Game 3 on Thursday night at 7:10 pm PT/10:10 pm ET at crypto.com Arena. Despite losing ten straight to the Nuggets head-to-head, the Lakers are listed as one-point favorites to win Game 3.\n\nOn the moneyline, the Lakers are slight -115 favorites while the Nuggets are -105 to take a 3-0 lead in the best-of-seven series. The game total is sitting at just 216.5. The total for Game 1 was 226, which dropped to 223.5 for Game 2, and is now nearly ten points lower as Game 3 gets set to tip-off.\n\nThe first two games of the series averaged just 208.5 points per game (217 in Game 1 and 200 in Game 2).\n\nOdds as of April 25 at DraftKings. See the full list of DraftKings legal states.\n\nThe Nuggets, who opened as -310 favorites to advance in the NBA playoff bracket, are now prohibitively short -1100 chalk to eliminate the Lakers for the second straight season. LA's odds have faded from +250 to +700. The winner of the Lakers/Nuggets series will face the winner of the Suns vs Timberwolves series, which Minnesota currently leads 2-0 as it shifts back to Phoenix for Game 3 tomorrow.\n\nTrailing 74-55 with 7:15 remaining in the third quarter on Monday, the Nuggets came all the way back to earn a hard-fought 101-99 victory, taking a 2-0 series lead in the process. Presumptive NBA MVP Nikola Jokic led the way with a monster triple-double (27 points, 20 rebounds, 10 assists) while Jamal Murray added 20 points including the game winner, which went through with just 0.1 seconds on the clock.\n\nBoth Anthony Davis (32 points on 14-of-19 shooting, 11 rebounds, two assists, one steal, one block) and LeBron James (26 points of 9-of-19 shooting, 12 assists, eight rebounds) were great for Los Angeles in Game 2, and D'Angelo Russell (23 points, six assists) chipped in valuable secondary scoring, but the Lakers still lost the turnover battle (14 to 9) and were out-rebounded (45-38) for the second straight game.\n\nNBA player prop odds as of Apr. 25 at DraftKings Sportsbook.\n\nJokic once again has the highest point total of the night but at 27.5, is a point lower than he was in Game 2. Both Davis and James have point totals of 25.5 to lead the Lakers. On the rebounding front, both Davis and Jokic have totals of 13.5 and are the only players listed in double-figures.\n\nAs good as they've been at home this season, it's extremely hard to back the Lakers during a ten-game head-to-head losing streak against Jokic and the Nuggets. That said, Los Angeles have held the lead at halftime in both games so far, and teams coming back home down 2-0 have a long history of strong starts.

With a 20-point third-quarter lead, it looked like they were heading for their first win over the Nuggets in 10 tries, and if they'd done so, they would have stolen home-court advantage in a suddenly competitive first-round series.\n\nInstead, the Nuggets adjusted. Michael Malone tweaked his defense to allow Aaron Gordon to guard Anthony Davis, disarming the Davis-LeBron James pick-and-roll and leaving the Lakers completely disoriented on offense for a significant stretch of the late-third and early-fourth quarter. Their defense collapsed in the cyclone that is the Nikola Jokic-Jamal Murray pick-and-roll, with Ham's decision to open late possessions with James guarding Murray leading to the Nuggets scoring on three consecutive possessions to win the game.\n\nIt was as frustrating a loss as the Lakers have suffered all season, and Davis himself voiced a frustration that extended well beyond a single game. \"We have stretches where we don't know what we're doing on both ends of the floor,\" he said after Game 2. Though Davis did not directly take a shot at the coaching staff, it would be hard to read this quote as anything else. Ham has drawn a significant amount of criticism this season, and in January, The Athletic reported that there was a \"deepening disconnect between coach Darvin Ham and the Lakers locker room.\"\n\nHam addressed what Davis said after a film session on Wednesday and defended the Laker coaching staff. \"I mean, I just think sometimes when plays don't turn out the way you think they should, then the frustration sets in a little bit,\" Ham said. \"But I don't think it's [from] us not being organized. I think I have incredibly talented coaches all along my staff. We pride ourselves, whether it's a practice, a shootaround, a film session, a game or whatever, we pride ourselves on being highly efficient and organized. I just chalk that up to being frustrated. It's an emotional game, the way it ended and all of that. But I'll agree to disagree on that one.\"\n\nGoing home should make life a bit easier for the Lakers in the next two games. They went 28-14 in home games this season, and if the Lakers can turn things around in Thursday night's Game 3, there's still time for them to make this a competitive series.\n\nBut the Nuggets beat the Lakers twice in Los Angeles in last year's series. They've now beaten them 10 times in a row as a whole. If that streak reaches 12, it's going to be hard to defend Ham or his staff's track record against the Nuggets. If your team doesn't know what it's doing by its 10th attempt against a single opponent, your coaching staff is doing something wrong.", "source": {"uri": "cbssports.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "CBS Sports"}, "authors": [{"uri": "sam_quinn@cbssports.com", "name": "Sam Quinn", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Denver_Nuggets", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Denver Nuggets"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los_Angeles_Lakers", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles Lakers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Darvin_Ham", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Darvin Ham"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anthony_Davis", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Anthony Davis"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Malone_(basketball)", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Michael Malone (basketball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aaron_Gordon", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Aaron Gordon"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Home_advantage", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Home advantage"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Athletic", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "The Athletic"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los_Angeles", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Adventure", "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Adventure", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Board_Games/Historical", "label": "dmoz/Games/Board Games/Historical", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Word_Games", "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Word Games", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Home/Entertaining/Baby_Showers", "label": "dmoz/Home/Entertaining/Baby Showers", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 71}], "image": "https://sportshub.cbsistatic.com/i/r/2024/04/25/eed61aa3-ec59-4702-9a88-28b1c3317c14/thumbnail/1200x675/6e6ce2ec758066ed020bb029e1e98588/darvin-ham-anthony-davis-getty.png", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9512740", "eventUri": "eng-9512740", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.02745098039215688, "wgt": 194, "relevance": 1}

But the repeated theme of the Nuggets outplaying the Lakers in fourth quarters using set offensive plays that Michael Malone has implemented has shown how unprepared the Lakers have been tactically.\n\nDarvin Ham Admitted To Not Knowing What To Do With Nikola Jokic\n\nThe Los Angeles Lakers are facing an 0-2 first-round deficit with the hope they win in Game 3 at home. Before their Game 2 meltdown against the Nuggets, coach Ham said that he doesn't know what to do when it comes to stopping Nikola Jokic.\n\n\"He's become extremely efficient, like when he's manning their offense, he knows how to kill you in a variety of different ways. Just gotta put constant pressure on him and that doesn't seem to bother him either. Taller than everybody. Wingspan, skillset. It's like s**t, I don't know what to do.\"\n\nThis comment is a credit to Jokic's incredible abilities, as he's averaged 29.5 points, 16.0 rebounds, and 8.5 assists through the first two games of this series. However, an opposing head coach shouldn't openly admit that they cannot guard the other team's best players in the middle of the series, especially when you have a player like Anthony Davis on your roster.\n\nThe fourth quarter gameplan in Game 2 was shambolic, as the Lakers didn't engage Davis offensively at any point. While LeBron James was having a great quarter, it's shocking that Ham didn't run any plays for AD. This is a theme we've seen all season long. It explains why Davis has seemed frustrated with Ham's coaching this season.\n\nWith Ham's job reportedly secure for the next season, a first-round exit and pressure from players like Davis and LeBron could endanger that.", "source": {"uri": "fadeawayworld.net", "dataType": "news", "title": "Fadeaway World"}, "authors": [{"uri": "ishaan_bhattacharya@fadeawayworld.net", "name": "Ishaan Bhattacharya", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anthony_Davis", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Anthony Davis"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Darvin_Ham", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Darvin Ham"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los_Angeles_Lakers", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles Lakers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Denver_Nuggets", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Denver Nuggets"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Animosity_(band)", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Animosity (band)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_playoffs", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "NBA playoffs"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nikola_Joki\u0107", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Nikola Joki\u0107"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Malone_(basketball)", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Michael Malone (basketball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assist_(basketball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Assist (basketball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rebound_(basketball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Rebound (basketball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Head_coach", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Head coach"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LeBron_James", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "LeBron James"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Browser_Based", "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Browser Based", "wgt": 18}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Board_Games/Historical", "label": "dmoz/Games/Board Games/Historical", "wgt": 17}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Coaching", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Coaching", "wgt": 22}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Board_Games/Print_and_Play", "label": "dmoz/Games/Board Games/Print and Play", "wgt": 17}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Resources", "label": "dmoz/Games/Resources", "wgt": 17}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 99}], "image": "https://fadeawayworld.net/.image/ar_1.91%2Cc_fill%2Ccs_srgb%2Cfl_progressive%2Cg_faces:center%2Cq_auto:good%2Cw_1200/MjA1OTg2NzIwMzY4MzA1NDk4/434533985_1353008328716164_190928461400591152_n.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9512740", "eventUri": "eng-9512740", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.003921568627450966, "wgt": 191, "relevance": 1}

However, the lack of execution and cold stretches allowed the Nuggets to come back into the contest before Jamal Murray iced it with the game-winning buzzer-beater over Anthony Davis for the 101-99 win.\n\nMurray had an off night before he turned the corner in the fourth with a 14-point burst. He had 20 points in the game on 37.5% shooting. Meanwhile, Nikola Jokic continued his dominance over LA with a 27-point triple-double with 20 rebounds and 10 assists.\n\nThe Lakers got 32 points and 11 rebounds out of Anthony Davis, while LeBron James finished with 26 points, eight boards and 12 assists. D'Angelo Russell finally broke his Nuggets jinx with a 23-point night, shooting 7 of 11 3s.\n\nVlatko Cancar is the only player on the Nuggets' injury report.\n\nLA Lakers injury report\n\nThe Lakers have listed LeBron James and Anthony Davis as probable, while Cam Reddish, Jarred Vanderbilt, Christian Wood and Jalen Hood-Schifino are ruled out.\n\nDenver Nuggets vs. LA Lakers Starting Lineups and Depth Charts\n\nDenver Nuggets starting lineup and depth chart\n\nJamal Murray and Kentavious Caldwell-Pope will start for the Nuggets in the backcourt, while Michael Porter Jr., Aaron Gordon and Nikola Jokic will man the front line. Reggie Jackson, Peyton Watson and Christian Braun will play the most minutes off the bench.\n\nLA Lakers starting lineup and depth chart\n\nThe Lakers' starting lineup will include D'Angelo Russell and Austin Reaves in the backcourt, LeBron James and Rui Hachimura as the forwards and Anthony Davis as the center.\n\nTaurean Prince, Gabe Vincent, Spencer Dinwiddie and Jaxson Hayes could play the most minutes off the bench.\n\nDenver Nuggets vs. LA Lakers key matchups\n\nAustin Reaves vs. Jamal Murray remains one of the key matchups. Reaves has done a solid job defensively in shutting down Murray in the first half of both games, and that must continue for 48 minutes as that proved critical for the Lakers.\n\nAnthony Davis vs. Nikola Jokic is the most pivotal player duel since last year's playoffs, and nothing has changed in that regard. Davis and Jokic both gave each other tremendous headaches offensively, but the two must step up defensively to limit each other's impact. The one that does that will give their team a significant boost.", "source": {"uri": "sportskeeda.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Sportskeeda"}, "authors": [{"uri": "arhaan_raje@sportskeeda.com", "name": "Arhaan Raje", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_playoffs", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "NBA playoffs"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Denver_Nuggets", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Denver Nuggets"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los_Angeles_Lakers", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles Lakers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anthony_Davis", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Anthony Davis"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los_Angeles", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crypto.com_Arena", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Crypto.com Arena"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jamal_Murray", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Jamal Murray"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assist_(basketball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Assist (basketball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rebound_(basketball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Rebound (basketball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LeBron_James", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "LeBron James"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Double-double", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Double-double"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cam_Reddish", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Cam Reddish"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christian_Wood", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Christian Wood"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nikola_Joki\u0107", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Nikola Joki\u0107"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/D'Angelo_Russell", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "D'Angelo Russell"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buzzer_beater", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Buzzer beater"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jarred_Vanderbilt", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Jarred Vanderbilt"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peyton_Watson", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Peyton Watson"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Austin_Reaves", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Austin Reaves"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gabe_Vincent", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Gabe Vincent"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jaxson_Hayes", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Jaxson Hayes"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reggie_Jackson_(basketball,_born_1990)", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Reggie Jackson (basketball\\, born 1990)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rui_Hachimura", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Rui Hachimura"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spencer_Dinwiddie", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Spencer Dinwiddie"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kentavious_Caldwell-Pope", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Kentavious Caldwell-Pope"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aaron_Gordon", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Aaron Gordon"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taurean_Prince", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Taurean Prince"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Porter_Jr.", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Michael Porter Jr."}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Browser_Based", "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Browser Based", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Board_Games/Historical", "label": "dmoz/Games/Board Games/Historical", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Play_Groups", "label": "dmoz/Games/Play Groups", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Board_Games/Murder-Mystery_and_Deduction", "label": "dmoz/Games/Board Games/Murder-Mystery and Deduction", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Board_Games/Developers_and_Publishers", "label": "dmoz/Games/Board Games/Developers and Publishers", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 95}], "image": "https://staticg.sportskeeda.com/editor/2024/04/23091908-1714064167.jpeg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9512740", "eventUri": "eng-9512740", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1372549019607843, "wgt": 191, "relevance": 1}

You build a lead, you can't go to playing slow and try to play the clock game. Just have to stay aggressive, stay organized, understand where you're trying to go with the ball, be aggressive to the paint, things we've been preaching all year. But to slow down and they're gaining the momentum now just because you're slow, we're out of rhythm. So we just got to figure out a way to maintain pace.\"\n\nHam added that Los Angeles needs to be better about adjusting to Denver's adjustments and convert on the open looks they get.\n\n\"I think it's a little bit of both,\" he said. \"To the first part of your question, again we talk about maintaining our pace. That's the thing, it's not just running up and down fast and throwing up a quick shot. It's just doing things with a sense of urgency, whether it's in the full court and being disciplined with our running habits and then in the halfcourt, creating an advantage through our separation, running pick-and-roll situations, actually getting a hit and whoever is handling the ball, really getting pressure on the paint to score or to make the pass.\n\n\"The second part, it's just like you have to be careful. You have to understand why you failed at something. It's not just like OK, you failed, let's scratch that whole plan and go this way. No. You have to understand everything at length, that's the great thing about film. It reveals once you settle down and get the emotions out, it's a game of emotions and then you go back and watch the film and you're able to make an intelligent decision on whether to stay the course or change things completely. I think it's never totally one or the other, it's a little bit of both.\"\n\nWhile Anthony Davis believes the Lakers go stretches where they don't know what they're doing, Ham disagreed and said that he thinks the coaching staff has kept them organized. Regardless, Ham, Davis and the rest of the roster need to figure out a way to get on the same page if they hope to end their losing streak against the Nuggets.\n\nMagic Johnson normally tweets his reaction to Lakers games, but he admitted that he was too devastated to after the Game 2 loss.", "source": {"uri": "s22928.pcdn.co", "dataType": "news", "title": "Lakers Nation"}, "authors": [{"uri": "matt_peralta@s22928.pcdn.co", "name": "Matt Peralta", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Darvin_Ham", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Darvin Ham"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los_Angeles_Lakers", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles Lakers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Denver_Nuggets", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Denver Nuggets"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Denver", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Denver"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Denver"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los_Angeles", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anthony_Davis", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Anthony Davis"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jamal_Murray", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Jamal Murray"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magic_Johnson", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Magic Johnson"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Adventure", "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Adventure", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Interactive", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Interactive", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Relationships/Kissing", "label": "dmoz/Society/Relationships/Kissing", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Home/Entertaining/Baby_Showers", "label": "dmoz/Home/Entertaining/Baby Showers", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://s22928.pcdn.co/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Darvin-Ham-5.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9512740", "eventUri": "eng-9512740", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1294117647058823, "wgt": 187, "relevance": 1}

After two hard-fought battles in Denver, the Nuggets hold a 2-0 series lead despite the Lakers having big leads in both games. As has been the case with the Nuggets, L.A. has been unable to hold on in crunch time while Denver's stars in Michael Porter Jr., Nikola Jokic and Jamal Murray continue to show up.\n\nPart of the reason the Nuggets have not slipped up in their last 10 outings against the Lakers is because they do not undermine them as an opponent. Oftentimes, when two teams that have a lopsided history or are on opposite ends of the bracket play one another, the better team can let games slip due to complacency. But Denver has always shown the utmost respect for the Lakers.\n\nAnd Porter continued this trend at a Nuggets practice in L.A. prior to Thursday's Game 3. He spoke about what the Lakers were able to accomplish in the first two games of the series despite not having a win to show for it, via DNVR Nuggets:\n\n\"They're gonna show up really aggressive. They've shown that they can play with us on our home floor. They've been up big in both games. If I was on their team, I'm sure they have a lot of confidence just knowing that they were in the games both games, had big leads. So going back home, I'm sure they feel confident so we know we got go in there and be all business.\"\n\nThe Lakers have absolutely hung tough with the Nuggets over the last 10 games, even though they are 0-10 in that span. And if Jokic, Porter, Murray and company weren't careful, L.A. would certainly be capable of stealing a game or two. And that's what they hope to do on Thursday in Game 3.\n\nPorter and the Nuggets, meanwhile, look to avoid that complacency to win their 11th straight.\n\nLos Angeles suffered perhaps one of their worst losses in recent memory as they allowed Denver to come back from 20 points down and steal Game 2 on their home floor. It was a gut punch for the Lakers, who have now lost 10 consecutive games to the Nuggets and don't seem any closer to getting over that hump.\n\nLeBron James was visibly gassed in the second half after playing hard on both ends of the floor. James subbed himself out on a couple of times though he did empty out the tank in the fourth with some clutch shotmaking.\n\nJames himself admitted that he and the team need to be better about executing for all 48 minutes.", "source": {"uri": "s22928.pcdn.co", "dataType": "news", "title": "Lakers Nation"}, "authors": [{"uri": "ron_gutterman@s22928.pcdn.co", "name": "Ron Gutterman", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Denver_Nuggets", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Denver Nuggets"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los_Angeles_Lakers", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles Lakers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Denver", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Denver"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Denver"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crypto.com_Arena", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Crypto.com Arena"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_playoffs", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "NBA playoffs"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nikola_Joki\u0107", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Nikola Joki\u0107"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jamal_Murray", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Jamal Murray"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Porter_Jr.", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Michael Porter Jr."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LeBron_James", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "LeBron James"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Games", "label": "dmoz/Games", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Party_Games", "label": "dmoz/Games/Party Games", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Board_Games/Historical", "label": "dmoz/Games/Board Games/Historical", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Addictions/Games", "label": "dmoz/Health/Addictions/Games", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 55}], "image": "https://s22928.pcdn.co/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/Michael-Porter-Jr-Anthony-Davis.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9512740", "eventUri": "eng-9512740", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1843137254901961, "wgt": 185, "relevance": 1}

It was as heartbreaking and devastating a loss as they have ever had in their franchise history, and now they will have to regain some poise and confidence as the series moves to Crypto.com Arena.\n\nD'Angelo Russell and, in particular, Anthony Davis played extremely well in Game 2, but as the contest progressed, L.A. gradually went away from them offensively. It was a shiny, expensive gift to the Nuggets, who have now defeated L.A. in 10 consecutive games.\n\nA win in Game 3 on Thursday may give this series at least a faint semblance of a competitive one.

Latest on Lakers star's status for Game 3 (April 25)", "body": "LeBron James is probable to play in Thursday's Game 3 between the Denver Nuggets and LA Lakers at Crypto.com Arena. James will likely suit up. He carried the same status for Games 1 and 2 and was available for both. He will remain a game-time decision, though.\n\nThe Lakers are down 0-2 in the series, so Game 3 is pivotal. A loss likely seals their fate as first-round exits, but a win offers them a shot at making this a close series. The Lakers have dropped 10 straight to the Nuggets, so there isn't much optimism around their chances of succeeding.\n\nNevertheless, even in year 21, LeBron James cannot be doubted to flip the script, especially after solid outings in the previous two games.\n\nWhat happened to LeBron James?\n\nJames is on the Lakers' injury report, citing left ankle peroneal tendinopathy. The four-time MVP has dealt with the ailment since Jan. 4, missing eight of his 11 games this season because of that injury. However, James has managed that issue since the All-Star break, allowing him to be in a favorable condition physically for the 2024 NBA Playoffs.\n\nLeBron James Stats vs. Denver Nuggets in 2024 NBA Playoffs\n\nLeBron James has been among the top three players in the 2024 NBA Playoffs first-round series between the Denver Nuggets and LA Lakers. In two games, he has averaged 26.5 points, 7.0 rebounds and 10.0 assists, shooting on 54/55/75 splits. James has a box +/- of -3.5.\n\nHe has been the driving force for LA on offense. The Lakers have looked clueless without him taking over, which has hindered the team's play in his off minutes. James has struggled in the clutch as he is fatigued with the responsibility he has to shoulder early in the game.\n\nD'Angelo Russell and Austin Reaves must initiate the offense efficiently. It will be critical in keeping James fresh down the stretch.\n\nLeBron James is favored to score over 25.5 points, grab over 7.5 rebounds and dish under 9.5 assists.\n\nWhere to watch Denver Nuggets vs. LA Lakers Game 3?\n\nTNT and TruTV have the broadcast rights to Thursday's Game 3 between the Denver Nuggets and LA Lakers.

The fallout from going down 2-0 to the Denver Nuggets in the NBA Playoffs has seen LeBron James fed up with Anthony Davis and Davis throw Lakers coach Darvin Ham under the bus. As Game 3 approached, Ham made it clear that he does not co-sign Davis' excuses.\n\nHam has come under fire for his coaching methods all season, from everyone including James, Davis, fans and media.\n\nWhen the Lakers need a scapegoat, the 50-year-old coach often becomes the man in the crosshairs. That was the case in Game 2, when Los Angeles was playing well enough to steal a game in Denver and even the series 1-1, but threw away a 20-point lead in the second half as Jamal Murray crushed their hearts at the buzzer.\n\nDuring the game, James appeared visibly frustrated with Davis' lack of effort. In the aftermath, AD again shifted the blame to the coaching staff, stating that the Lakers \"have stretches when we don't know what we're doing.\"\n\nHam directly responded to that jab, saying that his coaches \"pride themselves\" on being organized.

Denver has won 10 consecutive meetings.\n\nWe're about to see how resilient the Lakers are, because it's realistically curtains if they come up short again in Game 3 (10 p.m. ET, TNT). That informs our breakdown of Nuggets vs. Lakers odds and props.\n\nDenver shot 8-for-34 from 3-point range in Game 2, and that's with Michael Porter Jr. finishing 6-for-10. Starting guards Murray and Kentavious Caldwell-Pope finished 0-for-9 from beyond the arc. Had James made his last 3-ball that rimmed out, or if Murray had misfired, we'd be talking about how the defending champs looked vulnerable in fumbling away homecourt advantage. The Nuggets have trailed for most of the series despite Jokic averaging 29.5 points, 16 rebounds and 8.5 assists.\n\nDenver put together the NBA's second-best home record (33-8), but went just 24-17 on the road, going 2-2 at Crypto.com Arena with a pair of wins over the Lakers and two losses to the Clippers. The Nuggets were just 6-4 over their last 10 regular-season games, which included a 2-2 road record behind wins over depleted Utah and Memphis. The Nuggets lost the likes of Bruce Brown and Jeff Green this past offseason, and their reserves have shot a combined 12-for-36 in this series, including 3-for-19 on 3-pointers.\n\nRelated: Best NBA betting sites | Latest sportsbook promos and bonuses\n\nAlthough they got just six bench points, it's hard to see LA playing much better than it did at Ball Arena since Davis, James and D'Angelo Russell combined for 81 points on 31-for-54 shooting (57 percent). Being at home will help the likes of Rui Hachimura and Austin Reaves elevate their games, but it's clear there's a mental hurdle that must be overcome in addition to just outplaying the defending champs.\n\nDavis must continue to play Jokic to at least a stalemate. He was inconsistent in last season's series, but is 26-for-42 from the field, averaging 32 points, 12.5 rebounds and 2.5 blocks. With James excelling in averaging 26.5 points and 10 assists, the backcourt of Russell and Reaves will be the x-factors. Russell shot 6-for-20 in the series opener, missing eight of nine from 3-point range. He was 7-for-11 from beyond the arc in Game 2.\n\nRussell has been a much more accurate shooter in L.A. than on the road, shooting 44.7 percent from 3-point range as opposed to 38 percent in away games. Reaves went 3-for-11 on 3-pointers in Denver and is similarly better at home. Getting anything out of Spencer Dinwiddie and Gabe Vincent would be helpful. The duo went scoreless through 46 combined minutes in Denver.\n\nMore: 2024 NBA Championship odds | NBA prop betting\n\nJames should rack up a second straight game with double-digit assists, topping 8.5. Look for Caldwell-Pope (9.5) and Reaves (13.5) to surpass their point prop figures since we'll see them encouraged to take their open looks to take advantage of Davis and Jokic being double-teamed.\n\nLA is better equipped to win than it was last season and will pour everything into clawing back in the series. Falling behind 3-0 would be devastating, and considering how well Davis and James are playing and how much better Russell and Reaves are at home, this should be a game they win outright if they get a favorable whistle.", "source": {"uri": "sportingnews.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Sporting News"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Denver_Nuggets", "type":

It was a gut punch for the Lakers, who have now lost 10 consecutive games to the Nuggets and don't seem any closer to getting over that hump.\n\nLeBron James was visibly gassed in the second half after playing hard on both ends of the floor. James subbed himself out on a couple of times though he did empty out the tank in the fourth with some clutch shotmaking.\n\nJames himself admitted that he and the team need to be better about executing for all 48 minutes.\n\n\"It's all about sustainability,\" James said after practice on Wednesday. \"It doesn't matter what you can do throughout the first 47 and a half minutes. You got to finish the game, which we didn't do. We got to do a better job of that. Some of the things we've done over the first couple games, we're very happy and excited about. But we got to do a better job of closing.\"\n\nAs far as adjustments go, James said the team has a good understanding of what they need to do but now it's time for them to actually go out and do it.\n\n\"Yeah, we got to be be better. We know some of the things that we can do, we watched film today a lot. We know some of the things we can do better, but there's only so much we can talk about, it's about doing it. We can talk and say do this, do that, but you got to go out and make it happen.\"\n\nIt's demoralizing to come back home after letting a golden opportunity to win a playoff game on the road, but James isn't letting it get to him and is instead focusing on protecting home court. Being back in Los Angeles should give the Lakers a boost, but they'll need to play near-perfect basketball to beat the Denver.\n\nD'Angelo Russell had a bounce back game in Game 2, catching fire from deep and giving Los Angeles a legitimate shot to tie up the series.

NBA insider Dave McMenamin reported during Monday's Game 2 that the defensive stalwart was eyeing a Game 3 return. Vanderbilt has been out since Feb. 2 with a foot injury.\n\nHe's critical to the Lakers, especially defensively, and LA could use him against the Nuggets after going down 0-2, primarily because of its defensive struggles in crunch situations. The veteran forward was the ideal solution to limit Jamal Murray's juggernaut in the clutch, so it isn't surprising to see the Lakers struggle in Vanderbilt's absence.\n\nJarred Vanderbilt injury update: Will Lakers forward return vs Denver for Game 3? (Apr. 25)\n\nVanderbilt won't play against the Nuggets in Game 3. He's officially ruled out per the Lakers' injury report despite reports suggesting he could return for the all-important clash. Vanderbilt will extend his time on the sidelines because of a midfoot injury he sustained against the Boston Celtics on Feb. 1.\n\nHe has been out since then. Vanderbilt has dealt with multiple injuries this season, limiting him to 29 appearances. He averaged 5.2 points, 4.8 rebounds and 1.2 steals, shooting 51.8%.\n\nWhat happened to Jarred Vanderbilt?\n\nJarred Vanderbilt suffered a right mid-foot sprain amid one of his best showings this season when the LeBron James and Anthony Davis-less LA Lakers beat the Boston Celtics 114-105 at TD Garden on Feb. 1. Vanderbilt exited the game at halftime. He had 10 points and seven rebounds in only 16 minutes.\n\nVanderbilt put up an excellent shift defensively in limiting Jayson Tatum. The Lakers benefitted significantly, taking a 60-46 halftime lead. Vanderbilt didn't play the second half, but Austin Reaves' hot shooting night and the defensive activity from everyone helped the Lakers secure the win.\n\nHow to watch Denver Nuggets vs. LA Lakers Game 3?\n\nTNT and TruTV will broadcast the Denver Nuggets vs. LA Lakers Game 3 nationally, while Altitude and Spectrum SportsNet will provide local coverage. Fans outside the US can watch the contest online via NBA League Pass. Tipoff is at 10:00 p.m. ET at Crypto.com Arena, the Lakers' homecourt.\n\nThe Lakers aren't the underdogs, but they aren't the favorites, either. Both teams have a -110 money line, but the Nuggets spread is -1, suggesting that they have a slight edge to win Thursday's contest and take a 3-0 lead.\n\nA loss practically ends the Lakers' hopes of coming back in this series.", "source": {"uri": "sportskeeda.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Sportskeeda"}, "authors": [{"uri": "arhaan_raje@sportskeeda.com", "name": "Arhaan Raje", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vanderbilt_Commodores_men's_basketball", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Vanderbilt Commodores men's basketball"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Denver_Nuggets", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Denver Nuggets"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los_Angeles_Lakers", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles Lakers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jarred_Vanderbilt", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Jarred Vanderbilt"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boston_Celtics", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Boston Celtics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Basketball_Association", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "National Basketball Association"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los_Angeles", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steal_(basketball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Steal (basketball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rebound_(basketball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Rebound (basketball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Denver", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Denver"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Denver"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crypto.com_Arena", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Crypto.com Arena"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TNT_(American_TV_network)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "TNT (American TV network)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jayson_Tatum", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Jayson Tatum"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Altitude_Sports_and_Entertainment", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Altitude Sports and Entertainment"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spectrum_(arena)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Spectrum (arena)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TD_Garden", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "TD Garden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TruTV", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "TruTV"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LeBron_James", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "LeBron James"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Austin,_Texas", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Austin, Texas"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Austin, Texas"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Browser_Based", "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Browser Based", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Board_Games/Historical", "label": "dmoz/Games/Board Games/Historical", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Play_Groups", "label": "dmoz/Games/Play Groups", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Board_Games/Murder-Mystery_and_Deduction", "label": "dmoz/Games/Board Games/Murder-Mystery and Deduction", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Board_Games/Developers_and_Publishers", "label": "dmoz/Games/Board Games/Developers and Publishers", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 96}], "image": "https://staticg.sportskeeda.com/editor/2024/04/22424041-1714054100.jpeg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9512740", "eventUri": "eng-9512740", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "date": "-02-02", "textStart": 273, "textEnd": 279}, {"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-04-25", "textStart": 736, "textEnd": 743}, {"amb": false, "date": "-02-01", "textStart": 1047, "textEnd": 1053, "freq": 2}], "sentiment": -0.2235294117647059, "wgt": 161, "relevance": 1}

Soon-to-be three-time MVP Nikola Jokic and the reigning champs have now beat Los Angeles 10 straight times, and Denver appears on the verge of mounting a sweep over the Lakers for the second-straight postseason.\n\nMORE: Lakers' best option to slow down Jokic\n\nWhat version of King James will we see in Game 3? Last year down 2-0, he scored 23 points on 19 shots to go along with 12 dimes. In Game 4 of that series, he took on a heavier scoring load, finishing with 40 points on 25 shots in a close loss.\n\nLet's roll out our top LeBron James BetMGM player props for Game 3 of Lakers vs. Nuggets in the first round of the 2024 NBA Playoff, ranked in order of betting value and win probability.\n\nLeBron has always been incredible when facing elimination -- and let's face it, this Game 3 might as well be an elimination game. Teams that have fallen behind 3-0 in playoff series have gone 0-151 in their best-of-seven series. You simply cannot come back from an 0-3 deficit.\n\nKing James' average in elimination games over his illustrious career: 33.7 points per game. His shooting splits: 49.2/36.3/72.3. His average shots taken in elimination games: 24.3. These are all great signs for OVER bettors.\n\nIn the 23 games in which LeBron took 20-plus shots this season, he averaged 30.6 points per game. We think he takes at least 20 shots, scores at least 30, and blows the over/under right out of the proverbial water.\n\nMORE: LeBron's right -- the refs have been bad in the playoffs\n\nYou can't go wrong with this prop, as James remains one of the best passers in the NBA, and we already project him to score around 30 points so he will only need a handful of assists to hit this OVER.\n\nBron has 65 total assists over the Lakers' past six games (10.8 APG), so something tells us he will easily notch the OVER on this stat-combo prop. He has 29 combined dimes (rhymes!) across L.A.'s past three meetings with Denver.\n\nMORE: LeBron among Steph Noh's All-NBA picks\n\nThis is easy-peasy, lemon-squeezy. LeBron has double-doubles in two of L.A.'s past three games and four of the past six, and this is the Lakers' biggest game of the entire 2023-24 campaign.\n\nJames always racks up more dimes at home (8.8 APG), and he has averaged 10.7 rebounds per game when facing elimination. He'll hit this one way or another.\n\nWe're a little more ambivalent about betting this prop, but it's also hard to resist putting a little lotto-ticket wager since the odds offer up such a juicy payout. A winning $18 ticket here nets us over $103 profit, and it would make for a heck of a fun rooting interest throughout the night without setting us back too much financially if we come up short.\n\nJames last put up a triple-double against the Pelicans in the Play-In Tournament just last week, putting up 28 points, a whopping 17 assists, and 11 rebounds. With the Lakers' backs against the wall, we're jumping headfirst into this somewhat-volatile prop and hoping we come out the other side with a sweet cash windfall.\n\nMORE: Playoff power rankings based on odds\n\nPlus odds on a Bron playoff prop at home with the Lakers down 2-0!? Yeah, sign us up. King James has put together some of his biggest highlight-reel rejections in the postseason, and he appears to have more energy during this playoff run than when the Lakers got swept by the Nuggets in the Western Conference Finals last year. One chase-down block and we've doubled our money -- let's go!\n\nWe expect LeBron to go over this mark win or lose, as he has such a high usage rate, creates for others so often, and takes matters into his own hands in the clutch of close and/or must-win games. He has 21 turnovers over his past four games, so four seems like a fairly easy mark to hit.\n\nWe took to the alternate three-pointer prop board to find this juicy plus-odds bet. LeBron has drilled three three-pointers in two straight games and three of the Lakers' past four, and we already told you he's going to be kicking things into high gear on Thursday evening.\n\nThis isn't a slam dunk by any means, but the +155 odds make us feel pretty good about a modest wager in a game we're already projecting him to score 30-plus points.

Los Angeles opened as a short home pup but is now a small favorite with desperation fueling that market move.\n\nBelow, I give my best Nuggets vs. Lakers predictions for Thursday, April 25.\n\nThe Los Angeles Lakers desperately need their role players to show up in Game 3.\n\nGuys like Rui Hachimura, D'Angelo Russell, and Austin Reaves were MIA at times in the opening two games -- the latter of whom finished with only nine points in the Game 2 catastrophe.\n\nReaves finished Monday's game going 4-for-11 from the field -- including 1-for5 from 3-point range -- and failed to get to the foul line. That stumble comes on the heels of a 13-point showing in Game 1, in which the spunky shooting guard shot 5-for-9 (2-for-6 on 3-pointers) in 37 minutes.\n\nHe averaged almost 16 points in the regular season and enjoys playing at home, where his shooting percentage spiked to 49.2% from the floor and 39.1% from distance, compared to just a 34.5% 3-point clip away from L.A.\n\nHis player projections for Game 3 vary depending on the models, but all come in north of 13 points, and the majority call for 15+ with a ceiling of 17.1. My number is a bit more conservative, bubbling out to 15.2 tonight.\n\nThe NBA player props odds have his Over/Under pegged at 13.5 points, the lowest scoring total Reaves has faced in a long time. Looking at his last 10 outings, his points prop has bounced between 14.5 and 16.5 O/U.\n\nSome sharper books are dealing the Over 13.5 as pricey as -134. However, you can find a more affordable ask -- as low as -120 -- on the same total if you shop around.\n\nReaves will look to attack on offense and a few of his scoring forecasts call for outputs in the 16-17 range.\n\nHachimura's offensive struggles find him contributing in other ways. He was big on the boards for L.A. down the stretch and I call for five-plus rebounds tonight.\n\nLeBron James may have to take over if the rest of the Lakers don't show up. James has made three triples in each of the first two games, shooting a collective 6-for-11 from downtown.\n\nLearn how to bet a same-game parlay with these helpful tips and strategies.\n\nThe Lakers fall into the famed first-half \"0-2 trend\" as a home team down 0-2 on their own court in Game 3. This used to be a very profitable system, hitting higher than 60% from 2007 to 2017, but books have gotten smart to it and pad the 1H lines.\n\nSince 2018, home teams down 0-2 in the series are just 18-18-2 versus the 1H spread.

It's been a problem for this team, despite strong starts. Even in game two, when the Lakers held over a 20-point lead in the second half, they still found a way to lose the game.\n\nWhile nobody is to blame but themselves for their performance, their lack of production from the bench is dooming them. The only bench player to score for the Lakers through the first two games has been forward Taurean Prince and that won't get the job done.\n\nThe team's star players have carried them in the games but need just a little help to get over the hump. Guys like point guard Gabe Vincent, point guard Spencer Dinwiddie and center Jaxson Hayes have all failed to contribute anything other than running around the court so far.\n\nVincent may still be working back from his long absence but they still need more from their big free agent signee Dinwiddie was the lone roster move for this team during the season and his lack of contributions has been appalling. Hayes has rarely seen the floor, something that may need to change moving forward.\n\nWhatever the case is, the Lakers need their depth to help the stars out. Both LeBron James and Anthony Davis can't beat Denver alone so something needs to give.\n\nAs the series heads back to Los Angeles, maybe the comfort of home will bring better fortune.

Nikola Jokic, the Serbian center for the Denver Nuggets, is quickly establishing himself as the new monarch of the Western Conference, a title that LeBron James once held undisputedly during his reign in the East. The dynamics within the conference are shifting, and it's clear that the Nuggets, under Jokic's leadership, are crafting a narrative of dominance reminiscent of James' past.\n\nLeBron James and his Los Angeles Lakers are experiencing a troubling d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu as they face the Nuggets. The Lakers have succumbed to Jokic and his team in their last 10 matchups, including a disheartening sweep in last year's Western Conference finals and a recent nail-biting loss in Game 2 of the first round. Rachel Nichols, a seasoned NBA analyst from FOX Sports, didn't mince words on \"Undisputed\" about the situation. She highlighted the parallel universe where Jokic, much like LeBron once did, seems invincible in his conference. \"LeBron James is getting a taste of his own medicine,\" Nichols remarked, underlining the shift in power dynamics.\n\nIt's not just Jokic's individual brilliance that's troubling for the Lakers but the cohesive unit he's part of. Denver has crafted a team that not only revolves around Jokic but also supports him in ways that LeBron's earlier teams perhaps didn't. Jokic, often described as 'the straw that stirs the drink,' finds perfect harmony with teammates like Jamal Murray, who have grown accustomed to shining at crucial moments.\n\nNichols pointed out during her commentary, \"Jamal Murray obviously knows what he is supposed to do. Nikola Jokic cleared out the rest of those players on that last shot by Jamal Murray. Jokic had a hand in that play as well. This is exactly what LeBron used to do to everyone else.\"\n\nDespite the setbacks, LeBron James remains a formidable force with a mindset focused on redemption. The Lakers, stinging from their recent losses, are gearing up for Game 3 with a clear mission. James, reflecting on their situation, emphasized the importance of protecting home court. \"Protect home. That's where my mindset goes,\" he stated, underscoring the critical nature of the upcoming game. The Lakers are determined to put an end to Denver's winning streak and reclaim their standing.\n\nAs the Lakers prepare to host the Nuggets at 10 pm ET on Thursday, April 24, all eyes will be on how they adjust their strategy against Denver's relentless assault. The game promises high stakes and higher tensions, with fans and players alike bracing for what could be a defining moment in this playoff series.\n\nIn this clash of titans, the narrative is not just about Jokic's rise or LeBron's challenge but also about the evolution of team dynamics and leadership in the pressure cooker of the NBA playoffs. As this drama unfolds, the Lakers' quest to regain supremacy in the West continues, while Jokic's Nuggets aim to cement their status as the new kings of the conference.", "source": {"uri": "sportsencounter.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Sports Encounter"}, "authors": [{"uri": "akash_vedi@sportsencounter.com", "name": "Akash Vedi", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nikola_Joki\u0107", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Nikola Joki\u0107"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Denver_Nuggets", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Denver Nuggets"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los_Angeles_Lakers", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles Lakers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LeBron_James", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "LeBron James"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rachel_Nichols_(journalist)", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Rachel Nichols (journalist)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_Conference_(NBA)", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Western Conference (NBA)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_playoffs", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "NBA playoffs"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jamal_Murray", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Jamal Murray"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basketball", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Basketball"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serbia", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Serbia"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Serbia"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fox_Sports", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Fox Sports"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Basketball_Association", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "National Basketball Association"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Denver", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Denver"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Denver"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Professional", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Professional", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Fan_Pages", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Fan Pages", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Show_Basketball", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Show Basketball", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/History", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/History", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 86}], "image": "https://www.sportsencounter.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/Jokics-Ascendancy-Stirs-the-NBA-Lakers-Grapple-with-the-New-Western-Conference-Powerhouse.webp", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9512740", "eventUri": "eng-9512740", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-04-24", "textStart": 2447, "textEnd": 2455}], "sentiment": 0.1058823529411765, "wgt": 147, "relevance": 1}

Los Angeles hopes for a long playoff run, even if that may be a pipedream at this point.\n\nBut the Lakers do have a few key players that could be heading to free agency this summer, including LeBron James and D'Angelo Russell. They both have options in their contracts that they can either pick up or decline.\n\nOthers include Christian Wood, Jaxson Hayes and Cam Reddish. The Lakers roster may look a little different come next season but it also depends on who the head coach is. While Darvin Ham is likely to return, a new coach may see things differently in terms of player production.\n\nAssuming Ham does return, here are predictions on what each player will do this summer:\n\nLeBron James ($51,415,938): Decline\n\nJames will decline his option, making him a free agent. However, this doesn't mean he will leave the Lakers. There have been reports about James wanting to stay with Los Angeles past this year but on a new deal.\n\nHe wants to get a larger contract for his final few seasons and the Lakers will rightfully oblige. James is the heart of this team and should be back next year.\n\nD'Angelo Russell ($18,692,307): Decline\n\nRussell will likely decline his deal, especially after his strong season. However, there is no guarantee he will be back.\n\nThe Lakers likely aren't going to want to pay him a heavy contract and they may want to upgrade with a third-star player. But he has redeemed himself in the eyes of the organization and is at least a candidate to return, which wasn't the case just a few months ago.\n\nChristian Wood ($3,036,040): Decline\n\nWood didn't have a very strong first season with the Lakers and may want to look elsewhere on the market. He is only scheduled to make $3 million so that isn't likely to keep him around.\n\nWhile Hayes may be able to get a little more money somewhere else, he seems to fit well with the Lakers. He could play one more year in Los Angeles, potentially elevating his position around the league even more.\n\nThe biggest issue for him is playing time but it was the same in New Orleans as well. I believe that Hayes ends up picking up the option and the Lakers keep a decent enough backup center.\n\nCam Reddish ($2,463,946): Pick-Up\n\nReddish has been up and down all year long but I think he stays. He has found a nice home with the Lakers and has bounced around the league for most of his career.\n\nWhile it's not perfect, Reddish showed he could be a valuable member off the bench.

Appearing on 'The Big Podcast with Shaq,' he was asked if he thinks Ham will be more of a long-term fixture in LA's locker room, or if he thinks they could move on from him in the near future.\n\nAfter making it clear that he does not like speaking on coaches because he does not know for certain, Shaq stated that he does know for a fact that changes will be made if the Lakers lose and are eliminated from the playoffs.\n\nShaq: \"If the Lakers lose, changes will be made\"\n\nThe evidence Shaq gave for his statement was that he knows this is simply how the Lakers do business. \"That's just the way they operate,\" he said. \"That's a storied franchise, historical franchise, and we're used to winning. We're all about winning. Ever since that bubble championship it's been up and down, so changes will definitely be made.\"\n\nThese are big words from someone whose history is so intertwined with the history of the Lakers, and who of course still has plenty of connections within the organization. Now, Shaq did not explicitly state that the changes he is speaking of would involve LA moving on from Darvin Ham, but that is certainly what he seems to be hinting at.\n\nOne thing is for sure: Shaq's words are very blunt and he leaves no room for doubt about what direction the franchise will take if they find themselves sitting at home in a few days once again. The team that is tied for the most NBA championships in league history will not sit around comfortable with just another playoff appearance, and that should be reassuring to fans.\n\nIf the Lakers are indeed eliminated, the manner in which they bow out could play a part in what changes take place as well. Another sweep at the hands of the Nuggets would almost certainly force management's hand to make more drastic moves.", "source": {"uri": "lakeshowlife.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Lake Show Life"}, "authors": [{"uri": "will_eudy@lakeshowlife.com", "name": "Will Eudy", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_playoffs", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "NBA playoffs"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shaquille_O'Neal", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Shaquille O'Neal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los_Angeles_Lakers", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles Lakers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Darvin_Ham", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Darvin Ham"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Denver", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Denver"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Denver"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Denver_Nuggets", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Denver Nuggets"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_Finals", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "NBA Finals"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Business/Opportunities", "label": "dmoz/Business/Opportunities", "wgt": 9}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Opportunities/Franchising", "label": "dmoz/Business/Opportunities/Franchising", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Word_Games", "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Word Games", "wgt": 8}, {"uri": "dmoz/Home/Moving_and_Relocating", "label": "dmoz/Home/Moving and Relocating", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Home/Moving_and_Relocating/Moving", "label": "dmoz/Home/Moving and Relocating/Moving", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 58}], "image": "https://images2.minutemediacdn.com/image/upload/c_crop,w_5596,h_3147,x_0,y_50/c_fill,w_1440,ar_16:9,f_auto,q_auto,g_auto/images/ImagnImages/mmsport/20/01hway7h9zbts6066gb1.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9512740", "eventUri": "eng-9512740", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.08235294117647063, "wgt": 136, "relevance": 1}

Russell delivered on his end of the bargain, scoring 23 points including hitting 7-of-11 of his attempts from beyond the arc.\n\nRussell chalked up his Game 2 scoring frenzy to simply making the shots he missed in Game 1, but now Los Angeles will need him to have a repeat performance if they hope to snap their losing streak to Denver.\n\nThe guard has typically performed well in front of the Crypto.com Arena crowd and he said he believes that having them cheering on the team will help them in Game 3.\n\n\"I think that's a big advantage in the playoffs,\" Russell said. \"Every team relies on that to maybe give you some energy that you're lacking. So obviously we're gonna come out with our own energy and continue to build on it and when there's times throughout the game where they can be more vocal, loud and crazy, I think it will help us.\"\n\nRole players like Russell tend to play better at home versus the road in the playoffs, and L.A. is certainly hoping that's the case this time around. Losing Game 2 was a devastating blow to the Lakers from a mental standpoint as they played about as well as the team could've hoped for yet were still left to pick themselves up.\n\nIt's unrealistic to expect Russell to have another hot shooting night from deep, especially because Nuggets head coach Michael Malone will surely have some adjustments to prevent him from going off. It'll be up to the likes of Austin Reaves, Rui Hachimura and the bench to pull their weight and find a way to contribute on both ends.\n\nReaves has had a tough series offensively and it's likely because of all the energy he's expending guarding Jamal Murray on the other end. Without Reaves' offensive production, it places a heavier burden on LeBron James and Anthony Davis to score.\n\nLike the rest of the players, Reaves was upset about losing Game 2 but said the group needs to move on.", "source": {"uri": "s22928.pcdn.co", "dataType": "news", "title": "Lakers Nation"}, "authors": [{"uri": "matt_peralta@s22928.pcdn.co", "name": "Matt Peralta", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los_Angeles_Lakers", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles Lakers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_playoffs", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "NBA playoffs"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/D'Angelo_Russell", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "D'Angelo Russell"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Denver_Nuggets", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Denver Nuggets"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crypto.com_Arena", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Crypto.com Arena"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Denver", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Denver"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Denver"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los_Angeles", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Austin_Reaves", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Austin Reaves"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anthony_Davis", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Anthony Davis"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rui_Hachimura", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Rui Hachimura"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jamal_Murray", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Jamal Murray"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Malone_(basketball)", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Michael Malone (basketball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LeBron_James", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "LeBron James"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Games", "label": "dmoz/Games", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Party_Games", "label": "dmoz/Games/Party Games", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Board_Games/Historical", "label": "dmoz/Games/Board Games/Historical", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Online/Play-By-E-Mail", "label": "dmoz/Games/Online/Play-By-E-Mail", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 67}], "image": "https://s22928.pcdn.co/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/DAngelo-Russell-10.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9512740", "eventUri": "eng-9512740", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1137254901960785, "wgt": 134, "relevance": 1}

As we close out the 2023-24 season, it's time to see how these elite players have managed the spotlight.\n\nFrom standout performances to struggles and growth, we're breaking down their impact on the court, how their teams have fared, and their playoff prospects. We'll explore each player's contributions, team dynamics, and how they're shaping up as the postseason makes its way.\n\n1. LeBron James\n\nEven at 39, LeBron James isn't just hanging on; he's thriving. Drafted No. 1 way back in 2003, LeBron has shown no signs of slowing down. This season, he's racked up some serious stats, averaging 25.7 points, 8.3 assists, and 7.3 rebounds over 71 games. It's more than just numbers with LeBron; it's the way he shapes games, lifts his team, and terrifies opponents.\n\nHis stellar performance has kept his team, the Los Angeles Lakers, right in the thick of things. They've wrapped up the regular season with a record of 47-35, securing the seventh seed in the tough Western Conference. That record speaks volumes about how LeBron's presence continues to be a game-changer, turning what many expected to be a transition year into a solid playoff push.\n\nAs the playoffs keep going, the Lakers are set to face the Nuggets at home, which promises a high-stakes showdown. LeBron's experience and skill will be key factors if the Lakers aim to make a deep run. He's been here many times, and his ability to perform under playoff pressure will be crucial. Watching LeBron in the playoffs is always a treat, as he switches into an even higher gear, often delivering performances that remind everyone why he's still one of the best in the business.\n\n2. Anthony Edwards\n\nAnthony Edwards, the dynamic guard who was the top pick in the 2020 NBA Draft, has firmly established himself as a cornerstone for the Minnesota Timberwolves this season. With an impressive stat line of 25.9 points, 5.4 rebounds, and 5.1 assists over 79 games, Edwards has not only showcased his scoring prowess but also his ability to contribute across the board.\n\nThis season, Edwards' performance has been a key driver in propelling the Timberwolves to a solid playoff position. They finished the regular season with a commendable 56-26 record, which earned them the 3rd seed in the Western Conference. Edwards' explosive ability to score from anywhere on the court, combined with his improved playmaking and rebounding, has made him a multi-dimensional threat that opponents struggle to contain.\n\nAs the Timberwolves march through the playoffs, they're 2-0 over the Phoenix Suns in what was expected to be a gritty and intense first-round series. Edwards' role has been crucial; his energy and aggressive scoring will need to be at their peak to challenge their formidable opponents. With his rapid development and increasing consistency, Edwards has the potential to turn a playoff game on its head, making him a key figure to watch in the upcoming series.\n\nLooking forward, the Timberwolves have high hopes for their playoff journey, largely riding on Edwards' young but capable shoulders. His ability to elevate his game in high-pressure situations will be pivotal as Minnesota seeks to make a deep playoff run and solidify their status as a rising force in the NBA.\n\n3. Kyrie Irving\n\nKyrie Irving, the electric guard who took the NBA by storm after being the No. 1 pick in 2011, has continued to dazzle with his impressive handling and scoring abilities. In the 2023-24 season, he put up strong numbers for the Dallas Mavericks, averaging 25.6 points, 5.2 assists, and 5.0 rebounds over 58 games. Despite missing some games, Kyrie's impact when on the floor is undeniable, and his ability to take over games remains as potent as ever.\n\nThe Mavericks concluded their regular season with a respectable 50-32 record, securing the 5th seed in the competitive Western Conference. Kyrie's contributions were instrumental in many of Dallas's victories, particularly in tight games where his clutch shooting and playmaking turned potential losses into wins. His presence has been a critical factor in not only steadying the Mavericks' ship but also propelling it forward into postseason contention.\n\nAs the playoffs rolled around, the Mavericks found themselves matched up against the L.A. Clippers in the Western Conference First Round. The series is currently tied at 1-1, setting the stage for what promises to be a thrilling battle. Kyrie's performance in these games has been, and will continue to be, crucial for Dallas. His playoff experience and ability to perform under pressure are key assets for the Mavericks, who are looking to make a deep playoff run.\n\n4. Anthony Davis\n\nAnthony Davis, once the first overall pick in 2012, has continued to be a dominant force in the NBA, especially during the 2023-24 season. This year, he put up impressive averages of 24.7 points, 12.6 rebounds, and 3.5 assists over 76 games, affirming his status as one of the premier big men in the league. Davis's ability to impact both ends of the floor has been crucial for the Los Angeles Lakers as they navigated through a tough season.\n\nThe Lakers ended the regular season with a record of 47-35, positioning them 7th in the Western Conference. Despite the team's ups and downs, Davis's performances were a consistent bright spot, providing the Lakers with a solid foundation to compete each night. His presence in the paint and ability to stretch the floor have been invaluable, especially in crucial matchups.\n\nAs the playoffs began, the Lakers faced a challenging first-round series against the Denver Nuggets. Currently trailing 0-2 in the series, the situation is becoming increasingly dire for Los Angeles. However, Davis has stepped up significantly in the postseason, averaging 32.0 points and 12.5 rebounds along with 3.5 assists in the first two games. His elevated play in the playoffs highlights his ability to rise to the occasion, showcasing his skills in high-pressure situations.\n\nDespite the Lakers' current deficit in the series, Davis's playoff performance has not only showcased his individual talents but also his leadership on the court. As the Lakers look to bounce back against the Nuggets, Davis's role becomes even more critical. The team's ability to rally and turn the series around will heavily depend on his performance and ability to inspire his teammates.\n\n5. Zion Williamson\n\nZion Williamson, the electrifying forward selected first overall in the 2019 NBA Draft, had a solid yet challenging 2023-24 season with the New Orleans Pelicans. He managed to put up averages of 22.9 points, 5.8 rebounds, and 5.0 assists over 70 games, demonstrating his dynamic ability to impact games despite facing various obstacles.\n\nThe Pelicans finished the regular season with a respectable 49-33 record, securing the 8th seed in the competitive Western Conference. Zion's performance was crucial in many of those victories, as he continued to be a nightmare matchup for opponents with his explosive athleticism and improved playmaking abilities. His ability to draw defenses and create opportunities for himself and his teammates has been a significant factor in the Pelicans' offensive schemes.\n\nHowever, as the playoffs began, Zion faced a significant setback, suffering an injury that sidelined him for the first round. This was a major blow to the Pelicans, who are currently trailing the Oklahoma City Thunder 2-0 in their series. Zion's absence is palpably felt, especially as the team struggles to fill the void left by his scoring and leadership.\n\nThe challenge for New Orleans is now to find ways to compensate for Zion's production and energy. The team needs other players to step up and collectively fill the gap, not only in scoring but also in creating plays and securing rebounds. This situation tests the depth and resilience of the Pelicans as they attempt to navigate through the playoffs without one of their key players.\n\n6. Karl-Anthony Towns\n\nKarl-Anthony Towns, the No. 1 pick in the 2015 NBA Draft, has been a steady force for the Minnesota Timberwolves throughout the 2023-24 season. With an average of 21.8 points, 8.3 rebounds, and 3.0 assists over 62 games, Towns has continued to showcase his versatile skill set, which makes him one of the top big men in the league.\n\nThis season, the Timberwolves finished with an impressive record of 56-26, securing the 3rd seed in the highly competitive Western Conference. Towns' contributions have been pivotal in achieving this success, as he provides both scoring and rebounding, coupled with his ability to stretch the floor with his shooting. His presence inside and his perimeter shooting ability create significant matchup problems for opposing teams.\n\nAs the playoffs got underway, the Timberwolves took a commanding 2-0 lead in their first-round series against the Phoenix Suns. Towns has been instrumental in this strong start, dominating in the post and making critical plays when needed. His ability to perform in clutch situations has not only helped his team secure victories but also instilled confidence in his teammates.\n\n7. Paolo Banchero\n\nPaolo Banchero, the first overall pick in the 2022 NBA Draft, has quickly become the cornerstone of the Orlando Magic. In his second season, Banchero averaged 22.6 points, 6.9 rebounds, and 5.4 assists over 80 games, showcasing his ability to influence the game in multiple facets and emerging as a leader on a young and vibrant team.\n\nThe Magic finished the regular season with a record of 47-35, clinching first place in the Southeast Division and securing the 5th seed in the Eastern Conference. This marked a significant improvement and a promising shift in the team's trajectory, largely attributable to Banchero's development and impact. His versatility as a forward who can handle the ball, create his own shots, and set up his teammates has been a key factor in Orlando's success this season.\n\nDespite their regular season achievements, the Magic have encountered challenges in the playoffs, currently trailing the Cleveland Cavaliers 0-2 in the first round. In these playoff games, Banchero has maintained strong individual performances, averaging 22.5 points, 5.0 rebounds, and 4.0 assists. However, the team as a whole has struggled to match the intensity and execution of the Cavaliers.\n\nAs the series progresses, the pressure is on Banchero and the Magic to adjust and overcome the deficit they face. The playoffs are a crucial test of Banchero's ability to lead under pressure, and his response to these challenges will be pivotal in determining Orlando's fate this postseason. The Magic will need him to not only produce offensively but also elevate his defensive play and leadership to rally his team.\n\n8. Cade Cunningham\n\nCade Cunningham, the top overall pick in the 2021 NBA Draft, faced a challenging season with the Detroit Pistons in 2023-24. Despite Detroit's struggles, Cunningham continued to show why he was selected first, averaging 22.7 points, 7.5 assists, and 4.3 rebounds over 62 games. His performance underscored his potential as a future star and leader, even as the Pistons ended the season with a disappointing record of 14-68, finishing last in the Eastern Conference.\n\nCunningham's role as the primary playmaker and scorer for Detroit has become more pronounced in his third season. His ability to handle the ball, create shots for himself and others, and make plays under pressure has been a silver lining during a tough year for the team. His scoring has been efficient, and his playmaking skills have matured, indicating his evolution into a more complete player.\n\nThe Pistons' season was undoubtedly a difficult one, with few victories to celebrate. However, the experience could be invaluable for a young player like Cunningham, providing him with ample opportunities to learn, grow, and prepare for the future. The Pistons will need to build around Cunningham in the coming years, adding pieces that complement his skill set and help translate his individual successes into team success.\n\n9. Victor Wembanyama\n\nVictor Wembanyama, the highly anticipated first overall pick in the 2023 NBA Draft, lived up to the hype in his debut season with the San Antonio Spurs. Despite his team's struggles, Wembanyama made an immediate impact, averaging 21.4 points, 10.6 rebounds, and an impressive 3.6 blocks per game over 71 games. His unique combination of size, skill, and defensive prowess quickly established him as a standout player in the league.\n\nThe Spurs finished the season with a record of 22-60, placing them 14th in the Western Conference. Although the team's performance was far from competitive, Wembanyama's presence brought a new sense of hope and excitement to the franchise. His ability to alter shots at the rim and contribute significantly on both ends of the floor made him one of the few bright spots in an otherwise challenging season for San Antonio.\n\nWembanyama's rookie year showcased his potential to be a transformative player in the NBA. His scoring ability, especially for someone of his height, combined with his shot-blocking and rebounding, make him a rare talent. Throughout the season, he demonstrated that he could handle the physicality of the league and had the work ethic to continue improving his game.\n\n10. Deandre Ayton\n\nDeandre Ayton, the first overall pick in the 2018 NBA Draft, experienced a season of both personal achievement and team difficulties after his move to the Portland Trail Blazers. Throughout the 2023-24 season, Ayton posted solid numbers, averaging 16.7 points, 11.1 rebounds, and 1.6 assists across 55 games. His presence in the paint and rebounding prowess highlighted his contributions, even as the team struggled significantly.\n\nThe Trail Blazers ended the season with a disappointing record of 21-61, placing them at the bottom of the Western Conference. This performance marked a tough season for Portland, as they navigated through roster changes and injuries, with Ayton being one of the few consistent performers. Despite the team's struggles, Ayton's ability to dominate the boards and provide reliable scoring in the post were crucial, showcasing his skills as a premier center.\n\nAyton's season, though statistically strong, also reflected the challenges of adapting to a new team environment and the pressure of trying to turn around a franchise in rebuild mode. His role as a veteran and a centerpiece in the Trail Blazers' strategy was evident, as he was often the focal point on offense and the last line of defense. However, the team's overall performance indicates a need for further roster improvements and strategic adjustments to better leverage Ayton's talents.", "source": {"uri": "fadeawayworld.net",

A second half lead of as much as 20 points gradually evaporated as the defending champion Nuggets asserted their will on the play of Nikola Yokic, Michael Porter, Aaron Gordon and Jamal Murray.\n\nCurious about outcome, with about three minutes remaining in game, I turned the television on and, not surprisingly, realized that Denver had come within four points of the lead. After tying the game at 99, the Lakers had an opportunity to take control of game and lead, ball in Lebron's hands. He took a decent three point shot that rimmed in, then out. With about 10 seconds left in game, the Nuggets put the ball in Jamal Murray's hands. Guarded by Anthony Davis, Jamal feigned a drive to basket, which AD reacted to, then faded to corner and hit a jumper while falling to the floor, giving the Nuggets their tenth consecutive playoff victory over the Lakers and a commanding 2-0 series lead. I prefer not to criticize coaches, but I honestly believe Lebron or someone with similar skills should have been on Murray. It was a tremendously played game that could have gone either way. The NBA is indeed a make or miss league.\n\nThe Knicks/76ers game proved just as entertaining and dramatic. The 76ers actually outplayed New York for a majority of the game, but as is often the case with talented, veteran teams as is the Knicks, they clawed their way back in the game with the gritty play of Josh Hart, Hartenstein their center and Duece McBride, a fearless competitor who gives them a competitive edge as a scorer and defender. Trailing by five points with the game seemingly in hand, a turnover allowed Jalen Brunson to make an improbable 3-point shot that hit the rim, bounced straight up before finding the bottom of the net. Then for some perplexing reason, former Heat guard Kyle Lowry, traded to Philly, rushed an inbound pass to Tyreese Maxey who couldn't control the ball, thus allowing the Knicks to steal ball, shoot and make a successful second three pointer after missing one, all in same sequence. 76er Head Coach Nick Nurse's attempt to call a timeout prior to steal and shot went unheeded. Both Joel Embiid and Lebron James complained about the officiating, not unusual when the fortunes of the game don't go your way. Consistency really is the key when it comes to matters of officiating.\n\nEven if Jimmy Butler and Terry Rozier were healthy, the Heat would be prohibitive underdogs against the Celtics. My prediction, after the dust settles, is that the Celtics and Nuggets will meet for the title. If and when that happens, I'll give you my choice as '24 NBA champion. What a wonderful time to get wrapped up in playoff basketball, NBA style.\n\nThe Florida Panthers Hockey team has begun its quest for a Stanley Cup title by defeating the Tampa Bay Lightning in the first playoff series which continues tonight in Sunrise.\n\nFinally, in case you missed it, Fisk University's Morgan Price became the first gymnast to win a NCAA title from a HBCU, winning the

But through the first two games of the Lakers' first-round matchup with the Denver Nuggets, they have only gotten 17 bench points with all of them coming from Taurean Prince.\n\nIf the purple and gold want any chance to make this a series, they need more bench scoring to complement the starters. Spencer Dinwiddie and Gabe Vincent need to be more aggressively looking for their shot and not force the issue that could negatively impact the game.\n\nAs Game 3 looms, perhaps being back at Crypto.com Arena will help the bench as the notion is role players play better at home. However, Prince believes that the other bench players must let the game flow and be aggressive when the opportunity presents itself.\n\n\"I think that just comes with having flow,\" Prince said. \"I think that's just how the game goes sometimes and we understand that. I think it's been the same thing throughout the whole season, we kind of just pick and choose our battles and when to attack and when to be aggressive in that area.\"\n\nUnfortunately, during Game 2, Prince and Dinwiddie forced the issue during the fourth quarter and took ill-advised shots that Denver capitalized on. Flow is a big piece to finding a rhythm as forcing the issue can provide even more trouble for the Lakers due to pressure that the Nuggets put on their opponents.\n\nDepth is something that L.A. prided itself on coming into this season and there is no better time to showcase that then in a do-or-die situation with Game 3. Every player is going to need to show up and the bench needs to do their job by outscoring a weak Denver bench that does not have many scoring threats.\n\nTaurean Prince: Lakers know they can be dangerous regardless of who's in lineup\n\nTwo key pieces that the team is missing right are Jarred Vanderbilt and Christian Wood, who both can provide the skillsets that the Lakers need in this series. Vanderbilt with his perimeter defense and Wood with his ability to rebound and score a couple of points.\n\nBut L.A. needs to continue on without those two at least until potentially Game 4. As all eyes shift to Game 3 and perhaps extending the series a little bit longer, Prince knows that the team can be dangerous regardless of who's in or out of the lineup.", "source": {"uri": "lakersnation.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Lakers Nation"}, "authors": [{"uri": "matthew_valento@lakersnation.com", "name": "Matthew Valento", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taurean_Prince", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Taurean Prince"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los_Angeles_Lakers", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles Lakers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_playoffs", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "NBA playoffs"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spencer_Dinwiddie", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Spencer Dinwiddie"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Denver_Nuggets", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Denver Nuggets"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crypto.com_Arena", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Crypto.com Arena"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Denver", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Denver"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Denver"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christian_Wood", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Christian Wood"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vanderbilt_Commodores_men's_basketball", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Vanderbilt Commodores men's basketball"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rebound_(basketball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Rebound (basketball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jarred_Vanderbilt", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Jarred Vanderbilt"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Browser_Based", "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Browser Based", "wgt": 22}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Downloads", "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Downloads", "wgt": 21}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Board_Games/Historical", "label": "dmoz/Games/Board Games/Historical", "wgt": 21}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Board_Games/Print_and_Play", "label": "dmoz/Games/Board Games/Print and Play", "wgt": 21}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Board_Games/Developers_and_Publishers", "label": "dmoz/Games/Board Games/Developers and Publishers", "wgt": 22}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 90}], "image": "https://s22928.pcdn.co/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/Taurean-Prince-5.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9512740", "eventUri": "eng-9512740", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1294117647058823, "wgt": 129, "relevance": 1}

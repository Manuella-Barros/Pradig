{"id": 231222004, "title": "Why Glen Powell Jokes His Dog &#39;Doesn&#39;t Like Vin Diesel&#39;: Inside the Twisters Star&#39;s Universal Backlot Tour (Exclusive)", "text": "Glen Powell is joking when he says his dog Brisket \"doesn't like Vin Diesel.\" But judging from their recent adventure involving a Fast & Furious ride, this may not be too far from the truth. The 35-year-old star of action-rom-com Hit Man (now streaming on Netflix) and disaster movie Twisters (in theaters July 19) has had his 1-year-old terrier poodle mix constantly by his side since adopting him from the Labelle Foundation, he tells PEOPLE exclusively. \"Everybody can be a dog dad, but I really feel like I bring him everywhere, so he really has so many co-parents,\" says Powell. While filming Twisters, he recalls, \"every department was taking care of Brisket,\" from the crew to costar Daisy Edgar-Jones. Because he's \"so socialized\" and \"such a well-behaved dog\" \u2014 and because Powell can slip the small pup into his shirt, he adds \u2014 Brisket has \"been on every corner of the planet at this point, and he's unfazed by anything.\" Anything, that is, except the Los Angeles Universal Studios Backlot Tour, which the Top Gun: Maverick star calls \"the one thing that I regret taking Brisket on.\" While working with the cast and crew on Universal Pictures' Twisters, he remembers, \"during the lunch break, I was like, 'You know what? I want to take the cast on a Backlot Tour. Let's see if we can hook up a guide.' \"So, of course, Brisket's next to me \u2014 'Yeah, let's bring Brisket!' \u2014 [but] I forgot the Backlot Tour\u2026 It's fire. It's a shark. It's pyrotechnics. All of a sudden, we go to The Fast and the Furious ride, which is like this giant dome. You go in there, and the thing's shaking like crazy, and there's gunshots, and there's fire.\" All to say, \"It's a nightmare for a dog,\" concludes Powell. \"Daisy Edgar-Jones and I are co-parenting, she's next to me and we were just covering Brisket's eyes, whispering. I was like, 'That was the worst dad move ever.' I almost gave him a heart attack.\" Hence, he quips, \"Brisket doesn't like Vin Diesel.\" Never miss a story \u2014 sign up for PEOPLE's free daily newsletter to stay up-to-date on the best of what PEOPLE has to offer, from juicy celebrity news to compelling human interest stories. Although Brisket wasn't present for his dad's PEOPLE interview, staying instead with Powell's niece and nephew \"while I'm having to run around,\" Powell knows the pooch is safe and happy \u2014 and avoiding further studio tours. \"Brisket has the best personality,\" he says. \"He brings so much joy to everybody.\" Following a theatrical release, Hit Man began streaming on Netflix June 7. Twisters hits theaters July 19.", "summary": "Glen Powell brings his dog Brisket &#34;everywhere,&#34; he says \u2014 including a studio tour involving sharks, pyrotechnics, and the &#39;Fast &amp; Furious&#39; franchise", "url": "https://people.com/glen-powell-dog-vin-diesel-universal-tour-exclusive-8659688", "image": "https://people.com/thmb/vl0u249iaaQsVK8wLnE7X0Y5F6A=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():focal(749x0:751x2)/glenpowell0617OLT-ee7eea3e882c43498fd41683a28fd51d.jpg", "video": null, "publish_date": "2024-06-08 12:15:00", "author": "Jack Smart", "authors": ["Jack Smart"], "language": "en", "source_country": "US", "sentiment": -0.226}

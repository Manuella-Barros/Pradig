{"id": 243276410, "title": "Businessman Facing Spy Charge to Live With Elderly Mum", "text": "A businessman accused of foreign interference has been ordered to wear an ankle monitor while he lives at his elderly mother\u2019s home awaiting trial. Alexander Csergo was granted bail during a hearing at Sydney\u2019s Downing Centre District Court on June 28, on conditions including that he surrender his passport and not approach any points of international departure. The 56-year-old has pleaded not guilty to one charge of reckless foreign interference after allegedly providing information to Chinese spies posing as think-tank workers. A trial date has been set for May 2025, a near-one-year wait that Judge Graham Turnbull said was the main factor in granting bail. Judge Turnbull noted the time Csergo would otherwise spend in custody could be greater than his sentence should he be found guilty. Csergo\u2019s 86-year-old mother, Catherine, said outside court she was overjoyed to have her son back after he had spent more than a year in custody. \u201cWhen he comes home we\u2019re going to have coffee together, sit on the balcony, look at the sea,\u201d Ms. Csergo said. \u201cHe told me \u2019mum, I\u2018ll take care of you\u2019, that\u2019s why he come home.\u201d Judge Turnbull said the greatest risk from releasing Csergo was that he would flee, particularly given his previous overseas connections, including working with the Chinese government. \u201cThere is potentially a place for him to go,\u201d he said. High-profile lawyer and former ACT attorney-general Bernard Collaery, who is representing Csergo, successfully argued the risk of flight could be dealt with by imposing strict conditions on his client. Csergo, his brother and their elderly mother have each agreed to forfeit $100,000 (US$66,900) should he fail to appear in court. Other conditions included in his bail are that he report daily to police and submit to ankle monitoring. Judge Turnbull on June 27 said according to the evidence the alleged offending would fall in the less serious range. \u201cThe strength of the crown case is, I would say, arguable,\u201d he told the court. Judge Turnbull noted the case did not include allegations that any of the material Csergo is accused of providing was classified. Mr. Collaery told an earlier court hearing his client had co-operated with the alleged spies out of fear of repercussions while he was in China Csergo used open-source information and co-operated as harmlessly as possible in his exchanges with the alleged foreign agents, according to Mr. Collaery. \u201cThis man was determined not to be detained in China,\u201d he told a bail hearing at the time. \u201cHe was co-operating to keep his nose clean.\u201d Csergo is due to face trial on May 19, 2025.", "summary": "A businessman accused of foreign interference has been ordered to wear an ankle monitor while he lives at his elderly mother&#8217;s home awaiting trial.

{"id": 239780838, "title": "Today in Politics: Paper leaks row remains on the boil on eve of first session of 18th Lok Sabha", "text": "The NEET-PG 2024 exam was postponed on Saturday, a day before it was scheduled to take place. This came amidst a massive controversy regarding the alleged NEET-UG exam paper leaks and days after the cancellation of the UGC-NET 2024 exam also due to similar irregularities. The NEET-PG exam is taken by medical students after graduation to qualify for PG courses. \u201cThis decision has been taken in the best interests of the students and to maintain the sanctity of examination process\u2026 fresh dates will be announced at the earliest,\u201d the health ministry said in a statement. Union health secretary Apurva Chandra told The Indian Express: \u201cNEET PG is being postponed as a precautionary measure.\u201d The Centre on Saturday night also announced that the probe into alleged irregularities in the NEET-UG exam will be handed over to the CBI for a comprehensive investigation. The development came amid a flurry of decisions over alleged irregularities in competitive exams, including the removal of National Testing Agency (NTA) Director General Subodh Singh and setting up of a seven-member panel headed by former ISRO chief K Radhakrishnan for exam reforms. Hitting out at the BJP-led NDA government over the row, the Congress general secretary in charge of communications, Jairam Ramesh, alleged that exam cancellations were happening in the country every day because of the \"total incompetence\" of Prime Minister Narendra Modi and the \"people around him\". Over the last couple of days, the Opposition INDIA alliance has been sharpening its attack on the BJP dispensation over the paper leaks. Senior Congress leader Rahul Gandhi on Thursday hit out at PM Modi\u2019s silence on the paper leaks, claiming he has \u201cpsychologically collapsed\u201d after the Lok Sabha elections. \u201cThe education system has been captured by the BJP and its parent organisation. Till the time this capture is not reversed, paper leaks will continue. The capture has been facilitated by Narendra Modi ji,\u201d Rahul alleged. With just a day left for the new Parliament session to begin, paper leaks and exam irregularities are likely to take centre stage politically. The first session of the 18th Lok Sabha will get underway on Monday, which is set to be stormy over paper leaks among other issues. The DMK, also a key INDIA ally, has opposed the NEET exam since its inception arguing it discriminates against underprivileged students. Meanwhile, the Centre on Friday notified a law that aims to curb malpractices and irregularities in competitive examinations. \u201cIn exercise of the powers conferred by sub-section (2) of section 1 of the Public Examinations (Prevention of Unfair Means) Act, 2024 (1 of 2024), the Central Government hereby appoints the 21st day of June, 2024, as the date on which the provisions of the said Act shall come into force,\u201d reads the notification by the Personnel Ministry. Assembly poll preps Union minister and BJP election in-charge for Jharkhand Shivraj Singh Chouhan arrived in Ranchi on Saturday evening to review the party's performance in the Lok Sabha polls and prepare a roadmap for the upcoming Assembly polls. In his first visit as state election in-charge, Chouhan will on Sunday hold a meeting with the core committees, party's district presidents, district in-charges and others. Assam CM and Jharkhand election co-incharge Himanta Biswa Sarma will arrive in Ranchi on Sunday to take part in the meeting. The Jharkhand Assembly elections are scheduled to be held later this year. Shah to review flood preparedness Union Home Minister Amit Shah will on Sunday review preparedness to deal with floods that affect various parts of the country during the monsoon. Every year, large areas of Bihar, Assam and other eastern states are inundated due to a rise in the water level of various rivers due to monsoon rains. \"The Home Minister will chair a high-level meeting here on Sunday to review overall preparedness for flood management in the country,\" a Home Ministry official said. Uttarakhand, Himachal Pradesh, Sikkim and a few other states also encounter landslides and other rain-related issues during the monsoon. Tamil Nadu, Kerala, and Jammu and Kashmir have also seen floods in recent years. Currently, Assam is facing floods with around 3.90 lakh people affected in 19 districts, officials said. Delhi water crisis An AAP delegation will meet Delhi Lt Governor V K Saxena on Sunday to find a solution to the deepening water crisis faced by the city. \"Since there is a serious water crisis in Delhi and the people of Delhi should get their rightful water. Therefore, we are coming to meet you to discuss this serious issue. We have full hope that tomorrow we will sit together and find a solution to this problem,\" stated AAP national secretary Pankaj Kumar Gupta in a letter to Saxena. The AAP leader blamed Haryana for the water crisis persisting in Delhi for several weeks. \"This water crisis has increased due to the Haryana government not releasing the entire share of water to Delhi. On top of that, the heat wave has further increased the demand for water in Delhi. In such a situation, the water crisis has deepened,\" he said. - With PTI inputs", "summary": "", "url": "https://indianexpress.com/article/political-pulse/today-in-politics-paper-leaks-row-first-session-18th-lok-sabha-9409387/", "image": "https://images.indianexpress.com/2024/06/paper-leak.jpg", "video": null, "publish_date": "2024-06-23 01:56:38", "author": null, "language": "en", "catgory": "politics", "source_country": "in", "sentiment": -0.417}

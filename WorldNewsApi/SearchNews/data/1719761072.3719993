Lyft\u2019s David Risher can answer that", "text": "Fun side note: Risher was the first CEO to bike to Fortune\u2018s studio for a Leadership Next interview. Listen to the episode or read the transcript below. Transcript Alan Murray: Leadership Next is powered by the folks at Deloitte who, like me, are exploring the changing rules of business leadership and how CEOs are navigating this change. Welcome to Leadership Next, the podcast about the changing rules of business leadership. I\u2019m Alan Murray. Michal Lev-Ram: And I\u2019m Michal Lev-Ram. Today\u2019s guest is David Risher, CEO of Lyft. And this was a really fun conversation. It\u2019s just such a tangible brand, that and Uber, which he did not mention by name, but we can. And he has been in the job for a year now and really set his focus on both the customers and the drivers and making sure that they\u2019re comfortable. And part of that, by the way, is this new initiative they have called Women+ Connect, where female drivers can choose female riders. So transparency, I think, across the board with both customers and drivers is a really, really big thing for him. Murray: Yeah, it was really impressive. I mean, I\u2019ve always thought of it as kind of a Coke-Pepsi sort of competition, but he made some very clear points about how he\u2019s trying to differentiate Lyft and take advantage of its position in the marketplace. I\u2019ll tell you what really impressed me, Michal, we\u2019ve done, what, 150 of these? Around 150 of these interviews. This is the first time that the interviewee came to the studio on a bicycle. Lev-Ram: And we should note it was a Lyft bikeshare bicycle. So he, you know, he wasn\u2019t off-brand in his vehicle of choice. Murray: No, but it was a beautiful spring day and he biked all the way around the tip of Manhattan to get to our offices and showed up, he was breathing well, seemed to be seemed to have handled the ride just fine. It was fun. Lev-Ram: Well, the two of you can race another time. But, you know, we got to talk about a lot of just some of the challenges and obviously opportunities for them, including geographic expansion. But, you know, both Lyft and Uber have been challenged. COVID was definitely problematic for ridesharing. And so it was really interesting to hear both how they\u2019re coming out of that and also just how he\u2019s leading the company now in a post founder-led era, which is quite different. Murray: Well, let\u2019s listen in. [Interview begins.] David Risher, thanks for being with us. David Risher: Yeah, of course. It\u2019s nice to be here. Murray: It\u2019s good to have you. So you\u2019re one year into this job. It\u2019s a big job. What\u2019s been the biggest surprise over the course of that year? Risher: Oh, man. I mean, this might sound funny, but the biggest surprise is how much you can get done in a year if you really put your mind to it. We had all the ingredients, but we just didn\u2019t quite have the recipe right. And you put them together, great team, big vision around customer obsession, and go, go, go, and it\u2019s amazing to see the growth we\u2019ve seen. Murray: Michal, can I keep going here for a little bit? Lev-Ram: Absolutely. Murray: Because I\u2019d really like to get you to follow up on that. This is a hypercompetitive business. You\u2019re like Coke and Pepsi or maybe more like Hertz and Avis or something. You know, I know when I\u2019m getting a car, I just want the car to be there fast. I don\u2019t care who it comes from. So what is the nature? It\u2019s a fairly undifferentiated product. What can you do? How do you really make ground against Uber in this battle? Risher: Yeah, it turns out you can do a lot. And it\u2019s interesting because, so first of all, you know, really focusing on the customer really makes a difference. So I\u2019ll give you some examples. When I started, the company had started to focus a little bit too much on Wall Street and a little bit too little on its own riders and drivers. And so, you know, if I\u2019m honest, we were paying our drivers not quite competitive rates. We were charging our riders a little bit more under the hopes of making more money faster. Just a bad strategy, just because to your point, a lot of people they\u2019ll say, you know, who\u2019s going to get me? They\u2019re less expensive. Who\u2019s going to get me there faster? So when I look forward, you know, over the year, you know, just fixing some of the basics really, really helps. And I\u2019ll give you an example. A year ago, our what we call our pin ETA difference. So let\u2019s say the gap between how fast you might be picked up in the other guy versus us might have been three or four minutes, which is significant if you\u2019re in a hurry. Murray: Yeah. Risher: Now it\u2019s ten seconds. What\u2019s ten seconds? So when you get to the point where it\u2019s ten seconds, now you can start to compete on other things. You can start to compete on Women+ Connect, which we launched, which is a product that lets women choose women. You can start to compete on faster airport pickup, where people are very stressed about getting to the airport. So it\u2019s sort of a couple stage thing. You got to make sure you\u2019re focused on your customers. You got to fix the basics to give yourself permission to do some of the other more innovative things. And then you can start to innovate and give people a real reason to choose one or the other instead of having them think it\u2019s kind of the same thing. Lev-Ram: So I remember the early days of Lyft with the pink mustaches, and you could like sit next to your driver and they would talk to you. Do you feel like that\u2019s still at all the sort of culture, the experience, like is that at all a differentiator, or has that gone away? Because, you know, a lot of drivers are Uber and Lyft drivers today, right? They\u2019re not exclusive to one or the other. Risher: Yeah. Brands are so interesting and reputations are so interesting because they take a long time to build and once you\u2019ve got them, they actually persist for many years. So I was just. Murray: We, by the way, at Fortune, we know that. Risher: For sure you do. Murray: It\u2019s hard to kill a good brand once\u2026. Risher: Are you guys trying? Murray: You know we\u2019re not anymore, but there have probably been times in our past when we were trying pretty hard. Risher: And it\u2019s such a source of strength. Right? Because and of course, you can kill a great brand, but you to and, by the way, Uber has tried over the years. You know what I mean? They\u2019ve seemed pretty good at that from time to time. But so back to us. So look, I was with drivers on Friday morning. I\u2019m here in New York City. We actually have a guild called the Independent Drivers Guild. And one of the first comments people made was around, your riders are nicer. So that\u2019s interesting. So part of what you\u2019re talking about, Michal, is sort of like you know, right from the beginning, this company really decided to focus on being kind of the good guys. And while some of the specifics around the pink mustache and so forth, we\u2019re not using as much anymore, that general vibe absolutely persists. I\u2019ll say one last thing. I drive for Lyft about every six weeks, and it\u2019s a great experience. I can tell you all about it. It\u2019s kind of hilarious, by the way, when I tell people who I am and they kind of go bananas. But one of the things, of course, I always ask is why did you choose us over the other guys today? And a third of the time, maybe half the time they say, you know what? Honestly, I can\u2019t quite say but I just like you guys better. And that persist. That really matters. Murray: Huh? Wow. Lev-Ram: I want to know a little bit more. You mentioned Women+ Connect. And I know that\u2019s one of the newer initiatives. I thought it was really interesting to see the numbers that almost half of riders are female, but less than a quarter I think of drivers are female. So where did this initiative come from and what\u2019s been the response? Risher: So this is a fun story because it actually was the first thing I did when I started. So I started on April 17th of last year, nine o\u2019clock in the morning I come in like any new employee, you know, I get my badge, you know, I get my computer. Ten o\u2019clock in the morning, we have a meeting, and the meeting at the time is called Women Driving Women. And it\u2019s me saying, you know what? This is what we\u2019re going to work on next. And this idea had been floating around for a while, right? Because to your point, you know, half the population is women, but only about 25% of our drivers are, by the way, they only drive about 15% of hours. So what does that tell you? Right? That tells you that they and last interesting data point, DoorDash is about 66% women Dashers 50 to 60%. So it turns out the gig economy works really well for a lot of people and certainly women. And this might sound stereotypical, it also happens to be true. A lot of women are balancing complicated lives. They have, you know, childcare, maybe elder care, something else in their life that makes it somewhat difficult to have a full-time job. So all of those things suggest, gosh, what a great opportunity. But then what\u2019s going wrong? Well, what\u2019s going wrong is maybe not that surprisingly, a lot of women don\u2019t feel super safe driving. Right? And imagine the physics of it, right? You\u2019re in the front seat of the car. There\u2019s someone in the back, you don\u2019t necessarily know the person and so on and so on. So and then when you talk to riders, it turns out that a lot of riders and my friends included, when I would talk to them who are women, they would say it\u2019s not that I feel uncomfortable exactly, but I will say if it\u2019s late at night or if it\u2019s a new city, you know, I would actually prefer a woman driver. So anyway, and a fair amount of sort of anecdotal market research on it and then the numbers sort of spoke for themselves. So we called together a group of people. Of course, there are all sorts of issues when you do a feature like this, there\u2019s some legal issues, you know, gender is sort of a fraught topic. You can kind of work through all these things, but at the end we said, Look, let\u2019s do this and see what the response is. The response has been phenomenal, phenomenal. We launched it in five cities, then 50. Now we\u2019re all across the United States. If you look at social media, you\u2019ll see women saying, I\u2019m crying. This is what I\u2019ve been waiting for someone to do for years. If you look at our driver activations now, about a third of our applicants are women now, up from the 20 to 25%. So that\u2019s actually growing. It\u2019s just fantastic. And so this is something we were going to do, you know, every single day for the rest of Lyft\u2019s history is we\u2019re going to make it better and better, easier and easier for women to drive other women. Murray: So smart. Lev-Ram: David, what other kinds of initiatives do you have in play that are either, you know, current or coming up this year? Risher: So we\u2019ve talked a lot about rider-focused initiatives and driver-focused initiatives, but our partnership strategy, I think is also really important and actually not super well understood. So we\u2019ve had partnerships, for example, with Delta Airlines for many years, with Starbucks, with Chase. And let me just talk about the Delta one, for instance, because it gives you sort of example. With Delta, you can earn SkyMiles when you take a Lyft ride. So that\u2019s important, right? Because that means that if you\u2019re a Delta SkyMiles customer or client, I\u2019m not sure what the word is, you know, you\u2019re more likely to take us than the other guys. We also provide services to Delta for their pilots and air crew, particularly very early in the morning when shuttle buses and so forth don\u2019t work, and particularly when pilots are in places that are sort of unusual. Maybe they got diverted and so there\u2019s sort of a last-minute thing that has to be done. Very similar with Starbucks. We actually help Starbucks baristas get to work, again typically early in the morning before public transit is operational and so forth. Mastercard, we\u2019ve had a partnership with for years where we\u2019ve, you know, they were kind of actually started in San Francisco with the bikeshare program. And if you saw the Grammys, they actually did an advertisement that mentioned our partnership around planting trees, which we do together in a certain way. The reason I bring all these up is because, you know, I spent a lot of time outside the United States, as I mentioned. And one of the great sayings that you hear in various different countries across the continent of Africa is if you want to go fast, you go alone. But if you want to go far, go together. And we really, as a smaller player than our big competitor, it\u2019s quite helpful for us from a business model perspective and frankly just from sort of an ecosphere and perspective to really have deep partnerships with that with other organizations where we have shared goals. So yeah. Murray: Again, great companies, they\u2019re great purpose driven companies. Risher: So every one of them, yeah, that\u2019s the idea. Murray: A great coalition of brands. I want to go back to something you said at the beginning. Your first year in the job there was, you took what was a four-minute wait, which for somebody who doesn\u2019t like waiting, that\u2019s significant. You took it down to 10 seconds. Risher: Yeah. Murray: How\u2019d you do that? Risher: More drivers, more drivers. So the way rideshare works, it\u2019s a two-sided marketplace. And you have to keep rider and driver in balance, right? If you have too few drivers, prices go up and wait times increase. Of course, if you have too many drivers, you have a different problem as well. So you have to be very, very careful about how you, it\u2019s called, balance the marketplace, keep the marketplace liquid in econometric terms. And so we spent, and we\u2019ll do this forever, a lot of energy figuring out how can we be a more attractive place to drive. First order of business, make sure you\u2019re paying them well. Right? We have a whole white paper about this. You can read about it. It talks about how much drivers make after all their expenses. We now guarantee, guarantee that drivers will never make less than 70% of what a rider pays them after insurance and some other fees. That was a huge, huge deal. And driver sentiment has shifted very dramatically towards Lyft as a result. So again, it\u2019s a bunch of things. Some of it\u2019s very basic, like making sure you\u2019re paying them, you know, the sort of a fair rate and the rate that\u2019s comparable to what they could get doing other things. And some of it is around more innovation, right? Trying to figure out a way to guarantee certain pieces so that and you just do it over and over and over again. You know, city by city, we\u2019re in 280 markets or so. And that\u2019s the result. Lev-Ram: Is transparency part of it, too? I mean, I would assume that drivers care very much about that. Have you made changes there? Risher: Absolutely. Absolutely. And in fact, that\u2019s exactly it. So I have a public email address. It\u2019s David at Lyft dot com and drivers. Right. And they\u2019re very clear about what it is that they like and they\u2019re also very clear about what bugs them. And so, but again customer obsession right? So our drivers are our customers so we have to pay attention to what bugs them and the lack of transparency really bothers them. You know, they start to kind of come up with all sorts of theories of what\u2019s going on. So now, and this again, is a relatively new feature, we\u2019ve actually just rolled it out over the last six weeks or so. At the end of every week, you get a full statement that literally starts with how much riders paid because that was the thing that would bug them so much is they would say, you know, I got a, you know, a trip where a rider paid me 50 bucks and I only made ten. And it\u2019s like, what? What? What is that? So anyway, so now we show them, you know, the complete statement, literally everything the rider paid, everything that they got, all their tips, all the tolls, all the different, you know, things. And then, again, if it\u2019s ever less than 70% after those pass-through fees, we literally send them a check. We send them a check. And again, this driver group I talked to the other day, they said I couldn\u2019t believe it the first time I got a rebate, it was sort of like getting a tax rebate. It was it was great. Murray: So you focus on your customers, you take better care of your drivers. But when when Minneapolis said we\u2019re going to impose a minimum wage on rideshare drivers, you were out. Risher: Well, so because we take care of our riders and drivers, right. So we by the way, we\u2019re not actually out yet. They\u2019ve now moved that to July 1st. And I hope we can come to a compromise. That\u2019s actually really our goal. But the reason we\u2019ve said we will not continue to operate in Minneapolis if they make these moves is because our drivers will make less, because the rates will go up, let\u2019s say, from 20 to let\u2019s say 50 for the same for the ride. And what will happen then is fewer people will take Lyft and what will happen then is drivers will make less. And so you\u2019ll have the situation where riders are paying more than they want, drivers are not making as much as today, and everyone\u2019s going to be even more annoyed than they are right now. So we said, Look, if you want to do this, we have a way, you know, there there\u2019s actually a compromise that you guys have come up with and we\u2019re ready to say yes. But if you really are stuck on increasing effectively the fares by, you know, double, we just can\u2019t do business that way. Lev-Ram: Is it surprising at all that this many years in companies like Lyft and Uber are still having these conversations with cities? I mean, I remember being in Austin when you guys pulled out of that city and being stuck somewhere and realizing just like, how do I get home? How do I get back to my hotel? But I don\u2019t know. From my perspective, like, would you have figured this out by now? And wouldn\u2019t you, plus cities have figured it out? Risher: I am so glad you said that. Yeah, like what? What the heck? So I think, yes, it is surprising, but I think what it reflects is a couple of things. I think one, again, we were talking about brands before, right? Once you have a certain mindset, gosh is it hard to shift that mindset. And I think for a long time the rideshare industry had a certain kind of vibe around it and that vibe was a little bit and and honestly, this is an area where I don\u2019t like to trash talk my competitor. But they were so aggro that cities still are kind of stuck in that mode. And so when we go I talked to the mayor of Boston a couple of weeks ago, the mayor of Washington, D.C., a couple weeks before that. And my point is like, look, we are an important part of this city\u2019s social infrastructure, right? We are getting people out to work, to play, to go to restaurants, to go to bars, to get to the airport. Like this is a big way of how your city connects with itself every single day. Two million rides a day on just the Lyft platform across the nation. So let\u2019s kind of move a little bit forward from some of these squabbles and frankly, many cities have, many states have. But then there\u2019s a separate element, which is it could be seen as politically interesting to sort of pick this kind of fight. And I can also imagine a world, and here I\u2019m trying to be sort of open minded, where genuinely well-intentioned people say, gosh, I really want, you know, this driver population to make more. Of course you do. I completely understand that. And so I\u2019m going to come up with a strategy that I think does that, and they just don\u2019t know the math. And so anyway, so I think it\u2019s kind of all of the above. When I think, well, gosh, I hope we move beyond this. I really do, because it\u2019s not, again, two million rides a day, you know, 700 to 800 million rides a year. And oh, by the way, not just cars, but also bikes here in New York City and across the country. Like we\u2019re a big part of of many workers lives, many drivers lives, of course, riders lives and cities. And I think it\u2019s kind of time to move forward. Murray: So, David, you\u2019re focusing on customers, you\u2019re focusing on riders, you\u2019re focusing less on shareholders. But at the end of the day, you do have to make money. Risher: Sure. Murray: And you haven\u2019t yet. Risher: Yeah. Murray: How do you feel about progress towards that goal? Risher: Great. And the reason is because our sort of our mantra is customer obsession drives profitable growth. So, you know, let\u2019s look at the numbers for a second. So first on the growth side, you know, the first quarter that I was CEO, we grew about 10% year on year, then we grew about 17%, then we grew about 20%, then we grew about 26%. So those are the first four quarters. So we\u2019re growing. So then the question is, will, are we doing a profitably? Well, as you point out, we haven\u2019t made gap profitability yet, but it is absolutely on the you know, on the roadmap. We were free cash flow positive last quarter. That\u2019s Q4 of 2023. We will be free cash flow positive this entire year. Absolutely. We\u2019ve promised it to Wall Street. And when you look at our losses, they are diminishing to the point where they\u2019re really quite small right now and most Wall Street analysts show us turning a profit quite soon. So we are absolutely on that path. Some of it was through very hard decisions. You know, one of my first decision was obviously very difficult involving cutting about 26% of our staff, which is very, very difficult to do. Incredibly hard, you know, kind of heart wrenching work. But you you have to do it if you\u2019re going to be able to lower your prices and pay drivers more, you know, and and and. And now we\u2019re being very disciplined, very disciplined quarter after quarter. And by the way, our CFO, Erin Brewer, one of the best people I\u2019ve ever hired in my entire life, and I\u2019ve hired great people. And she is incredibly disciplined as well. So between the two of us, we\u2019re not giving an inch on that. Lev-Ram: In terms of growth and the market out there. I mean, your competitor, I can name it, Uber, has always had this like conquer the world approach. You, you know, Lyft from the get go was focused much more on the U.S., I know you\u2019re in Canada as well. But is that changing at all? Do you feel like you need to look elsewhere for that growth in the market? And is that going to happen any time soon? Risher: So I\u2019ll say a couple of things there. First, let\u2019s let\u2019s talk specifically about geography. You just brought it up. So I was actually just in Toronto earlier this week. We now have an office in Toronto. We\u2019ve got about 80 people there, by the way, mostly engineering. It\u2019s an incredible city for great engineering and technical talent. And we operate rideshare in Canada. We operate rideshare now. So ten seconds of history, to your point, we right from the beginning, we were very much more domestically focused, you know, than the other guys, as you say. And when I joined, one of the things that the board knew about me was I have spent a lot of time outside the United States. I lived outside the United States for many years. The nonprofit I ran was very global in nature. I probably spent more time outside the U.S. than inside the U.S. over the last 20 years. That\u2019s probably exaggeration, but along those lines. So anyway, so I\u2019m very, very internationally minded. I very much think that what we do bring people together, you know, get drivers a way to earn money that\u2019s flexible, can work worldwide for sure. Now, you do have to get what you\u2019re doing right, right in one geography before you go to many, oherwise you find yourself really getting in trouble that way. I\u2019ve learned that lesson myself. And so we are very focused on North America, but that includes Canada. So our share in Canada over the last nine months since we really started to focus on it is significantly larger. I can give you a specific stat. Our share in Toronto, which is Canada\u2019s biggest city, of course, eight months ago when we were not honestly taking Canada very seriously was about 12%. As of last week, it is 32%. That\u2019s a very, very significant increase over a very short period of time. And again, it sort of comes back to the basics. Price well, pick people up fast. You know, these are things that don\u2019t you know, they\u2019re sort of universal, universal truths. And once you find one, you know, you do more and more of that. And I\u2019m happy to say, you know, I met with the premier of Ontario when I was in Toronto, and they\u2019re super excited about our arrival because it turns out to be better for everyone to have competition, right? I mean, Uber is there and we haven\u2019t been there, at least in a significant way. It\u2019s better for everyone, right? More drivers on the road, more riders knowing about rideshare and so on and so forth. So anyway, that playbook, I think we can apply elsewhere in the world, particularly when we see maybe a gap, you know, between what people want and what people are getting. It\u2019ll be step by step. You know, I\u2019m not making any predictions on timing, but it\u2019s kind of on the on the roadmap. Let\u2019s just say. Murray: You know, it\u2019s interesting because you\u2019re developing into a duopoly, right? Uber and Lyft and, historically, duopolies have been pretty good for the duopolists, but not very good for the customer. But is there something about these two-sided marketplaces that ensures that the customer will be well taken care of? Risher: There is. There is. I think it\u2019s such an interesting point. Like I, I think you\u2019re right. I think this is generally a two-player marketplace in most places around the world. That\u2019s kind of what you see because, in just ten seconds on that, it\u2019s very expensive to build these systems. It\u2019s billions of dollars of CapEx of, you know, share capital that you\u2019ve got to put in the ground to build systems that can match rider and driver, you know, 2 million times a day, 365 days a year, 24 hours, all this sort of thing. So quite expensive. And so therefore you\u2019re not going to get a lot of people doing that once two people are in there. A third person doesn\u2019t come in and say, Cool, I want to spend all that money to, you know, and divide this market up even more. So then the question is, how do you make sure that customers benefit from it? And the short answer is you almost can\u2019t not. So unlike maybe in the cell phone world where you might have two players and customers kind of tend to get the short end of a stick there. With us, we are competing for drivers and riders every single minute, every single minute. If we start to overprice, riders will go to the other guy. If we start to underpay, drivers will go to the other guy. It\u2019s gravitational, you know, there\u2019s literally nothing we can do about that. We\u2019ve seen what happens when you try. [Music starts.] Murray: Jason Girzadas, the CEO of Deloitte US, is the sponsor of this podcast and joins me today. Welcome, Jason. Jason Girzadas: Thank you, Alan. It\u2019s great to be here. Murray: Jason, we live in an era of disruption, technology disruption, geopolitical disruption, workplace disruption, and it makes accurate predictions about what\u2019s going to happen in the future more difficult than it has ever been. Yet the polls that we do together with you show that most business leaders largely remain optimistic. Why do you think that is? Girzadas: I think optimism is a result of the fact that we\u2019ve been through an incredibly tumultuous three years. And so I think business leaders realize that they\u2019ve built resiliency into their organizations. The prospect of even more disruption isn\u2019t as foreign of a concept, and I think there\u2019s more confidence in their ability to adapt and to be agile. Secondarily, there\u2019s been tremendous investment in technology and new capabilities that client organizations and executives broadly are optimistic about those creating more value and more opportunity. So it\u2019s a function of what we\u2019ve been through, as well as the investments that have been made that give a sense of optimism despite some of the headwinds. Murray: And what\u2019s your advice to companies that are struggling with the potential disruption in the future? Girzadas: Well, disruption is the new normal. I don\u2019t think there\u2019s any placid water on the horizon or calmness that we can predict. So it\u2019s a function of getting accustomed to the discontinuities that are ahead of us, whether it\u2019s around technology or geopolitical change or workplace changes associated with the future of work or the demands of the talent workforce, change is the new normal. As a result, it is requiring executive teams to actually look holistically at those challenges, be facile with doing scenario planning and being on the lookout for where and how to capitalize on disruption versus being concerned by it or seen as a barrier to their success. Murray: Jason, thanks for your perspective and thanks for sponsoring Leadership Next. Girzadas: Thank you. [Music ends.] Murray: Can we talk about you? Risher: Sure. Murray: You honed your teeth at Amazon. That\u2019s where your customer obsession comes from. You talk like a true Amazonian, but then you left in 2009 and started a nonprofit. What was going on there? Explain your journey. Risher: So in order to understand my strange, you know, zigzag, you almost have to go back a step. So before I worked at Amazon, I worked at Microsoft for many years in the nineties. The reason I bring that up is because that\u2019s where I really started to fall in love with technology. And in fact, the reason I joined Amazon, this was in 1997, was because Amazon at the time was a bookstore. That\u2019s all it was as a $15.6 million, quite small bookstore that had just opened up online the year before. And so, in fact, this is a complete side story and my apologies, but it still resonates in my brain. When I left Microsoft, Bill Gates actually called me into his office and he said, wait a minute, you mean to tell me you were leaving Microsoft where you\u2019ve had success and you\u2019re doing well for some tiny little Internet startup bookstore that nobody\u2019s ever heard of? Murray: The classic Gates conversation? Risher: Oh, man, was it. And it got even more so when he said, That has got to be the stupidest decision I\u2019ve ever heard anyone make. And I honestly think he was genuine about it. I mean, I really do think that, by the way, since here we are at Fortune, a reporter at the time for Fortune, Joe Nocera actually wrote a cover story on this a couple of months later called \u201cI Remember Microsoft\u201d and it was about several of us that had left Microsoft in the nineties, much to Bill Gates\u2019s frustration and have gone on to do other things anyway. But why did I leave? I left because it was technology which I learned to love at Microsoft and it was a bookstore which I\u2019ve loved forever. And so, you know, when it come to the end of my Amazon chapter, there are a couple of things. You know, I went and taught for a little bit. As I said, I moved overseas, but then I got super excited about this idea of using digital books to help kids read. And if you indulge me for 30 more seconds, I\u2019ll tell you that story. We actually spent the entire world with our family, our two daughters traveling around the world an entire year, teaching them and road schooling them. Amazing, amazing experience. At the end of that trip, we were in Ecuador and in Ecuador there is a village, a city called Guayaquil. In Guayaquil there was an orphanage. We spent the day at the orphanage because we were doing some social work as well as kind of education, tourism, so forth. And at the end of that day, as we\u2019re walking out, I see a big building with a padlock on it. And I asked the woman who runs the orphanage, why does that building? And she said, that is a library. And all of a sudden I think, wait, hold up. So what\u2019s going on and why does it have an padlock? And she says the books take forever to get here. They come by boat. By the time they get here, they\u2019re often out of date or there is someone else\u2019s junk book that they wanted to get rid of. You know, some, you know, accounting textbook from, you know, 1991 or whatever it might be. So anyway, I said and so therefore, the kids, the girls, the young women there, they\u2019ve lost interest. I said, Well, can I take a look inside? And she said, I think I\u2019ve lost the key to that place. Murray: [Makes a sound expressing surprise mixed with disgust.] Risher: Exactly. And it just was like, Whoa, hold up. And now, meanwhile, my two daughters, we had early generation Kindles. We just spent the year traveling. I\u2019m thinking, this is nuts. It makes no sense to cut down trees and move them around all this. Right? So I started a nonprofit all about getting kids reading. You know, fast forward many years. It\u2019s been in operation about 14 years now. We\u2019ve got about 22 million kids who have read on the platform, it\u2019s all digital reading, all on cell phones now. We don\u2019t use Kindle much anymore because everyone\u2019s got a cell phone. And it was incredibly important for me because it was a sense of purpose that I really brought to this job and maybe you can feel that. And it\u2019s really tricky to run nonprofits. They\u2019re quite resource constrained and so forth. So anyway, learned a bunch, but also had great impact and great, great experience in my life. Lev-Ram: And you\u2019ve said in the past that for-profits should be run like nonprofits. So what do you mean by that exactly? Murray: That\u2019s a very scary statement, having worked briefly for a nonprofit. So I\u2019m not sure this is the model. What is he talking about? Risher: So and I know I mean, when I say it, I know people, you know, kind of raise their eyebrows. What I really mean is nonprofits are, if you think about how big societal problems are tackled, you know, for-profits actually tackle a lot of them. Right? You know, the communication problem has sort of been solved by, you know, telephones. You know what I mean? So for-profits, you know, settle, you know, some problems. Then governments take on big issues, right? Education, military, things that the for-profit doesn\u2019t really make a lot of sense. But and then the problems that those two big sort of industries or whatever sectors can\u2019t take care of, those are the ones that the nonprofits are left with. You know, how do you feed people who don\u2019t have resources? How do you educate people who, for whatever reason, have fallen out of the school system and what have you? So some of the world\u2019s biggest problems with the ones that the nonprofits take on, and yet they have the smallest resources, tiny little budgets compared to the scope of the problem. And so if you are a nonprofit leader and running a successful, high-functioning nonprofit, you have to be very smart about making decisions that are very focused. You\u2019ve got to make the best of very limited resources. You have to lead with purpose because otherwise your employees will go across the street and probably get paid twice as much to do, you know, no more work. I can tell you now, people at nonprofits work just as hard as for profit. So I think the reason I say that is because I think as a manager and frankly, as a leader, the for-profit world has certain advantages to it. You know, the more work you do, the more money you make, which means you can pay your employees more and you can invest more in R&D. The nonprofit world has very few of those structural advantages, but a lot of the same problems, maybe even bigger problems. And so as a leader of that, gosh, you put a Fortune 500 CEO into that position and say, you know, run this for a couple of years and I guarantee they will come away A, with a new respect for the sector, but B, with skills that they simply could not have gotten just in the for-profit world. That\u2019s my contention. Murray: Fascinating. Lev-Ram: So you do you do believe in making a profit though? Risher: Oh, 100%. Murray: And someday he will. Risher: And I will. Again, it\u2019s on the roadmap. [Laughter from all three.] I\u2019ll tell you a story about that. I worked for Jeff Bezos for many years, and his father, Miguel, who\u2019s just a spectacular human being, when I got this job, he said, Hey, David, that\u2019s fantastic. You know, don\u2019t forget you\u2019re running a for-profit now. Lev-Ram: That\u2019s funny, but I want to ask you a question, actually, speaking of Jeff Bezos, so you worked for, you know, one founder-led company for Bill Gates at Microsoft and then Jeff Bezos at Amazon, both in the eras where these founders were leading the companies. And then you take on the job at Lyft, which is another founder-led company, smaller, but but another, you know, very it\u2019s very ingrained in the culture. What have you learned over the years working for such kind of strong founder identity companies? Risher: I think founder-led companies are, you know, kind of the best, you know, until they maybe at a certain point they run into problems. I\u2019ll talk to you about that in a second from from several perspectives. But, you know, if you are a founder-led company, particularly one where the founder has been there for years, which is not easy, right? I mean, founding a company is one thing. Running it, particularly at scale, is quite a different thing. So you\u2019re already talking about a pretty special person who manages to go from small to medium to large and sort of scale that way. But you get a sense of purpose and direction and cultural strength that is really hard to replicate. Now, taking it over has been really interesting because for a couple of reasons. First of all, so much great stuff to work with. You know, people who work at Lyft love working at Lyft. Our legal department you might think, Gosh, legal department, why would a legal department, our legal department, I think the average tenure at Lyft is something like seven years in the legal department, right? So that\u2019s crazy because the problems are interesting and they\u2019ve kind of grown with the company and learned a lot and so on and so forth. So you can really, but of course you can also get some quirks where the company starts to really resemble its founders and starts to have the same blind spot as its founders. Look, I\u2019ve seen this from both directions. I saw it at Worldreader. I left Worldreader, you know, to take this. And now my number two, Rebecca [Chandler Leege] is running the company. There are all kinds of things that it\u2019s doing as an organization that I couldn\u2019t have gotten it to do because I have my own blind spots and now vice versa with John [Zimmer] and Logan [Green], the founders of Lyft. they have been so incredibly gracious. They\u2019ve really handed me the keys to this, to their baby. That doesn\u2019t make sense. But anyway, changing the diapers of their car. Anyway, the point is that they\u2019ve been absolute exemplary in saying look, David, our contribution is we built this thing and now you\u2019re going to run it and take it to levels that we absolutely couldn\u2019t. And what that does for me is it gives me an enormous amount of freedom to come in and say, you know what, as great as that has been, it\u2019s time to make some changes. But also, let\u2019s build and stand on the shoulders of what they\u2019ve done. Murray: Our listeners would never forgive us if we didn\u2019t ask you about the EBITDA mistake because it was such a fascinating moment. It was a misplaced zero in a press release that caused the stock to soar, came back down. You now have class action lawsuit. What did you learn from that? Did you learn anything? Was there? Were there any\u2026 Risher: Oh, yeah, we learned a lot. Yeah. I mean, the first thing I have to say and I\u2019ve said this before, I\u2019ll say it again. That\u2019s on me. That\u2019s on me. And I want people really to understand that when you\u2019re the leader of the organization, someone makes a mistake, it\u2019s your problem. And so now I will also say, Man, did our team hustle? And what happened? What happened? It literally was an extra zero that got inserted into an early version of the press release and it just rolled forward. And this despite, literally no exaggeration, hundreds of peoples\u2019 eyes, including my own, seeing it over and over again. But what happened? It was in a forecast piece which gets a little less scrutiny than the backwards looking stuff, the basis point versus percentage that I mean, they\u2019re very, very different words. But unfortunately, of course, they mean something very, very different. And so and we literally found it in real time as we were reading out the sort of earnings report. And we changed it within two minutes, I think. And all of a sudden, our legal team again and actually our policy team jumped into action. So very, very quick response. Absolutely fantastic. And I certainly learned how fast a team can work when it is under that kind of pressure. Now, what have we also learned? Well, we\u2019ve learned that even though we have really exactly the same process that every other public company has, all sorts of eyes [hard to hear], it wasn\u2019t sufficient. It wasn\u2019t sufficient. So what are we doing? We actually now have a process. We\u2019re just about to go through this as our next earnings come out, where we take all of our materials, we now give them to an outside third party we\u2019ve hired to do exactly this. And what they do is without having any other context, they look not just and sort of double check the numbers, but they try to build the model that our press release and earnings statement is suggesting they build. And then look at what that model results in. And then we compare that back to our internal models and if those models vary by anything that\u2019s significant, we know there was a problem along the way. So it\u2019s a new process. It\u2019s one again, we got so much feedback from other investor relations and CFOs and so forth saying, You know, there but for the grace of God, go I. In other words, you know, you know these mistakes, it\u2019s a one in a million sort of thing, but it happens. We\u2019ve got a tighter process now. Lev-Ram: It\u2019s interesting because your part of your response to this was not only owning it, but also talking about it, whereas a lot of other companies, a lot of other leaders would have tried to step back from it once it\u2019s fixed. What guided that approach for you? Risher: That\u2019s a good question. I don\u2019t think I\u2019ve been asked that question before. You know, I think a big part of it, if you don\u2019t mind, maybe I\u2019ll get a little personal in this. What I was about to say was, and again, in my Worldreader, in my nonprofit space, if you\u2019re talking about kids\u2019 education and you\u2019re talking to a minister of education, there\u2019s no baloney. You have to you have to be very straightforward with them. But if I\u2019m really thinking about this, I had a very, very unpleasant argument with my father when I was a teenager. Very, very, very unpleasant. And the root of it, as I look back at it, was I was not straightforward with him in the way that he wanted me to be. And while he was angry at the behavior that had led to this, what he was really angry about, you know, such that I remember it very clearly many years later, was the fact that I wasn\u2019t being straightforward. And I really took that to heart. Now, I don\u2019t want to say I\u2019m a perfect person, but I will say that if it comes to be clear and transparent and straightforward versus not, I will. Murray: Yeah, no, that\u2019s really interesting. I accused you earlier of having an Amazonian mindset, but that\u2019s a little bit non Amazonian and non Microsoft, that commitment to transparency. Risher: I think I don\u2019t want to compare it to that, but I will say it\u2019s something that I feel very strongly about. And I\u2019ll say maybe one last thing. Since you now opened this interesting, you know, Pandora\u2019s box. You know, we do surveys of our employees every quarter, employee sentiment surveys, right? And they\u2019ll ask questions like, how confident are you in the leadership of this company, as an example? And one of the things that\u2019s really been gratifying to me is to see how those results have changed since I started, when, let\u2019s say those percentages might have been in the forties and now they\u2019re in the seventies. And by the way, the percentage of people who even answer the survey is now up to 85%, which is really quite high for a survey of this type. And a lot of the, we call them verbatims inside, a lot of the comments come down to you guys are saying what\u2019s what we\u2019re going to do, you\u2019re executing on it, you\u2019re owning mistakes. Like that kind of transparency is enormously powerful. Murray: So, David, our listeners may not know this, but I know that you came here on your bicycle today. Is this standard standard behavior? Do you travel a lot by bicycle? Risher: It is very standard behavior. I have bicycled to my office in San Francisco and back every single day. I have been in San Francisco since the day I started. It\u2019s actually not my bicycle, it\u2019s the Lyft bicycle. So Lyft operates the bicycle share systems in San Francisco, here in New York, in Denver, in Washington, D.C., in Boston, super important part of cities, infrastructure. To give you a sense in New York City in the summer, we facilitate on our the Citi bike system about 150,000 rides every single day. So very, very significant part of the city\u2019s infrastructure. It\u2019s also a great way to get out and about. And if you\u2019re particularly on an e-bike, you can do crazy things. You can go huge distances, not even break a sweat and you sort of feel like Superman. So, you know, I\u2019m a big believer that, you know, of course, I absolutely love my job. I literally jump out of bed every single morning. But you also have to have time to do other things in your life. And my 20-minute ride to hear from my hotel this morning, my 20-minute ride to my, which I did with my chief of staff by the way. I said, Hey, let\u2019s go for a ride, and we did it together. We kind of told stories along the way. Such an important way to sort of stay connected to the outside world. Murray: Wow. Any other sanity hacks you\u2026? Risher: You know, every Saturday morning I spend about a half an hour writing some reflections on the prior week. And I always look at how has work gone, how is my family doing, my wife and my daughters and my brothers and so forth. How are the relationships I have with my friends and how am I investing in those? How is my health, by which I include, you know, I go to the gym, my bicycle and so forth, and I sort of look at every one of those dimensions. And if they\u2019re all going well, then, you know, things are good. If one of them isn\u2019t sort of on track, then I think to myself, what do I need to do or what can I learn from that? So I find if I look at all four of those things pretty regularly and kind of sort of take the pulse, I stay on track. Murray: I think I said, I have a last question several questions ago, but I do have the last question, which is I heard you say that you got a Taylor Swift bump last year. Risher: We did, yeah. Several bumps every time she goes to a city. Murray: But then even more interesting than the bump was what came out often when I heard you say it, it was kind of a throwaway line, but is that Taylor Swift customers tip significantly better than other customers. So tell us about that. Risher: It is so interesting to see this. Look, again, Lyft\u2019s purpose is to bring people together. And so when we do things like a venue partnership, where we try to pick people up quickly, you know, after a big concert, whatever, it\u2019s so important because it gives people a better experience. But as a side thing, we also get to see all of these really interesting behaviors. And what you said is absolutely right. Taylor Swift rides, you know, so I\u2019m not necessarily talking about the rider, six months later that we haven\u2019t looked at. But I will tell you, if you\u2019re going to or from a Taylor Swift concert, you are much more likely to be a good tipper. And I\u2019ll give you actually a little side anecdote on this. This also applies. And here\u2019s a fun fact, if you\u2019re going to an ice cream store in a Lyft, you will typically tip 20 to 30% higher than average. If you are leaving an ice cream store, you will tip 40 to 50% higher than average. So it\u2019s really interesting. People\u2019s behaviors actually are quite dependent on the mood they\u2019re in. And, you know, if they\u2019re singing, you know, a Taylor Swift song, I guarantee you they\u2019re in a pretty good mood and they\u2019re more generous with their driver. Murray: Wow. David Risher, what a great conversation. This is one of my last Leadership Next podcasts but one of the best. It\u2019s so much fun. Risher: That\u2019s very kind. Lev-Ram: Thank you, David. Thank you. Great conversation. Risher: Oh, I really appreciate you guys. Thanks for the very thoughtful questions and our huge congratulations for whatever it is you\u2019re going to do next. I know you can\u2019t say it, but I\u2019m excited to\u2026 Murray: I\u2019ll tell you soon enough. Okay. Thanks a lot. Risher: For sure. Murray: Leadership Next is edited by Nicole Vergalla.

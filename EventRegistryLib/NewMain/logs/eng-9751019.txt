The Games officially kick off with a lavish and high-security opening ceremony on the River Seine on Friday.\n\nParis prosecutors said Wednesday that they had arrested a 40-year-old Russian man Tuesday at his Paris apartment on suspicion of planning to \"destabilize the Olympic Games.\"\n\nHe was charged with \"conducting intelligence work on behest of a foreign power\" with an aim to \"provoke hostilities in France,\" crimes punishable with 30-year sentence in France, according to a statement from the Paris prosecutor's office.\n\nDuring an official search of the suspect's home in Paris, police agents found items that \"raised fears of his intention to organize events likely to lead to destabilization of the Olympic Games,\" prosecutors said.\n\nThe Russian Embassy in Paris said it had not received any notification from French authorities about the arrest and has asked French officials for an explanation after seeing reports about it. It did not comment further.\n\nThe Games' organizers are facing major security challenges, including cyberattack concerns, amid high international tensions because of the Russia's war in Ukraine and the Israel-Hamas conflict in Gaza.\n\nThere are also elaborate disinformation campaigns orchestrated out of Russia, targeting the Olympics and France's recent elections, according to French officials and cybersecurity experts in Europe and the United States.\n\nIn an example this week, French intelligence found that a video on social media supposedly showing a Hamas threat against the Olympics was fake, generated by AI and appeared to have links to Russia, according to a French security official. The official was not authorized to be publicly named discussing intelligence matters.\n\nA Hamas official on Telegram also denied the militant group was behind the video.\n\nEarlier Wednesday in a separate plot, Interior Minister G\u00e9rald Darmanin said in an interview with French broadcaster BFMTV that a young man was arrested in Gironde, a region in southwest France, on suspicion of \"planning a violent action against the Olympic Games.\"\n\nPolice arrested the 18-year-old man Tuesday on accusations that he was planning to target the \"organization of the Games,\" Darmanin said.\n\nHe did not give details on the suspect's potential targets or whether they were in Paris or in other French cities hosting Olympic events that run through Aug. 11.\n\n\"We are still working on this case ... (we) avoid giving details ... but we think there is a link,\" Darmanin said. \"It's been established that this person wanted to attack the Olympic Games.\"\n\nParis has deployed 35,000 police officers each day for the Olympics, with a peak of 45,000 for the opening ceremony. In addition, 10,000 soldiers are taking part in security operations in the Paris region.\n\nA 10,000-strong military force is patrolling streets and sites in the Paris region and carrying out other security missions.\n\nFrance also is getting help from more than 40 countries that together have sent at least 1,900 police reinforcements.\n\nFollow AP's Paris Olympics coverage at

Instead, dozens of boats will carry thousands of athletes and performers on a 6km (3.7 mile) floating parade down the Seine, showcasing the beauty and history of the French capital.\n\nMore than 300,000 people are expected to line both banks of the river to watch the ceremony - along with 45,000 police, including members of France's elite special intervention forces trained in counterterrorism.\n\nSnipers will be deployed on the top of buildings along the route and an anti-drone system will be in place.\n\n\"There's a balance to be found between top security, which is absolutely the priority,\" Tony Estanguet, president of the Paris 2024 organising committee, told a press conference on Sunday.\n\n\"It's part of the objective to guarantee the security and to propose a fantastic celebration of the Games... But to have this kind of unique celebration, you also need to have a very, very strong security plan. And that's the case.\"\n\nThe ceremony, which will start at 7.30pm on Friday night local time (5.30am Saturday NZT), will be \"a large fresco\" celebrating Paris, France and the Games and will interweave the traditional parade by athletes with artistic performances and elements of protocol, said Thomas Jolly, the artistic director of the opening ceremony.\n\nWith wars in Gaza and Ukraine, and security concerns at home, France is already at its highest level of security. The crowds set to descend on Paris will be in marked contrast to the atmosphere of the last Summer Olympics in Tokyo in 2021 which played to empty arenas, and a year later than scheduled, due to the Covid-19 pandemic.\n\nFrench officials have said there are no specific terrorism threats for the ceremony that will launch the Games in Paris, which run until Aug. 11.\n\nHowever, should specific concerns arise, there are backup plans, that would either see the ceremony restricted to the Trocadero square near the Eiffel tower, or switched to the Stade de France stadium.\n\nFrench security services rejected more than 4,000 applications for Paris 2024 Olympics accreditations, including over espionage and cyberattack concerns, the country's caretaker interior minister said on Sunday.\n\nGerald Darmanin said French authorities have so far checked close to one million accreditation requests for the Games that kick off on 26 July and had rejected 4340 people, some over radical Islamist connections or suspicion of being foreign spies.\n\nClose to one hundred were rejected over espionage fears or concerns they were agents trying to get an accreditation using a different profession.\n\n\"They are probably not there to carry out attacks. But in addition to intelligence and traditional espionage, there is the possibility of accessing entry points into computer networks to carry out a cyberattack,\" Darmanin told the weekly Journal du Dimanche.\n\nHe said they had applied as journalists or technical staff and their countries of origin were Russia and Belarus, among others, which he did not name.\n\n\"For example, we refused a large number of 'journalists' who claimed to cover the Games. On the other hand, we accepted the presence of Russians who work for the International Olympic Committee (IOC). We apply the precautionary principle,\" he said.\n\nRussian journalists have been allowed to get accredited for the Games and have already arrived in the French capital.\n\nParis will be deploying 45,000 security personnel to guarantee the safety of the Games and its unique opening ceremony along the river Seine where athletes will float on barges past hundreds of thousands of spectators.\n\nOrganisers have reduced the initial number of spectators from 600,000 to around 300,000.\n\n\"To our knowledge, we have no known threat to the security of the Olympic Games,\" Darmanin said.\n\n\"In the past days I did a new reconnaissance by boat on the Seine with the police. I confirm that the ceremony will take place in the format announced by the President of the Republic.\"\n\n\"Apart from the flow of the river and the low risk of bad weather, there is - to date - no identified threat to the Games. Neither our intelligence services nor the foreign services with which we coordinate have detected any foreign threat. But you have to stay very humble and focused.\"", "source": {"uri": "rnz.co.nz", "dataType": "news", "title": "RNZ"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

Photograph: Gonzalo Fuentes / Reuters\n\nAs Paris makes final preparations for the Summer Olympics, the grand opening ceremony along the river Seine on Friday has created an unprecedented security challenge that organisers hope won't dampen the party vibe.\n\nFor the first time, a Games opening ceremony will not take place in a stadium. Instead, dozens of boats will carry thousands of athletes and performers on a 6-km (3.7-mile) floating parade down the Seine, showcasing the beauty and history of the French capital.\n\nMore than 300,000 people are expected to line both banks of the river to watch the ceremony - along with 45,000 police, including members of France's elite special intervention forces trained in counter-terrorism.\n\nSnipers will be deployed on the top of buildings along the route and an anti-drone system will be in place.\n\n\"There's a balance to be found between top security, which is absolutely the priority,\" Tony Estanguet, president of the Paris 2024 organising committee, told a press conference on Sunday.\n\n\"It's part of the objective to guarantee the security and to propose a fantastic celebration of the Games... But to have this kind of unique celebration, you also need to have a very, very strong security plan. And that's the case.\"\n\nHowever, should specific concerns arise, there are backup plans, that would either see the ceremony restricted to the Trocadero square near the Eiffel tower, or switched to the Stade de France stadium.\n\nFrance rejects multiple Paris Games accreditation requests over security fears\n\nFrench security services rejected more than 4,000 applications for Paris 2024 Olympics accreditation, including over espionage and cyberattack concerns, the country's caretaker interior minister said on Sunday.\n\nGerald Darmanin said French authorities have so far checked close to one million accreditation requests for the Games that kick off on July 26 and had rejected 4,340 people, some over radical Islamist connections or suspicion of being foreign spies.\n\nClose to one hundred were rejected over espionage fears or concerns they were agents trying to get an accreditation using a different profession.\n\n\"They are probably not there to carry out attacks. But in addition to intelligence and traditional espionage, there is the possibility of accessing entry points into computer networks to carry out a cyberattack,\" Darmanin told the weekly Journal du Dimanche.\n\nHe said they had applied as journalists or technical staff and their countries of origin were Russia and Belarus, among others, which he did not name.\n\n\"For example, we refused a large number of 'journalists' who claimed to cover the Games. On the other hand, we accepted the presence of Russians who work for the International Olympic Committee (IOC). We apply the precautionary principle,\" he said.\n\nRussian journalists have been allowed to get accredited for the Games and have already arrived in the French capital.\n\nParis will be deploying 45,000 security personnel to guarantee the safety of the Games and its unique opening ceremony along the river Seine where athletes will float on barges past hundreds of thousands of spectators.\n\nOrganisers have reduced the initial number of spectators from 600,000 to around 300,000.\n\n\"To our knowledge, we have no known threat to the security of the Olympic Games,\" Darmanin said.", "source": {"uri": "rediff.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Rediff.com India Ltd."}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paris", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/France", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "France"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Olympic_Games_ceremony", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Olympic Games ceremony"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seine", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Seine"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Counterterrorism", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Counterterrorism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swimming_pool", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Swimming pool"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Summer_Olympic_Games", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Summer Olympic Games"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sniper", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Sniper"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Police_officer", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Police officer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Espionage", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Espionage"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interior_minister", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Interior minister"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyberattack", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Cyberattack"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/G\u00e9rald_Darmanin", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "G\u00e9rald Darmanin"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trocad\u00e9ro", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Trocad\u00e9ro"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tony_Estanguet", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Tony Estanguet"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gestapo", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Gestapo"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stade_de_France", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Stade de France"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eiffel_Tower", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Eiffel Tower"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Islamic_extremism", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Islamic extremism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Precautionary_principle", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Precautionary principle"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russians", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Russians"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_network", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Computer network"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Olympic_Committee", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "International Olympic Committee"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reuters", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Reuters"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Olympic_Games", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Olympic Games"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russia", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Russia"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Russia"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Belarus", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Belarus"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Belarus"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Games", "label": "dmoz/Games", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Board_Games/War_and_Politics", "label": "dmoz/Games/Board Games/War and Politics", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Online", "label": "dmoz/Games/Online", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Party_Games", "label": "dmoz/Games/Party Games", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 68}], "image": "https://im.rediff.com/sports/2024/jul/21paris.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9751019", "eventUri": "eng-9751019", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-07-26", "textStart": 1991, "textEnd": 1998}], "sentiment": 0.4039215686274509, "wgt": 195, "relevance": 1}

(we) avoid giving details ... but we think there is a link,\" Darmanin said. \"It's been established that this person wanted to attack the Olympic Games.\"\n\nParis has deployed 35,000 police officers each day for the Olympics, with a peak of 45,000 for the opening ceremony. In addition, 10,000 soldiers are taking part in security operations in the Paris region.\n\nA 10,000-strong military force is patrolling streets and sites in the Paris region and carrying out other security missions.\n\nFrance also is getting help from more than 40 countries that together have sent at least 1,900 police reinforcements.\n\n___\n\nFollow AP's Paris Olympics coverage at https://apnews.com/hub/2024-paris-olympic-games\n\nCopyright 2024 The Associated Press.

However, along with traditional espionage there is also the risk of someone accessing computer networks and commit cyber attacks,\" said the minister, answering the question as to what the possible spies wanted to do in France.\n\nAlthough a large number of Russian \"journalists\" were denied entry, French authorities \"still permitted the presence of Russians working in the International Olympic Committee,\" said Darmanin.", "source": {"uri": "bnn-news.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Baltic News Network - News from Latvia, Lithuania, Estonia"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/France", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "France"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Olympic_Games", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Olympic Games"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physical_therapy", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Physical therapy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_security", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Computer security"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Espionage", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Espionage"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russia", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Russia"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Russia"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Belarus", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Belarus"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Belarus"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/G\u00e9rald_Darmanin", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "G\u00e9rald Darmanin"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyberattack", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Cyberattack"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russians", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Russians"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_network", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Computer network"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Olympic_Committee", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "International Olympic Committee"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Disabled/Mentally_Challenged", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Disabled/Mentally Challenged", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://bnn-news.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/binoculars-2421967_1280-696x522-1.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9751019", "eventUri": "eng-9751019", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.1372549019607843, "wgt": 168, "relevance": 1}

AP's earlier story follows below. PARIS (AP) - French security authorities have thwarted a plot against the Paris Olympics, the country's interior minister said Wednesday, two days before the official start of the Summer Games. France has been on high alert over the past few weeks as preparations to host the 2024 Olympics hit the final stretch. The Games officially kick off with a lavish and high-security opening ceremony on the River Seine on Friday. The Games' organizers face security challenges, including cyberattack concerns, amid high international tensions because of the Russia's war in Ukraine and the Israel-Hamas conflict in Gaza. There are also elaborate disinformation campaigns orchestrated out of Russia, targeting the Olympics and France's recent elections, according to French officials and cybersecurity experts in Europe and the United States. Interior Minister G\u00e9rald Darmanin said in an interview Wednesday with French broadcaster BFMTV that a young man was arrested in Gironde, a region in the southwest of France, on suspicion of \"planning a violent action against the Olympic Games.\"\u009d Police arrested an 18-year-old man Tuesday on accusations that he was planning to target the \"organization of the Games,\"\u009d Darmanin said. He did not give details on the suspect's potential targets or whether they were in Paris or in other French cities hosting Olympic events that run through Aug. 11. \"We are still working on this case ... (we) avoid giving details ... but we think there is a link,\" Darmanin said. \"It's been established that this person wanted to attack the Olympic Games.\" Paris has deployed 35,000 police officers each day for the Olympics, with a peak of 45,000 for the opening ceremony. In addition, 10,000 soldiers are taking part in security operations in the Paris region. A 10,000-strong military force is patrolling streets and sites in the Paris region and carrying out other security missions. France also is getting help from more than 40 countries that together have sent at least 1,900 police reinforcements. ___ Follow AP's Paris Olympics coverage at", "source": {"uri": "medicinehatnews.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Medicine Hat News"}, "authors": [{"uri": "canadian_press@medicinehatnews.com", "name": "Canadian Press", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interior_minister", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Interior minister"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paris", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/France", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "France"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Olympic_Games", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Olympic Games"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russia", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Russia"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Russia"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Law_enforcement", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Law enforcement"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Summer_Olympic_Games", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Summer Olympic Games"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euro", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Euro"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russian_invasion_of_Ukraine", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Russian invasion of Ukraine"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyberattack", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Cyberattack"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Olympic_Games_ceremony", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Olympic Games ceremony"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seine", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Seine"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/G\u00e9rald_Darmanin", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "G\u00e9rald Darmanin"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/\u00cele-de-France", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "\u00cele-de-France"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "\u00cele-de-France"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disinformation", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Disinformation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BFM_TV", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "BFM TV"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Associated_Press", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Associated Press"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Olympic_sports", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Olympic sports"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Europe", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Europe"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gironde", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Gironde"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Gironde"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gaza_Strip", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Gaza Strip"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Gaza Strip"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Palestine"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Disabled/Mentally_Challenged", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Disabled/Mentally Challenged", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Olympics", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Olympics", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 59}], "image": "https://medicinehatnews.com/wp-content/uploads/cp/20240723070732-669f94b423675952f6c923ecjpeg.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9751019", "eventUri": "eng-9751019", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-08-11", "textStart": 2670, "textEnd": 2677}], "sentiment": -0.1764705882352942, "wgt": 165, "relevance": 1}

Organizers say everyone will be safe", "body": "The Opening Ceremony will be held alongside the banks of the River Seine.\n\n(CNN) -- Millions of visitors and thousands of athletes will flock to Paris for the Summer Olympic Games, but the great unknown for organizers is the potential risk of protests, terrorism and cyber attacks.\n\nThe Olympics have been a target for attacks in the past, notably the 1972 Munich Games where 11 Israeli athletes and coaches were killed by members of the Palestinian terrorist group Black September. Then in 1996, a bomb blast killed one woman and injured more than 100 people at the Atlanta Games.\n\nFrance plans to deploy around 35,000 police each day during the Games, peaking at 45,000 for the Opening Ceremony, a spokesperson at the French interior ministry told CNN.\n\nIn addition, 10,000 soldiers will be deployed in the Paris region - an effort supported by 1,800 police officers from around the world, they added.\n\nFrance will also deploy 20,000 private security personnel, Reuters reported.\n\nOpening Ceremony like no-other\n\nThe Opening Ceremony of the Paris Olympics is set to take place on July 26 and will be the first ever held on a river.\n\nSome 104,000 people in stands lining the River Seine will watch the event, with 220,000 more on raised roadways along a six-kilometer (nearly four miles) stretch of the river, according to French Interior Minister G\u00e9rald Darmanin.\n\nFor years, French officials had boasted that some 600,000 people would attend the Opening Ceremony, but that number has been slashed due to safety concerns.\n\nEarlier this year, Darmanin said that an \"anti-terrorist security perimeter\" will be put in place in the days leading up to the event.\n\nNicolas Nordman, Deputy Paris Mayor in charge of security, told CNN that authorities had been working for months to try to anticipate what might happen and were confident the ceremony would be safe.\n\nHe said a \"strictly controlled\" zone alongside the banks of the river will be closed off before the Opening Ceremony and anyone entering into it would be checked.\n\nThat security perimeter came into effect last Thursday, with people living, working and visiting places inside the restricted zone required to carry a pass to enter. Individuals had to apply for an access pass prior to Thursday.\n\n\"These controls must ensure that no ill-intentioned people enter the area. There is also the need for controls on the day of the ceremony,\" said Nordman.\n\n\"This means that when people come to the site, we have to make sure that there are no security risks.\"\n\nHowever, Nordman says he recognizes the need for Parisians to get on with their lives.\n\n\"What we want is for people to enjoy the Olympic Games. One of the conditions for them to enjoy them is to be safe,\" he added. \"But we also want them to be able to move around in order to enjoy them.\"\n\nWorldwide unrest\n\nParis has experienced terrorist attacks in the past, notably in 2015, when gunmen armed with assault rifles and explosives targeted six locations across the French capital, killing 130 people and wounding 494.\n\nThree explosions occurred outside the Stade de France in Saint-Denis, a suburb north of Paris, killing a pedestrian. The Stade de France is where track and field events and Rugby Sevens matches will take place at the Paris Olympics.\n\nDale Buckner, CEO of the security firm Global Guardian which has provided advice for those traveling to France for the Games, told CNN the country has \"a lot of enemies\" due to its stance on a wide range of international and domestic issues.\n\n\"Because of their status in the world and because of the cultural blending of religion and populations of people from around the world as an open democracy, there's going to be detractors and supporters, which creates friction,\" Buckner said.\n\nThere is also growing domestic unrest, powered in part by the recent French elections which saw a battle between the left and far-right.\n\nTo underline the threat to France, Interior Minister Darmanin confirmed security forces had detained a \"member of the extreme-right\" this week who was \"suspected of wanting to commit violent action during the Olympic Games.\"\n\nAccording to Darmanin, the man had an \"intention to intervene during a phase of the torch relay.\"\n\nDarmanin said France has banned nearly 4,000 people from attending events tied to the Games.\n\nThat group includes members of the extreme left and the extreme right, radical Islamists and suspected radical Islamists, he said.\n\nAuthorities are also \"paying particular attention to Russian and Belarusian citizens,\" Darmanin added.\n\nOrganizers, though, said they are fully confident in their ability to prevent attacks of any kind and will lean on AI-driven video analysis to keep the events safe.\n\n\"We try to anticipate all situations. We have carried out exercises. There have been many drills, numerous simulations of crises, events that are sometimes quite extraordinary, where everyone, for a whole day, tries to anticipate and then respond,\" Nordman added.\n\n\"We've done a lot of exercises, some of them extremely complicated. Today, we're ready and we're calm. We know that we have put in place everything we could to ensure safety, which is a key objective for us.\"\n\nSecurity in Paris will be bolstered by the presence of the military, which will be supporting the police throughout the Games, patrolling streets and providing backup in the form of dog teams and anti-drone expertise, according to General Eric Chasboeuf, second in command of the military mission for the Games.\n\nHe told CNN that a base has been set up inside Paris, on a scale not seen since World War II.\n\n\"I've never seen such a huge and massive security deployment in our capital, even since the tragic terrorist attempt that we suffered from in 2015,\" Chasboeuf said. \"It will be completely secure.\"\n\nInvisible threat\n\nAccording to Buckner, one of the biggest threats to France's bid to host a safe Olympics could come from an invisible source - cyberattacks - with the country's electric, communication or transportation grids potentially at risk.\n\n\"We have an offensive strategy, and we have a defensive strategy that are being executed every second of every day simultaneously. Because if we don't ... you will see cyber disruption,\" Buckner said.\n\n\"The big change for this Olympics is that I think that there is a cyber war going on every second of every day. The cyber war is going to go all the way through the Olympics.\"\n\nThe-CNN-Wire\n\n\u2122 & \u00a9 2024 Cable News Network, Inc., a Warner Bros. Discovery Company.

One of the conditions for them to enjoy them is to be safe,\" he added. \"But we also want them to be able to move around in order to enjoy them.\"\n\nWorldwide unrest\n\nParis has experienced terrorist attacks in the past, notably in 2015, when gunmen armed with assault rifles and explosives targeted six locations across the French capital, killing 130 people and wounding 494.\n\nThree explosions occurred outside the Stade de France in Saint-Denis, a suburb north of Paris, killing a pedestrian. The Stade de France is where track and field events and Rugby Sevens matches will take place at the Paris Olympics.\n\nDale Buckner, CEO of the security firm Global Guardian which has provided advice for those traveling to France for the Games, told CNN the country has \"a lot of enemies\" due to its stance on a wide range of international and domestic issues.\n\n\"Because of their status in the world and because of the cultural blending of religion and populations of people from around the world as an open democracy, there's going to be detractors and supporters, which creates friction,\" Buckner said.\n\nThere is also growing domestic unrest, powered in part by the recent French elections which saw a battle between the left and far-right.\n\nTo underline the threat to France, Interior Minister Darmanin confirmed security forces had detained a \"member of the extreme-right\" this week who was \"suspected of wanting to commit violent action during the Olympic Games.\"\n\nAccording to Darmanin, the man had an \"intention to intervene during a phase of the torch relay.\"\n\nDarmanin said France has banned nearly 4,000 people from attending events tied to the Games.\n\nThat group includes members of the extreme left and the extreme right, radical Islamists and suspected radical Islamists, he said.\n\nAuthorities are also \"paying particular attention to Russian and Belarusian citizens,\" Darmanin added.\n\nOrganizers, though, said they are fully confident in their ability to prevent attacks of any kind and will lean on AI-driven video analysis to keep the events safe.\n\n\"We try to anticipate all situations. We have carried out exercises. There have been many drills, numerous simulations of crises, events that are sometimes quite extraordinary, where everyone, for a whole day, tries to anticipate and then respond,\" Nordman added.\n\n\"We've done a lot of exercises, some of them extremely complicated. Today, we're ready and we're calm. We know that we have put in place everything we could to ensure safety, which is a key objective for us.\"\n\nSecurity in Paris will be bolstered by the presence of the military, which will be supporting the police throughout the Games, patrolling streets and providing backup in the form of dog teams and anti-drone expertise, according to General Eric Chasboeuf, second in command of the military mission for the Games.\n\nSoldiers leave for a patrol at the military camp set up on the outskirts of Paris.\n\nThomas Padilla/AP\n\nHe told CNN that a base has been set up inside Paris, on a scale not seen since World War II.\n\n\"I've never seen such a huge and massive security deployment in our capital, even since the tragic terrorist attempt that we suffered from in 2015,\" Chasboeuf said. \"It will be completely secure.\"\n\nInvisible threat\n\nAccording to Buckner, one of the biggest threats to France's bid to host a safe Olympics could come from an invisible source - cyberattacks - with the country's electric, communication or transportation grids potentially at risk.\n\n\"We have an offensive strategy, and we have a defensive strategy that are being executed every second of every day simultaneously. Because if we don't ... you will see cyber disruption,\" Buckner said.\n\n\"The big change for this Olympics is that I think that there is a cyber war going on every second of every day. The cyber war is going to go all the way through the Olympics.\"\n\nCNN's Maeva Labbe-Maalouf, Joseph Ataman and Saskya Vandoorne contributed reporting.", "source": {"uri": "cnn.com", "dataType":

The man is suspected of engaging in \"espionage on behalf of a foreign state with the intent to incite hostilities in France\" . According to the Le Parisien newspaper, the Russian has been formally charged.\n\nDuring a search of the suspect's apartment, authorities found \"evidence suggesting he was preparing a pro-Russian operation designed to destabilize France during the Olympic Games\", an insider connected to the investigation told = the press. Another source indicated that the plot might have been a \"large-scale project\" with potentially \"serious\" consequences.\n\nThe investigation is being conducted by France's Directorate General of Internal Security (DGSI), a counterespionage agency, rather than a counterterrorism one, according to Le Parisien. If convicted, the man faces up to 30 years in prison.\n\nOn June 5, authorities announced the arrest near Charles de Gaulle Airport of a Donbas native with dual Russian and Ukrainian citizenship. The 26-year-old man was hospitalized with severe facial burns following the explosion of a homemade bomb he was assembling. Searches of his hotel room uncovered several explosive devices, raw materials for their manufacture, cash, fake passports, and firearms.\n\nPreliminary data suggest the suspect attempted to create multiple explosive devices to target French military equipment intended for shipment to Ukraine. The investigation is being carried out jointly by the DGSI and France's National Antiterrorism Prosecution Office.\n\nMeanwhile, French authorities have denied access to dozens of foreigners, fearing espionage during the Olympics. The ban affects around 100 individuals from Russia, Belarus, and several other countries, as disclosed by Interior Minister G\u00e9rald Darmanin on July 20 to the publication Le Journal du Dimanche.\n\nDarmanin clarified that these individuals had intended to attend the 2024 Olympics posing as journalists, physiotherapists, or technical staff. \"They likely wouldn't be here to commit attacks. However, beyond espionage, there are concerns about access to network entry points for potential cyberattacks,\" Darmanin stated.\n\nOverall, Darmanin noted that among 960,000 files reviewed by intelligence agencies, 4,340 people were denied work or attendance at the 2024 Summer Games, including volunteers, stadium workers, and members of sports delegations. Suspected ties to terrorism, Islamist activities, right- and left-wing radicalism, and past convictions are among the reasons for these refusals.\n\nThe Summer Olympics in Paris are set to take place from July 26 to August 11.

Organizers say everyone will be safe - KION546", "body": "(CNN) -- Millions of visitors and thousands of athletes will flock to Paris for the Summer Olympic Games, but the great unknown for organizers is the potential risk of protests, terrorism and cyber attacks.\n\nThe Olympics have been a target for attacks in the past, notably the 1972 Munich Games where 11 Israeli athletes and coaches were killed by members of the Palestinian terrorist group Black September. Then in 1996, a bomb blast killed one woman and injured more than 100 people at the Atlanta Games.\n\nFrance plans to deploy around 35,000 police each day during the Games, peaking at 45,000 for the Opening Ceremony, a spokesperson at the French interior ministry told CNN.\n\nIn addition, 10,000 soldiers will be deployed in the Paris region - an effort supported by 1,800 police officers from around the world, they added.\n\nFrance will also deploy 20,000 private security personnel, Reuters reported.\n\nThe Opening Ceremony of the Paris Olympics is set to take place on July 26 and will be the first ever held on a river.\n\nSome 104,000 people in stands lining the River Seine will watch the event, with 220,000 more on raised roadways along a six-kilometer (nearly four miles) stretch of the river, according to French Interior Minister G\u00e9rald Darmanin.\n\nFor years, French officials had boasted that some 600,000 people would attend the Opening Ceremony, but that number has been slashed due to safety concerns.\n\nEarlier this year, Darmanin said that an \"anti-terrorist security perimeter\" will be put in place in the days leading up to the event.\n\nNicolas Nordman, Deputy Paris Mayor in charge of security, told CNN that authorities had been working for months to try to anticipate what might happen and were confident the ceremony would be safe.\n\nHe said a \"strictly controlled\" zone alongside the banks of the river will be closed off before the Opening Ceremony and anyone entering into it would be checked.\n\nThat security perimeter came into effect last Thursday, with people living, working and visiting places inside the restricted zone required to carry a pass to enter. Individuals had to apply for an access pass prior to Thursday.\n\n\"These controls must ensure that no ill-intentioned people enter the area. There is also the need for controls on the day of the ceremony,\" said Nordman.\n\n\"This means that when people come to the site, we have to make sure that there are no security risks.\"\n\nHowever, Nordman says he recognizes the need for Parisians to get on with their lives.\n\n\"What we want is for people to enjoy the Olympic Games. One of the conditions for them to enjoy them is to be safe,\" he added. \"But we also want them to be able to move around in order to enjoy them.\"\n\nParis has experienced terrorist attacks in the past, notably in 2015, when gunmen armed with assault rifles and explosives targeted six locations across the French capital, killing 130 people and wounding 494.\n\nThree explosions occurred outside the Stade de France in Saint-Denis, a suburb north of Paris, killing a pedestrian. The Stade de France is where track and field events and Rugby Sevens matches will take place at the Paris Olympics.\n\nDale Buckner, CEO of the security firm Global Guardian which has provided advice for those traveling to France for the Games, told CNN the country has \"a lot of enemies\" due to its stance on a wide range of international and domestic issues.\n\n\"Because of their status in the world and because of the cultural blending of religion and populations of people from around the world as an open democracy, there's going to be detractors and supporters, which creates friction,\" Buckner said.\n\nThere is also growing domestic unrest, powered in part by the recent French elections which saw a battle between the left and far-right.\n\nTo underline the threat to France, Interior Minister Darmanin confirmed security forces had detained a \"member of the extreme-right\" this week who was \"suspected of wanting to commit violent action during the Olympic Games.\"\n\nAccording to Darmanin, the man had an \"intention to intervene during a phase of the torch relay.\"\n\nDarmanin said France has banned nearly 4,000 people from attending events tied to the Games.\n\nThat group includes members of the extreme left and the extreme right, radical Islamists and suspected radical Islamists, he said.\n\nAuthorities are also \"paying particular attention to Russian and Belarusian citizens,\" Darmanin added.\n\nOrganizers, though, said they are fully confident in their ability to prevent attacks of any kind and will lean on AI-driven video analysis to keep the events safe.\n\n\"We try to anticipate all situations. We have carried out exercises. There have been many drills, numerous simulations of crises, events that are sometimes quite extraordinary, where everyone, for a whole day, tries to anticipate and then respond,\" Nordman added.\n\n\"We've done a lot of exercises, some of them extremely complicated. Today, we're ready and we're calm. We know that we have put in place everything we could to ensure safety, which is a key objective for us.\"\n\nSecurity in Paris will be bolstered by the presence of the military, which will be supporting the police throughout the Games, patrolling streets and providing backup in the form of dog teams and anti-drone expertise, according to General Eric Chasboeuf, second in command of the military mission for the Games.\n\nHe told CNN that a base has been set up inside Paris, on a scale not seen since World War II.\n\n\"I've never seen such a huge and massive security deployment in our capital, even since the tragic terrorist attempt that we suffered from in 2015,\" Chasboeuf said. \"It will be completely secure.\"\n\nAccording to Buckner, one of the biggest threats to France's bid to host a safe Olympics could come from an invisible source - cyberattacks - with the country's electric, communication or transportation grids potentially at risk.\n\n\"We have an offensive strategy, and we have a defensive strategy that are being executed every second of every day simultaneously. Because if we don't ... you will see cyber disruption,\" Buckner said.\n\n\"The big change for this Olympics is that I think that there is a cyber war going on every second of every day. The cyber war is going to go all the way through the Olympics.\"\n\nThe-CNN-Wire\n\n\u2122 & \u00a9 2024 Cable News Network, Inc., a Warner Bros. Discovery Company.

fears", "body": "PARIS - The arrest of a Russian man in Paris, reportedly a former reality-TV chef, over a suspected \"destabilisation\" plot targeting the Paris Olympics underscores French concerns that Moscow is looking to undermine the event from afar.\n\nThe man, born in 1984, was detained at his home in Paris this week and is suspected of \"passing intelligence to a foreign power in order to arouse hostilities in France,\" a statement from prosecutors said on July 23.\n\nLe Monde newspaper said police had found documents \"of diplomatic interest\" at his apartment and he was suspected of working for the Russian FSB intelligence service after appearances in reality TV shows and a stint as a chef in a French ski resort.\n\n\"We think very strongly that he was going to organise operations of destabilisation, interference, spying,\" Interior Minister Gerald Darmanin told BFM television on July 24.\n\n\"He's now in the justice system which will be able to confirm the suspicions of the police.\"\n\nMr Darmanin said that \"other Russian individuals\" had been arrested by the Paris police and that French authorities had noted a campaign of disinformation aimed at raising fears and discrediting the Paris Games, which start on July 26.\n\n\"We saw a video which purports to be someone from (Palestinian militant group) Hamas... who announces an attack in the next few days and comes because France is going to welcome Israeli athletes,\" he said.\n\n\"We're not sure, but it looks like it is fake and has been spread by pro-Kremlin and pro-Russian

French security services have thwarted four terrorist attacks targeting the Olympic games and their participants, French Interior Minister Gerald Darmanin said on the BFM TV channel.\n\n\"We are still working on it, so far without details, but indeed we think that it is related to plotting violent acts against the Olympic Games, and it is a symbol. This is the fourth case,\" the minister said, commenting on yesterday's detention of an 18-year old young man in the Gironde department.\n\nAccording to him, the French Interior Ministry confirmed that two terrorist attacks, that had previously been thwarted, were definitely aimed against the Olympic Games. Two more planned attacks are still being inspected, regarding in particular the suspect from Gironde, who, based on data from the National Anti-Terrorism Prosecutor's Office's (PNAT), could be a member of a terrorist group. In his posts on social media, he noted that he \"had intentions to commit criminal acts, especially during sports competitions.\" Another as yet unconfirmed case is the detention of a radical Islamist on July 19 who attacked a taxi driver near Le Mans in the commune of La Ferte-Bernard.\n\nLaw enforcement authorities are therefore prioritizing statements by public figures that could provoke lone-wolf terrorists to attack, Darmanin stated, commenting on the statement by Thomas Portes, a deputy from the left-wing La France Insoumise party. Portes stated that \"the Israeli delegation will not be welcome in Paris.\" Darmanin noted that the \"organized threat from the outside\" is still present.

three times as big as the London 2012 policing presence - has swung into action, with officers drafted in from 43 countries.\n\nBritish police make up a significant chunk of the 1,700 foreign officers called in to support a potential total of 45,000 French officers who can be called on over the next fortnight.", "source": {"uri": "ca.sports.yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo Sports Canada"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paris", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/France", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "France"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Olympic_Games", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Olympic Games"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_Directorate_for_Internal_Security", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "General Directorate for Internal Security"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Le_Parisien", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Le Parisien"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intelligence_agency", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Intelligence agency"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indictment", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Indictment"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russia", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Russia"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Russia"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Counterintelligence", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Counterintelligence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Olympic_Games_ceremony", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Olympic Games ceremony"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Olympic_Stadium", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Olympic Stadium"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sabotage", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Sabotage"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Terrorism", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Terrorism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interior_minister", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Interior minister"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyberattack", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Cyberattack"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/G\u00e9rald_Darmanin", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "G\u00e9rald Darmanin"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Detection_dog", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Detection dog"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Royal_Air_Force", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Royal Air Force"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_security", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "National security"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Government_of_the_United_Kingdom", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Government of the United Kingdom"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Espionage", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Espionage"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Police", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Police"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/London", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "London"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "London"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Kingdom", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Terrorism", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Terrorism", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Warfare_and_Conflict", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Warfare and Conflict", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Theft", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Theft", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Technology", "label": "news/Technology", "wgt": 49}], "image": "https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/yd5e5UAap0ds.QL_RCUD2A--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyMDA7aD03NTA7Y2Y9d2VicA--/https://media.zenfs.com/en/the_telegraph_818/da35e93b39a899a9dc0c3c56792bae56", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9751019", "eventUri": "eng-9751019", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.09019607843137256, "wgt": 118, "relevance": 1}

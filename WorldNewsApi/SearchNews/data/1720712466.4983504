{"id": 232055168, "title": "This couple came to the U.S. as refugees and started a restaurant. It\u2019s now a finalist for the culinary world\u2019s top prize", "text": "The culinary world\u2019s equivalent of the Oscars will recognize restaurants and chefs in 22 categories at a ceremony set for Monday in Chicago. The nominees cover a diverse range of cuisine and chef experience, a recent shift following turbulent, pandemic-era years for the James Beard Foundation. The most-anticipated categories include awards for outstanding restaurateur, chef and restaurant. Hamissi Mamba and Nadia Nijimbere, who fled Burundi about a decade ago and now own Baobab Fare in Detroit, are among five finalists in the outstanding restaurateur category. The couple faced a difficult road as refugees opening a business in the U.S. Their restaurant\u2019s menu features kuku, pan-fried chicken in a tangy mustard-onion sauce that\u2019s served with fried plantains, stewed yellow beans and coconut rice. \u201cWe inspire a lot of refugees \u2014 refugees who are coming to this country without hope and one day thinking that they can win this kind of title,\u201d Mamba said. \u201cIt\u2019s a big deal for us, because we want to show people that this world can be equal.\u201d The James Beard Foundation has bestowed awards since 1991, except in 2020 and 2021 when the organization scrapped them as the restaurant industry was reeling from the COVID-19 pandemic. The foundation was also facing criticism over a lack of racial diversity and allegations about some nominees\u2019 behavior. Foundation officials vowed to improve ethical standards and be more \u201creflective of the industry.\u201d Restaurants apply for the awards. Judges, who mostly remain anonymous, try the cuisine before voting. Nominees are reviewed for the food as well as for a behavioral \u201ccode of ethics,\u201d including how employees are treated. \u201cWe are looking at the whole plate,\u201d said Tanya Holland, chair of the awards committee. For restaurants, just being a finalist can bring wide recognition and boost business. Restaurant awards have become less common in recent years, giving the James Beard Awards even more weight, said Paul Freedman, a Yale University professor whose expertise includes food history. \u201cIt really calls attention to restaurants that might not be all that well known outside their region,\u201d he said. A Seattle family credited with bringing the first pho shop to the city in the 1980s is also a finalist for outstanding restaurateur with a trio of pho restaurants and their chicken and rice shop called The Boat. Yenvy Pham, whose parents opened their first restaurant after immigrating from Vietnam, calls a bowl of their pho, with its beefy bone broth and anise and clove aromatics, a \u201csure thing.\u201d They make the soup fresh every day over 24 hours. \u201cIt\u2019s wild,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s a great honor.\u201d The other restaurateur finalists are Chris Viaud with three restaurants in New Hampshire, Hollis Wells Silverman with the Eastern Point Collective that runs several Washington, D.C., restaurants, and Erika and Kelly Whitaker for restaurants in Boulder, Colorado. Some finalists are already lauded, including Michael Rafidi, whose Washington, D.C., restaurant Albi was awarded a coveted Michelin Star in 2022. He is among five finalists for outstanding chef. Albi, which is Arabic for \u201cmy heart,\u201d pays homage to Rafidi\u2019s Palestinian roots by using Old World food preparation techniques. Everything is cooked over charcoal, including grape leaves stuffed with lamb and sfeeha, a meat pie. \u201cThere\u2019s a mission for me to continue to spread light and cook Palestinian food,\u201d he said. Another finalist for outstanding chef is David Uygur, who runs a tiny Italian restaurant in Dallas. Lucia features fresh pasta made in house and a popular cured meat board. The menu changes seasonally. Uygur, whose father is Turkish, became interested in Italian food because of love. His high school sweetheart, now wife, loved Italian cuisine. He wanted his restaurant, with just nine tables, to feel intimate. \u201cI wanted the restaurant to feel like someone was coming to eat our house,\u201d he said. \u201cI wanted our guests in our home.\u201d Other outstanding chef finalists include Sarah Minnick for Lovely\u2019s Fifty Fifty in Portland, Oregon, Dean Neff of Seabird in Wilmington, North Carolina, and Renee Touponce for The Port of Call in Mystic, Connecticut.", "summary": "Hamissi Mamba and Nadia Nijimbere, who fled Burundi about a decade ago and now own Baobab Fare in Detroit.", "url": "https://fortune.com/2024/06/09/restaurant-success-refugee-immigrant-entrepreneurs-chefs-james-beard-award-finalists/", "image": "https://fortune.com/img-assets/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/AP24158527547532-e1717943569477.jpg", "video": null, "publish_date": "2024-06-09 14:45:20", "author": "Sophia Tareen,The Associated Press", "authors": ["Sophia Tareen", "The Associated Press"], "language": "en", "source_country": "US", "sentiment": 0.452}

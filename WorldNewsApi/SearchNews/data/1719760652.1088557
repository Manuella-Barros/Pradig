{"id": 225010910, "title": "The Mancunian Way: Before counterfeit street", "text": "Hello, We\u2019ve spoken at length about the transformation of Cheetham Hill over the last 18 months. Greater Manchester Police (GMP) launched Operation Vulcan in November 2022, aiming to rid what has become known as the counterfeit capital of Europe of its criminal activities. In recent months, the talking point has become what comes next for the area, which sits only a stone\u2019s throw away from some of Manchester city centre\u2019s most desirable areas. Soon enough, the area will be home to a 25-storey block of flats - and top council bosses say it will 'change significantly, with 'more modern buildings' to be unveiled. But today we\u2019re going to take a look backwards, at what Cheetham Hill used to look like in the days before \u2018counterfeit street\u2019. Fascinating images from the Manchester Libraries and Mirrorpix picture archives show the area around Bury New Road and Strangeways from a time gone by. It\u2019s also an interesting lesson in local history for those of us who may not have known the area before it earned its hooky reputation. The stretch has long been associated with textiles businesses, wholesalers and distributors, many of which can be seen in these archive images dug out by Lee Grimsditch. The pictures capture a Manchester of the past - but the streets are still recognisable today. Take a look here. Fresh start Customers and staff alike were left devastated after beloved family-run restaurant Hong Thai was forced to close following a fire at their Arndale unit six months ago. Announcing in January that they would be permanently closing their base at the shopping centre due to the extent of the damage caused, owner Lilly, whose real name is Lilia Tsang, said her 'heart was broken' over the decision and fans of their food were equally as distraught. But the popular eatery has found a new home opposite the Royal Mail plant on Oldham Road - and as Adam Maidment found out, they have not been forgotten. Their fresh, delicious food had firmly cemented its place in the Mancunian palette - so much so that one customer said he has been counting down the days until he can get his hands on their chicken satay skewers again. \u201cWe are very excited but we are also scared and a little bit worried because the location is different,\u201d Lilly told Adam when he popped in to see the new restaurant. \u201cWe\u2019ve been closed for six months and we have felt really, really down during that time. A lot of people helped us with suggestions for locations for where we could move to. \u201cSome people suggested that we open a food truck or a stall somewhere else but we decided we really wanted to have our own restaurant now.\u201d She says the team did think about stopping after the fire, but eventually decided to reopen in the new spot after support from the community.

It comes as the minority stakeholder conducts a full-scale review of the club, with the INEOS founder looking to implement cost-cutting measures. The Athletic has reported that Ratcliffe sent an email to all non-football staff and scouts asking if they wish to 'voluntarily resign' from their positions at United. It is believed that should staff choose to accept the offer, the scheme will be closer aligned to 'voluntary redundancy' which would see those exiting the club given a set monetary sum for departing. The cost-cutting measures were also reportedly in place at Saturday\u2019s FA Cup final tie against rivals Manchester City, when it was believed staff were asked to make a \u00a320 contribution if they wanted to attend.

General election chat We\u2019re just over a month out from the general election, and regardless of the votes, there will be change in Greater Manchester.

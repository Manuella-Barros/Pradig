When contacted, the restaurant owner claimed that he had allowed shooting in a portion of his restaurant free of cost on late Saturday evening.The entire parking space was occupied by the cars of Mr Chakraborty and his men.

The restaurant owner added that the actors men told him that hes an MLA and a very close friend of TMCs national general secretary Abhishek Banerjee.I said that I dont care even if he is Narendra Modis friend or Abhisheks. It was then when suddenly Mr Chakraborty came and punched me on my face and kicked me in my abdomen, Alam alleged.

I should have kept my cool and could have controlled my anger. I would like to apologise to the owner, the actor-turned MLA said. On Saturday evening, Chakraborty went to Techno City Police Station and demanded that the police get the CCTV footage of the parking lot where the problem began.My action last evening was the reaction to the problem which started at the parking lot. The footage that has been released or made viral is showing me attacking the owner. But why is not the footage of the parking lot not released? I will request the police to watch that also to understand how it started, he said.A senior officer of Bidhannagar Police Commissionerate said that the restaurant owner on Saturday lodged a complaint against the MLA and his security guards.

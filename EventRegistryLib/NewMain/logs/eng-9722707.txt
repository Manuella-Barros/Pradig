He won the last of his 40 caps for Wales during the 2023 Six Nations before announcing his international retirement ahead of the Rugby World Cup.\n\nAfter signing for Biarritz last year Webb tested positive for a growth hormone in July 2023 following a training session. He ended up playing only one game for his new club against Colomiers on the opening day of the season last August, before being handed a provisional suspension by the AFLD pending the result of a B sample, which also tested positive.\n\nA statement from the AFLD, according to French media, explains that Webb is prohibited from participating \"in a competition\" or \"any activity, including training, training or exhibitions\" or \"to exercise the functions of management staff or any administrative activity within a sports federation, a professional league\" which have been \"organised by an organisation that is a signatory to the World Anti-Doping Code or one of its members\".\n\nWebb played in two Test matches for the British and Irish Lions as a replacement on the 2017 tour of New Zealand, but missed out on the 2015 Rugby World Cup through injury and was ineligible for the 2019 tournament due to Wales' 60-cap rule for players based abroad, after Webb had signed for Toulon in France.\n\nHe spent the bulk of his playing career with Ospreys and briefly played for Bath. His time with Toulon ended controversially, departing before the end of his three-year contract citing family reasons with Toulon owner Bernard Lemairtre criticising Webb in the press for \"a dishonest attitude\" after he quickly re-joined Ospreys and became eligible again for Wales.\n\nOutside of rugby Webb is currently listed as a model for London-based agency MOT Models and has also set up coaching business RW9 Performance, providing strength and conditioning coaching for young athletes along with 'nutrition advice' and 'mentoring'.", "source": {"uri": "ca.sports.yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo Sports Canada"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rhys_Webb", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Rhys Webb"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/French_Anti-Doping_Agency", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "French Anti-Doping Agency"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wales", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Wales"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Wales"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rugby_World_Cup", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Rugby World Cup"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Growth_hormone", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Growth hormone"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Six_Nations_Championship", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Six Nations Championship"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cap_(sport)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Cap (sport)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doping_in_sport", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Doping in sport"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rugby_union_positions", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Rugby union positions"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biarritz", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Biarritz"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Biarritz"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Anti-Doping_Agency", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "World Anti-Doping Agency"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sports_governing_body", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Sports governing body"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toulon", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Toulon"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Toulon"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/France", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "France"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2005_British_&_Irish_Lions_tour_to_New_Zealand", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "2005 British & Irish Lions tour to New Zealand"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/British_&_Irish_Lions", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "British & Irish Lions"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ospreys_(rugby_union)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Ospreys (rugby union)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test_cricket", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Test cricket"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rugby_union", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Rugby union"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bath,_Somerset", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Bath, Somerset"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Bath, Somerset"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Football", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Football", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Football/Rugby_Union", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Football/Rugby Union", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Football/Rugby_League", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Football/Rugby League", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Employment/Careers", "label": "dmoz/Business/Employment/Careers", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Football", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Football", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 98}], "image": "https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/AQhLWnnCUHfsBX.citlzag--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyMDA7aD03NTE7Y2Y9d2VicA--/https://media.zenfs.com/en/the_telegraph_818/0d62b5a5b34fb578eed0dcd6b1bf97a8", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9722707", "eventUri": "eng-9722707", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1764705882352942, "wgt": 210, "relevance": 1}

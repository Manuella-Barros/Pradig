His sit-down with union officials also overlaps with the NATO summit in Washington, where Biden is navigating geopolitics with other world leaders.\n\nA person who has been involved in past executive council meetings described them as largely informal and unscripted, a sign that Biden will not be able to rely on a prepared text as he seeks to solidify support among a group of union leaders who are both loyal to his administration and pragmatic. The person insisted on anonymity to preview the private meeting.\n\nA White House official, insisting on anonymity to preview the meeting, said that Biden intends to thank the union leaders for their support and outline his plans for the future. Biden is close to many union leaders who will be in the room, and considers AFL-CIO president Liz Shuler to be a personal friend.\n\nThe council is composed of more than 50 officials from the unions that compose the AFL-CIO, with the group representing 12.5 million union members.\n\nSo far, the unions are sticking with the Biden administration despite widespread fears that his age handicaps his candidacy after his shaky performance in the June 27 debate.

Biden routinely holds his events at union halls. He has conversed regularly with several of the union leaders at Wednesday's meeting, knowing that the group is a key link at the local level to the voters that he says make him the Democrats' best candidate in November.\n\nOver the course of his term, Biden has tied his administration to the idea that labor unions built the middle class. He visited a picket line during the auto strikes, backed the steelworkers union in objecting to Nippon Steel taking over U.S. Steel, saved pensions for union workers as part of his pandemic aid and sided with unions on a new rule to make more workers eligible for overtime pay.\n\nBiden is so mindful of union workers that he recently canceled a speech planned for the conference of the National Education Association in Philadelphia after the union's staff announced a strike and formed a picket line.\n\nOne person familiar with the labor movement's thinking said there is an acknowledgment that Biden lost some ground among voters after the debate, but the unions have found that one-on-one conversations about Biden's agenda are mattering more to members and their families than his age and health.

He told the crowd that even Wall Street was acknowledging the power of unions, as he once again articulated his vision for an economy built \"from the bottom up and middle out.\"\n\n\"I said I'm going to be the most pro-union president in American history,\" Biden told the cheering crowd. \"Well guess what? I am.\"\n\nThe AFL-CIO said the president has been booked to attend the meeting for more than a year, but his participation now involves much higher scrutiny after his weak debate performance against Donald Trump raised fears about his ability to compete in November's election. His sit-down with union officials also overlaps with the NATO summit in Washington, where Biden is navigating geopolitics with other world leaders.\n\nA person who has been involved in past executive council meetings described them as largely informal and unscripted, a sign that Biden will not be able to rely on a prepared text as he seeks to solidify support among a group of union leaders who are both loyal to his administration and pragmatic. The person insisted on anonymity to preview the private meeting.\n\nBiden thanked the union leaders for their support, and outlined his plans for the future seeking to cast aside doubt over his reelection campaign. Biden is close to many union leaders who will be in the room, and considers AFL-CIO president Liz Shuler to be a personal friend.\n\nIn announcing Biden, Shuler says Biden has supported jobs, manufacturing and created good union jobs in clean energy.\n\n\"You've always had our back -- we have your back,\" Shuler said to the president.\n\nThe council is composed of more than 50 officials from the unions that compose the AFL-CIO, with the group representing 12.5 million union members.\n\nSo far, the unions are sticking with the Biden administration despite widespread fears that his age handicaps his candidacy after his shaky performance in the June 27 debate. But some statements of support are also worded diplomatically to suggest a degree of flexibility in case Biden chooses to drop out -- saying they back the Biden-Harris administration and not just Biden personally.\n\nAfter Biden was interviewed by ABC News last week in the aftermath of his poor debate, Randi Weingarten, president of the American Federation of Teachers, posted on X: \"Biden is an incredible President and tonight we saw that he's on top of the details. He has my support and we're ready to keep working for Biden-Harris to win in November.\"\n\nSome union leaders have been more targeted in their support for Biden and his continued candidacy.\n\nUnited Steelworkers International President David McCall said before Wednesday's meeting that his union \"proudly supports\" Biden, saying that his \"record of delivering for working people stands for itself.\"\n\nKenneth Cooper, president of the International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers, was also firmly behind Biden, saying that his union members \"couldn't ask for a stronger advocate.\"\n\nWednesday's meeting has become a test of the union movement's strategy to emphasize Biden's policy agenda as a way to overcome doubts about his candidacy. Biden routinely holds his events at union halls. He has conversed regularly with several of the union leaders at Wednesday's meeting, knowing that the group is a key link at the local level to the voters that he says make him the Democrats' best candidate in November.\n\nOver the course of his term, Biden has tied his administration to the idea that labor unions built the middle class. He visited a picket line during the auto strikes, backed the steelworkers union in objecting to Nippon Steel taking over U.S. Steel, saved pensions for union workers as part of his pandemic aid and sided with unions on a new rule to make more workers eligible for overtime pay.\n\nBiden is so mindful of union workers that he recently canceled a speech planned for the conference of the National Education Association in Philadelphia after the union's staff announced a strike and formed a picket line.\n\nOne person familiar with the labor movement's thinking said there is an acknowledgment that Biden lost some ground among voters after the debate, but the unions have found that one-on-one conversations about Biden's agenda are mattering more to members and their families than his age and health. Their pitch is that Biden's agenda has directly helped union workers while Trump's plans could leave them worse off.\n\nThe AFL-CIO has raised 42 specific objections to Trump's time as president from 2017 to 2021. It noted that the Republican, who recently proposed making tips paid to workers tax-free, had also as president implemented a proposal to let bosses pocket their employees' tips, among other concerns about his tax cuts and efforts to restrict unionization.\n\nTrump has also made a play for union members, having met in January with officials in the Teamsters Union and saying afterward that although Republicans generally don't get backing from organized labor, \"in my case it's different because I've employed thousands of Teamsters and I thought we should come over and pay our respects.\"\n\nThe former president has portrayed himself as supporting blue-collar workers, with the Teamsters president Sean O'Brien later saying that there's \"no doubt\" that Trump enjoys some support from union members. O'Brien is scheduled to speak at the Republican National Convention next week in Milwaukee at Trump's invitation.\n\nIn 2020, AP VoteCast found that 16% of voters came from union households and 56% of them supported Biden.

His sit-down with union officials also overlaps with the NATO summit in Washington, where Biden is navigating geopolitics with other world leaders.\n\nBiden spoke with a handheld mic and no teleprompter in sight. He thanked the union leaders for their support, and outlined his plans for the future seeking to cast aside doubt over his reelection campaign. Biden is close to many union leaders who were in room, and considers AFL-CIO president Liz Shuler to be a personal friend.\n\n\"I said I'm going to be the most pro-union president in American history,\" Biden told the cheering crowd. \"Well, guess what? I am.\"\n\nIn announcing Biden, Shuler told the room he has supported jobs, manufacturing and created good union jobs in clean energy. She flat-out told the president that he had the union's support.\n\n\"You've always had our back - we have your back,\" Shuler said to the president.\n\nThe council is composed of more than 50 officials from the unions that compose the AFL-CIO, with the group representing 12.5 million union members.\n\nA person familiar with the meeting said it reflected some of the divisions among Democrats about Biden. One union leader pushed Biden to do more to show he's a fighter, while the head of the North America's Building Trades Unions said the Democrats calling for Biden to step down didn't know how to fight tough. The person insisted on anonymity to discuss the closed-door gathering.\n\nUnited Auto Workers President Shawn Fain, who Biden had actively courted during last year's strikes, was not recognized to speak while Biden was in the room. But he later pushed Biden's team to explain their plans for beating Trump.\n\nSo far, the unions are sticking with the Biden administration, despite widespread fears that his age handicaps his candidacy after his shaky performance in the June 27 debate. The AFL-CIO said Thursday that Biden's \"fighting spirit\" was on full display in the back and forth with union leaders.\n\nStill, some statements of support are also worded diplomatically to suggest a degree of flexibility in case Biden chooses to drop out - saying they back the Biden-Harris administration and not just Biden personally.\n\nThe AFL-CIO said it unanimously voted on Thursday to \"reaffirm\" its backing of \"President Joe Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris, the leadership of the most pro-union administration in our lifetimes.\"\n\nAfter Biden was interviewed by ABC News last week in the aftermath of his poor debate, Randi Weingarten, president of the American Federation of Teachers, posted on X: \"Biden is an incredible President and tonight we saw that he's on top of the details. He has my support and we're ready to keep working for Biden-Harris to win in November.\"\n\nSome union leaders have been more targeted in their support for Biden and his continued candidacy.\n\nUnited Steelworkers International President David McCall said before Wednesday's meeting that his union \"proudly supports\" Biden, saying that his \"record of delivering for working people stands for itself.\"\n\nKenneth Cooper, president of the International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers, was also firmly behind Biden, saying that his union members \"couldn't ask for a stronger advocate.\"\n\nWednesday's meeting was a test of whether Biden's emphasis on policy and loyalty to Democratic constituencies such as unions can overcome doubts about his candidacy.\n\nOver the course of his term, Biden has tied his administration to the idea that labor unions built the middle class. He visited a picket line during the auto strikes, backed the steelworkers union in objecting to Nippon Steel taking over U.S. Steel, saved pensions for union workers as part of his pandemic aid and sided with unions on a new rule to make more workers eligible for overtime pay.\n\nBiden is so mindful of union workers that he recently canceled a speech planned for the conference of the National Education Association in Philadelphia after the union's staff announced a strike and formed a picket line.\n\nOne person familiar with the labor movement's thinking said there is an acknowledgment that Biden lost some ground among voters after the debate, but the unions have found that one-on-one conversations about Biden's agenda are mattering more to members and their families than his age and health. Their pitch is that Biden's agenda has directly helped union workers while Trump's plans could leave them worse off.\n\nThe AFL-CIO has raised 42 specific objections to Trump's time as president from 2017 to 2021. It noted that the Republican, who recently proposed making tips paid to workers tax-free, had also as president implemented a proposal to let bosses pocket their employees' tips, among other concerns about his tax cuts and efforts to restrict unionization.\n\nTrump has also made a play for union members, having met in January with officials in the Teamsters Union and saying afterward that although Republicans generally don't get backing from organized labor, \"in my case it's different because I've employed thousands of Teamsters and I thought we should come over and pay our respects.\"\n\nThe former president has portrayed himself as supporting blue-collar workers, with the Teamsters president Sean O'Brien later saying that there's \"no doubt\" that Trump enjoys some support from union members.

His sit-down with union officials also overlaps with the NATO summit in Washington, where Biden is navigating geopolitics with other world leaders.\n\nA person who has been involved in past executive council meetings described them as largely informal and unscripted, a sign that Biden will not be able to rely on a prepared text as he seeks to solidify support among a group of union leaders who are both loyal to his administration and pragmatic. The person insisted on anonymity to preview the private meeting.\n\nA White House official, insisting on anonymity to preview the meeting, said that Biden intends to thank the union leaders for their support and outline his plans for the future. Biden is close to many union leaders who will be in the room, and considers AFL-CIO president Liz Shuler to be a personal friend.\n\nThe council is composed of more than 50 officials from the unions that compose the AFL-CIO, with the group representing 12.5 million union members.\n\nFILE - President Joe Biden addresses the AFL-CIO convention, June 14, 2022, in Philadelphia. Facing pressure from within his own party to abandon his reelection campaign, Biden is relying on labor unions to help make the case that his record in office matters more than his age. Biden is set to meet July 10, 2024, with the executive council of the AFL-CIO, America's largest federation of trade unions. (AP Photo/Susan Walsh)\n\nSo far, the unions are sticking with the Biden administration despite widespread fears that his age handicaps his candidacy after his shaky performance in the June 27 debate. But some statements of support are also worded diplomatically to suggest a degree of flexibility in case Biden chooses to drop out - saying they back the Biden-Harris administration and not just Biden personally.\n\n\"President Biden and Vice President Harris have always had workers\u00b4 backs - and we will have theirs,\" Shuler, the AFL-CIO president, said after the debate.\n\nAfter Biden was interviewed by ABC News last week in the aftermath of his poor debate, Randi Weingarten, president of the American Federation of Teachers, posted on X: \"Biden is an incredible President and tonight we saw that he\u00b4s on top of the details. He has my support and we\u00b4re ready to keep working for Biden-Harris to win in November.\"\n\nSome union leaders have been more targeted in their support for Biden and his continued candidacy.\n\nUnited Steelworkers International President David McCall said before Wednesday's meeting that his union \"proudly supports\" Biden, saying that his \"record of delivering for working people stands for itself.\"\n\nKenneth Cooper, president of the International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers, was also firmly behind Biden, saying that his union members \"couldn't ask for a stronger advocate.\"\n\nWednesday's meeting has become a test of the union movement's strategy to emphasize Biden's policy agenda as a way to overcome doubts about his candidacy. Biden routinely holds his events at union halls. He has conversed regularly with several of the union leaders at Wednesday's meeting, knowing that the group is a key link at the local level to the voters that he says make him the Democrats' best candidate in November.\n\nOver the course of his term, Biden has tied his administration to the idea that labor unions built the middle class. He visited a picket line during the auto strikes, backed the steelworkers union in objecting to Nippon Steel taking over U.S. Steel, saved pensions for union workers as part of his pandemic aid and sided with unions on a new rule to make more workers eligible for overtime pay.\n\nBiden is so mindful of union workers that he recently canceled a speech planned for the conference of the National Education Association in Philadelphia after the union's staff announced a strike and formed a picket line.\n\nOne person familiar with the labor movement's thinking said there is an acknowledgment that Biden lost some ground among voters after the debate, but the unions have found that one-on-one conversations about Biden's agenda are mattering more to members and their families than his age and health. Their pitch is that Biden's agenda has directly helped union workers while Trump's plans could leave them worse off.\n\nThe AFL-CIO has raised 42 specific objections to Trump\u00b4s time as president from 2017 to 2021. It noted that the Republican, who recently proposed making tips paid to workers tax-free, had also as president implemented a proposal to let bosses pocket their employees\u00b4 tips, among other concerns about his tax cuts and efforts to restrict unionization.\n\nTrump has also made a play for union members, having met in January with officials in the Teamsters Union and saying afterward that although Republicans generally don't get backing from organized labor, \"in my case it\u00b4s different because I\u00b4ve employed thousands of Teamsters and I thought we should come over and pay our respects.\"\n\nThe former president has portrayed himself as supporting blue-collar workers, with the Teamsters president Sean O'Brien later saying that there's \"no doubt\" that Trump enjoys some support from union members. O'Brien is scheduled to speak at the Republican National Convention next week in Milwaukee at Trump's invitation.\n\nIn 2020, AP VoteCast found that 16% of voters came from union households and 56% of them supported Biden. Biden and Trump essentially split non-union households in Michigan, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin, meaning that the Democrat's edge with union households was likely a critical factor in his victory.",

His sit-down with union officials also overlaps with the NATO summit in Washington, where Biden is navigating geopolitics with other world leaders.\n\nBiden spoke with a handheld mic and no teleprompter in sight. He thanked the union leaders for their support, and outlined his plans for the future seeking to cast aside doubt over his reelection campaign. Biden is close to many union leaders who were in room, and considers AFL-CIO president Liz Shuler to be a personal friend.\n\n\"I said I'm going to be the most pro-union president in American history,\" Biden told the cheering crowd. \"Well, guess what? I am.\"\n\nIn announcing Biden, Shuler told the room he has supported jobs, manufacturing and created good union jobs in clean energy. She flat-out told the president that he had the union's support.\n\n\"You've always had our back -- we have your back,\" Shuler said to the president.\n\nThe council is composed of more than 50 officials from the unions that compose the AFL-CIO, with the group representing 12.5 million union members.\n\nA person familiar with the meeting said it reflected some of the divisions among Democrats about Biden. One union leader pushed Biden to do more to show he's a fighter, while the head of the North America's Building Trades Unions said the Democrats calling for Biden to step down didn't know how to fight tough. The person insisted on anonymity to discuss the closed-door gathering.\n\nUnited Auto Workers President Shawn Fain, who Biden had actively courted during last year's strikes, was not recognized to speak while Biden was in the room. But he later pushed Biden's team to explain their plans for beating Trump.\n\nSo far, the unions are sticking with the Biden administration, despite widespread fears that his age handicaps his candidacy after his shaky performance in the June 27 debate. The AFL-CIO said Thursday that Biden's \"fighting spirit\" was on full display in the back and forth with union leaders.\n\nStill, some statements of support are also worded diplomatically to suggest a degree of flexibility in case Biden chooses to drop out -- saying they back the Biden-Harris administration and not just Biden personally.\n\nThe AFL-CIO said it unanimously voted on Thursday to \"reaffirm\" its backing of \"President Joe Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris, the leadership of the most pro-union administration in our lifetimes.\"\n\nAfter Biden was interviewed by ABC News last week in the aftermath of his poor debate, Randi Weingarten, president of the American Federation of Teachers, posted on X: \"Biden is an incredible President and tonight we saw that he's on top of the details. He has my support and we're ready to keep working for Biden-Harris to win in November.\"\n\nSome union leaders have been more targeted in their support for Biden and his continued candidacy.\n\nUnited Steelworkers International President David McCall said before Wednesday's meeting that his union \"proudly supports\" Biden, saying that his \"record of delivering for working people stands for itself.\"\n\nKenneth Cooper, president of the International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers, was also firmly behind Biden, saying that his union members \"couldn't ask for a stronger advocate.\"\n\nWednesday's meeting was a test of whether Biden's emphasis on policy and loyalty to Democratic constituencies such as unions can overcome doubts about his candidacy.\n\nOver the course of his term, Biden has tied his administration to the idea that labor unions built the middle class. He visited a picket line during the auto strikes, backed the steelworkers union in objecting to Nippon Steel taking over U.S. Steel, saved pensions for union workers as part of his pandemic aid and sided with unions on a new rule to make more workers eligible for overtime pay.\n\nBiden is so mindful of union workers that he recently canceled a speech planned for the conference of the National Education Association in Philadelphia after the union's staff announced a strike and formed a picket line.\n\nOne person familiar with the labor movement's thinking said there is an acknowledgment that Biden lost some ground among voters after the debate, but the unions have found that one-on-one conversations about Biden's agenda are mattering more to members and their families than his age and health. Their pitch is that Biden's agenda has directly helped union workers while Trump's plans could leave them worse off.\n\nThe AFL-CIO has raised 42 specific objections to Trump's time as president from 2017 to 2021. It noted that the Republican, who recently proposed making tips paid to workers tax-free, had also as president implemented a proposal to let bosses pocket their employees' tips, among other concerns about his tax cuts and efforts to restrict unionization.\n\nTrump has also made a play for union members, having met in January with officials in the Teamsters Union and saying afterward that although Republicans generally don't get backing from organized labor, \"in my case it's different because I've employed thousands of Teamsters and I thought we should come over and pay our respects.\"\n\nThe former president has portrayed himself as supporting blue-collar workers, with the Teamsters president Sean O'Brien later saying that there's \"no doubt\" that Trump enjoys some support from union members. O'Brien is scheduled to speak at the Republican National Convention next week in Milwaukee at Trump's invitation.\n\nIn 2020, AP VoteCast found that 16% of voters came from union households and 56% of them supported Biden. Biden and Trump essentially split non-union households in Michigan, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin, meaning that the Democrat's edge with union households was likely a critical factor in his victory.\n\nCopyright 2024 The Associated Press.

His sit-down with union officials also overlaps with the NATO summit in Washington, where Biden is navigating geopolitics with other world leaders.\n\nAlso Read | CNN Layoffs: US-Based Cable News Network Cutting About 100 Jobs, Plans to Debut Digital Subscriptions Before Year's End.\n\nBiden spoke with a handheld mic and no teleprompter in sight. He thanked the union leaders for their support, and outlined his plans for the future seeking to cast aside doubt over his reelection campaign. Biden is close to many union leaders who were in room, and considers AFL-CIO president Liz Shuler to be a personal friend.\n\n\"I said I'm going to be the most pro-union president in American history,\" Biden told the cheering crowd. \"Well, guess what? I am.\"\n\nIn announcing Biden, Shuler told the room he has supported jobs, manufacturing and created good union jobs in clean energy. She flat-out told the president that he had the union's support.\n\n\"You've always had our back -- we have your back,\" Shuler said to the president.\n\nThe council is composed of more than 50 officials from the unions that compose the AFL-CIO, with the group representing 12.5 million union members.\n\nA person familiar with the meeting said it reflected some of the divisions among Democrats about Biden. One union leader pushed Biden to do more to show he's a fighter, while the head of the North America's Building Trades Unions said the Democrats calling for Biden to step down didn't know how to fight tough. The person insisted on anonymity to discuss the closed-door gathering.\n\nUnited Auto Workers President Shawn Fain, who Biden had actively courted during last year's strikes, was not recognized to speak while Biden was in the room. But he later pushed Biden's team to explain their plans for beating Trump.\n\nSo far, the unions are sticking with the Biden administration, despite widespread fears that his age handicaps his candidacy after his shaky performance in the June 27 debate. The AFL-CIO said Thursday that Biden's \"fighting spirit\" was on full display in the back and forth with union leaders.\n\nStill, some statements of support are also worded diplomatically to suggest a degree of flexibility in case Biden chooses to drop out -- saying they back the Biden-Harris administration and not just Biden personally.\n\nThe AFL-CIO said it unanimously voted on Thursday to \"reaffirm\" its backing of \"President Joe Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris, the leadership of the most pro-union administration in our lifetimes.\"\n\nAfter Biden was interviewed by ABC News last week in the aftermath of his poor debate, Randi Weingarten, president of the American Federation of Teachers, posted on X: \"Biden is an incredible President and tonight we saw that he's on top of the details. He has my support and we're ready to keep working for Biden-Harris to win in November.\"\n\nSome union leaders have been more targeted in their support for Biden and his continued candidacy.\n\nUnited Steelworkers International President David McCall said before Wednesday's meeting that his union \"proudly supports\" Biden, saying that his \"record of delivering for working people stands for itself.\"\n\nKenneth Cooper, president of the International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers, was also firmly behind Biden, saying that his union members \"couldn't ask for a stronger advocate.\"\n\nWednesday's meeting was a test of whether Biden's emphasis on policy and loyalty to Democratic constituencies such as unions can overcome doubts about his candidacy.\n\nOver the course of his term, Biden has tied his administration to the idea that labor unions built the middle class. He visited a picket line during the auto strikes, backed the steelworkers union in objecting to Nippon Steel taking over U.S. Steel, saved pensions for union workers as part of his pandemic aid and sided with unions on a new rule to make more workers eligible for overtime pay.\n\nBiden is so mindful of union workers that he recently canceled a speech planned for the conference of the National Education Association in Philadelphia after the union's staff announced a strike and formed a picket line.\n\nOne person familiar with the labor movement's thinking said there is an acknowledgment that Biden lost some ground among voters after the debate, but the unions have found that one-on-one conversations about Biden's agenda are mattering more to members and their families than his age and health. Their pitch is that Biden's agenda has directly helped union workers while Trump's plans could leave them worse off.\n\nThe AFL-CIO has raised 42 specific objections to Trump's time as president from 2017 to 2021.

His sit-down with union officials also overlaps with the NATO summit in Washington, where Biden is navigating geopolitics with other world leaders.\n\nA person who has been involved in past executive council meetings described them as largely informal and unscripted, a sign that Biden will not be able to rely on a prepared text as he seeks to solidify support among a group of union leaders who are both loyal to his administration and pragmatic. The person insisted on anonymity to preview the private meeting.\n\nA White House official, insisting on anonymity to preview the meeting, said that Biden intends to thank the union leaders for their support and outline his plans for the future. Biden is close to many union leaders who will be in the room, and considers AFL-CIO president Liz Shuler to be a personal friend.\n\nThe council is composed of more than 50 officials from the unions that compose the AFL-CIO, with the group representing 12.5 million union members.\n\nSo far, the unions are sticking with the Biden administration despite widespread fears that his age handicaps his candidacy after his shaky performance in the June 27 debate.

He extolled the power of unions and told them of his longstanding support for them, telling the crowd even Wall Street was acknowledging the power of unions.\n\nHours later in the Oval Office, when a reporter asked him about an opinion piece written by George Clooney in which the actor implored Biden to leave the 2024 race, the president responded with \"AFL-CIO!\" paused, pumped his fists and added, \"Go, go, go.\"\n\nPeople are also reading... 3 dead in plane crash near McDowell, Rutherford county line Plane crashes in McDowell; emergency crews ask people to avoid Brackett Town Road Marion man meets McDowell paramedic who saved his life 24 years ago Toddler killed by truck at Steel Creek campground north of Morganton 3 from South Carolina die in Nebo plane crash; national safety board investigating Golden Hour Charcuterie opens in Marion's Depot District Body found Sunday was Marion man; cause of death pending toxicology report Nebo woman charged with break-in McDowell Little League crowns two champions; league to host a baseball state tournament Burkemont Mountain in Morganton ablaze with 30-acre wildfire Marion NC man's charges upgraded to felony after assault on 79-year-old When are the 4th of July fireworks, parades in McDowell County?

His sit-down with union officials also overlaps with the NATO summit in Washington, where Biden is navigating geopolitics with other world leaders.\n\nBiden spoke with a handheld mic and no teleprompter in sight. He thanked the union leaders for their support, and outlined his plans for the future seeking to cast aside doubt over his reelection campaign. Biden is close to many union leaders who were in room, and considers AFL-CIO president Liz Shuler to be a personal friend.\n\nIn announcing Biden, Shuler told the room he has supported jobs, manufacturing and created good union jobs in clean energy. She flat out told the president that he had union's support.\n\n\"You've always had our back -- we have your back,\" Shuler said to the president.\n\nThe council is composed of more than 50 officials from the unions that compose the AFL-CIO, with the group representing 12.5 million union members.\n\nSo far, the unions are sticking with the Biden administration despite widespread fears that his age handicaps his candidacy after his shaky performance in the June 27 debate. But some statements of support are also worded diplomatically to suggest a degree of flexibility in case Biden chooses to drop out -- saying they back the Biden-Harris administration and not just Biden personally.\n\n\"I said I'm going to be the most pro-union president in American history,\" Biden told the cheering crowd. \"Well. guess what? I am.\"\n\nAfter Biden was interviewed by ABC News last week in the aftermath of his poor debate, Randi Weingarten, president of the American Federation of Teachers, posted on X: \"Biden is an incredible President and tonight we saw that he's on top of the details.

He visited a picket line during the auto strikes, backed the steelworkers union in objecting to Nippon Steel taking over U.S. Steel, saved pensions for union workers as part of his pandemic aid and sided with unions on a new rule to make more workers eligible for overtime pay.\n\nBiden is so mindful of union workers that he recently canceled a speech planned for the conference of the National Education Association in Philadelphia after the union's staff announced a strike and formed a picket line.\n\nOne person familiar with the labor movement's thinking said there is an acknowledgment that Biden lost some ground among voters after the debate, but the unions have found that one-on-one conversations about Biden's agenda are mattering more to members and their families than his age and health. Their pitch is that Biden's agenda has directly helped union workers while Trump's plans could leave them worse off.\n\nThe AFL-CIO has raised 42 specific objections to Trump's time as president from 2017 to 2021. It noted that the Republican, who recently proposed making tips paid to workers tax-free, had also as president implemented a proposal to let bosses pocket their employees' tips, among other concerns about his tax cuts and efforts to restrict unionization.\n\nTrump has also made a play for union members, having met in January with officials in the Teamsters Union and saying afterward that although Republicans generally don't get backing from organized labor, \"in my case it's different because I've employed thousands of Teamsters and I thought we should come over and pay our respects.\"\n\nThe former president has portrayed himself as supporting blue-collar workers, with the Teamsters president Sean O'Brien later saying that there's \"no doubt\" that Trump enjoys some support from union members. O'Brien is scheduled to speak at the Republican National Convention next week in Milwaukee at Trump's invitation.\n\nIn 2020, AP VoteCast found that 16% of voters came from union households and 56% of them supported Biden. Biden and Trump essentially split non-union households in Michigan, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin, meaning that the Democrat's edge with union households was likely a critical factor in his victory.\n\nCopyright 2024 The Associated Press.

His sit-down with union officials also overlaps with the NATO summit in Washington, where Biden is navigating geopolitics with other world leaders.\n\nBiden spoke with a handheld mic and no teleprompter in sight. He thanked the union leaders for their support, and outlined his plans for the future seeking to cast aside doubt over his reelection campaign. Biden is close to many union leaders who were in room, and considers AFL-CIO president Liz Shuler to be a personal friend.\n\n\"I said I'm going to be the most pro-union president in American history,\" Biden told the cheering crowd. \"Well, guess what? I am.\"\n\nIn announcing Biden, Shuler told the room he has supported jobs, manufacturing and created good union jobs in clean energy. She flat-out told the president that he had the union's support.\n\n\"You've always had our back -- we have your back,\" Shuler said to the president.\n\nThe council is composed of more than 50 officials from the unions that compose the AFL-CIO, with the group representing 12.5 million union members.\n\nA person familiar with the meeting said it reflected some of the divisions among Democrats about Biden. One union leader pushed Biden to do more to show he's a fighter, while the head of the North America's Building Trades Unions said the Democrats calling for Biden to step down didn't know how to fight tough. The person insisted on anonymity to discuss the closed-door gathering.\n\nUnited Auto Workers President Shawn Fain, who Biden had actively courted during last year's strikes, was not recognized to speak while Biden was in the room. But he later pushed Biden's team to explain their plans for beating Trump.\n\nSo far, the unions are sticking with the Biden administration, despite widespread fears that his age handicaps his candidacy after his shaky performance in the June 27 debate. The AFL-CIO said Thursday that Biden's \"fighting spirit\" was on full display in the back and forth with union leaders.\n\nStill, some statements of support are also worded diplomatically to suggest a degree of flexibility in case Biden chooses to drop out -- saying they back the Biden-Harris administration and not just Biden personally.\n\nThe AFL-CIO said it unanimously voted on Thursday to \"reaffirm\" its backing of \"President Joe Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris, the leadership of the most pro-union administration in our lifetimes.\"\n\nAfter Biden was interviewed by ABC News last week in the aftermath of his poor debate, Randi Weingarten, president of the American Federation of Teachers, posted on X: \"Biden is an incredible President and tonight we saw that he's on top of the details. He has my support and we're ready to keep working for Biden-Harris to win in November.\"\n\nSome union leaders have been more targeted in their support for Biden and his continued candidacy.\n\nUnited Steelworkers International President David McCall said before Wednesday's meeting that his union \"proudly supports\" Biden, saying that his \"record of delivering for working people stands for itself.\"\n\nKenneth Cooper, president of the International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers, was also firmly behind Biden, saying that his union members \"couldn't ask for a stronger advocate.\"\n\nWednesday's meeting was a test of whether Biden's emphasis on policy and loyalty to Democratic constituencies such as unions can overcome doubts about his candidacy.\n\nOver the course of his term, Biden has tied his administration to the idea that labor unions built the middle class. He visited a picket line during the auto strikes, backed the steelworkers union in objecting to Nippon Steel taking over U.S. Steel, saved pensions for union workers as part of his pandemic aid and sided with unions on a new rule to make more workers eligible for overtime pay.\n\nBiden is so mindful of union workers that he recently canceled a speech planned for the conference of the National Education Association in Philadelphia after the union's staff announced a strike and formed a picket line.\n\nOne person familiar with the labor movement's thinking said there is an acknowledgment that Biden lost some ground among voters after the debate, but the unions have found that one-on-one conversations about Biden's agenda are mattering more to members and their families than his age and health. Their pitch is that Biden's agenda has directly helped union workers while Trump's plans could leave them worse off.\n\nThe AFL-CIO has raised 42 specific objections to Trump's time as president from 2017 to 2021. It noted that the Republican, who recently proposed making tips paid to workers tax-free, had also as president implemented a proposal to let bosses pocket their employees' tips, among other concerns about his tax cuts and efforts to restrict unionization.\n\nTrump has also made a play for union members, having met in January with officials in the Teamsters Union and saying afterward that although Republicans generally don't get backing from organized labor, \"in my case it's different because I've employed thousands of Teamsters and I thought we should come over and pay our respects.\"\n\nThe former president has portrayed himself as supporting blue-collar workers, with the Teamsters president Sean O'Brien later saying that there's \"no doubt\" that Trump enjoys some support from union members.

He extolled the power of unions and told them of his longstanding support for them, telling the crowd even Wall Street was acknowledging the power of unions.\n\nHours later in the Oval Office, when a reporter asked him about an opinion piece written by George Clooney in which the actor implored Biden to leave the 2024 race, the president responded with \"AFL-CIO!\" paused, pumped his fists and added, \"Go, go, go.\"\n\nPeople are also reading...

His sit-down with union officials also overlaps with the NATO summit in Washington, where Biden is navigating geopolitics with other world leaders.\n\nBiden spoke with a handheld mic and no teleprompter in sight. He thanked the union leaders for their support, and outlined his plans for the future seeking to cast aside doubt over his reelection campaign. Biden is close to many union leaders who were in room, and considers AFL-CIO president Liz Shuler to be a personal friend.\n\nIn announcing Biden, Shuler told the room he has supported jobs, manufacturing and created good union jobs in clean energy. She flat out told the president that he had union's support.\n\n\"You've always had our back -- we have your back,\" Shuler said to the president.\n\nThe council is composed of more than 50 officials from the unions that compose the AFL-CIO, with the group representing 12.5 million union members.\n\nSo far, the unions are sticking with the Biden administration despite widespread fears that his age handicaps his candidacy after his shaky performance in the June 27 debate. But some statements of support are also worded diplomatically to suggest a degree of flexibility in case Biden chooses to drop out -- saying they back the Biden-Harris administration and not just Biden personally.\n\n\"I said I'm going to be the most pro-union president in American history,\" Biden told the cheering crowd. \"Well. guess what? I am.\"\n\nListen now and subscribe: Apple Podcasts | Google Podcasts | Spotify | RSS Feed | SoundStack | All Of Our Podcasts\n\nAfter Biden was interviewed by ABC News last week in the aftermath of his poor debate, Randi Weingarten, president of the American Federation of Teachers, posted on X: \"Biden is an incredible President and tonight we saw that he's on top of the details. He has my support and we're ready to keep working for Biden-Harris to win in November.\"\n\nSome union leaders have been more targeted in their support for Biden and his continued candidacy.\n\nUnited Steelworkers International President David McCall said before Wednesday's meeting that his union \"proudly supports\" Biden, saying that his \"record of delivering for working people stands for itself.\"\n\nKenneth Cooper, president of the International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers, was also firmly behind Biden, saying that his union members \"couldn't ask for a stronger advocate.\"\n\nWednesday's meeting has become a test of the union movement's strategy to emphasize Biden's policy agenda as a way to overcome doubts about his candidacy. Biden routinely holds his events at union halls. He has conversed regularly with several of the union leaders at Wednesday's meeting, knowing that the group is a key link at the local level to the voters that he says make him the Democrats' best candidate in November.\n\nOver the course of his term, Biden has tied his administration to the idea that labor unions built the middle class. He visited a picket line during the auto strikes, backed the steelworkers union in objecting to Nippon Steel taking over U.S. Steel, saved pensions for union workers as part of his pandemic aid and sided with unions on a new rule to make more workers eligible for overtime pay.\n\nBiden is so mindful of union workers that he recently canceled a speech planned for the conference of the National Education Association in Philadelphia after the union's staff announced a strike and formed a picket line.\n\nOne person familiar with the labor movement's thinking said there is an acknowledgment that Biden lost some ground among voters after the debate, but the unions have found that one-on-one conversations about Biden's agenda are mattering more to members and their families than his age and health. Their pitch is that Biden's agenda has directly helped union workers while Trump's plans could leave them worse off.\n\nThe AFL-CIO has raised 42 specific objections to Trump's time as president from 2017 to 2021. It noted that the Republican, who recently proposed making tips paid to workers tax-free, had also as president implemented a proposal to let bosses pocket their employees' tips, among other concerns about his tax cuts and efforts to restrict unionization.\n\nTrump has also made a play for union members, having met in January with officials in the Teamsters Union and saying afterward that although Republicans generally don't get backing from organized labor, \"in my case it's different because I've employed thousands of Teamsters and I thought we should come over and pay our respects.\"\n\nThe former president has portrayed himself as supporting blue-collar workers, with the Teamsters president Sean O'Brien later saying that there's \"no doubt\" that Trump enjoys some support from union members. O'Brien is scheduled to speak at the Republican National Convention next week in Milwaukee at Trump's invitation.\n\nIn 2020, AP VoteCast found that 16% of voters came from union households and 56% of them supported Biden. Biden and Trump essentially split non-union households in Michigan, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin, meaning that the Democrat's edge with union households was likely a critical factor in his victory.\n\nCopyright 2024 The Associated Press.

His sit-down with union officials also overlaps with the NATO summit in Washington, where Biden is navigating geopolitics with other world leaders.\n\nBiden spoke with a handheld mic and no teleprompter in sight. He thanked the union leaders for their support, and outlined his plans for the future seeking to cast aside doubt over his reelection campaign. Biden is close to many union leaders who were in room, and considers AFL-CIO president Liz Shuler to be a personal friend.\n\n\"I said I'm going to be the most pro-union president in American history,\" Biden told the cheering crowd. \"Well, guess what? I am.\"\n\nIn announcing Biden, Shuler told the room he has supported jobs, manufacturing and created good union jobs in clean energy. She flat-out told the president that he had the union's support.\n\n\"You've always had our back -- we have your back,\" Shuler said to the president.\n\nThe council is composed of more than 50 officials from the unions that compose the AFL-CIO, with the group representing 12.5 million union members.\n\nA person familiar with the meeting said it reflected some of the divisions among Democrats about Biden. One union leader pushed Biden to do more to show he's a fighter, while the head of the North America's Building Trades Unions said the Democrats calling for Biden to step down didn't know how to fight tough. The person insisted on anonymity to discuss the closed-door gathering.\n\nUnited Auto Workers President Shawn Fain, who Biden had actively courted during last year's strikes, was not recognized to speak while Biden was in the room. But he later pushed Biden's team to explain their plans for beating Trump.\n\nSo far, the unions are sticking with the Biden administration, despite widespread fears that his age handicaps his candidacy after his shaky performance in the June 27 debate. The AFL-CIO said Thursday that Biden's \"fighting spirit\" was on full display in the back and forth with union leaders.\n\nStill, some statements of support are also worded diplomatically to suggest a degree of flexibility in case Biden chooses to drop out -- saying they back the Biden-Harris administration and not just Biden personally.\n\nThe AFL-CIO said it unanimously voted on Thursday to \"reaffirm\" its backing of \"President Joe Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris, the leadership of the most pro-union administration in our lifetimes.\"\n\nAfter Biden was interviewed by ABC News last week in the aftermath of his poor debate, Randi Weingarten, president of the American Federation of Teachers, posted on X: \"Biden is an incredible President and tonight we saw that he's on top of the details. He has my support and we're ready to keep working for Biden-Harris to win in November.\"\n\nSome union leaders have been more targeted in their support for Biden and his continued candidacy.\n\nUnited Steelworkers International President David McCall said before Wednesday's meeting that his union \"proudly supports\" Biden, saying that his \"record of delivering for working people stands for itself.\"\n\nKenneth Cooper, president of the International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers, was also firmly behind Biden, saying that his union members \"couldn't ask for a stronger advocate.\"\n\nWednesday's meeting was a test of whether Biden's emphasis on policy and loyalty to Democratic constituencies such as unions can overcome doubts about his candidacy.\n\nOver the course of his term, Biden has tied his administration to the idea that labor unions built the middle class. He visited a picket line during the auto strikes, backed the steelworkers union in objecting to Nippon Steel taking over U.S. Steel, saved pensions for union workers as part of his pandemic aid and sided with unions on a new rule to make more workers eligible for overtime pay.\n\nBiden is so mindful of union workers that he recently canceled a speech planned for the conference of the National Education Association in Philadelphia after the union's staff announced a strike and formed a picket line.\n\nOne person familiar with the labor movement's thinking said there is an acknowledgment that Biden lost some ground among voters after the debate, but the unions have found that one-on-one conversations about Biden's agenda are mattering more to members and their families than his age and health. Their pitch is that Biden's agenda has directly helped union workers while Trump's plans could leave them worse off.\n\nThe AFL-CIO has raised 42 specific objections to Trump's time as president from 2017 to 2021. It noted that the Republican, who recently proposed making tips paid to workers tax-free, had also as president implemented a proposal to let bosses pocket their employees' tips, among other concerns about his tax cuts and efforts to restrict unionization.\n\nTrump has also made a play for union members, having met in January with officials in the Teamsters Union and saying afterward that although Republicans generally don't get backing from organized labor, \"in my case it's different because I've employed thousands of Teamsters and I thought we should come over and pay our respects.\"\n\nThe former president has portrayed himself as supporting blue-collar workers, with the Teamsters president Sean O'Brien later saying that there's \"no doubt\" that Trump enjoys some support from union members. O'Brien is scheduled to speak at the Republican National Convention next week in Milwaukee at Trump's invitation.\n\nIn 2020, AP VoteCast found that 16% of voters came from union households and 56% of them supported Biden. Biden and Trump essentially split non-union households in Michigan, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin, meaning that the Democrat's edge with union households was likely a critical factor in his victory.\n\nCopyright 2024 The Associated Press.

He extolled the power of unions and told them of his longstanding support for them, telling the crowd even Wall Street was acknowledging the power of unions.\n\nHours later in the Oval Office, when a reporter asked him about an opinion piece written by George Clooney in which the actor implored Biden to leave the 2024 race, the president responded with \"AFL-CIO!\" paused, pumped his fists and added, \"Go, go, go.\"\n\nPeople are also reading...

His sit-down with union officials also overlaps with the NATO summit in Washington, where Biden is navigating geopolitics with other world leaders.\n\nBiden spoke with a handheld mic and no teleprompter in sight. He thanked the union leaders for their support, and outlined his plans for the future seeking to cast aside doubt over his reelection campaign. Biden is close to many union leaders who were in room, and considers AFL-CIO president Liz Shuler to be a personal friend.\n\nIn announcing Biden, Shuler told the room he has supported jobs, manufacturing and created good union jobs in clean energy. She flat out told the president that he had union's support.\n\n\"You've always had our back -- we have your back,\" Shuler said to the president.\n\nThe council is composed of more than 50 officials from the unions that compose the AFL-CIO, with the group representing 12.5 million union members.\n\nSo far, the unions are sticking with the Biden administration despite widespread fears that his age handicaps his candidacy after his shaky performance in the June 27 debate. But some statements of support are also worded diplomatically to suggest a degree of flexibility in case Biden chooses to drop out -- saying they back the Biden-Harris administration and not just Biden personally.\n\n\"I said I'm going to be the most pro-union president in American history,\" Biden told the cheering crowd. \"Well. guess what? I am.\"\n\nAfter Biden was interviewed by ABC News last week in the aftermath of his poor debate, Randi Weingarten, president of the American Federation of Teachers, posted on X: \"Biden is an incredible President and tonight we saw that he's on top of the details. He has my support and we're ready to keep working for Biden-Harris to win in November.\"\n\nSome union leaders have been more targeted in their support for Biden and his continued candidacy.\n\nUnited Steelworkers International President David McCall said before Wednesday's meeting that his union \"proudly supports\" Biden, saying that his \"record of delivering for working people stands for itself.\"\n\nKenneth Cooper, president of the International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers, was also firmly behind Biden, saying that his union members \"couldn't ask for a stronger advocate.\"\n\nWednesday's meeting has become a test of the union movement's strategy to emphasize Biden's policy agenda as a way to overcome doubts about his candidacy. Biden routinely holds his events at union halls. He has conversed regularly with several of the union leaders at Wednesday's meeting, knowing that the group is a key link at the local level to the voters that he says make him the Democrats' best candidate in November.\n\nOver the course of his term, Biden has tied his administration to the idea that labor unions built the middle class. He visited a picket line during the auto strikes, backed the steelworkers union in objecting to Nippon Steel taking over U.S. Steel, saved pensions for union workers as part of his pandemic aid and sided with unions on a new rule to make more workers eligible for overtime pay.\n\nBiden is so mindful of union workers that he recently canceled a speech planned for the conference of the National Education Association in Philadelphia after the union's staff announced a strike and formed a picket line.\n\nOne person familiar with the labor movement's thinking said there is an acknowledgment that Biden lost some ground among voters after the debate, but the unions have found that one-on-one conversations about Biden's agenda are mattering more to members and their families than his age and health. Their pitch is that Biden's agenda has directly helped union workers while Trump's plans could leave them worse off.\n\nThe AFL-CIO has raised 42 specific objections to Trump's time as president from 2017 to 2021. It noted that the Republican, who recently proposed making tips paid to workers tax-free, had also as president implemented a proposal to let bosses pocket their employees' tips, among other concerns about his tax cuts and efforts to restrict unionization.\n\nTrump has also made a play for union members, having met in January with officials in the Teamsters Union and saying afterward that although Republicans generally don't get backing from organized labor, \"in my case it's different because I've employed thousands of Teamsters and I thought we should come over and pay our respects.\"\n\nThe former president has portrayed himself as supporting blue-collar workers, with the Teamsters president Sean O'Brien later saying that there's \"no doubt\" that Trump enjoys some support from union members. O'Brien is scheduled to speak at the Republican National Convention next week in Milwaukee at Trump's invitation.\n\nIn 2020, AP VoteCast found that 16% of voters came from union households and 56% of them supported Biden. Biden and Trump essentially split non-union households in Michigan, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin, meaning that the Democrat's edge with union households was likely a critical factor in his victory.\n\nCopyright 2024 The Associated Press.

He has my support and we're ready to keep working for Biden-Harris to win in November.\"\n\nSome union leaders have been more targeted in their support for Biden and his continued candidacy.\n\nUnited Steelworkers International President David McCall said before Wednesday's meeting that his union \"proudly supports\" Biden, saying that his \"record of delivering for working people stands for itself.\"\n\nKenneth Cooper, president of the International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers, was also firmly behind Biden, saying that his union members \"couldn't ask for a stronger advocate.\"\n\nWednesday's meeting has become a test of the union movement's strategy to emphasize Biden's policy agenda as a way to overcome doubts about his candidacy. Biden routinely holds his events at union halls. He has conversed regularly with several of the union leaders at Wednesday's meeting, knowing that the group is a key link at the local level to the voters that he says make him the Democrats' best candidate in November.\n\nOver the course of his term, Biden has tied his administration to the idea that labor unions built the middle class. He visited a picket line during the auto strikes, backed the steelworkers union in objecting to Nippon Steel taking over U.S. Steel, saved pensions for union workers as part of his pandemic aid and sided with unions on a new rule to make more workers eligible for overtime pay.\n\nBiden is so mindful of union workers that he recently canceled a speech planned for the conference of the National Education Association in Philadelphia after the union's staff announced a strike and formed a picket line.\n\nOne person familiar with the labor movement's thinking said there is an acknowledgment that Biden lost some ground among voters after the debate, but the unions have found that one-on-one conversations about Biden's agenda are mattering more to members and their families than his age and health. Their pitch is that Biden's agenda has directly helped union workers while Trump's plans could leave them worse off.\n\nThe AFL-CIO has raised 42 specific objections to Trump's time as president from 2017 to 2021. It noted that the Republican, who recently proposed making tips paid to workers tax-free, had also as president implemented a proposal to let bosses pocket their employees' tips, among other concerns about his tax cuts and efforts to restrict unionization.\n\nTrump has also made a play for union members, having met in January with officials in the Teamsters Union and saying afterward that although Republicans generally don't get backing from organized labor, \"in my case it's different because I've employed thousands of Teamsters and I thought we should come over and pay our respects.\"\n\nThe former president has portrayed himself as supporting blue-collar workers, with the Teamsters president Sean O'Brien later saying that there's \"no doubt\" that Trump enjoys some support from union members. O'Brien is scheduled to speak at the Republican National Convention next week in Milwaukee at Trump's invitation.\n\nIn 2020, AP VoteCast found that 16% of voters came from union households and 56% of them supported Biden. Biden and Trump essentially split non-union households in Michigan, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin, meaning that the Democrat's edge with union households was likely a critical factor in his victory.\n\nCopyright 2024 The Associated Press.

He extolled the power of unions and told them of his longstanding support for them, telling the crowd even Wall Street was acknowledging the power of unions.\n\nHours later in the Oval Office, when a reporter asked him about an opinion piece written by George Clooney in which the actor implored Biden to leave the 2024 race, the president responded with \"AFL-CIO!\" paused, pumped his fists and added, \"Go, go, go.\"\n\nPeople are also reading...

His sit-down with union officials also overlaps with the NATO summit in Washington, where Biden is navigating geopolitics with other world leaders.\n\nBiden spoke with a handheld mic and no teleprompter in sight. He thanked the union leaders for their support, and outlined his plans for the future seeking to cast aside doubt over his reelection campaign. Biden is close to many union leaders who were in room, and considers AFL-CIO president Liz Shuler to be a personal friend.\n\nIn announcing Biden, Shuler told the room he has supported jobs, manufacturing and created good union jobs in clean energy. She flat out told the president that he had union's support.\n\n\"You've always had our back -- we have your back,\" Shuler said to the president.\n\nThe council is composed of more than 50 officials from the unions that compose the AFL-CIO, with the group representing 12.5 million union members.\n\nSo far, the unions are sticking with the Biden administration despite widespread fears that his age handicaps his candidacy after his shaky performance in the June 27 debate. But some statements of support are also worded diplomatically to suggest a degree of flexibility in case Biden chooses to drop out -- saying they back the Biden-Harris administration and not just Biden personally.\n\n\"I said I'm going to be the most pro-union president in American history,\" Biden told the cheering crowd. \"Well. guess what?

His sit-down with union officials also overlaps with the NATO summit in Washington, where Biden is navigating geopolitics with other world leaders.\n\nBiden spoke with a handheld mic and no teleprompter in sight. He thanked the union leaders for their support, and outlined his plans for the future seeking to cast aside doubt over his reelection campaign. Biden is close to many union leaders who were in room, and considers AFL-CIO president Liz Shuler to be a personal friend.\n\n\"I said I'm going to be the most pro-union president in American history,\" Biden told the cheering crowd. \"Well, guess what? I am.\"\n\nIn announcing Biden, Shuler told the room he has supported jobs, manufacturing and created good union jobs in clean energy. She flat-out told the president that he had the union's support.\n\n\"You've always had our back -- we have your back,\" Shuler said to the president.\n\nThe council is composed of more than 50 officials from the unions that compose the AFL-CIO, with the group representing 12.5 million union members.\n\nA person familiar with the meeting said it reflected some of the divisions among Democrats about Biden. One union leader pushed Biden to do more to show he's a fighter, while the head of the North America's Building Trades Unions said the Democrats calling for Biden to step down didn't know how to fight tough. The person insisted on anonymity to discuss the closed-door gathering.\n\nUnited Auto Workers President Shawn Fain, who Biden had actively courted during last year's strikes, was not recognized to speak while Biden was in the room. But he later pushed Biden's team to explain their plans for beating Trump.\n\nSo far, the unions are sticking with the Biden administration, despite widespread fears that his age handicaps his candidacy after his shaky performance in the June 27 debate. The AFL-CIO said Thursday that Biden's \"fighting spirit\" was on full display in the back and forth with union leaders.\n\nStill, some statements of support are also worded diplomatically to suggest a degree of flexibility in case Biden chooses to drop out -- saying they back the Biden-Harris administration and not just Biden personally.\n\nThe AFL-CIO said it unanimously voted on Thursday to \"reaffirm\" its backing of \"President Joe Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris, the leadership of the most pro-union administration in our lifetimes.\"\n\nAfter Biden was interviewed by ABC News last week in the aftermath of his poor debate, Randi Weingarten, president of the American Federation of Teachers, posted on X: \"Biden is an incredible President and tonight we saw that he's on top of the details. He has my support and we're ready to keep working for Biden-Harris to win in November.\"\n\nSome union leaders have been more targeted in their support for Biden and his continued candidacy.\n\nUnited Steelworkers International President David McCall said before Wednesday's meeting that his union \"proudly supports\" Biden, saying that his \"record of delivering for working people stands for itself.\"\n\nKenneth Cooper, president of the International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers, was also firmly behind Biden, saying that his union members \"couldn't ask for a stronger advocate.\"\n\nWednesday's meeting was a test of whether Biden's emphasis on policy and loyalty to Democratic constituencies such as unions can overcome doubts about his candidacy.\n\nOver the course of his term, Biden has tied his administration to the idea that labor unions built the middle class. He visited a picket line during the auto strikes, backed the steelworkers union in objecting to Nippon Steel taking over U.S. Steel, saved pensions for union workers as part of his pandemic aid and sided with unions on a new rule to make more workers eligible for overtime pay.\n\nBiden is so mindful of union workers that he recently canceled a speech planned for the conference of the National Education Association in Philadelphia after the union's staff announced a strike and formed a picket line.\n\nOne person familiar with the labor movement's thinking said there is an acknowledgment that Biden lost some ground among voters after the debate, but the unions have found that one-on-one conversations about Biden's agenda are mattering more to members and their families than his age and health. Their pitch is that Biden's agenda has directly helped union workers while Trump's plans could leave them worse off.\n\nThe AFL-CIO has raised 42 specific objections to Trump's time as president from 2017 to 2021. It noted that the Republican, who recently proposed making tips paid to workers tax-free, had also as president implemented a proposal to let bosses pocket their employees' tips, among other concerns about his tax cuts and efforts to restrict unionization.\n\nTrump has also made a play for union members, having met in January with officials in the Teamsters Union and saying afterward that although Republicans generally don't get backing from organized labor, \"in my case it's different because I've employed thousands of Teamsters and I thought we should come over and pay our respects.\"\n\nThe former president has portrayed himself as supporting blue-collar workers, with the Teamsters president Sean O'Brien later saying that there's \"no doubt\" that Trump enjoys some support from union members. O'Brien is scheduled to speak at the Republican National Convention next week in Milwaukee at Trump's invitation.\n\nIn 2020, AP VoteCast found that 16% of voters came from union households and 56% of them supported Biden. Biden and Trump essentially split non-union households in Michigan, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin, meaning that the Democrat's edge with union households was likely a critical factor in his victory.\n\nCopyright 2024 The Associated Press.

His sit-down with union officials also overlaps with the NATO summit in Washington, where Biden is navigating geopolitics with other world leaders.\n\nBiden spoke with a handheld mic and no teleprompter in sight. He thanked the union leaders for their support, and outlined his plans for the future seeking to cast aside doubt over his reelection campaign. Biden is close to many union leaders who were in room, and considers AFL-CIO president Liz Shuler to be a personal friend.\n\n\"I said I'm going to be the most pro-union president in American history,\" Biden told the cheering crowd. \"Well, guess what? I am.\"\n\nIn announcing Biden, Shuler told the room he has supported jobs, manufacturing and created good union jobs in clean energy. She flat-out told the president that he had the union's support.\n\n\"You've always had our back -- we have your back,\" Shuler said to the president.\n\nThe council is composed of more than 50 officials from the unions that compose the AFL-CIO, with the group representing 12.5 million union members.\n\nA person familiar with the meeting said it reflected some of the divisions among Democrats about Biden. One union leader pushed Biden to do more to show he's a fighter, while the head of the North America's Building Trades Unions said the Democrats calling for Biden to step down didn't know how to fight tough. The person insisted on anonymity to discuss the closed-door gathering.\n\nUnited Auto Workers President Shawn Fain, who Biden had actively courted during last year's strikes, was not recognized to speak while Biden was in the room. But he later pushed Biden's team to explain their plans for beating Trump.\n\nSo far, the unions are sticking with the Biden administration, despite widespread fears that his age handicaps his candidacy after his shaky performance in the June 27 debate. The AFL-CIO said Thursday that Biden's \"fighting spirit\" was on full display in the back and forth with union leaders.\n\nStill, some statements of support are also worded diplomatically to suggest a degree of flexibility in case Biden chooses to drop out -- saying they back the Biden-Harris administration and not just Biden personally.\n\nThe AFL-CIO said it unanimously voted on Thursday to \"reaffirm\" its backing of \"President Joe Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris, the leadership of the most pro-union administration in our lifetimes.\"\n\nAfter Biden was interviewed by ABC News last week in the aftermath of his poor debate, Randi Weingarten, president of the American Federation of Teachers, posted on X: \"Biden is an incredible President and tonight we saw that he's on top of the details. He has my support and we're ready to keep working for Biden-Harris to win in November.\"\n\nSome union leaders have been more targeted in their support for Biden and his continued candidacy.\n\nUnited Steelworkers International President David McCall said before Wednesday's meeting that his union \"proudly supports\" Biden, saying that his \"record of delivering for working people stands for itself.\"\n\nKenneth Cooper, president of the International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers, was also firmly behind Biden, saying that his union members \"couldn't ask for a stronger advocate.\"\n\nWednesday's meeting was a test of whether Biden's emphasis on policy and loyalty to Democratic constituencies such as unions can overcome doubts about his candidacy.\n\nOver the course of his term, Biden has tied his administration to the idea that labor unions built the middle class. He visited a picket line during the auto strikes, backed the steelworkers union in objecting to Nippon Steel taking over U.S. Steel, saved pensions for union workers as part of his pandemic aid and sided with unions on a new rule to make more workers eligible for overtime pay.\n\nBiden is so mindful of union workers that he recently canceled a speech planned for the conference of the National Education Association in Philadelphia after the union's staff announced a strike and formed a picket line.\n\nOne person familiar with the labor movement's thinking said there is an acknowledgment that Biden lost some ground among voters after the debate, but the unions have found that one-on-one conversations about Biden's agenda are mattering more to members and their families than his age and health. Their pitch is that Biden's agenda has directly helped union workers while Trump's plans could leave them worse off.\n\nThe AFL-CIO has raised 42 specific objections to Trump's time as president from 2017 to 2021. It noted that the Republican, who recently proposed making tips paid to workers tax-free, had also as president implemented a proposal to let bosses pocket their employees' tips, among other concerns about his tax cuts and efforts to restrict unionization.\n\nTrump has also made a play for union members, having met in January with officials in the Teamsters Union and saying afterward that although Republicans generally don't get backing from organized labor, \"in my case it's different because I've employed thousands of Teamsters and I thought we should come over and pay our respects.\"\n\nThe former president has portrayed himself as supporting blue-collar workers, with the Teamsters president Sean O'Brien later saying that there's \"no doubt\" that Trump enjoys some support from union members. O'Brien is scheduled to speak at the Republican National Convention next week in Milwaukee at Trump's invitation.\n\nIn 2020, AP VoteCast found that 16% of voters came from union households and 56% of them supported Biden. Biden and Trump essentially split non-union households in Michigan, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin, meaning that the Democrat's edge with union households was likely a critical factor in his victory.\n\nCopyright 2024 The Associated Press.

He extolled the power of unions and told them of his longstanding support for them, telling the crowd even Wall Street was acknowledging the power of unions.\n\nHours later in the Oval Office, when a reporter asked him about an opinion piece written by George Clooney in which the actor implored Biden to leave the 2024 race, the president responded with \"AFL-CIO!\" paused, pumped his fists and added, \"Go, go, go.\"\n\nPeople are also reading...

His sit-down with union officials also overlaps with the NATO summit in Washington, where Biden is navigating geopolitics with other world leaders.\n\nBiden spoke with a handheld mic and no teleprompter in sight. He thanked the union leaders for their support, and outlined his plans for the future seeking to cast aside doubt over his reelection campaign. Biden is close to many union leaders who were in room, and considers AFL-CIO president Liz Shuler to be a personal friend.\n\nIn announcing Biden, Shuler told the room he has supported jobs, manufacturing and created good union jobs in clean energy. She flat out told the president that he had union's support.\n\n\"You've always had our back -- we have your back,\" Shuler said to the president.\n\nThe council is composed of more than 50 officials from the unions that compose the AFL-CIO, with the group representing 12.5 million union members.\n\nSo far, the unions are sticking with the Biden administration despite widespread fears that his age handicaps his candidacy after his shaky performance in the June 27 debate. But some statements of support are also worded diplomatically to suggest a degree of flexibility in case Biden chooses to drop out -- saying they back the Biden-Harris administration and not just Biden personally.\n\n\"I said I'm going to be the most pro-union president in American history,\" Biden told the cheering crowd. \"Well. guess what? I am.\"\n\nAfter Biden was interviewed by ABC News last week in the aftermath of his poor debate, Randi Weingarten, president of the American Federation of Teachers, posted on X: \"Biden is an incredible President and tonight we saw that he's on top of the details. He has my support and we're ready to keep working for Biden-Harris to win in November.\"\n\nSome union leaders have been more targeted in their support for Biden and his continued candidacy.\n\nUnited Steelworkers International President David McCall said before Wednesday's meeting that his union \"proudly supports\" Biden, saying that his \"record of delivering for working people stands for itself.\"\n\nKenneth Cooper, president of the International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers, was also firmly behind Biden, saying that his union members \"couldn't ask for a stronger advocate.\"\n\nWednesday's meeting has become a test of the union movement's strategy to emphasize Biden's policy agenda as a way to overcome doubts about his candidacy. Biden routinely holds his events at union halls. He has conversed regularly with several of the union leaders at Wednesday's meeting, knowing that the group is a key link at the local level to the voters that he says make him the Democrats' best candidate in November.\n\nOver the course of his term, Biden has tied his administration to the idea that labor unions built the middle class. He visited a picket line during the auto strikes, backed the steelworkers union in objecting to Nippon Steel taking over U.S. Steel, saved pensions for union workers as part of his pandemic aid and sided with unions on a new rule to make more workers eligible for overtime pay.\n\nBiden is so mindful of union workers that he recently canceled a speech planned for the conference of the National Education Association in Philadelphia after the union's staff announced a strike and formed a picket line.\n\nOne person familiar with the labor movement's thinking said there is an acknowledgment that Biden lost some ground among voters after the debate, but the unions have found that one-on-one conversations about Biden's agenda are mattering more to members and their families than his age and health. Their pitch is that Biden's agenda has directly helped union workers while Trump's plans could leave them worse off.\n\nThe AFL-CIO has raised 42 specific objections to Trump's time as president from 2017 to 2021. It noted that the Republican, who recently proposed making tips paid to workers tax-free, had also as president implemented a proposal to let bosses pocket their employees' tips, among other concerns about his tax cuts and efforts to restrict unionization.\n\nTrump has also made a play for union members, having met in January with officials in the Teamsters Union and saying afterward that although Republicans generally don't get backing from organized labor, \"in my case it's different because I've employed thousands of Teamsters and I thought we should come over and pay our respects.\"\n\nThe former president has portrayed himself as supporting blue-collar workers, with the Teamsters president Sean O'Brien later saying that there's \"no doubt\" that Trump enjoys some support from union members. O'Brien is scheduled to speak at the Republican National Convention next week in Milwaukee at Trump's invitation.\n\nIn 2020, AP VoteCast found that 16% of voters came from union households and 56% of them supported Biden. Biden and Trump essentially split non-union households in Michigan, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin, meaning that the Democrat's edge with union households was likely a critical factor in his victory.\n\nCopyright 2024 The Associated Press.

The publication said union leaders want Biden to spell out his plan for beating Trump. Biden is coming under increasing pressure to step aside after his disastrous debate against Trump.\n\nJoe Biden this week described himself as the most pro-union president in US history.\n\n\"I think of you as my domestic NATO -- not a joke,\" the president said during a speech on Wednesday to the executive council of the AFL-CIO, America's largest federation of trade unions.\n\nBiden regularly plays up his support from unions, and he may just be counting on it for his survival.\n\nBut that support could be about to break.\n\nAccording to The Washington Post, top union leaders have privately expressed concerns about Biden's ability to beat Trump in November.\n\nThe Post, citing two anonymous sources familiar with the comments, said union leaders repeatedly asked Biden campaign officials for their plan on how to defeat Trump in a closed-door meeting on Wednesday.\n\nThe report said Sara Nelson, president of the Association of Flight Attendants, and Shawn Fain, president of the United Auto Workers, were among the most outspoken attendees.\n\nThe Association of Flight Attendants and the United Auto Workers did not immediately reply to a request by Business Insider for comment.\n\nMore members of Biden's senior campaign staff are also beginning to doubt his future, the Post said.\n\n\"Overwhelmingly a majority of senior campaign staff are despondent and don't see a path,\" a Democratic strategist familiar with the conversations told the publication.\n\nFor now, union leaders are continuing to publicly support the president. In a statement Wednesday, AFL-CIO leadership said it had \"unanimously voted to reaffirm its commitment,\" adding that \"no president has been more invested in helping workers than Joe Biden.\"\n\nUnited Steelworkers International President David McCall said before Wednesday's meeting that his union \"proudly supports\" Biden and that his \"record of delivering for working people stands for itself.\"\n\nLosing support from labor\n\nAccording to Politico's Jonathan Martin, support from the unions is likely Biden's only path to survival against Trump.\n\nJust days ago, Anita Dunn, Biden's longtime advisor, told Politico: \"The people Joe Biden fights for -- middle-class labor union members, Blacks, Latinos -- they know he fights for them, and they're going to stay in the fight for him.\"\n\nBiden and other Democrats have regularly touted the president's pro-labor credentials.\n\nThe AFL-CIO told the Associated Press on Thursday that Biden's \"fighting spirit\" was on full display during his meeting with union leaders this week.\n\nThe AP noted that some statements of support were worded diplomatically in case Biden caves in to pressure to drop out.\n\nThat pressure is growing after Biden's disastrous performance in the June 27 presidential debate against Trump, which has raised questions about his age and mental agility.\n\nCBS/YouGov poll on June 30 found that 72% of registered voters believe Biden does not have the mental and cognitive health to be president, while reports say that behind closed doors, Biden has also shown signs of aging, including fumbling remarks and appearing forgetful at a recent D-Day event with world leaders\n\nSen. Peter Welch of Vermont, in an op-ed in the Post on Wednesday, became the first Democratic senator to call on Biden to step aside, saying it was \"for the good of the country.\"\n\nHollywood actor and Democratic supporter George Clooney, in an op-ed in The New York Times, said that the Biden he met at a fundraising event three weeks ago wasn't the Joe Biden of 2010.\n\nHe \"wasn't even the Joe Biden of 2020,\" said Clooney.\"He was the same man we all witnessed at the debate.\"\n\nMeanwhile, Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer privately told donors he's open to replacing Biden as the party's presidential nominee, Axios reported, citing three unnamed sources familiar with the matter.\n\nAnd on Wednesday, Nancy Pelosi, who stepped down as speaker early last year, failed to clearly endorse Biden as the Democratic candidate.\n\nIf union leaders join the chorus of voices asking Biden to step down, other key supporters may quickly follow.\n\nRead the original article on Business

Become an Insider and start reading now. Have an account? Log in.\n\nAccording to The Washington Post, top union leaders have privately expressed concerns about Biden's ability to beat Trump in November.\n\nThe Post, citing two anonymous sources familiar with the comments, said union leaders repeatedly asked Biden campaign officials for their plan on how to defeat Trump in a closed-door meeting on Wednesday.\n\nThe report said Sara Nelson, president of the Association of Flight Attendants, and Shawn Fain, president of the United Auto Workers, were among the most outspoken attendees.\n\nThe Association of Flight Attendants and the United Auto Workers did not immediately reply to a request by Business Insider for comment.\n\nMore members of Biden's senior campaign staff are also beginning to doubt his future, the Post said.\n\n\"Overwhelmingly a majority of senior campaign staff are despondent and don't see a path,\" a Democratic strategist familiar with the conversations told the publication.\n\nFor now, union leaders are continuing to publicly support the president. In a statement Wednesday, AFL-CIO leadership said it had \"unanimously voted to reaffirm its commitment,\" adding that \"no president has been more invested in helping workers than Joe Biden.\"\n\nUnited Steelworkers International President David McCall said before Wednesday's meeting that his union \"proudly supports\" Biden and that his \"record of delivering for working people stands for itself.\"\n\nAccording to Politico's Jonathan Martin, support from the unions is likely Biden's only path to survival against Trump.\n\nJust days ago, Anita Dunn, Biden's longtime advisor, told Politico: \"The people Joe Biden fights for -- middle-class labor union members, Blacks, Latinos -- they know he fights for them, and they're going to stay in the fight for him.\n\nBiden and other Democrats have regularly touted the president's pro-labor credentials.\n\nThe AFL-CIO told the Associated Press on Thursday that Biden's \"fighting spirit\" was on full display during his meeting with union leaders this week.\n\nThe AP noted that some statements of support were worded diplomatically in case Biden caves in to pressure to drop out.\n\nThat pressure is growing after Biden's disastrous performance in the June 27 presidential debate against Trump, which has raised questions about his age and mental agility.\n\nCBS/YouGov poll on June 30 found that 72% of registered voters believe Biden does not have the mental and cognitive health to be president, while reports say that behind closed doors, Biden has also shown signs of aging, including fumbling remarks and appearing forgetful at a recent D-Day event with world leaders\n\nSen. Peter Welch of Vermont, in an op-ed in the Post on Wednesday, became the first Democratic senator to call on Biden to step aside, saying it was \"for the good of the country.\"\n\nHollywood actor and Democratic supporter George Clooney, in an op-ed in The New York Times, said that the Biden he met at a fundraising event three weeks ago wasn't the Joe Biden of 2010.\n\nHe \"wasn't even the Joe Biden of 2020,\" said Clooney.\"He was the same man we all witnessed at the debate.\"\n\nMeanwhile, Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer privately told donors he's open to replacing Biden as the party's presidential nominee, Axios reported, citing three unnamed sources familiar with the matter.\n\nAnd on Wednesday, Nancy Pelosi, who stepped down as speaker early last year, failed to clearly endorse Biden as the Democratic candidate.\n\nIf union leaders join the chorus of voices asking Biden to step down, other key supporters may quickly follow.", "source": {"uri": "businessinsider.com",

His meeting with the Executive Council, including the heads of unions with over 12 million members, was preceded by brief public remarks.\n\nThe corporate media reported on the event primarily from the standpoint of Biden's efforts to shore up his flagging election campaign by appealing to his base in \"organized labor,\" in reality, the trade union bureaucracy. But the fact that the visit took place only minutes before the second day of the NATO summit underscores the role of the unions as critical in preparing the \"home front\" for war.\n\nIn his opening remarks, Biden said perhaps more than he intended in drawing the connection between imperialist war abroad and the use of the AFL-CIO to suppress the class struggle at home.\n\n\"We have two strong, strong organizations in America that I look to for our security. One is NATO, a joint assembly of democracies to make sure that we're keeping the peace, and that no one is going to screw around with us, is a strong as it's ever been. And I look at you as my domestic NATO,\" he told the assembled AFL-CIO bureaucrats.\n\nWhile NATO is used for American imperialism's wars in the Middle East and against Russia and China, the president did not say who the enemy he needed the labor bureaucracy to wage war against. But it is the American working class.\n\nBiden gave a public speech apparently intended to show his \"vigor\" and dispel concerns about his age and mental fitness. But he stammered and tripped over his words while delivering a speech on the US economy that bore no relation to reality. \"We're going to build this country from the bottom-up and the middle-out, not the top-down,\" he claimed, immediately contradicting himself by pointing to the support for his economic platform by Wall Street.\n\nHe then claimed that the US was the \"fastest-growing economy in the world.\" Whether this is what he meant to say or not, it is an absurd falsehood. According to the latest International Monetary Fund figures, annual GDP growth in the US is 2.7 percent. This is below Egypt, Albania and Ukraine. However, under Biden corporate profits have surged past already-record levels.\n\nFar from building the economy from the \"bottom up,\" the basis of this \"success\" has been massive attacks on the working class. A central plank of his domestic economic policy is curbing wage growth through higher interest rates, austerity measures and by working with the union bureaucracy to block or limit strikes. The result is that since the start of 2023, US companies have announced more than 1 million layoffs.\n\nThe aim of this policy is to both smash resistance in the working class to poverty wages and terrible working conditions and to free up resources for war. In the latest federal budget, military spending reached $850 billion dollars.\n\nJerry White, the Socialist Equality Party's vice presidential candidate, responded to Biden's speech:\n\nIt came as no surprise that the AFL-CIO Executive Board lined up behind Biden Wednesday and hailed him as a conquering hero. This underscores the complete integration of the bureaucrats with the Democratic Party, and through it, American imperialism. Boasting about his reliance of the AFL-CIO to wage war abroad and war against the working class at home, Biden told the union bureaucrats: \"You are my domestic NATO.\"\n\nBiden's corporatist policy draws together the union apparatus with corporate America and the military-industrial complex to protect the so-called \"national interest.\" This means defending American imperialism's interests on the backs of the working class. In one major national contract after another for the past four years, Biden has worked closely with his agents in the unions to block or limit strikes and impose contracts with historic concessions.\n\nThis includes the national rail contract in 2022, when Biden intervened to ban a strike after workers rejected a contract he brokered. It also includes the new contract in the auto industry, which Biden personally campaigned for. In the months since it was passed, thousands of autoworkers have lost their jobs.\n\nThe union bureaucrats all support the war in Ukraine, which raises the danger of nuclear war. As for the Gaza genocide, they either openly support it, as is the case for American Federation of Teachers President Randi Weingarten, or have attempted to get in front of rank-and-file anger by passing toothless \"ceasefire\" resolutions, even as they continue to support \"Genocide Joe.\"\n\nFor now, most of the union apparatus continues to back Biden, in spite of his deep unpopularity among workers and as growing numbers of his billionaire backers and political allies call for him to step down. The AFL-CIO tweeted on his visit, \"No president has been more invested in expanding the labor movement and empowering workers than President Joe Biden. We were honored to welcome the President back to the House of Labor today and stand in strong solidarity with the Biden-Harris ticket.\"\n\nSome sections of the bureaucracy are hedging their bets. The Teamsters, for example, are courting Trump. Next week, Teamsters President Sean O'Brien will speak at the Republican National Convention in Milwaukee, which will have the character of a Nuremberg-style rally to coronate Trump.\n\nAs the WSWS has pointed out for some time, its undying support for capitalism and hatred of socialism, its extreme nationalism and gangster methods against rank-and-file resistance has long made the labor bureaucracy fertile ground for fascism.\n\nWhether they back Biden, another Democrat or the fascistic Republicans, the affluent layers who make up the labor bureaucracy are inherently drawn to the capitalist state to defend their privileged positions against an increasingly militant and radicalized working class.\n\nIn his statement, White concluded:\n\nBiden's appearance only underscores that the working class has to rebel against the entire union apparatus and build new organizations of workers' power, rank-and-file committees. In particular, it underscores the correctness of autoworkers' demands for new elections in the United Auto Workers. New revelations confirm UAW President Fain, a top Biden ally, was elected on the basis of mass vote suppression and is deeply implicated in corruption.\n\nThe fight against the union bureaucracy is a political struggle. Behind the Fains and Weingartens stand the capitalist state and both parties. They depend on the services of the union bureaucracies to prevent working class opposition from escaping the control of official, corporate-controlled channels. But that is exactly what must happen. Inequality, war, the threat of dictatorship and every other social problem requires the mobilization of the working class against the capitalist system that the bureaucracy defends.\n\nRead moreDemand a new UAW election!

The AFL-CIO is the country's largest union federation, with members including the American Federation of Teachers, the American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees, and the United Food and Commercial Workers International Union.\n\n\"This is the latest example of President Biden rallying the Biden-Harris coalition this week around the stakes of this election,\" Biden campaign spokesman Seth Schuster wrote Wednesday of Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris. \"As the president spelled out in a letter [Monday] to congressional Democrats: he is staying in the race, and he will beat Donald Trump in November.\n\n\"He then reaffirmed his commitment and answered questions on Morning Joe, to supporters, with the Congressional Black Caucus (CBC), and to Democratic mayors from across the country on Tuesday night,\" Schuster said. \"Last week, he met with Democratic governors, attended a black church service in Philadelphia, organized with union members in Harrisburg, and more.\"\n\nIn addition to Biden's Pennsylvania itinerary from last weekend, Schuster also underscored Biden's travel last week to Wisconsin and his trip Friday to Michigan, before he is expected in Nevada and Texas next week.\n\nBiden's sit-down with AFL-CIO union leaders is part of his presidential outreach as he tries to convince Democrats to keep him as their party's nominee after last month's debate in which he performed poorly, losing his train of thought.\n\nCLICK HERE TO READ MORE FROM THE WASHINGTON EXAMINER\n\nBiden told the Democratic Mayors Association on Tuesday that he and his administration, in collaboration with their own aides, have been \"making enormous progress.\"\n\n\"We're going to make sure that we focus on the things that affect people in my city in Wilmington, Delaware, my hometown, as well as yours,\" he said. \"This campaign is going to be won with basic block-and-tackling. ...

This administration sparked an industrial renaissance; saved workers' pensions and hundreds of thousands of public servant jobs; expanded overtime pay; and invested in millions of good union jobs, particularly in construction. Unions have never wavered in our support of Joe Biden and Kamala Harris because they've never wavered in their commitment to working people, including the vigorous support of workers' right to organize. That's just as true today as when we endorsed the ticket more than a year ago.\n\nThe labor movement understands, as Joe Biden does, that solidarity is how we win. The message from today's meeting couldn't have been clearer: Right now, it's time to come together around a vision of a country where everyone has a fair shot with a living wage, affordable health care, retirement security, and time to do the things we love like spending time with family and friends and pursuing our interests and passions. These are fundamental to, as the president reiterated to our meeting, building the economy from the bottom up and the middle out, not the top down.\n\nThe labor movement is united behind President Biden and Vice President Harris.

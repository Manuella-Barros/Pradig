But as prosecutors prepare to retry him, a new bill making its way through the New York state legislature could give them a powerful weapon.\n\nThe bill, introduced by state Assemblymember Amy Paulin, would allow evidence of prior bad acts to be admitted in sexual assault trials -- the kind of evidence that led the New York Court of Appeals to toss out Weinstein's guilty verdict last month.\n\nSurvivors hope the bill would allow witnesses who say Weinstein assaulted them to testify again, even though he is not charged with crimes related to those incidents.\n\n\"Weinstein's conviction being overturned has made me realize that our laws do not consider sexual abuse survivors,\" Taral\u00ea Wulff, one of the witnesses whose testimony was thrown out, told The Daily Beast. \"We must be proactive in addressing these shortcomings in our legal system.\"\n\nPaulin, a senior member of the New York State Assembly and a rape survivor, told The Daily Beast she introduced the bill in February 2023 in anticipation of a decision like the one in the Weinstein appeal.\n\n\"After we saw that the judge had allowed [this] evidence, we just wanted to be sure that we were covered,\" Paulin told the Daily Beast. \"I didn't expect to need the bill, but as it turned out, it was a good thing.\"\n\nThe bill is in committee and the legislative session ends June 6, but Paulin is hopeful that outrage over the Weinstein decision could push it over the line. The measure has been endorsed by survivors' rights groups Sanctuary for Families and the Joyful Heart Foundation, and Paulin said the committee chair is supportive and will appear at a press conference for the bill on Thursday.\n\nThe original version of the bill would have taken effect 30 days after it was signed into law. An amendment added Thursday would have the bill take effect immediately, with the aim of it being in effect for Weinstein's trial.\n\nA spokesperson for Gov. Kathy Hochul's office told The Daily Beast they would review the legislation. Hochul said last week that her office was \"analyzing the scale of [the Weinstein] decision, the impact, what it means, and how we can make sure that all women feel safe coming forward, that they can tell what happened to them.\"\n\nThe Manhattan District Attorney's office said it is \"working hand-in-hand with stakeholders to modernize and clarify New York's laws pertaining to Molineux evidence so prosecutors around the state can better secure justice for survivors.\" They declined to comment on how the bill would affect a retrial.\n\nWeinstein survivors and accusers are rallying around the bill, hoping to get it enacted before the retrial. A coalition holding a press conference Thursday at the New York headquarters of the National Organization for Women includes Ambra Gutierrez, a model who told police that Weintein assaulted her in 2015 but never saw charges filed.\n\n\"I was really surprised when the conviction was overturned over the fact that a lot of victims were speaking about their experience,' Gutteirez told The Daily Beast. \"So I just feel and believe firmly that something like this has to be fixed, because it's really nonsense.\"\n\nGuttierez is part of an advocacy group called the Model Alliance, which is pushing for its own bill, the Fashion Workers Act, in Albany this session. The group's founder, Sara Ziff, filed a sexual assault suit last year accusing former Weinsten associate Fabrizio Lombardo. That case is a civil matter, so the bill would not affect it, but Ziff said the Alliance still saw the legislation as a \"no-brainer.\"\n\n\"I understand from my decade of advocacy and speaking with survivors that perpetrators like Weintsein operate within a system and more often than not there are multiple victims,\" Ziff said. \"It only makes sense that this be corrected.\"\n\nSix women testified in Weinstein's 2020 trial, at which he was convicted of raping one woman and forcibly performing oral sex on another and was sentenced to 23 years in prison. Three of those women were what is known as Molineux witnesses, who spoke about assaults they said Weinstein committed against them but that did not result in charges.\n\nThe 4-3 decision from the appeals court found that those witnesses should not have been allowed to testify, and threw out the disgraced producer's conviction. He remains in prison for his rape conviction in Los Angeles, and Manhattan prosecutors have promised to retry him for the New York crimes.\n\nAllowing for Molineux witnesses in New York criminal trials could bolster the case against Weinstein and other sexual assault cases in the state. Sixteen states currently allow for such evidence to be admitted at trial, and several others allow it in specific instances.\n\nJane Manning, a former sex crimes prosecutor and supporter of the bill, says this kind of evidence is especially important in cases like Weinstein's, where the alleged crime happened behind closed doors.\n\n\"[These trials] will often rely heavily on the testimony of the survivor, and all those dynamics of rape victims -- victim blaming and rape myths and and reflexive disbelief -- will come into play,\" she said. \"Allowing the voices of other survivors to be heard during a trial, it just offers a little leveling of the field.\"\n\nShe added that the five and a half days that jurors took to deliberate on Weintein's case, as well as their decision to acquit him on some charges, showed the testimony of prior bad act witnesses did not overly bias the jury.\n\n\"This kind of evidence is really relevant, it's really probative, and I think jurors have shown they can handle it and give it the correct amount of weight,\" she said.", "source": {"uri": "thedailybeast.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Daily Beast"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

(AP) -- New York lawmakers may soon change the legal standard that allowed Harvey Weinstein's rape conviction to be overturned, with momentum building behind a bill to strengthen sexual assault prosecutions after the disgraced movie mogul's case was tossed.\n\nThe state's highest court late last month threw out Weinstein's conviction in a ruling that said a trial judge wrongly allowed women to testify about allegations that weren't part of his criminal charges.\n\nTwo weeks later, lawmakers are pushing a bill that would allow courts to admit evidence that a defendant in a sex crimes case committed other sexual offenses, while also giving a judge discretion to bar such testimony if it would create \"undue prejudice\" against a defendant.\n\n\"In sexual assault cases, which typically rely on testimony of the survivor, it is essential and critical. It allows a perpetrator's pattern of behavior to be presented in court,\" Assemblymember Amy Paulin, a Democrat sponsoring the bill, said at a rally for the legislation in New York City on Thursday.\n\nWATCH: Anita Hill discusses overturn of Weinstein's rape conviction and what it means for #MeToo\n\nNew York does allow such evidence to be used in some instances, such as to prove a motive or common scheme, though backers of the bill, which include the deputy leader of the state Senate, said the current rule is in need of clarification after the Weinstein decision.\n\nPaulin said 16 other states have similar laws, as does the federal government.\n\nWeinstein, 72, has denied the New York charges. He is accused of raping an aspiring actor in 2013 and sexually assaulting a production assistant in 2006. His conviction in 2020 was a key moment in the #MeToo movement, a reckoning with sexual misconduct in American society.\n\nNew York prosecutors are seeking a September retrial for Weinstein. The former film executive has also been convicted of a rape in California and sentenced to 16 years in prison there. He is currently jailed in New York.\n\nThe bill has drawn early criticism from the Legal Aid Society. Amanda Jack, a policy director at the group, said the proposal is overly broad and \"will move us so far away from any sense of fairness and due process that it must be rejected as a dangerous undoing of our system of criminal trials.\"\n\nHeather Ellis Cucolo, a professor at the New York Law School, said admitting such evidence requires delicate consideration from the court but could help jurors in sexual assault cases where two people are giving conflicting accounts of an incident.\n\n\"It's incredibly difficult to weigh the evidence when it's that he said she said, so the whole purpose then of using prior bad acts is to hopefully show that this is a pattern. This is something that this person has done with other victims,\" she said.", "source": {"uri": "pbs.org", "dataType": "news", "title": "PBS.org"}, "authors": [{"uri": "associated_press@pbs.org", "name": "Associated Press", "type": "author", "isAgency": true}, {"uri": "anthony_izaguirre@pbs.org", "name": "Anthony Izaguirre", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_(state)", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "New York (state)"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harvey_Weinstein", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Harvey Weinstein"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sexual_assault", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Sexual assault"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rape", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Rape"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Defendant", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Defendant"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MeToo_movement", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "MeToo movement"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/State_supreme_court", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "State supreme court"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bar_association", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Bar association"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Albany,_New_York", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Albany, New York"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Albany, New York"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anita_Hill", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Anita Hill"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/California_State_Senate", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "California State Senate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/California_State_Assembly", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "California State Assembly"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Democratic Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_government_of_the_United_States", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Federal government of the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amy_Paulin", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Amy Paulin"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_City", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "New York City"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "New York City"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Legal_Aid_Society", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "The Legal Aid Society"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_Law_School", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "New York Law School"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Criminal_procedure", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Criminal procedure"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Due_process", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Due process"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jury", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Jury"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Associated_Press", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Associated Press"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/California", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "California"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "California"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Sex_Offenses", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Sex Offenses", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Crime_and_Justice", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Crime and Justice", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Victims", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Victims", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Law", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Law", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 93}], "image": "https://d3i6fh83elv35t.cloudfront.net/static/2020/01/2020-01-31T221603Z_503256670_RC2ARE9EMRNP_RTRMADP_3_PEOPLE-HARVEY-WEINSTEIN-1024x683.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9554599", "eventUri": "eng-9554599", "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Albany, New York"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.3333333333333334, "wgt": 211, "relevance": 1}

Before joining Raw Story, he wrote for Shareblue and AlterNet, specializing in election and policy coverage.\n\nFormer film mogul Harvey Weinstein got a break last month when a New York appeals court tossed his sexual assault conviction, ruling that the prosecutors improperly used prior bad acts as evidence at his trial.\n\nBut the outrage over that decision might mean New York could swiftly change how sexual assault cases are prosecuted -- and he could find himself swiftly convicted on the same evidence when he is retried.\n\nAccording to The Daily Beast, \"As prosecutors prepare to retry him, a new bill making its way through the New York state legislature could give them a powerful weapon. The bill, introduced by state Assemblymember Amy Paulin, would allow evidence of prior bad acts to be admitted in sexual assault trials ... Survivors hope the bill would allow witnesses who say Weinstein assaulted them to testify again, even though he is not charged with crimes related to those incidents.\"\n\nWeinstein, once a titan in Hollywood, has had more than 100 women come forward to describe horrific acts of rape and abuse at his hands.\n\n\"After we saw that the judge had allowed [this] evidence, we just wanted to be sure that we were covered,\" said Paulin, herself a sexual assault survivor. \"I didn't expect to need the bill, but as it turned out, it was a good thing.\" The bill is currently in committee, and Paulin is hopeful it can be passed before the current legislative session ends next month.\n\nALSO READ: Marjorie Taylor Greene is buying stocks again. Some picks pose a conflict of interest\n\nRegardless of the legislation's passage or the outcome of the new trial, Weinstein will remain behind bars because he was separately convicted on charges in California. But New York lawmakers hope this legislation will allow for easier prosecution in future cases.\n\n\"Weinstein survivors and accusers are rallying around the bill, hoping to get it enacted before the retrial. A coalition holding a press conference Thursday at the New York headquarters of the National Organization for Women includes Ambra Gutierrez, a model who told police that Weintein assaulted her in 2015 but never saw charges filed,\" said the report, with Gutteirez telling The Daily Beast, \"I was really surprised when the conviction was overturned over the fact that a lot of victims were speaking about their experience.

It allows a perpetrator's pattern of behavior to be presented in court,\" Assemblymember Amy Paulin, a Democrat sponsoring the bill, said at a rally for the legislation in New York City on Thursday.\n\nNew York does allow such evidence to be used in some instances, such as to prove a motive or common scheme, though backers of the bill, which include the deputy leader of the state Senate, said the current rule is in need of clarification after the Weinstein decision.\n\nPaulin said 16 other states have similar laws, as does the federal government.\n\nWeinstein, 72, has denied the New York charges. He is accused of raping an aspiring actor in 2013 and sexually assaulting a production assistant in 2006. His conviction in 2020 was a key moment in the #MeToo movement, a reckoning with sexual misconduct in American society.\n\nNew York prosecutors are seeking a September retrial for Weinstein. The former film executive has also been convicted of a rape in California and sentenced to 16 years in prison there. He is currently jailed in New York.\n\nThe bill has drawn early criticism from the Legal Aid Society. Amanda Jack, a policy director at the group, said the proposal is overly broad and \"will move us so far away from any sense of fairness and due process that it must be rejected as a dangerous undoing of our system of criminal trials.\"\n\nHeather Ellis Cucolo, a professor at the New York Law School, said admitting such evidence requires delicate consideration from the court but could help jurors in sexual assault cases where two people are giving conflicting accounts of an incident.\n\n\"It's incredibly difficult to weigh the evidence when it's that he said she said, so the whole purpose then of using prior bad acts is to hopefully show that this is a pattern.

Merchan denied the motion, saying the defense had directed the testimony away from the evidence too.\n\nDaniels' account of her encounters with Trump marked one of the tensest days yet of his now-four-week-old trial on charges of falsifying business records to cover up the payments to suppress her story. Prosecutors say the hush money was an attempt to influence the 2016 election.\n\nAttorneys for the presumptive 2024 GOP nominee for president, however, may have helped their case by painting Daniels as opportunistic and vindictive.\n\n\"Am I correct that you hate President Trump?\" defense attorney Susan Necheles asked.\n\n\"Yes,\" Daniels responded, who added she wanted Trump \"held accountable.\"\n\nMeanwhile, with Trump potentially facing jail time for violating his gag order, Mayor Eric Adams told reporters Rikers Island stands ready, though he said he didn't want to discuss a hypothetical scenario.\n\nDaniels is set to return to the stand on Thursday. -- Emily Ngo\n\nCLASS SIZE DEBATE: Over 850 high-need schools in the city have enough space to lower class sizes by September, an analysis by the city's powerful teachers union found.\n\nMore than 300,000 students attend the 856 schools that get federal money for large percentages of pupils from low-income families, according to the union's survey.\n\n\"It's time for New York City to roll up its sleeves and do what needs to be done,\" United Federation of Teachers president Michael Mulgrew said during a press conference in Lower Manhattan. The DOE, he said, must hire 3,000 educators to reduce class sizes in the schools, at a cost of $180 million.\n\nThis marks the latest push by the union -- for whom the class size law is a priority -- to pressure Adams to comply with the statute, which Adams had called an unfunded mandate.\n\nMulgrew secured key concessions as part of a deal to extend mayoral control of schools for two years that includes more financing capacity to build schools and classrooms.\n\nThe DOE said the price tag would exceed $180 million.\n\n\"We have been in constant engagement with the UFT and [principals union] regarding the class size reduction plan that must be posted today, and we will continue to stay in compliance with the law,\" agency spokesperson Nathaniel Styer said in a statement. -- Madina Tour\u00e9\n\nLINCOLN'S CIVIL WAR: Adams isn't the word police, he often says -- but he sure didn't like Council Member Lincoln Restler's tone at a hearing last week, where he questioned whether the city's Chief Equal Employment Opportunity Officer Melody Ruiz may not be impartial in judging cases of alleged workplace harassment since she is a longtime employee of Adams.\n\n\"Hours later, she was hyperventilating, crying. Her name was maligned,\" Adams said about Ruiz, doubling down on the letter his administration sent asking the council for an ethics investigation into Restler for his conduct.\n\nRestler's questioning was pointed and mildly aggressive -- with the focus being on whether alleged sexual harassment victims of Adams' adviser and ally Tim Pearson would get a fair hearing. But Adams disagreed with Playbook's assessment.\n\nBeing a council member \"does not give you the authority to degrade people,\" he said. \"There should be a level of decorum that's expected as you question. And if that's normal behavior, based on your observation, something is wrong.\"\n\nDo NYPD leaders adhere to that level of decorum, Playbook asked?\n\n\"Yes, they do,\" Adams responded. \"I think we are the kindest and the gentlest and the most loving police department on the globe.\" -- Jeff Coltin\n\nMore from the city:\n\n-- Adams made a 'symbolic gesture' by drinking water at a public housing complex where residents have concerns about toxicity.

But legislators said their testimony is crucial in prosecuting sex crimes and vowed Thursday to pass legislation bringing them back.\n\n\"In sexual assault cases, which typically rely on the testimony of the survivor, it is essential,\" said Assemblywoman Amy Paulin (D-Westchester), one of the bill's sponsors in her chamber.\n\n\"It allows a perpetrator's pattern of behavior to be presented in court. It allows consent defenses, which are most often the defenses used in relationship sexual assault cases, to be effectively refuted.\"\n\nPaulin spoke alongside Wulff and fellow Weinstein Molineux accuser Ambra Gutierrez -- as well as Sara Ziff who sued the former head of Miramax in Italy, Fabrizio Lombardo, for sexual assault aided by the Adult Survivors Act.\n\nState Sen. Michael Gianaris (D-Queens) said he was sponsoring a version of the Senate bill legalizing the use of Molineux witnesses.\n\n\"Very often, [these] cases rely on the testimony of two people with conflicting accounts and therefore we think this justifies an exception to show a pattern of behavior . . . So we are introducing this legislation, hopefully, we get it passed before the session adjourns in a month,\" he said at a press conference hosted at the headquarters of the National Organization for Women.\n\nPaulin said the importance of the witnesses was seen in the Weinstein case.\n\n\"In the Weinstein case, the women were able to testify he used professional advancement as a way to put them in a compromised position, that Harvey Weinstein typically used force to overpower his victims and many if not several had prior consensual acts prior,\" she said.\n\nJudge Jenny Rivera, who wrote the opinion, argued that the Molineux testimony only served to paint Weinstein in a negative light to the jury. Rivera was joined by lefty Chief Judge Rowan Wilson in the opinion.\n\nThe bill in response to the ruling would implement language almost mirroring federal guidelines on evidence, bringing New York in line with over a dozen other states.\n\nGianaris, who is the number two in Senate Democratic leadership, said he hopes to get the bill passed before the end of the legislative session in a few weeks.\n\n\"Hopefully we will get quick progress on this before we adjourn in June,\" Gianaris said.\n\nLawmakers have been scrambling to make a legislative fix since the Weinstein ruling dropped, as the Post first reported two weeks ago.\n\n\"I'm glad that the new legislation by Senator Gianaris and Assembly Member Paulin will allow more survivors of sexual abuse to come forward and help keep creeps like Harvey Weinstein from using their power and influence to prey on victims,\" Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Brad Hoylman-Sigal (D-Manhattan) told the Post.\n\nSenate Majority Leader Andrea Stewart-Cousins (D-Westchester) said she's open to considering a legislative fix, when asked by the Post earlier this week.\n\n\"Obviously if there is some loophole or something that could make the case stronger, we would obviously be interested in looking at that,\" Stewart-Cousins said.\n\nAny push to rectify Molineux may also receive Republican backing. State Sen. Anthony Palumbo (R-Suffolk), Republicans' lead on the Senate Judiciary Committee, said he's been putting together his own legislation which is very similar to the Democrats' bill.\n\n\"Assemblywoman Amy Paulin's sponsorship of a similar bill reflects the bipartisan support to correct this outrageous decision,\" he told the Post.\n\nSpeaking at an unrelated event Thursday, Gov. Kathy Hochul failed to give a clear response to the Weinstein ruling, though she said her legal team is reviewing Paulin and Gianaris' legislation.\n\n\"Every woman has the right to be heard in the courtroom with the appropriate witnesses. We are still examining that law,\" Hochul said.\n\nWulff said she believes that something will be done to help future victims.\n\n\"Honestly, after the shock of learning the conviction being overturned, I immediately started chasing a silver lining,\" Wulff said\n\n\"I thought there has to be a reason why this is happening to us. If that megaphone is on us, then this is the opportunity we have right now to make a change.\"", "source": {"uri": "nypost.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "New York Post"}, "authors": [],

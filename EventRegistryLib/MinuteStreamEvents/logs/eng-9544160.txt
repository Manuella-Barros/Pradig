State-owned Pemex's six domestic refineries processed more than 1mn b/d of crude in March for the first time in almost eight years, boosting its gasoline and diesel output by 32pc and cutting its imports by 25pc from a year earlier. Combined with Pemex's still declining crude production, this has pulled approximately 500,000 b/d of Mexican crude exports -- mostly medium and heavy sour grades -- from the market compared with a 2023 peak of 1.2mn b/d in June -- equivalent to the loss of about 175,000 b/d on average this year compared with 2023. The government said earlier this year that it was not planning \"significant\" export cuts after cancelling some term contracts. But the drop in shipments combined with the eventual start of its long-delayed 340,000 b/d Olmeca refinery, possibly in 2025, has the potential to shift global flows. At least two independent US Gulf coast refiners are sceptical of major shifts. Road fuel demand is expected to exceed capacity additions in the coming years, Marathon Petroleum chief executive Michael Hennigan said recently. Valero, which is opening a marine storage terminal in Mexico, where about 250 retail outlets carry its brand, expects demand from Mexico to remain strong and grow, chief operating officer Gary Simmons said in its latest earnings call. The impact of Mexico's shift to greater self-sufficiency will depend heavily on its ability to sustain its long-promised refinery renaissance. Mexico's crude exports have already picked up in April from March, to roughly 660,000 b/d based on ship tracking data, although still about 125,000 b/d lower than a year earlier. Energy independence Pemex's refining rates started to fall in 2014 after the previous administration chose to rely less on domestic production and focus more on opening the energy market to outside investment. President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador vowed to make Pemex great again and build a big refinery to reach \"energy independence\" when he took office in late 2018. Lopez Obrador poured at least $3.7bn into maintenance alone at Pemex's ageing refineries in 2019-23, excluding major projects including uncompleted ones to add cokers at two refineries that will cost $6bn-8bn and a spiralling $16bn-20bn for the Olmeca plant. It bought out Shell's share in the Deer Park refinery in Texas , taking full control of the plant in 2022. With presidential elections set for June, it was time to show results. But Pemex has a long history of high accident rates , making refinery operations unreliable. The next administration may have to sustain some of this spending and tackle Pemex's $101.5bn debt at a time of calls for structural reform. In addition, the 330,000 b/d Salina Cruz and 315,000 b/d Tula refineries -- Mexico's largest -- have long struggled with elevated high-sulphur fuel oil (HSFO) production that takes up valuable storage space and makes it hard to run both plants at high rates simultaneously. Record-high exports of HSFO in March helped and Pemex is building coking units at both refineries to solve this, but they are unlikely to both start until early 2025. Attention is on whether and when the Olmeca refinery will affect Mexican demand and offer balance more permanently. Pemex said it will start producing diesel in late May, but also does not expect more than 9,000 b/d of output of all fuels this year . The refinery has missed multiple deadlines, the latest in April. Olmeca's crude unit -- the first processing unit -- faces \"major issues\", a source familiar with Pemex refinery operations says. But others say secondary processing units are ready.

Mexico's crude exports have already picked up in April from March, to roughly 660,000 b/d based on ship tracking data, although still about 125,000 b/d lower than a year earlier.\n\nPemex's refining rates started to fall in 2014 after the previous administration chose to rely less on domestic production and focus more on opening the energy market to outside investment. President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador vowed to make Pemex great again and build a big refinery to reach \"energy independence\" when he took office in late 2018. Lopez Obrador poured at least $3.7bn into maintenance alone at Pemex's ageing refineries in 2019-23, excluding major projects including uncompleted ones to add cokers at two refineries that will cost $6bn-8bn and a spiralling $16bn-20bn for the Olmeca plant. It bought out Shell's share in the Deer Park refinery in Texas, taking full control of the plant in 2022. With presidential elections set for June, it was time to show results.\n\nBut Pemex has a long history of high accident rates, making refinery operations unreliable. The next administration may have to sustain some of this spending and tackle Pemex's $101.5bn debt at a time of calls for structural reform.\n\nIn addition, the 330,000 b/d Salina Cruz and 315,000 b/d Tula refineries -- Mexico's largest -- have long struggled with elevated high-sulphur fuel oil (HSFO) production that takes up valuable storage space and makes it hard to run both plants at high rates simultaneously. Record-high exports of HSFO in March helped and Pemex is building coking units at both refineries to solve this, but they are unlikely to both start until early 2025.\n\nAttention is on whether and when the Olmeca refinery will affect Mexican demand and offer balance more permanently. Pemex said it will start producing diesel in late May, but also does not expect more than 9,000 b/d of output of all fuels this year. The refinery has missed multiple deadlines, the latest in April. Olmeca's crude unit -- the first processing unit -- faces \"major issues\", a source familiar with Pemex refinery operations says. But others say secondary processing units are ready.", "source": {"uri": "argusmedia.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Argus Media"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oil_refinery", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Oil refinery"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mexico", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Mexico"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Mexico"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/State-owned_enterprise", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "State-owned enterprise"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diesel_fuel", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Diesel fuel"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gasoline", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Gasoline"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Petroleum", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Petroleum"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Valero_Energy", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Valero Energy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Independent_politician", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Independent politician"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gary_Simmons_(artist)", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Gary Simmons (artist)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autarky", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Autarky"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andr\u00e9s_Manuel_L\u00f3pez_Obrador", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Andr\u00e9s Manuel L\u00f3pez Obrador"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marathon_Petroleum", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Marathon Petroleum"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ocean", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Ocean"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Renaissance", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Renaissance"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pemex", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Pemex"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gulf_of_Mexico", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Gulf of Mexico"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chief_operating_officer", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Chief operating officer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Energy_independence", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Energy independence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fuel_oil", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Fuel oil"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coke_(fuel)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Coke (fuel)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Texas", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Texas"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Texas"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deer_Park,_Texas", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Deer Park, Texas"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Deer Park, Texas"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salina_Cruz", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Salina Cruz"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Salina Cruz"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Mexico"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Business/Energy/Oil_and_Gas", "label": "dmoz/Business/Energy/Oil and Gas", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Business", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Business", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Science/Environment/Energy", "label": "dmoz/Science/Environment/Energy", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Energy/Marketing_and_Advertising", "label": "dmoz/Business/Energy/Marketing and Advertising", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 61}], "image": null, "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9544160", "eventUri": "eng-9544160", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.2627450980392156, "wgt": 218, "relevance": 1}

Elsewhere, global markets are struggling amid rising inventories and falling profit margins after a warm winter diminished demand for heating fuel. Rising domestic production means Mexico could import less. In March, roughly 60% of all diesel consumed in the country was imported from other markets, including the US.\n\nRead More: Pemex Ekes Out Tiny Profit as Oil Production Decline Resumes\n\nPemex expects output from its refineries to reach almost 1.5 million barrels per day by the end of the year, with about 1.2 million barrels of gasoline, diesel and jet fuel being produced daily by September, Romero said.\n\nThe company also is planning to seek approval to explore 45 new wells during the next presidential administration, and estimates total petroleum reserves will stand at about 7.5 billion barrels by the end of this year, according to Romero.\n\nA new coker plant at Pemex's Tula refinery in Hidalgo state is expected to begin operations by July, while construction on a second coker in Salinas Cruz, Oaxaca, will be about half complete by September, Romero said.\n\nThe projections come a week after Pemex posted a slight profit in the first quarter as production slipped, with government support helping to prop up the debt-saddled company. Output has withered to less than half of what it was two decades ago.\n\nPemex stands as one of the greatest challenges Mexico's next president will inherit.

Half of those living with the virus in the United States are at least 50 years old, emphasizing the importance of understanding social support dynamics for this population, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.\n\nOlder people living with HIV often face stigma related to both their HIV status and age, which can impact their mental health and increase social isolation. Support from various sources such as community organizations, family and healthcare workers is crucial in mitigating these challenges, providing avenues for connection and motivation for self-care.\n\n\"Social support is a key component of resilience and overcoming challenging obstacles that older adults living with HIV may face,\" said Krause. \"Social support can come in many forms, such as friendships, family relationships and support groups. They all serve unique and collective purposes to ensure good health outcomes in older people living with HIV.\"\n\nResearchers recruited 40 participants ages 51 to 69 through varied sampling methods within the Newark metropolitan area, including drag shows, pride events and medical facilities. Data collection involved semi-structured interviews covering topics such as participants' personal experiences with HIV, social networks and mental health.\n\nFrom the gathered data, four main themes emerged regarding participants' experiences living with HIV as older individuals: friends and relationships, support groups, stigma and discrimination, and family, all of which highlighted the recurring role of social support.\n\nStudy findings underscore the need for older adults living with HIV to cultivate strong support systems, especially in understudied areas such as Newark. The absence of such networks correlated with a range of difficulties among participants as they age, such as heightened substance use, depressive episodes, anxiety, homelessness and adverse health consequences.\n\n\"It is important for researchers and public health practitioners to work together to develop programs that can help facilitate consistent and affirming interactions for older adults living with HIV,\" said Krause. \"This will help so many people improve their overall quality of life and support positive health outcomes.\"\n\nLooking ahead, Krause said there is a necessity for further research tailored to this population, advocating for increased funding and the development of interventions and programs that foster social support through reliable and positive experiences, since not all older adults living with HIV have easy access to such support and resources.\n\nStudy co-authors include researchers from the Center for Health, Identity, Behavior and Prevention Studies

We have also seen progress in addressing societal barriers and enablers of HIV putting several countries a step closer to ending AIDS as a public health threat by 2030.\n\n\"Why then should we talk about HIV prevention? We are quite not on track.\n\n\"Despite the availability of a wide array of effective HIV prevention tools and methods and a massive scale-up of HIV treatment in several countries within recent years, new infections among adults globally have not decreased sufficiently as expected,\" she said.\n\nReeling out global figures, she said in 2022, about 4,000 adults and children acquired HIV each day -- a total of 1.3 million new HIV infections.\n\nShe noted that intensive effort is needed to reach the global target of fewer than 370,000 new HIV infections annually by 2025.\n\n\"Despite its efficacy, there remains a stark underinvestment in HIV prevention. In sub-Saharan Africa, only 42 per cent of districts with high HIV incidence have dedicated HIV prevention programs.\n\n\"We, therefore, require an acceleration of progress in HIV prevention. HIV prevention is not only a moral imperative but also a pragmatic and cost-effective public health strategy.\n\n\"Let's remind each other that no single prevention method or approach can stop the HIV epidemic on its own.\n\n\"Several methods and interventions have proved highly effective in reducing the risk of, and protecting against HIV infection, including male and female condoms, the use of antiretroviral medicines as pre-exposure prophylaxis, voluntary male medical circumcision,\n\nbehaviour change interventions to reduce the number of sexual partners, the use of clean needles and syringes, opiate substitution therapy and the treatment of people living with HIV to reduce viral load and prevent onward transmission,\" she stated.\n\nAchrekar said proven strategies that address the needs of specific populations to protect themselves and others from HIV including key populations, adolescents and young people, women, and other priority populations should be identified and prioritised.\n\n\"Over the years, we have observed three interconnected reasons that underpin the failure to implement effective Prevention Programmes to scale - lack of political commitment and, as a result, inadequate investment; reluctance to address sensitive issues related to young people's sexual and reproductive needs and rights, key populations, and harm reduction and the absence of systematic and sustainable implementation of prevention programmes.\n\n\"We know that placing communities at the centre of HIV prevention programs significantly enhances their effectiveness. Programmes led by community-based organisations yielded a fourfold increase in consistent condom use among at-risk populations. We need to continue to support communities with the resources they need to excel,\" she said.\n\nShe stated that the coverage of prevention of mother-to-child transmission of HIV services has remained low in Nigeria with a reach of only 30 per cent of eligible women in the country\n\n\"Nigeria is among the countries with the slowest decline in new HIV infections among children. In 2020, there were an estimated 21,000 new child HIV infections in Nigeria, the highest in the world, which accounted for 14 per cent of the global estimate.\n\n\"I understand that funding is currently not one of the major challenges of the PMTCT program in Nigeria. We would want to see renewed and intensive efforts to achieve the level ofPMTCT program scale-up needed to meet the eMTCT goals.\n\n\"The future of Nigeria's children cannot be left unchecked, concerted and urgent action must be taken to avert children being consigned to live a lifetime with a virus that is now preventable. We need to end the vertical transmission of the epidemic to have an AIDS-free generation in Nigeria,\" she added.\n\nAchrekar called for urgent action to end the inequalities that fuel the AIDS epidemic.", "source": {"uri": "healthwise.punchng.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Healthwise"}, "authors": [{"uri": "lara_adejoro@healthwise.punchng.com", "name": "Lara Adejoro", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HIV/AIDS", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "AIDS"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HIV", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "HIV"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nigeria", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Nigeria"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Nigeria"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epidemic", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Epidemic"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Agency_for_International_Development", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States Agency for International Development"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tuberculosis", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Tuberculosis"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secretary-General_of_the_United_Nations", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Secretary-General of the United Nations"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_health", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Public health"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Female_condom", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Female condom"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Efficacy", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Efficacy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Circumcision", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Circumcision"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sub-Saharan_Africa", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Sub-Saharan Africa"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pre-exposure_prophylaxis", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Pre-exposure prophylaxis"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virus", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Virus"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infection", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Infection"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Opioid_use_disorder", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Opioid use disorder"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harm_reduction", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Harm reduction"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Viral_load", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Viral load"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vertically_transmitted_infection", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Vertically transmitted infection"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syringe", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Syringe"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Condom", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Condom"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Health/Conditions_and_Diseases", "label": "dmoz/Health/Conditions and Diseases", "wgt": 17}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Health", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Health", "wgt": 16}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Conditions_and_Diseases/Immune_Disorders", "label": "dmoz/Health/Conditions and Diseases/Immune Disorders", "wgt": 52}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Reproductive_Health/Sexually_Transmitted_Diseases", "label": "dmoz/Health/Reproductive Health/Sexually Transmitted Diseases", "wgt": 17}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Health_and_Wellness", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Health and Wellness", "wgt": 25}, {"uri": "news/Health", "label": "news/Health", "wgt": 92}], "image": "https://healthwise.punchng.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/HIV.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9554654", "eventUri": "eng-9554654", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.09019607843137245, "wgt": 196, "relevance": 1}

We call for the meaningful youth engagement of adolescents and young people in all their diversities in designing, implementing, monitoring, and evaluating HIV prevention strategies and interventions through established technical working groups and mechanisms.\"\n\nThey also called for the integration of HIV prevention into existing health and development programs targeting adolescents and young people, including sexual reproductive health and rights, economic empowerment, mental health, sexual and gender-based violence, and education.\n\n\"We call for a multi-stakeholder approach to the development of mobile health applications and online platforms for HIV education, self-testing, adherence support, and virtual counseling services tailored to the needs and preferences of adolescent and young people living with HIV, including key populations.\n\n\"We stress the need for ensuring the health and rights of key populations (KP) living with HIV as a cornerstone of our HIV prevention agenda by prioritizing comprehensive care, empowerment, and advocacy for KP communities\" she added.", "source": {"uri": "thenationonlineng.net", "dataType": "news", "title": "Latest Nigeria News, Nigerian Newspapers, Politics"}, "authors": [{"uri": "dele_anofi@thenationonlineng.net", "name": "Dele Anofi", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HIV/AIDS", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "AIDS"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HIV", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "HIV"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infection", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Infection"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nigeria", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Nigeria"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Nigeria"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grassroots", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Grassroots"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fine_Gael", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Fine Gael"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/President's_Emergency_Plan_for_AIDS_Relief", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "President's Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_development", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "International development"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sustainability", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Sustainability"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coalition", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Coalition"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adolescence", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Adolescence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_government_of_the_United_States", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Federal government of the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abuja", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Abuja"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Abuja"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Nigeria"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sexual_and_reproductive_health", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Sexual and reproductive health"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comprehensive_sex_education", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Comprehensive sex education"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Empowerment", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Empowerment"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Violence_against_women", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Violence against women"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychotherapy", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Psychotherapy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mental_health", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Mental health"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Health/Conditions_and_Diseases", "label": "dmoz/Health/Conditions and Diseases", "wgt": 19}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues", "wgt": 19}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Health", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Health", "wgt": 18}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Conditions_and_Diseases/Immune_Disorders", "label": "dmoz/Health/Conditions and Diseases/Immune Disorders", "wgt": 53}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Health_and_Wellness", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Health and Wellness", "wgt": 24}, {"uri": "news/Health", "label": "news/Health", "wgt": 50}], "image": null, "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9554654", "eventUri": "eng-9554654", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.3647058823529412, "wgt": 185, "relevance": 1}

We were immersed in plenaries, discussions, and workshops, and 500 advocates from 35 states did over 240 meetings with Congress in one day! As a health advocate and a Black man living with HIV, I feel an immense sense of pride reflecting on the critical moments our community shared.\n\nIt may seem stereotypical, but as a gay man, I took delight in curating my attire, draped in red, white, and blue, to affirm a simple truth: we are Americans, too.\n\nAmidst the crowd's fervor, an advocate started a spontaneous singing of \"God Bless America\" that grew to a chorus of proud voices. Indeed, may God bless us all, for we stand at the precipice of a pivotal moment in our democracy.\n\nAnd it's a pivotal moment for the lives, rights, and health of people living with and vulnerable to HIV.\n\nThe HIV community possesses a unique perspective on the value of democracy. Our health, rights, and lives hinge upon its preservation. Yet, these fundamental pillars are under siege this election year. As Americans, we understand the power of our vote and our expectations that those we elect do their duty to uphold our rights, health, and well-being.\n\nI've been honored to speak to millions on television and radio, deliver hundreds of keynote addresses, sermons, and presentations, and contribute to numerous conferences worldwide. However, these audiences are different from the passionate advocates at AIDSWATCH. I know our resilience.\n\nLiving with HIV for four decades, I buried a partner from AIDS years ago and have spent over 30 years living alongside my husband, Bill. I'm deeply fueled by our people's history and achievements over the years. Collaborating daily with the dedicated team at AIDS United, members, and grantees continues to be both a privilege and a driving force in my life's work.\n\nI've dedicated myself to advocating for our communities and advancing HIV/AIDS policies and programs on national and international levels. In my current work on the Presidential Advisory Council on HIV/AIDS (PACHA), the Scientific Advisory Board for PEPFAR, and as chair of the board of Funders Concerned About AIDS (FCAA), I know that collaboration between the community, funders, and policymakers is vital to progress in this fight against HIV/AIDS.\n\nBut what truly makes a meaningful difference for policymakers is seeing the faces and hearing the stories of people like me and others living with and vulnerable to HIV/AIDS. Our experiences must inspire and guide efforts to enact policies and appropriate funds at the federal and state levels that make a difference in the HIV epidemic.\n\nAIDSWatch serves as a clarion call to action. It compels us to remind our representatives in Congress of their duty to stand with us, champion our cause, and resist those seeking to deny our rights and erode our progress.\n\nOur journey is fraught with triumphs and tribulations. We celebrate the strides in ending the epidemic but acknowledge the persistent disparities. The decline in new HIV transmissions is cause for optimism, yet it falls short of what it needs to be for people of color, people in the South, and LGBTQ+ communities.\n\nViral suppression rates continue to rise, thanks partly to programs like the Ryan White program. However, access to PrEP and awareness of U=U remain insufficient, particularly among communities of color and marginalized groups.\n\nAs we ventured to Capitol Hill this year, we carried the memories of those we loved and lost. Equally, the impactful efforts of fearsome advocates like Dr. Ada Adimora, Cecilia Gentili, and Hydeia Broadbent. Their legacy fuels our determination to advocate for change.\n\nIn the wake of AIDSWatch, our message to Congress remains clear: we demand action to preserve and protect our democracy, our lives, our health, and our rights. Because, at our core, we are Americans, too.\n\nAs we look ahead, let us seize this moment to create meaningful change. Let us unite in our shared pursuit of equality, justice, and dignity.\n\nGod bless us, America. Together, we shall prevail.\n\nJesse Milan, Jr., JD is a tireless community advocate and recognized national and international expert on HIV/AIDS policies and programs.

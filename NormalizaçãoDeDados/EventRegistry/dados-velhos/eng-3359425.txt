He was never elevated to the foreign minister's post and now he doesn't want to share power with an equal partner. He could have returned as a senior, if a minister of state was appointed in the foreign ministry,\" a close aide of Sartaj Aziz told The Nation.\n\nAziz was serving as adviser to the prime minister on foreign affairs, when Nawaz Sharif was disqualified as the premier by the Supreme Court last month.\n\nUntil April, he had Tariq Fatemi working under him as a special assistant to the prime minister with the status of a minister of state.\n\nAziz himself enjoyed the status of a federal minister but was never inducted as a full-time foreign minister as he was not a member of the parliament.\n\nFormer prime minister Nawaz Sharif kept the portfolio with himself for around four years, refusing to listen to the demands of the opposition who wanted a full-time foreign minister amid diplomatic challenges.\n\nNawaz Sharif could easily have got Aziz elected as a senator and then appointed him as the foreign minister but he did not prefer the option.\n\nWhen Abbasi took over as the prime minister he was expected to retain all the cabinet members who worked with Sharif. But when Khawaja Asif was appointed foreign minister, Aziz contacted the premier to stop his reappointment.\n\nLater, Aziz met Abbasi and told him he was not available for the job citing \"personal reasons\".\n\nSources, however, said Nawaz Sharif wanted the veteran Leaguer to serve as the adviser and Abbasi was also pushing him to accept the job.\n\nPM Abbasi believed Asif can look into the administrative affairs, while Sartaj Aziz could deal with the diplomatic business.\n\nA senior government official told The Nation that there was a proposal to bring back Sartaj Aziz as adviser to the prime minister on foreign affairs with an office at the Prime Minister's House instead of the foreign ministry.\n\n\"Under this proposal, Sartaj Aziz will work directly under the PM and will not have to share power with Khawja Asif in the foreign ministry. His role will also be advisory instead of a de-facto minister,\" said the official.\n\nHe said that PM Abbasi had asked Nawaz Sharif to convince Aziz for the revised job.\n\n\"We are expecting Sartaj Aziz to return under the new terms. He is still not out,\" the official added.\n\nFor the last several months, Pakistani diplomats have been working hard as the country faced diplomatic challenges.\n\nThe Pakistan government and top diplomats had been on the mission to win over US President Donald Trump's trust and muster support against Indian aggression besides improving ties with the regional countries.\n\nSo far, India looks heads and shoulders ahead in Washington.\n\nThe neighbourhood situation is also not promising. But Pakistan has improved ties with Russia and retained China as its chief supporter.\n\nWeeks before his disqualification, Sharif visited the foreign ministry for a meeting with the top diplomats and aides to discuss the regional tension and India's growing relations with the US.\n\nOfficials at the foreign ministry said Aziz had attended a low-profile farewell ceremony at the Foreign Office last week and told the staff he was leaving.\n\n\"Khawaja Asif spoke high of him and said he had earlier worked under Sartaj Aziz and he will still be his boss. Sartaj Aziz, however, did not seem too interested to change his mind. We don't expect him to return to the foreign ministry's office at least. He may take some assignment at the PM's House,\" said one official.", "location": {"label": {"eng": "Islamabad"}, "country": {"label": {"eng": "Islamic Republic of Pakistan"}, "type": "country"}, "type": "place"}, "extractedDates": null, "time": "01:48:00", "originalArticle": null, "details": {}, "timeCrawl": "01:48:00", "title": "Sartaj unwilling to share power with Asif ", "date": "2017-08-14", "uri": "708986756", "image": "http://nation.com.pk/print_images/large/2017-08-14/sartaj-unwilling-to-share-power-with-asif-1502672100-7164.jpg", "source": {"title": "The Nation", "uri": "nation.com.pk", "id": "468"}, "id": "8990018", "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Relationships/Weddings", "label": "dmoz/Society/Relationships/Weddings", "wgt": 100, "id": 194}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Religion_and_Spirituality/Christianity", "label": "dmoz/Society/Religion and Spirituality/Christianity", "wgt": 100, "id": 253}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/China", "id": "47", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "People's Republic of China"}, "type": "loc", "location": {"label": {"eng": "People's Republic of China"}, "type": "country"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/India", "id": "104", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "India"}, "type": "loc", "location": {"label": {"eng": "India"}, "type": "country"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pakistan", "id": "178", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Islamic Republic of Pakistan"}, "type": "loc", "location": {"label": {"eng": "Islamic Republic of Pakistan"}, "type": "country"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russia", "id": "191", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Russia"}, "type": "loc", "location": {"label": {"eng": "Russia"}, "type": "country"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "id": "233", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "type": "loc", "location": {"label": {"eng": "United States"}, "type": "country"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Islamabad", "id": "48650", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Islamabad"}, "type": "loc", "location": {"label": {"eng": "Islamabad"}, "country": {"label": {"eng": "Islamic Republic of Pakistan"}, "type": "country"}, "type": "place"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muhammad", "label": {"eng": "Muhammad"}, "type": "person", "id": "303301", "score": 4}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pakistani_people", "label": {"eng": "Pakistanis"}, "type": "wiki", "id": "305931", "score": 2}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nawaz_Sharif", "label": {"eng": "Nawaz Sharif"}, "type": "person", "id": "307776", "score": 5}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Government_of_Pakistan", "label": {"eng": "Government of Pakistan"}, "type": "org", "id": "309433", "score": 2}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shahid_Khaqan_Abbasi", "label": {"eng": "Shahid Khaqan Abbasi"}, "type": "person", "id": "357423", "score": 4}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Nation", "label": {"eng": "The Nation"}, "type": "wiki", "id": "366049", "score": 5}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sartaj_Aziz", "label": {"eng": "Sartaj Aziz"}, "type": "person", "id": "405742", "score": 5}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Khawaja_Muhammad_Asif", "label": {"eng": "Khawaja Muhammad Asif"}, "type": "person", "id": "473922", "score": 3}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tariq_Fatemi", "label": {"eng": "Tariq Fatemi"}, "type": "wiki", "id": "1286964", "score": 3}]}

With the latest appointment of six advisers to the prime minister, the strength of cabinet members has reached 53.\n\nAfter taking oath of office of the prime minister on August 1, Abbasi initially inducted 43-member cabinet which included 27 federal ministers and 16 ministers of state. A few days later four new ministers took oath at the President House, bringing the number of members of the federal cabinet to 47. The new inductees include two ministers and two ministers of state.\n\nLast weekend, the prime minister further expanded his cabinet by appointing six advisers including Lieutenant General Nasser Janjua (Retd) as National Security Adviser, Sartaj Aziz as deputy chairman of the Planning Commission, Sardar Mehtab Abbasi, Jam Mashooq Ali, Amir Muqam and Irfan Siddiqui.\n\nAll these advisers, who had also served former prime minister Nawaz Sharif in the same capacity (as advisers), have been given the status of federal ministers. Now Prime Minister Abbasi is expected to appoint a few special assistants -- almost all of those who were serving Nawaz Sharif till his ouster. These included Khawaja Zaheer, Zafarullah Khan, Dr Asif Kirmani, Haroon Akhtar etc. During Nawaz Sharif tenure the maximum strength of special assistants was nine. These special assistants were enjoying the status of minister of state.\n\nUnder former prime minister Nawaz Sharif, the cabinet members' strength which was 25 (including advisers and special assistants) in 2013 had later increased to 43 including 21 federal ministers, nine ministers of state, four advisers to the PM and nine special assistants to the PM.\n\nSoon after coming into power former prime minister Nawaz Sharif had massively reduced the size of the federal secretariat including that of the Prime Minister's Secretariat as a move to reduce public spending and ensure good governance. However, later he started adding up cabinet members, which resulted into creation of more and more ministries and divisions.

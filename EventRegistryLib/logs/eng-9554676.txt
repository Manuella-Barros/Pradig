(Will Steinfeld/Rhode Island Current)\n\nPROVIDENCE -- After months of behind-the-scenes negotiations over how to reform the way Rhode Island's police departments investigate and discipline officers accused of misconduct, legislative leaders have reached a compromise that will now head to the House floor.\n\nThe House Judiciary Committee Tuesday evening voted 12-4 to advance matching bills sponsored by Deputy House Speaker Raymond Hull and Senate President Dominick Ruggerio to reform the Law Enforcement Officers Bill of Rights (LEOBOR) to a full House vote on Thursday.\n\nUnder the law adopted in 1976, police officers accused of misconduct appear before a panel made up of three active or retired police officers -- with one picked by the chief, one by the officer under investigation, and a third chosen by both or a presiding Superior Court judge -- who rule on any disciplinary actions.\n\nCalls for reform this legislative session had been slowed by disagreements over expanding the number of members who sit on the disciplinary panel to five. Both Hull and Ruggerio had proposed that three police officers and a retired judge would sit on the hearing panel. But the Senate's initial legislation included a fifth seat that would be filled by the executive director of the Nonviolence Institute, a Providence advocacy nonprofit -- a choice that was opposed by the Rhode Island Police Chiefs Association.\n\nThe Senate bill was amended to drop that designation for the fifth seat and now aligns with Hull proposal for the fifth seat to be occupied by an attorney \"selected in consultation with the Supreme Court's committee on racial and ethnic fairness.\"\n\nUnder the current law, police officers accused of misconduct can only be suspended without pay for two days before their right to a LEOBOR hearing kicks in. Both bills extend that suspension to five days without pay for officers accused of minor infractions and 14 days for those facing more serious complaints, such as excessive force or felonies.\n\nBoth bills also repeal the \"gag order\" that prohibits police chiefs from making public statements about cases that have not yet had a LEOBOR hearing.\n\n\"I am proud of the identical House and Senate LEOBOR bills,\" House Speaker K. Joseph Shekarchi said in a statement Tuesday afternoon. \"Both chambers have been working on this issue.\"\n\nRuggerio also praised the efforts that led to this week's compromise.\n\n\"Ever since our 2020 Senate commission on reforming the Law Enforcement Officers Bill of Rights completed its work, I have been committed to finding a way forward that improves accountability and transparency while recognizing the uniquely difficult job facing law enforcement officers who keep our communities safe,\" he said in a statement.\n\nShould Ruggerio's companion bill clear the House on Thursday, it will likely go before the full Senate again some time next week, said chamber spokesperson Greg Par\u00e9.\n\n\"Since the legislation is very similar to the bill that already was heard by the committee and passed by the Senate in January, it is not required to be sent back to committee and can be sent directly to the floor calendar,\" Par\u00e9 said.\n\nLeft to right: Reps. Cherie Cruz, a Pawtucket Democrat, Leonela Felix, a Pawtucket Democrat, and David Place, a Burrillville Republican, are shown during the House Judiciary Committee hearing on companion bills to reform the Law Enforcement Officers Bill of Rights at the State House on Tuesday, May 7, 2024. (Will Steinfeld/Rhode Island Current)\n\nThe Rhode Island League of Cities and Towns, which held a rally for LEBOR reform at the State House last week, submitted a letter of support to the House Judiciary Committee posted Tuesday afternoon. In it the league's associate director, David Bodah, called the legislation \"a significant step forward in addressing longstanding concerns within our law enforcement system.\"\n\n\"We acknowledge that this bill may not satisfy everyone, but it is a step in the right direction for the State of Rhode Island,\" Bodah wrote.\n\nBut Black Lives Matter Rhode Island PAC Director Harrison Tuttle wrote to the committee Tuesday that the proposed LEOBOR reform legislation falls short in\n\n\"BLM RI PAC strongly believes that, in line with the broader criminal justice reform efforts across the nation, police chiefs should have the authority to terminate officers when concerns about public safety arise,\" he wrote.\n\nTuttle also took issue with the composition of LEOBOR hearing panels.\n\n\"Allowing law enforcement officials to discipline their peers perpetuates a lack of public trust,\" he wrote. \"While some argue that police can be trusted with this responsibility, historical disappointments in accountability for victims of police brutality prove otherwise.\"\n\nAlso unsatisfied with the legislation: the State House's progressive members, who feel the proposals don't go far enough. Voting against advancing the bills Tuesday were Reps. Edith Ajello, Jos\u00e9 Batista, Cherie Cruz, and Leonela Felix.\n\nFelix, a Pawtucket Democrat, expressed gratitude for the work that has been done so far on the legislation this year, but said she was disappointed the compromise fell short of meeting all the demands made by legislators of color in March.\n\nThe main demand missing, she said, is a provision that would mandate LEOBOR proceedings occur at the same time as any criminal investigation and/or prosecution. Under the existing law, police chiefs can delay hearings until after the criminal investigation or trial is concluded.\n\nFelix told Rhode Island Current an investigation may be necessary for minor allegations, but not when it comes to offenses that result in serious harm or death such as the case of the murder of George Floyd in Minneapolis in 2020.\n\n\"If you or I violate our company policy or department policy, we get fired,\" she said. \"George Floyd should be the litmus when it comes to this.\"\n\nSenate spokesperson Par\u00e9 said legislative leadership has \"tremendous respect\" for the caucus, but believed hearings running concurrently with official proceedings would be unconstitutional and could impact any criminal prosecution.\n\n\"We appreciate their advocacy and their sincere desire to improve accountability measures in this bill,\" Par\u00e9 said.\n\nFelix didn't buy that argument.\n\n\"According to all the attorneys we've talked to, it's passed the constitutional muster,\" she said.\n\nFelix said she plans to offer this provision as a floor amendment Thursday.\n\nShould the amendment be rejected, Felix said a majority of the 21-member Rhode Island Black, Latino, Indigenous, Asian-American and Pacific Islander Caucus will vote against the bills. There had also been talk of plans for legislators to walk out of their respective chambers, but Felix said caucus members felt that would not send a clear message to state leaders.\n\nStill, if the LEOBOR bills do pass, Felix said it would be an incremental change.", "source": {"uri": "yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dominick_J._Ruggerio", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Dominick J.

Officers accused of wrongdoings are also allowed a hearing in front of a panel of three retired or active officers.\n\nConversations around this state law have been ongoing for years, being discussed extensively after the 2020 death of George Floyd. Since then, this legislation has been submitted multiple times but stalled in the House and Senate.\n\nHowever, there is confidence as this year's General Assembly session winds down, LEOBOR reform will happen.\n\nLEOBOR reform also has support from municipal leaders. In late April, the R.I. League of Cities and Towns held a press conference calling for reforms to the law.\n\nThis bill could face a possible roadblock during this vote: getting support from the R.I.

House passes police reform, but without 'George Floyd' provision - The Boston Globe", "body": "RelatedR.I. leaders reach compromise on changes to police misconduct law\n\nThe revisions were heralded as a \"major improvement\" by the chairman of the Judiciary Committee, but did not go far enough for some members of the caucus representing legislators of color, who unsuccessfully sought during the floor debate to get a 'George Floyd litmus test\" added to the law. The amendment, which was ultimately tabled in a vote of 47 to 25 over questions of constitutionality, would have allowed police chiefs to fire officers who use deadly force without going through a lengthy hearing process that can last years.\n\nThe law, known as LEOBOR, provides officers with due process if they are accused of serious misconduct, currently giving them the right to a hearing by a panel of fellow officers for discipline longer than a two-day suspension.\n\nIt's been widely criticized for the makeup of the three-member hearing panel, since the accused officer selects one of the members, the accusing police department selects another, and the third officer is selected by both parties.\n\nPolice chiefs have said the existing law makes it difficult to punish officers, and also prevents them from speaking publicly about high-profile police misconduct cases.\n\nThe amended legislation removes that gag order, and also changes the makeup of the panel to five members. Three of the members would be police officers randomly selected from a newly-created list and would receive special training before being put in the pool of candidates. The other two members would be a retired judge and an attorney, each selected by the chief justice of the Rhode Island Supreme Court.\n\nThe bill also allows chiefs to suspend police officers for a longer amount of time: five days for minor infractions, and 14 days for more serious misconduct such as improper use of force, \"felonious conduct\" including domestic assault, and issues of honesty and integrity. Longer suspensions and terminations would still give officers the right to a LEOBOR hearing, which cannot take place until the criminal case is over, including the appeal, if the officer is charged.\n\n\"This moves LEOBOR to somewhere they never thought it would be,\" said state Representative Ray Hull, a Providence police sergeant and the lead sponsor of the bill. \"Nothing's perfect, I'll tell you that. But after living in police service for 30-some odd years, this is a big jump. A big jump to transparency.\"\n\nHe highlighted the removal of the gag order, which he said was a \"huge\" change in police culture.\n\n\"This effectively opens it up to us to put the police chief on notice that we want to hear from you about your officers,\" Hull said. \"The chief can't shut his mouth.\"\n\nThe name of the statute would also be renamed the Law Enforcement Officers' Due Process, Accountability and Transparency Act.\n\nThose who argued the bill did not go far enough included state Representative Jose Batista, a Providence Democrat who introduced the \"George Floyd\" amendment.\n\nIf Floyd, who was murdered by Minneapolis police officer Derek Chauvin in 2020, were killed in Rhode Island, Chauvin would not have been able to be fired immediately under this proposal, Batista said.\n\n\"You'd have to wait for a criminal trial to end,\" Batista said. \"If he gets acquitted, you'd have to give him back pay.\" And only after the criminal case was over could the LEOBOR panel be impaneled to consider the termination.\n\nThe failed amendment would have allowed police chiefs to terminate officers who commit deadly force without waiting for the criminal case to be over. Officers would have still been able to dispute the decision using the grievance and arbitration provisions in the police union contract.\n\nAt a news conference before the vote, members of the Rhode Island Black, Latino, Indigenous, Asian-American and Pacific Islander caucus said the bill did not go far enough.\n\n\"In New York, after Eric Garner was killed in 2014, it took the police department until 2019 to terminate that police officer,\" said Senator Jonathan Acosta, one of the chairs of the caucus. \"After George Floyd was killed, the Minneapolis police department terminated [Derek Chauvin] within 24 hours. In Rhode Island, we are in the New York scenario. The bill that we're considering today on the House floor keeps us in the New York scenario. This caucus finds that unacceptable.\"\n\nRepresentative Leonela Felix, the other chair of the caucus, was among those who voted against the bill on the House floor. The other no votes were Representatives Edith Ajello, Karen Alzate, Cherie Cruz, Joshua Giraldo, Arthur Handy, Brianna Henries, John Lombardi, David Morales, Brandon Botter, Jennifer Stewart and

What to expect.", "body": "PROVIDENCE - The Rhode Island House is poised to vote Thursday on a proposed rewrite of the law enforcement \"Bill of Rights\" - long-blamed as an obstacle to firing of bad cops.\n\nHeaded for likely passage after some heated debate on the House floor tonight, the long-sought \"compromise\" was born out of the public anger and frustration sparked by a string incidents of alleged police misconduct locally and nationally, including:\n\nWhat would the compromise do?\n\nAmong the key features of the proposed compromise hammered out by House and Senate leaders and the police unions:\n\nBehind-the-scenes: Some groups still divided on compromise\n\nThe proposed compromise does not go far enough; however, for some, including those who belong to the legislature's \"Black, Latino, Indigenous, Asian-American and Pacific Islander Caucus\" who have, in the past, advocated for outright repeal of the Law Enforcement Officers' Bill of Rights (known as LEOBOR).\n\nThe caucus is holding a 3:15 press conference ahead of the House vote to elaborate on members' concern and unveil a proposed amendment.\n\nBut the divide was evident from the 12-to-4 vote for the legislation, in the House Judiciary Committee earlier this week\n\nJust ahead of that vote, state Rep. Leonela Felix, D-Pawtucket, told The Journal she appreciates \"the work that has been done in the last two years to get to where we are right now,\" but \"it's built on the false premise that this equates to justice and it does not.\"\n\n\"All we want to see in the bill is a carve-out where if an officer is accused of [deadly] force in violation of departmental rules or procedures, that those officers can be fired by their chiefs,'' long before a trial may play out and, after it, a hearing by one of the newly-expanded \"LEOBOR\" panels that would be created by the proposed new law.\n\nMore: Pawtucket officer acquitted this year of shooting unarmed teen resigns. What to know.\n\nLooking closer at one of the 'nay' votes\n\nAnother of the nays votes came from Rep. Jose Batista who, in 2020, was fired from his job as the head of a civilian-led Providence police review board in 2020 after releasing video footage of Providence Police Sgt. Joseph Hanley assaulting a handcuffed Black man in an incident that led to an assault charge against the officer.\n\nProsecutors say Hanley punched, kicked and kneeled on the neck of Rishod Gore. Gore was in handcuffs on the ground at the time, and repeatedly asked why he was under arrest while Hanley called him an \"animal\" and a \"savage,\" according to a video captured on a fellow officer's body-worn camera.\n\nIn an Op-Ed piece than ran shortly after he was fired, Batista explained why he did what he did this way: \"The vote to terminate me took place six days after I released public records showing a Providence police officer engaged in unrestrained violence against an innocent, unarmed Black man in handcuffs.\"\n\n\"That officer, on the other hand, was put on administrative paid leave for six months\" - then unpaid leave - \"and is still employed,\" he wrote in December 2020 of Hanley.\n\nThe Law Enforcement Officers' Bill of Rights prohibits the city from firing Hanley as long as his court case continues.\n\nThis past March, a Superior Court judge declared a mistrial in the Hanley case after a jury deadlocked in his second trial. Attorney General Peter Neronha's office plans to seek a new trial, a spokesman told The Journal on Thursday. Hanley, meanwhile, remains on unpaid leave, with the opportunity to collect his back pay if he is acquitted.\n\nA proposed amendment\n\nBatista vowed to propose an amendment, during the House floor debate, similar to what his colleague Felix described, to give police chiefs the option to immediately fire an officer who misuses deadly force, while giving the officer an opportunity to \"explain or respond\" to whatever they have been accused of doing.\n\n\"It's not just snap of a finger,\" he said.\n\nWhile the charges against Hanley do not entail deadly force, Batista cited it as a classic case of what is wrong with LEOBOR and the proposed fix: \"Four years and [potentially] three trials and [then] a conversation about pay, which I think is really counter to the values of Rhode Island taxpayers.\"\n\nOf the $124,000 in back pay the city of Pawtucket agreed to pay former Police Sgt. Daniel Dolan following his acquittal of charges he shot an unarmed teenager, Battista said: \"If I had hair, I might set it on fire. That cannot be the standard.\"\n\nHow would this impact active cases?\n\nThe matching House and Senate versions of the bill up for a vote on Thursday would, however, require the termination of any police officer who pleads guilty or no contest to a felony charge, even if it happens in another state, as was the case with former Wo0nsocket police officer.\n\nIn case, the Supreme Court said an officer couldn't be terminated under LEOBOR for his out of state admission of facts in a felony matter. The city ultimately agreed to pay the former officer, Enrique Sosa, $500,000 to end a years-long legal battle.", "source": {"uri": "eu.providencejournal.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Associated

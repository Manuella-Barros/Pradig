The soap- and shampoo-labeled bottles on the lower shelves at pharmacies were all the guidance I needed. If I ran out of one, I\u2019d usually use the other interchangeably until I had time to get to a pharmacy (e.g., shampoo as body wash and vice versa). Besides, isn\u2019t face wash only for people with acne? Apparently not. Hawthorne, a personalized men\u2019s hygiene and body care subscription service, recently asked me to take its quiz and sent me a custom-made personal care package. While I was skeptical at first, I now understand why people are particular about what they use on their face, body, hair, and even underarms\u2014I\u2019ve never felt more clean. The quiz takes just a few minutes and asks about your priorities, fragrance preferences, daily grooming and skincare habits, and hair and skin type to pair you with the perfect daily self-care lineup. Then, they send you a curated package right to your door with everything you need to feel clean, fresh, and, well, nice. Hawthorne also was thoughtful enough to send me two different scents\u2014one for work and one for play. While I was never much of a scent-spritzer, I have to admit it makes me feel nice to actually smell nice\u2014and I\u2019ve even gotten a few compliments. If you want to elevate your bathroom routine with intention and refined ingredients, Hawthorne is a great first step in the right direction. Plus, you don\u2019t have to go the subscription route either\u2014all of its products are available for purchase by themselves.

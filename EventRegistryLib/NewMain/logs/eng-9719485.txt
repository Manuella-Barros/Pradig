After voicing frustrations with his previous promoter, Stevenson has become a free agent, ready to explore all options for the next phase of his career. Among the potential suitors is boxing legend Floyd Mayweather, who runs Mayweather Promotions. This opens the door for a fascinating partnership between a rising star and a retired champion.\n\n\"It's OVER, take the L out of Lover..They proved to the world numerous of times they can't help a black fighter turn to a superstar now watch how much I go up without em,\" posted Stevenson on his X page.\n\nIn a bout that displayed his abilities and perhaps showed why Top Rank isn't making much effort to retain him, Shakur Stevenson defended his WBC lightweight title with a technically proficient yet ultimately underwhelming performance against Artem Harutyunyan. Stevenson won by unanimous decision but seldom threatened to end the fight early on Saturday at the Prudential Center in Newark, New Jersey.\n\n\"The hate come with this sh*t!

I've got to cut off the ring a little bit more,\" Stevenson remarked in media reports\n\nStevenson acknowledged his disappointment with Lomachenko and Gervonta Davis potentially facing each other, leaving him without a clear path towards a high-profile fight. Despite this setback, he remains committed to training and staying ready for future opportunities\n\n\"I love boxing.

He's blessed with the ability that if he cracks you, nine times out of ten you're gonna go down. I'm blessed with amazing eyes; I can see punches coming my way and get away from them.

Killa Cam also added some sauce on top of the brewing beef, telling Stevenson that street boxing isn't the same as boxing in the ring.\n\nDespite enjoying his recent title defense, Shakur Stevenson has been going off on Xitter, which made Ma$e and Cam'Ron essentially say that the boxer is crashing out.", "source": {"uri": "hiphopwired.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Latest Hip-Hop News, Music and Media | Hip-Hop Wired"}, "authors": [{"uri": "lance_strong@hiphopwired.com", "name": "Lance Strong", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shakur_Stevenson", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Shakur Stevenson"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mase", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Mase"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cam'ron", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Cam'ron"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boxing", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Boxing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artem_Harutyunyan_(boxer)", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Artem Harutyunyan (boxer)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Boxing_Council", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "World Boxing Council"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lightweight", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Lightweight"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newark,_New_Jersey", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Newark, New Jersey"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Newark, New Jersey"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boxing_ring", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Boxing ring"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Boxing", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Boxing", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Boxing/Fan_Pages", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Boxing/Fan Pages", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Boxing/History", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Boxing/History", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Boxing/Boxers", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Boxing/Boxers", "wgt": 9}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Boxing", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Boxing", "wgt": 9}], "image": "https://hiphopwired.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/43/2024/07/17205581504215.jpg?quality=85&strip=all&w=560&crop=0,0,100,320px", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9719485", "eventUri": "eng-9719485", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-07-06", "textStart": 490, "textEnd": 496}], "sentiment": -0.02745098039215688, "wgt": 191, "relevance": 1}

Two rappers Mase and Camron even commented on how much of a stinker his fight was. This was to Stevenson's chagrin, who has been posting relentlessly on X ever since his boring bout.\n\nThis past Saturday was supposed to be another homecoming for New Jersey native boxer and WBC lightweight champion, Shakur Stevenson, to show why he is the next best fighter in a stacked division. There are a wealth of opportunities on the horizon for the young, defense-first phenom, but he did himself no favors by going 12 rounds against a fighter he should have rolled over in Artem Harutyunyan.\n\nIt didn't help Stevenson's case that on the same night, two UFC legends jumped into a boxing ring and went toe-to-toe in front of a sold out Honda Center. Since his unanimous decision over his German counterpart, Stevenson has eviscerated all 'haters' on X.com, including rappers Mase and Camron.\n\nRelated Manny Pacquiao Returning to World Title Boxing is Unfair, Amir Khan Says\n\nIt's unfair if Manny Pacquiao fights for a world title against Mario Barrios, Amir Khan says.\n\nMase And Camron Went in on Shakur Stevenson Stevenson did not take too kindly to the criticism\n\nIn NSFW footage, you can watch Mase and Camron laugh at Stevenson right here:\n\nStevenson is this generation's defensive boxing genius, and glass half-fullers have seen the positive side of what the Newark native is doing.\n\nMany complained about Floyd Mayweather Jr.'s defensively-sound style back in the day, but \"Money Mayweather\" would laugh all the way to the bank. Stevenson has a long way to go before he encroaches on that kind of money, but he isn't shying away from the critics and has accepted the comparison to one of the greatest boxers of all-time:\n\nThe undefeated boxer was pulling no punches online following his fight, as he tangled with ESPN's boxing reporter, Mike Coppinger. Coincidentally, or not, Stevenson's ranking dropped a spot on ESPN's lightweight top 10 following this back and forth with Coppinger.\n\nStevenson is showing little signs of being distracted by the naysayers and is staying focused on his own path to success, and like Mayweather learned many moons ago, getting people to watch you fight is all that matters:\n\nShakur Steveson's Next Fight Boxing record: 22-0 (10 KOs), Best win: Oscar Valdez\n\nDespite the vitriol that the former Olympic silver medalist is dealing with right now, over time, fans will forget this performance if he can come out strong in his next showing. Another possible way to shut the haters up would be to shutout another undefeated lightweight boxer in the name of William Zepeda (31-0: 27 KOs), who had sparked his opponent Giovanni Cabrera inside three rounds on the same night Stevenson fought.\n\nStevenson will have to wait if he wants to prove himself against the current American face of boxing, Gervonta Davis, or against a former world champion, Vasyl Lomachenko, who seems to be on a collision course for one another.\n\nIf we get Stevenson-Zepeda this year or one after each, that will wipe the bad taste out of a lot of haters and will give Stevenson the chance to set the record straight.", "source": {"uri": "givemesport.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "GiveMeSport"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shakur_Stevenson", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Shakur Stevenson"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mase", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Mase"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boxing", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Boxing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manny_Pacquiao", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Manny Pacquiao"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Floyd_Mayweather_Jr.", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Floyd Mayweather Jr."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Honda_Center", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Honda Center"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Boxing_Council", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "World Boxing Council"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lightweight", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Lightweight"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amir_Khan_(boxer)", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Amir Khan (boxer)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ultimate_Fighting_Championship", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Ultimate Fighting Championship"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Jersey", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "New Jersey"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "New Jersey"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mario_Barrios", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Mario Barrios"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unanimous_decision", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Unanimous decision"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ESPN", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "ESPN"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newark,_New_Jersey", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Newark, New Jersey"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Newark, New Jersey"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Germany", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Germany"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Germany"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Zepeda", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "William Zepeda"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vasiliy_Lomachenko", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Vasiliy Lomachenko"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gervonta_Davis", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Gervonta Davis"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Silver_medal", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Silver medal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/\u00d3scar_Valdez", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "\u00d3scar Valdez"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Boxing", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Boxing", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Boxing/Fan_Pages", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Boxing/Fan Pages", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Boxing/History", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Boxing/History", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 86}], "image": "https://static0.givemesportimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/shakur-stevenson-stopped-jamel-herring-last-time-out.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9719485", "eventUri": "eng-9719485", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.1686274509803921, "wgt": 189, "relevance": 1}

However, what should've been a celebratory time for the young fighter has turned a bit sour, because his performance is being criticized once again for being lacking in the excitement department. You see, Stevenson is a defensive mastermind, and takes boxing's thesis -- hit and don't get hit -- a little too seriously for some fans to stomach.\n\nDuring his last fight, versus Edwin de Los Santos, neither fighter landed double-digit punches in any round -- and during his fight with Harutyunyan, Shakur's corner wanted him to be more aggressive. There's even footage of fans leaving the Prudential Center before the fight finished, with the Newark native winning in a unanimous decision.\n\nFormer boxer and current analyst Tim Bradley criticized Stevenson for not listening to his corner on Saturday night (July 6), saying, \"The only thing he didn't do was stop him because he got into an argument with his corner.

But it takes nothing away from how technically brilliant the southpaw from Newark, New Jersey, remains some eight years after he won a silver medal at the 2016 Rio Olympics.\n\nLast weekend, Stevenson was dominant in limiting Artem Harutyunyan to single-digit connects in 11 of 12 rounds while thoroughly outclassing him over 12 rounds. But it has been understandably hard for fans to separate that from the huge expectations coming in as Stevenson, an overwhelming betting favorite, was unable to finish Harutyunyan, which led to a chorus of boos in his hometown as groups of fans walked out of the Prudential Center before the fight was even over.\n\nFans will always prefer knockouts, which is an easy way to raise one's profile and demand large salaries. And an argument could certainly be made that Stevenson could've (or even should've) risked more danger in order to create an opening to finish an opponent who was demonstrably out of his league.\n\nBoxing, however, is just as much about the idea of \"hit and not get hit\" as it is about violence and the thrill of the knockout. And love him or hate him, Stevenson remains in discussion as quite possibly the best pure boxer in the game as a fighter who rarely gets hit clean despite largely operating within punching range directly in front of his opponents.\n\nThere will never be another Floyd Mayweather, which is why making comparisons to him can be difficult. But Stevenson remains the closest thing to a southpaw version of the boxer Mayweather became in his later years at welterweight when he used his personality to sell huge pay-per-views and then his sublime defensive skills to remove all of the danger by dissecting his opponents en route, typically, to a wide decision win.\n\nIf the debate here is whether Stevenson was wrong to turn down a guaranteed minimum of $3 million per fight over five bouts by Top Rank, that's one thing. As is, a debate whether Stevenson's reaction to the hefty criticism placed against him is the right move from a public relations standpoint.\n\nOnce again, however, that has nothing to do with his P4P ranking or whether or not the potential for him to fight in an exciting manner depends upon the style of the opponent across from him.\n\nNeed more proof? Look back on the three biggest wins to date in Stevenson's career, which came over a three-fight stretch beginning in 2021.\n\nStevenson captured a 130-pound title by dismantling Jamel Herring in a stoppage win before taking wide decisions from Oscar Valdez in their unification bout and later against Robson Conceicao. All three of those fights saw Stevenson walk down his opponents as the aggressor by landing big shots and avoiding the majority of the counter fire coming his way, all the while operating at close range.\n\nShould Stevenson had so boldly predicted a knockout of hard-hitting Edwin De Los Santos last November while knowing he was entering their vacant lightweight title bout with only one healthy hand? Again, from a commercial standpoint, that's all in fair play to critique. But Stevenson still dissuaded De Los Santos from going for broke while limiting him to a CompuBox record for fewest punches landed in lightweight division history.\n\nAs free agency looms, Stevenson still holds huge potential to land breakthrough fights against a number of big names, including Gervonta \"Tank\" Davis, Isaac \"Pitbull\" Cruz and Devin Haney. And while we can continue to debate all we want whether he will ever become a true A-side as a PPV brand given his defensive ways (both inside the ring and in his response to criticism), until someone finds a way to land big punches against him cleanly on a consistent basis, Stevenson remains a threat to disarm and decode every single one of them.\n\nUsing a criteria that takes into account everything from accomplishments to current form, let's take a closer look at the top fighters inside the ring. Below is the latest Pound for Pound rankings update after Rodriguez's win in June.\n\nPound-for-Pound Rankings1. Oleksandr Usyk\n\nUndisputed heavyweight champion (22-0, 14 KOs) | Previous ranking: No. 1\n\nUsyk's professional run has been as decorated as it has been perfect. The former undisputed cruiserweight champ scored a pair of resounding victories over Anthony Joshua to unify a trio of heavyweight titles before finally getting his undisputed clash against WBC champion Tyson Fury in May. An exciting, split-decision victory made Usyk just the third male boxer to become undisputed champion in two divisions during the four-belt era.\n\n2. Naoya Inoue\n\nUndisputed junior featherweight champion (24-0, 22 KOs) | Previous ranking: No. 2\n\nThe four-division champion who has reached undisputed status in at two different weight classes only continued his legendary takeover of the sport by rising from the canvas to finish Luis Nery in their May title bout at the Tokyo Dome. \"The Monster\" may have endured a brief misstep but he made up for the error by scoring three thrilling knockdowns en route to a sixth-round knockout. Unbeaten mandatory challenger Sam Goodman looks to be next.\n\n3. Terence Crawford\n\nUndisputed welterweight champion (39-0, 29 KOs) | Previous ranking: No. 3\n\nIf you wondered how great Crawford truly was, his dismantling of Spence in their undisputed title bout provided those answers. Crawford, who proved he would be a handful for any welterweight in history will move up to 154 pounds in August when he challenges WBA champion Israil Madrimov.\n\n4. Artur Beterbiev\n\nUnified light heavyweight champion (20-0, 20 KOs) | Previous ranking: 5\n\nBeterbiev turned away any whispers that he was getting old by dismantling former 168-pound champion Callum Smith in January. With his mandatories out of the way, an undisputed showdown against WBA champion Dmitry Bivol was scheduled for June 1. But the 39-year-old Beterbiev pulled out in May with a ruptured meniscus, which moved the fight to October.\n\n5. Dmitry Bivol\n\nWBA light heavyweight champion (23-0, 12 KOs) | Previous ranking: No. 6\n\nFollowing an incredible 2022, which included a victory over Canelo Alvarez and almost universal acclaim as the fighter of the year, Bivol sat out most of 2023 in hopes of facing unified champion Artur Beterbiev. Their undisputed title clash was set for June 1 until Beterbiev suffered a major injury, forcing Bivol to face replacement Malik Zinad, which he handled with ease.\n\n6. Canelo Alvarez\n\nUndisputed super middleweight champion (61-2-2, 38 KOs) | Previous ranking: No. 4\n\nThe former P4P king is still the undisputed champion of one of the sport's hottest divisions and he proved just that by brilliantly outdueling countryman Jaime Munguia in May. That doesn't mean the Mexican icon stands alone without criticism, however, as the boxing world continues to push for a superfight against two-time champion David Benavidez that Alvarez is outright avoiding.\n\n7. Gervonta Davis\n\nWBA lightweight champion (30-0, 28 KOs) | Previous ranking: 7\n\nDavis' body-shot knockout of Ryan Garcia in their superfight last April looks even better now that \"King Ryan\" became the first boxer to drop and defeat former undisputed lightweight king Devin Haney. With a 2023 jail sentence behind him, \"Tank\" returned in June to obliterate unbeaten Frank Martin. Davis wants champions from here on out, which could mean unification fights against Shakur Stevenson or Vasiliy Lomachenko.\n\n8. Jesse \"Bam\" Rodriguez\n\nFlyweight, junior bantamweight titleholder (20-0, 13 KOs) | Previous ranking: NR\n\nThe 24-year-old phenom from San Antonio landed just shy of 50 percent of his power shots to dismantle 115-pound titleholder Juan Francisco Estrada in July. Rodriguez added the name of Estrada, a future Hall of Famer, to the list of great fighters he has toppled, which include 115-pound stalwarts Carlos Cuadras and Srisaket Sor Rungvisai, and super flyweight standout Sunny Edwards.\n\n9. Shakur Stevenson\n\nWBC lightweight champion (22-0, 10 KOs) | Previous ranking: No. 9\n\nEven though he was nearly booed out of the arena - in his hometown, no less - while defending his title against Artem Harutyunyun in July, Stevenson limited his opponent to just 17 percent of punches landed overall and single digits in all but one round. The three-division champion remains under fire from boxing's court of public opinion who demand more in-ring excitement as he enters promotional free agency. Yet, Stevenson remains among the purest practitioners the sport has to offer.\n\n10. David Benavidez\n\nInterim light heavyweight titleholder (29-0, 24 KOs) | Previous ranking: No. 10\n\nFrustrated with waiting around for his shot at undisputed 168-pound king Canelo Alvarez, \"El Monstro\" moved up in weight to outclass former champion Oleksandr Gvozdyk in June. Benavidez, who later revealed injuries to both hands during training camp (which may have prevented him from scoring a stoppage), said he's open to big fights in either division moving forward.\n\nDropped out: None\n\nHonorable mention: Teofimo Lopez Jr., Vasiliy Lomachenko, Tyson Fury, Devin Haney, Junto Nakatani", "source": {"uri": "cbssports.com", "dataType": "news", "title":

He's been better than his 22 opponents to date, and because he's in his prime I expect him to continue to be better than everyone else he fights, too. Similar could be written about Davis, but three fights ago he was involved in a main event, on pay-per-view, against Hector Luis Garcia - a lower level of competition.\n\nI don't expect Stevenson to evolve into a fighter who provides a classic \"wow\" factor, but what he is capable of doing is beating Davis. I write that as someone who enjoys watching tacticians; I've watched him succeed in finding the path to victory in every fight, which is both what makes him so good and also what intrigues me about him. He can consistently make it look so effortless.\n\nHe didn't fight Harutyunyan with a sense of caution. He held his ground a lot - he's just not the kind of fighter who's at his very best when he does so, which means that when he does it almost looks a little awkward. Against Harutyunyan, when he was holding his ground and throwing certain punches, he started smothering some of his output because he was trying not to move away from where the action was unfolding. Because fighting like that doesn't come naturally to him there were times he found himself caught between two styles, but he's so good that he made it work for him anyway. Without producing his sharpest performance he also showed a clear effort to entertain, but, as someone who isn't a big puncher, doing so didn't - and often won't - lead to a knockout.\n\nSaturday's fight was Stevenson's last under contract to Top Rank. He's become a big enough deal that a television network can work with him while giving him a sense of freedom - similarly to Devin Haney. But whether he chooses to work independently, or to enter into an agreement with a major promoter, the most important thing for his reputation, career, and the sport is securing the best possible fights.\n\nIn some respects he's not easy to promote. We should never overlook that boxing is a business, but so are other sports, and in other sports we get to see the best against the best. Whether or not he's exciting, it's the promoter's job to figure out how to maximise his marketability. Stevenson's winning - he's doing his job. Whoever his promoter is will have to do theirs.\n\nIn recent months we've watched Stevenson-Harutyunyan, Davis-Martin, and Vasiliy Lomachenko-George Kambosos Jr, and watched Stevenson, Davis and Lomachenko all win. If Stevenson and Davis are considered the world's two best lightweights, then Lomachenko's the third - and at 36 years old his performance was the most impressive of the three.\n\nHaving accomplished as much as he has, Lomachenko would make an appealing opponent for both Stevenson and Davis, but having seen him take as many risks as he has it instead feels time for Davis to do so. Lomachenko has been spoken about as an opponent for both Davis and Stevenson, but a fight between Stevenson and Davis is the biggest in the division - let them fight, and then let Lomachenko, if he wants to keep fighting, fight the winner.\n\nWilliam Zepeda showed again that he deserves to be considered a rival to all three when he stopped Giovanni Cabrera in three rounds. His speed, and his intuitive pressure, could potentially wear the ageing Lomachenko down. Those same traits could also test Davis, but Davis' boxing IQ means I would give him the edge. It's Stevenson who might be the one who's capable of shutting him out.\n\nOne of the division's big names has to be Zepeda's target. He's an exciting fighter, and stopping Cabrera was impressive, because Cabrera's not easy to even look good against - let alone stop, and stop that quickly. Zepeda's previous opponent Maxi Hughes, like Cabrera, also had an awkward style, and Zepeda mauled through him in a similar way.", "source": {"uri": "boxingscene.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "BoxingScene.com"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frank_Martin_(boxer)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Frank Martin (boxer)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artem_Harutyunyan_(boxer)", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Artem Harutyunyan (boxer)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shakur_Stevenson", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Shakur Stevenson"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Card_(sports)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Card (sports)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vasiliy_Lomachenko", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Vasiliy Lomachenko"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Top_Rank", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Top Rank"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pay-per-view", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Pay-per-view"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knockout", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Knockout"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maxi_Hughes", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Maxi Hughes"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Zepeda", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "William Zepeda"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Devin_Haney", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Devin Haney"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lightweight", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Lightweight"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boxing", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Boxing"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Job-Related", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Job-Related", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 53}], "image": "https://www.boxingscene.com/uploads/pauliepicks.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9719485", "eventUri": "eng-9719485", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.0117647058823529, "wgt": 174, "relevance": 1}

There are strong rumors that Floyd Mayweather and Eddie Hearn will be going head-to-head in a bid to recruit Stevenson into their rosters. Stevenson praised both Mayweather and Hearn, and will even be attended a Matchroom event Saturday as Jaron Ennis fights David Avenesyan in Philadelphia.\n\nBoxing promotional icons Floyd Mayweather of Mayweather Promotions and Eddie Hearn of Matchroom may well be involved in a tug-of-war over the hottest free agent in boxing -- Shakur Stevenson.\n\nAfter winning a silver medal at the 2016 Olympic Games in Rio de Janeiro, Stevenson has won world championships in three different weight classes as a pro, and has boxed rings around the likes of Jamel Herring, Oscar Valdez, and Robson Conceicao.\n\nTop Rank, the historic outfit that represented many great fighters from Muhammad Ali to Mayweather himself, guided Stevenson's career up until his most recent outing -- a 12-round decision win over Artem Harutyunyun at Prudential Center in Newark, New Jersey on July 6.\n\nAfter that date, Stevenson became a free agent.\n\nRelated Why 2 Rappers Are at War With One of Boxing's Top Talents Shakur Stevenson\n\nTwo rap legends are mocking one of boxing's top talents Shakur Stevenson for the way he fights.\n\nStevenson Said he Likes Both Promoters He'd be a strong fit at Mayweather Promotions or Matchroom\n\nMayweather's firm Mayweather Promotions has more of a boutique approach to fighters, concentrating on a core unit of 10-25 athletes, rather than focus on a broader stable like Eddie Hearn has at Matchroom. While Hearn represents the likes of Anthony Joshua, Katie Taylor, Dmitriy Bivol, Jaron Ennis, and Jesse Rodriguez, Mayweather only has rising star Curmel Moton of note on his books and a fighter like Stevenson could revolutionize his company.\n\n\"I've got nothing but respect and love for Floyd,\" Stevenson said of the former five-weight world boxing champion. \"He's been talking to me a lot and helping me out.\"\n\nHe also heaped praise on Hearn.\n\n\"I think Eddie Hearn is one of the best promoters. Top Rank have ESPN. But promotion wise, Eddie Hearn is a better promoter.\"\n\nStevenson Will Attend a Matchroom Show Saturday The boxer will be in the crowd for the Ennis homecoming in Philadelphia\n\nMatchroom's next event takes place at Wells Fargo Center in Philadelphia, featuring Jaron 'Boots' Ennis against David Avenesyan. One interested spectactor will be Stevenson, who will not only be watching the fights, but will surely have one eye on Hearn, and how Matchroom promotes both boxing, and its fighters.\n\n\"Right now, Shakur Stevenson is one of the most talked about fighters in the world,\" said Hearn. \"I know I can make him a star, that's easy for me. I've got the dates, I've got the platform, I've got the megaphone - let's do it.\"\n\nMatchroom has quite a lot of events on the horizon, including the Riyadh Season sponsored mega fight card in

Instead, they met when Jill and Stevenson worked on his Senate campaign in 1972. \"I don't want to hurt anyone,\" he told the Daily Mail. \"But facts are facts and what happened, happened.\" The Bidens didn't comment on Stevenson's claims.\n\nLater, Stevenson contended Joe's family tried to use its influence to intimidate him during his and Jill's divorce. \"Frankie Biden of the Biden crime family comes up to me and he goes, 'Give her the house or you're going to have serious problems,'\" he told Newsmax in 2023, referring to Joe's brother and a beach property he owned under his company's name. While Stevenson has often criticized Joe, he generally has positive things to say about Jill. This time, he didn't spare her.", "source": {"uri": "nickiswift.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "NickiSwift.com"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bill_Stevenson_(musician)", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Bill Stevenson (musician)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Biden", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jill_Biden", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Jill Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Democratic Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Delaware", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Delaware"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Delaware"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2016_United_States_presidential_election", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "2016 United States presidential election"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daily_Mail", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Daily Mail"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Senate", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "United States Senate"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Death/In_Memoriam", "label": "dmoz/Society/Death/In Memoriam", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Advice", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Advice", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 76}], "image": "https://www.nickiswift.com/img/gallery/jill-bidens-ex-husband-has-a-shady-take-on-her-marriage-to-joe/l-intro-1720211917.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9719485", "eventUri": "eng-9719485", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-06-27", "textStart": 119, "textEnd": 126}, {"amb": false, "date": "2020-08-", "textStart": 476, "textEnd": 487}], "sentiment": 0.06666666666666665, "wgt": 150, "relevance": 1}

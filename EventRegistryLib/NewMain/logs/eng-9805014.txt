With 3.9 seconds remaining in the high school national semifinal, the No. 4 seeded back-to-back defending high school national champions were down 78-77. Seconds away from ending an incredible dynasty run of success at the top level of high school basketball.\n\nEnter Jaloni Cambridge.\n\nCatching a lobbing pass on the wing, Cambridge turned on the jets. The senior sped directly towards the basket before pulling up and hitting a running jump shot, securing Montverde Academy a spot in the national championship game.\n\nIt was just another day for Cambridge, leading her team with 33 points in that dramatic semifinal. That performance followed a triple-double of 19 points, 14 rebounds and 12 assists in the quarterfinal. All culminating in a third straight title on the back of a 17-point, nine-assist game by Cambridge in the title game.\n\nThat final high school tournament for Cambridge was especially exciting for Ohio State women's basketball fans. After the guard committed to head coach Kevin McGuff's side in December of 2023, the future of basketball in scarlet and gray hit a new level of hype.\n\nAfter signing on March 1, the No. 2 overall prospect Cambridge already made program history becoming the highest ranked recruit in school history.\n\nWhat Cambridge brings to Ohio State not only fills a hole left by now-WNBA player Jacy Sheldon's departure but keeps the Buckeyes in the conversation at the top of the Big Ten.\n\nCambridge's ability is clear in the countless highlight reels, but how she fits into the team isn't clear until she's on it. This summer, Cambridge joined the Buckeyes for summer practice and the guard is as advertised.\n\n\"I think with her just her speed and quickness and ability to make plays, she makes everybody around her better,\" said Coach McGuff. \"And so her teammates really love playing with her.\"\n\nOn the court, not many in the conference will compete with Cambridge for quickest but what makes Cambridge so dangerous is the ability to stay poised in that speed.\n\nThe freshman point guard gets to spots before defenders and sees plays develop on the court. When it comes time to make a decision on the offensive half of the court, Cambridge can go one of many directions.\n\nFirst, Cambridge can score. The quickness means charging into the paint and moving around defenders, but that skill combined with three-level shooting ability keeps opponents guessing. Will Cambridge go to the hoop? Take a three? Pull up for a midrange jumper? Cambridge has the ability to hit them all.\n\nThen there's finding teammates. Cambridge was the No. 1 point guard in the 2024 class for a reason. The guard averaged 6.6 assists per game as a high school senior, playing with other top prospects. Now Cambridge has a team including stars like guard Chance Gray and forwards Cotie McMahon and Taylor Thierry.\n\nThere's also a returning teammate who Cambridge knows well -- her sister Kennedy Cambridge. After transferring to Ohio State before the 2023-24 season, Kennedy became one of the reasons Jaloni will play a majority of her games in Columbus, Ohio this season.\n\nCambridge is the youngest of nine siblings, all playing basketball in the footsteps of their dad, and former Alabama A&M legend, Desmond Cambridge.\n\nJaloni and Kennedy reunite after playing three seasons together at the Ensworth School in Tennessee, with the youngest Cambridge transferring to Montverde Academy for her final high school season.\n\nPlaying on the varsity team as an eighth grader, Jaloni played alongside her now-Ohio State teammate Kennedy for two state championships in Tennessee. It's a partnership that was a determining factor in Cambridge to choosing Ohio State in the first place.\n\nThat partnership gives Cambridge an advantage at the college level. Already knowing the ins and outs of one of your teammates. Add that to the hard work that earned her MaxPrep's National Player of the Year award for the 23-24 high school season and its a competitive advantage for the Big Ten side.\n\nEven so, like any young prospect, adjusting to the college game is a process. Although Cambridge's ceiling isn't visible to the naked eye, coach McGuff's approach is natural for someone in her position.\n\n\"I don't want to over overhype it because we haven't played a game yet,\" said McGuff. \"And I don't want to put undue pressure on her because but I do see a bright, bright future ahead for her.\"\n\nWhen Ohio State does start to play this fall, there's a strong possibility that Cambridge is a big piece of the puzzle.\n\nFor the last four years, McGuff's had the luxury of a veteran side who are game tested. Following the Buckeyes' early exit in the second round of the NCAA Tournament, six upperclassmen left the program, with five exhausting NCAA eligibility.\n\nCambridge's experience playing with and against the best in high school basketball, plus history with Team USA's youth system and countless showcases like the McDonald's All-American Game and Nike Hoops Summit under her belt, makes her the likely starting pick.\n\nOhio State plays a system that mirrors the type of player Cambridge is on the court. The Scarlet & Gray like to run on offense and pressure on defense. Cambridge, who also averaged three steals per game, can do everything needed to help Ohio State continue to excel in the NCAA.\n\nNow, fans hope Cambridge and Buckeyes are building a side that can do what the program has never done before -- winning a national title of their own.", "source": {"uri": "landgrantholyland.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Land-Grant Holy Land"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basketball_positions", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Basketball positions"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Montverde_Academy", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Montverde Academy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ohio_State_Buckeyes_men's_basketball", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Ohio State Buckeyes men's basketball"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/College_football_national_championships_in_NCAA_Division_I_FBS", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "College football national championships in NCAA Division I FBS"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secondary_school", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Secondary school"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basketball", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Basketball"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cambridge", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Cambridge"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Cambridge"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assist_(basketball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Assist (basketball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Double-double", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Double-double"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kevin_McGuff", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Kevin McGuff"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jump_shot_(basketball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Jump shot (basketball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ohio_State_Buckeyes", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Ohio State Buckeyes"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Women's_basketball", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Women's basketball"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_Ten_Conference", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Big Ten Conference"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rebound_(basketball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Rebound (basketball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Point_guard", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Point guard"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_F._Kennedy", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "John F.

And while I'll reject Chris' invitation to accuse him of being 'a miserable, cantankerous old curmudgeon who is seeing more negatives than positives' (his words), I will take up his offer to respond, so that readers can 'hear from the powers-that be' about our vision for Cambridge.\n\nAs custodians of the city, local leaders need to take difficult decisions, which we do with the needs of all of our residents, businesses, visitors and the environment at the forefront of our minds. This isn't always straightforward and there's not always an easy answer.\n\nTake congestion. Chris asks 'Is road traffic in Cambridge, once so congested, really still so bad that drivers ... need to be thumped in their wallets to discourage them from coming in by car?'. Well, to be honest, it's complicated.\n\nWe all care about Cambridge, whether we live, work or visit the city. Most folk will agree that the way we travel around the city and wider region needs to change - but we need to balance that with retaining what makes Cambridge unique.\n\nThe Greater Cambridge Partnership (GCP) has a vital role in this. It was set up in 2014 by the government as a partnership between Cambridge City, South Cambridgeshire District and Cambridgeshire County councils to deliver projects, infrastructure and technology to improve people's lives and their experiences of moving around Greater Cambridge - now and in the future.\n\nAlthough not easy, we are now seeing real progress in the delivery of new infrastructure that will make travel easier, safer and more reliable. Giving choice about how people travel to get to where they need to be.\n\nThousands of people travel over the Chisholm Trail every day, which brings everyone living in some of the most deprived areas of Cambridge within a 10-minute cycle of a railway station.\n\nBy the end of September, all major works on Milton Road should be complete - providing new bus lanes and walking and cycling links to improve people's daily journeys. This follows on from the delivery of the award-winning Histon Road project.\n\nI haven't yet touched upon our busway projects - which will transform how people get in and out of the city - or the 12 Greenway active travel routes, subsiding the Park & Ride sites, or how later this year we'll be trialling cutting-edge autonomous buses which could form the future of transportation around our city and beyond.\n\nSimilarly, the Cambridgeshire and Peterborough Combined Authority (CPCA) has a vital role to play as strategic transport authority for the region. The Combined Authority is responsible for delivering our Local Transport and Connectivity Plan, which provides the blueprint for how we can challenge the status quo and improve connectivity for all.\n\nSeveral initiatives that provide alternatives to travelling by car have already been implemented, including the Voi electric bike and scooter trials in the city, and introducing the Tiger bus fares for young people who can now travel anywhere within the county for just \u00a31. The Combined Authority will also shortly be launching a consultation on how buses are run across Cambridgeshire and Peterborough.\n\nChris raises concerns as to the cost of parking in city council car parks. Fees have increased, albeit in line with comparative commercial parking operators. But we want to encourage people spending the day in town to choose the Park & Ride (\u00a33.50 return) or other options, while still enabling short-stay trips for under \u00a310 for anyone popping in briefly outside of peak times for shopping or leisure.\n\nChris suggests that we've been 'unashamedly raking in millions each year from people coming in by car' and queries whether this is 'actually just about swelling the council's bank account'. Car parking charges are indeed a vital part of balancing the council's books.\n\nWe receive reduced funding from central government year on year, which means councils up and down the country are having to generate their own income to cover the costs of delivering much-needed frontline services. We take in around \u00a39million a year from parking fees, which contributes to the \u00a3100million we spend each year.\n\nFrom collecting household recycling and bins, tackling homelessness and providing services in the community, to looking after our parks and open spaces, and running elections and staffing polling stations (twice this year!) - we need to generate an income to cover these costs, and think this is the right approach to doing so.\n\nChris asks 'What are the councils doing about Cambridge's retail scene?', while acknowledging that 'most of us are buying most of our stuff online, and shops are struggling to keep bricks-and-mortar emporia afloat'. Well, while I agree that it is sad to see empty retail units, we are fortunate in Cambridge to have a very low proportion compared to other parts of the country, where units are left empty in the long term. This is because of our growing local economy, and because of the desire and investment which enables the city to adapt to the changes in demand, such as the increase in entertainment, leisure and cultural experiences.\n\nHaving said that, we are committed to supporting Cambridge's businesses, particularly those that are locally owned or independents and social enterprises, because of the contribution they make to providing jobs, and social and cultural value to the city.\n\nWe're running a scheme to support market traders to enhance their business operations, and apply for \u00a31,000 grant funding to help develop their business; and the Youth Enterprise Market Challenge for 16 to 25-year-olds to transform their business ideas into thriving market stalls.\n\nWe are also working with Indie Cambridge, Allia, and Cambridge BID (Business Improvement District) to support and promote local small businesses and enhance the city for residents and visitors, from practical support and access to Green Business Grants, to considering how tourism can be better managed in Cambridge, or hosting arts and cultural events in the city centre.\n\nFinally, Chris invited us to share our vision for 'a bright future for Cambridge', if there is one. As an old bloke myself, I believe there is. The city council has recently committed to a new vision, for a Cambridge where:\n\n- residents enjoy a high quality of life and exemplar public services\n\n- decarbonisation and sustainability are central to prosperity\n\n- innovation benefits people and planet\n\n- development is sustainable and inclusive\n\n- arts, sports, and culture are thriving, and\n\n- democratic accountability is genuine and accessible\n\nWe believe the future of this city is very bright, but we are simply custodians and to get it right we need to hear and listen to people like Chris. These are difficult challenges, and it's only by engaging in these conversations that we will be able to ensure we do the right thing for this beautiful city. So, from one old bloke to another, thank you.", "source": {"uri": "cambridgeindependent.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "Cambridge Independent"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transport_in_Cambridge", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Transport in Cambridge"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chris_Elliott", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Chris Elliott"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cambridge", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Cambridge"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Cambridge"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cambridgeshire_and_Peterborough_Combined_Authority", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Cambridgeshire and Peterborough Combined Authority"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Cambridgeshire", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "South Cambridgeshire"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Districts_of_England", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Districts of England"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cambridge_City_Council", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Cambridge City Council"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cambridge_City_F.C.", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Cambridge City F.C."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Park_and_ride", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Park and ride"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/District", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "District"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Folk_music", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Folk music"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/County_council", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "County council"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Op-ed", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Op-ed"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Councillor", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Councillor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bus", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Bus"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cambridgeshire", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Cambridgeshire"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chisholm_Trail", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Chisholm Trail"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bus_lane", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Bus lane"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/County", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "County"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greenway_(landscape)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Greenway (landscape)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bus_rapid_transit", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Bus rapid transit"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Status_quo", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Status quo"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Histon_F.C.", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Histon F.C."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electric_bicycle", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Electric bicycle"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parking_lot", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Parking lot"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Milton,_Cambridgeshire", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Milton, Cambridgeshire"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Milton, Cambridgeshire"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Independent_politician", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Independent politician"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_service", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Public service"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Government_of_the_United_Kingdom", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Government of the United Kingdom"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society", "label": "dmoz/Society", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Work", "label": "dmoz/Society/Work", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Lifestyle_Choices", "label": "dmoz/Society/Lifestyle Choices", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Advice", "label": "dmoz/Society/Advice", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Activism/In_Daily_Life", "label": "dmoz/Society/Activism/In Daily Life", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 62}], "image": "https://www.cambridgeindependent.co.uk/_media/img/85Z6YY32RWHGL91YJBEB.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9805014", "eventUri": "eng-9805014", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.0980392156862745, "wgt": 169, "relevance": 1}

Giving examples from his own life as an actor, Jameel Khan shared several anecdotes exclusively with the indianexpress.com. He also talked about the alleged politics around Gangs Of Wasseypur casting. \"Anurag Kashyap besharam hoke kehta hai, 'I don't make any personal connections with people,'\" said Khan. The actor also spoke about how directors hold on to grudges after you turn down their offers. Jameel opened up about his initial days where he was asked to leave the industry if he cared about his self-respect. He said, \"I won't name this director, but I remember I met him through a friend and he said, 'Agar tumhe apni izzat pyaari hai toh wapas chale jao (If you respect yourself, go back),' I was like, 'sir, why did you say that?'. He said, \"A lot of people like you come here, dhakke khaate hai aur dhakke khaake wapas jab jaate hai toh unke shehron mein log unka mazak udaate hai ki le gaye the hero banne aur zero banke aagaye hai (People come here, struggle for years and return to their native towns. Then people make fun of them and say these guys went to become heroes and have returned as zeroes)'. You will suffer a lot, so just think again and return from where you have come.' Then after many years, I don't think he even remembers the incident, but he called for a film and I didn't like the role. So I very politely turned down his offer,\" he said. However, Jameel says directors hold grudge after actors turn down offers. He said, \"Previously, we needed producers and directors. We used to ask for jobs and were not paid much. But, that has changed for me now. Another difference is that, when I turn down a role, they don't get offended. Earlier, when I used to turn them down, they would feel quite offended. They used to be like, 'How dare you, don't you know I am a respected director?' I used to be like, 'Are bhai, if I don't like the role, give me the choice to turn it down. It's your choice to cast me for this role, I to should have a choice where I can turn it down if I don't want to take it up. Why are you offended?'\" ALSO READ | \u2018Amitabh Bachchan is a charmer, Shah Rukh Khan plays part of big brother, Salman Khan-Aishwarya Rai are stars\u2019: Jameel Khan He added, \"A lot of people who I have turned down have never got back to me. There are people who keep grudge against you for these things. But, through you I would like to say to people that 'if I have ever offended you or hurt you please let that thing go and I would love to work with good directors. If you are hurt if I have turned you down, but if there's a good role and story, I will love to take it up.' \" Jameel also shared his experience of the politics that takes place in the industry. \"We all live in society and politics is inevitable in this society. You will see politics in every field. Some things happen in your favour and some against you. There are always people who will pull you down or backstab you. It will keep happening. It is all part of society. I too have faced it, don't ask me how and why. But it is all part of our journey and that's how we gain experience and grow up\", told Jameel. Jameel, who played the role of Asgar Khan in Anurag Kashyap directorial Gangs of Wasseypur films, shared his opinion about the director.

He knew me since my theatre days, but he never cast me in any of his films. Even for Gangs of Wasseypur, Manoj Bajpayee suggested my name to him and that's how he cast me. Again after that, till date, he hasn't cast me. This is who he is.\" He added, \"He (Anurag Kashyap) shamelessly confesses that he is a very detached kind of person. I don't make a lot of personal connections. Badi besharmi se woh yeh baat kehta hai (He shamelessly tells this to people). But at least he is telling it to their face, which is a good thing. Whenever he will have a role which will suit me, he will approach me. He is happy in his own world and I am happy in my own world. Everybody have their own experiences, some have good ones, others have bad ones. But that's life.\"", "summary": "", "url": "https://indianexpress.com/article/entertainment/bollywood/jameel-khan-on-gangs-of-wasseypur-detached-anurag-kashyap-and-directors-who-hold-grudges-politics-is-inevitable-in-society-9420452/", "image": "https://images.indianexpress.com/2024/06/Anurag-Jameel.jpg", "video": null, "publish_date": "2024-06-29 02:41:26", "author": "Jyothi Jha", "authors": ["Jyothi Jha"], "language": "en", "source_country": "in", "sentiment": -0.17}

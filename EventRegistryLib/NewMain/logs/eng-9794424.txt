Its smaller rival Lyft is faring no better, down 2.6% at 10.64 on the stock market today after losing 10.7% last week.\n\nThe shares are sliding amid a market sell-off that has hit tech particularly hard. A weak U.S. monthly jobs report Friday heightened concerns that the U.S. economy is slowing down. That could be especially troubling for companies like Uber and Lyft that rely on discretionary consumer spending.\n\nMeanwhile, both Uber and Lyft shares have already been under pressure this year by concerns about Tesla launching a robotaxi service. Investors fear that Tesla's plan to launch its own app could give both Uber and Lyft a deep-pocketed new rival.\n\nOverall, Uber stock is down 5.5% year-to-date after gaining 150% last year. Lyft stock gained 26% last year but is down 30% so far this year. Here's what to know ahead of both firms' earnings reports:\n\nUber Stock: What To Watch For Q2\n\nUber will report second-quarter earnings early Tuesday. Analysts polled by FactSet expect earnings to increase 72% to 31 cents per share. Sales, meanwhile, are seen rising 14.5% to $10.6 billion.\n\nUBS analyst Stephen Ju wrote in a recent client note that \"investors should be keenly focused on mobility growth in 2Q24 and beyond, with lingering uncertainty\" after Uber missed booking estimates in its previous quarter.\n\nOn average, analysts expect Uber's overall bookings value to grow 18% year-over-year to $39.6 billion, according to FactSet. Within that category, analysts expect rides-related bookings to grow 21.2% to $20.3 billion, according to FactSet. Food delivery related bookings are expected to grow 16% to $18 billion.\n\nAs far as investor concerns about Tesla's robotaxi, \"it seems the AV overhang is here to stay,\" BofA Securities analyst Justin Post wrote to clients last week.\n\nBut he added, \"we expect Uber to highlight positive recent events that could aid sentiment.\"\n\nThat includes Tesla delaying its robotaxi event from August to October, Uber's new delivery partnership with Costco, and a recent court win for the company's gig work model in California.\n\nLyft, meanwhile, will report its earnings early Wednesday. The company remains the much smaller challenger to Uber. Lyft is focused strictly in North America and on rides, while Uber has the international and food and grocery delivery businesses.\n\nFor Lyft's June quarter, analysts expect adjusted earnings per share to increase 7% to 16 cents, according to FactSet. Sales are forecast to rise 36% to $1.39 billion.\n\nJefferies analyst John Colantuoni told clients that investors will be looking for upside to Lyft's second-quarter booking and for its earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization (EBITDA).\n\nSuch upside \"will be necessary for the market to gain comfort in Lyft's seemingly aggressive 3-year outlook,\" Colantuoni wrote in a client note last week. Jefferies has a neutral hold call on Lyft stock.\n\nAt an investor event earlier this year, Lyft management told analysts it expects gross bookings to grow at an annual rate of 15% through 2027. The firm also forecast adjusted EBITDA margin of about 4% on a full-year basis in 2027.\n\nAnalysts see Lyft's total bookings value growing roughly 18% year-over-year to $4.06 billion for the second quarter, according to FactSet consensus.\n\nWhat DoorDash Results Mean For Uber Stock\n\nMore broadly, Colantuoni said that concerns about softening consumer spending is going to bring more investor focus to earnings growth for the \"delivery and mobility\" category, which includes Uber, Lyft and DoorDash (DASH).\n\nDoorDash reported its second-quarter results late Thursday to a positive response. The company's shares jumped 8% Friday after the company's sales and adjusted earnings beat expectations.\n\nEvercore ISI analyst Mark Mahaney said DoorDash's results gave a positive signal for Uber's food and grocery delivery business. He rates Uber a positive outperform.\n\n\"(DoorDash) reported robust consumer demand with strength in restaurant delivery and monthly active user growth in Q2,\" Mahaney wrote to clients Sunday. \"Management has not seen signs of broader macro consumer weakness as US restaurant delivery continues to grow supported by Grocery/Convenience adoption, consistent with our checks suggesting strong Q2 trends.\"\n\nUber Stock: Technical Ratings\n\nComing into trading Monday, Uber stock still held a weak IBD Composite Rating of 42 out of 99, according to IBD Stock Checkup. The score combines five separate proprietary ratings into one. The best growth stocks have a Composite Rating of 90 or better.\n\nUber stock's Relative Strength Rating score was 45 out of a best-possible 99. The score puts Uber's 12-month performance in the bottom half of all stocks tracked by IBD.\n\nLyft, meanwhile, has a Composite Rating of 44 out of 99. Its Relative Strength score is 16 out of 99.\n\nYOU MAY ALSO LIKE:\n\nTesla Robotaxi Push Brings 'Cloud Of Uncertainty' For Uber And Lyft, Analyst Says\n\nUber And Lyft Score Gig Work Court Win.

The stock rose about 4% in pre-market trading.\n\nHere's how the company did for the period ending June 30, compared to analysts' estimates:\n\nRevenue increased 16% from $9.23 billion a year earlier, Uber said in a press release. The company's mobility unit reported a 23% increase in gross bookings to $20.6 billion. Gross bookings rose 16% in delivery to $18.1 billion, and were flat in the freight unit at $1.27 billion.\n\nCEO Dara Khosrowshahi had said the company expect around 20% growth for the second quarter, based on anticipated continued expansion in its core mobility business, and rising frequency of orders for food and trips through its membership subscribers.\n\nFor the third quarter, Uber expects bookings of $40.25 billion to $41.75 billion. The middle of the range, $41 billion, fell shy of the $41.18 billion average estimate, according to StreetAccount.

But the company slipped into a loss in the first three months of this year, as losses from its equity investments and legal settlements hit its bottom line even as its underlying operations stayed profitable.\n\nA sharp selloff in stocks could weigh on Uber's equity investments, propelling it into another loss in the coming months, though the company said it expects sales to grow and its underlying operations to remain profitable in the current quarter.\n\nUber said it expects the total value of transactions on its app -- or gross bookings -- to come in between $40.25 billion to $41.75 billion in the current quarter. Analysts polled by FactSet were expecting $41.18 billion. The company expects adjusted earnings between $1.58 billion and $1.68 billion, compared with analysts' estimate of $1.63 billion. That number strips out the impact of equity investments and several other costs to underscore the strength of a company's underlying operations.\n\nUber's gross bookings grew in the second quarter by 19% year-over-year to $39.95 billion, slightly above analysts' expectations. Ride bookings rose 23% while delivery bookings grew 16%.\n\nRevenue, or Uber's cut from those bookings, expanded 16% to $10.7 billion, also slightly above expectations.\n\nPrices for Uber's rides and deliveries have increased as the company has pivoted to profitability, helping its revenue. Uber has also made a big push into in-app advertising, a high-margin business. Its ad revenue exceeded a run rate of $1 billion last quarter.\n\nHailing Ubers and ordering in has become normalized for many consumers even though it isn't as cheap anymore. Analysts are waiting to see the margins Uber and its peers can sustain as the industry matures.\n\nGetting here has been a bumpy ride. Uber has cut back on deep discounts and abandoned expensive moonshots. It cut thousands of jobs during the pandemic and shelved ambitious plans to develop self-driving technology. The belt-tightening continued through last year, with smaller cuts in its freight and delivery businesses.\n\nThe company overcame a big regulatory hurdle last month when California's Supreme Court preserved Uber and other gig-labor-dependent companies' independent-contractor models in the state. In June, Uber reached a settlement with the attorney general of Massachusetts that promised workers a minimum wage alongside some benefits.\n\nSome regulatory challenges loom for Uber's food-delivery unit. New York City and Seattle recently adopted new laws aimed at raising driver pay, leading Uber Eats to charge new fees to consumers to make up for additional costs.\n\nUp through Monday's close, Uber's shares had risen 29% over the previous 12 months. The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite Index rose 16% over the same period.", "source": {"uri": "livemint.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "mint"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uber", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Uber"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Equity_(finance)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Equity (finance)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Settlement_(litigation)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Settlement (litigation)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_company", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Public company"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Market_share", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Market share"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stock", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Stock"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mobile_app", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Mobile app"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Revenue", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Revenue"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Massachusetts_Attorney_General", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Massachusetts Attorney General"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nasdaq_Composite", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Nasdaq Composite"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supreme_Court_of_the_United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Supreme Court of the United States"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minimum_wage", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Minimum wage"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advertising", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Advertising"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seattle", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Seattle"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Seattle"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/California", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "California"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "California"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_City", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "New York City"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "New York City"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Business/Investing", "label": "dmoz/Business/Investing", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Stocks_and_Bonds", "label": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Stocks and Bonds", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Financial_Services/Cash_Flow", "label": "dmoz/Business/Financial Services/Cash Flow", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Major_Companies", "label": "dmoz/Business/Major Companies", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 88}], "image": "https://www.livemint.com/lm-img/img/2024/08/06/600x338/UBER-RESULTS--0_1722944149108_1722944182085.JPG", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9794424", "eventUri": "eng-9794424", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1450980392156862, "wgt": 186, "relevance": 1}

The company's core earnings reached $1.60 billion, beating the forecasted $1.51 billion. Steady demand for ride-sharing and food delivery services, along with the return to offices and outdoor activities, bolstered Uber's performance. The ride-sharing segment saw a 25% increase in revenue to $6.13 billion, surpassing expectations. Growth was most pronounced in Latin America and Asia-Pacific, particularly Brazil, Australia, and India. Key initiatives, such as airport ride services improvements, Uber Shuttle, discounted student subscriptions, and pre-scheduled shared rides, contributed significantly. However, the delivery business slightly underperformed, with $3.29 billion in revenue against the anticipated $3.32 billion.\n\nUber's strong performance signals a robust market demand for both transportation and delivery services. While the delivery segment fell slightly short, the overall growth and high engagement in ride-sharing depict a confident consumer base. Investors will be keenly watching Lyft's upcoming earnings report, expecting it to reveal whether Uber's success is indicative of the broader market trend.\n\nThe bigger picture: Driving global growth.\n\nUber continues to solidify its presence globally, with significant growth in Latin America and Asia-Pacific regions. This expansive growth strategy, combined with innovative service offerings, positions Uber well against potential economic headwinds.

Revenue grew 16% year-over-year, the fastest pace in five quarters.\n\nUber said that it earned 47 cents per share on sales of $10.7 billion for the June-ending quarter. On average, analysts projected the San Francisco-based company would post earnings of 31 cents per share on revenue of $10.6 billion, according to FactSet.\n\nFor the same period a year earlier, Uber earned 18 cents per share on sales of $9.2 billion.\n\nFor the current quarter, Uber guided for gross bookings of $40.25 billion and $41.75 billion. Prior to the company posting its results, analysts were projecting Uber would tally $41.18 billion in bookings for the September-ending quarter, according to FactSet.\n\nFurther, the company said it expects adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization (EBITDA) between $1.58 billion and $1.68 billion for the third quarter. Uber stock analysts had projected $1.63 billion in adjusted EBITDA for the third quarter.\n\nUber stock fell 1% in Monday trading, sliding intraday to its lowest levels since last November. Shares have lost 5% this year but are up 29% in the past 12 months. Shares have slumped amid concerns about Tesla launching its own robotaxi service and mountings fears of a U.S. recession.\n\nComing into the report, Uber stock had an IBD Composite Rating of 42 out of a best-possible 99, according to IBD Stock Checkup. The score combines five separate proprietary ratings into one rating. The best growth stocks have a Composite Rating of 90 or better.\n\nFurther, Uber stock's Relative Strength Rating score was 45 out of a best-possible 99.

The episode then dives into Uber Technologies and AppLovin before their upcoming earnings releases to see if investors should buy these tech stocks trading at least 25% below their highs.\n\nHealthy Stock Market Pullback\n\nWall Street is finally selling stocks and locking in profits on overheated technology companies and other areas as Q2 earnings season ramps up. The Nasdaq got rejected at its 50-day moving average on Thursday, closing 2.3% lower as investors recalibrated stocks amid concerns about the economy and artificial intelligence-based gains.\n\nDespite what some may say or think, the market pullback is healthy since stocks and indexes cannot climb straight up. The Nasdaq climbed too far above key long-term and short-term moving averages. The Nasdaq also hit very overbought levels in terms of the Relative Strength Index (RSI) (bottom part of the chart) -- it is used to help determine if a stock or index is too expensive or too cheap based on its recent performance.\n\nHealthy stock markets are full of peaks and valleys even in the strongest bull runs. Investors must remember that periods of stock market weakness or downturns in strong individual stocks are often the best times to buy. This idea is the basis for one of Warren Buffett's most famous quotes about buying stocks.\n\nNow let's dive into Uber and AppLovin stock to see if investors should consider buying UBER and APP on the dip before their upcoming earnings releases.\n\nBuy Uber Stock Down 25% from its Highs?\n\nUber Technologies stock fell 5% on Thursday extending Uber's recent drop and its broader 25% downturn from its February highs. Uber posted its first full-year profit as a public company in 2023 by expanding its ride-hailing and delivery businesses while streamlining its operations.\n\nWall Street sold the stock as Uber's FY24 consensus earnings per share (EPS) estimate slipped over the last few months. Yet, Uber's most recent/accurate FY24 EPS estimate is 42% above consensus.\n\nUber is projected to grow its revenue by 17% in 2024 and 2025 to hit $50.67 billion next year -- up from $13 billion in pre-Covid 2019. The ride-hailing company's earnings outlook remains strong and Uber is expected to boost its monthly active platform consumers by 10% to 165 million in 2024.\n\nUber's core businesses are especially popular with higher-income consumers, shielding them from inflation concerns. The firm is expanding its delivery business in Asia through a key acquisition and Uber just announced a multi-year strategic partnership with EV-maker BYD. Uber is poised to play a significant role in the driverless vehicle revolution across ride-hailing, delivery, and freight/trucking.\n\nUber stock has soared 180% off its 2022 lows even though it has pulled back 25% from Uber's February highs. Uber could find support near its 50-week moving, trading at its most oversold RSI levels since it bottomed in the summer of 2022 (it hit its most overbought RSI levels in February).\n\nUber stock trades 35% below its average Zacks price target and at a 95% discount to its highs at 39.9X forward earnings. Uber's PEG ratio -- factors in the longer-term EPS growth outlook -- offers 52% value compared to the Zacks Tech sector.\n\nSome investors might want to wait until after Uber reports its Q2 financial results on August 6. But Wall Street loves the stock, with 35 of the 42 brokerage recommendations Zacks has at \"Strong Buys.\"\n\nIs AppLovin Stock Worth Investors' Attention Down 35%?\n\nAppLovin is an app monetization firm that designs tools to help app developers improve marketing, revenue generation, and beyond to boost profitable expansion. Wall Street fell in love with AppLovin's AI-enhanced features that are helping APP grow its sales and earnings. APP stock also bounced back as digital advertising rebounded after its 2022 slowdown.\n\nAppLovin is projected to post 32% sales growth in 2024 from $3.28 billion to $4.33 billion and then pop 10% next year to $4.77 billion -- up 230% vs. 2020. Zacks estimates call for AppLovin's adjusted EPS to soar 202% to $2.96 a share in 2024 and climb 21% higher next year.\n\nAppLovin stock skyrocketed over 650% since late 2022, including an 85% YTD run to blow away the Tech sector. APP's surge was fueled by AppLovin's soaring earnings outlook, with its FY24 estimate up 250% YoY. AppLovin stands to benefit from our app and smartphone-obsessed world.\n\nAppLovin stock fell 2.6% on Thursday and APP is down 18% from its 52-week highs. Investors also have the chance to buy APP stock 35% below its all-time highs heading into its Q2 earnings release on August 7. APP trades right near its 21-week moving average and below its 50-day.\n\nTurning to valuation, AppLovin trades at a 95% discount to its three-year highs at 23.3X forward 12-month earnings. APP trades 45% below its three-year median and 13% below the Zacks Tech sector.

Why Uber Stock Could Accelerate to $80 This Year.", "body": "Furthermore, concerns about Uber losing business to robotaxi companies may be overstated.\n\nRide-hailing and food-delivery service Uber Technologies (NYSE:UBER) hasn't rewarded its investors with stellar returns this year, but don't fret. 2024 isn't even close to being finished yet, and an important piece of news from California should convince the skeptics to buy Uber stock today.\n\nThe Uber share price zoomed up to $80 several times this year before pulling back. That's frustrating, but patience will pay off in the end. So, I invite you to ride it out and hold your Uber shares even if the road may be long and winding.\n\nFor years, Uber drivers in California were considered as gig workers, also known as independent contractors. However, some of Uber's drivers wanted to get benefits and protections typically associated with full-time employees.\n\nThat's not likely to happen anytime soon, though. Previously, a lower court in California ruled that Proposition 22, which would allow Uber to classify its drivers in California as independent contractors, is constitutional. More recently, the Supreme Court of California upheld the ruling of that lower court.\n\nThis means Uber can continue to classify its drivers as gig workers, as opposed to employees. A Reuters report explained why this is crucial for a company like Uber:\n\n\"Employees are entitled to minimum wage, overtime pay, reimbursements for expenses and other protections that do not extend to independent contractors, who can cost companies up to 30% less, according to several studies.\"\n\nIn other words, while the California Supreme Court's ruling might not be great news for all Uber drivers, it will probably benefit Uber's bottom line.\n\nIn other news, some Uber shareholders might be concerned about self-driving taxis, or robotaxis, taking market share from Uber. Are these autonomous vehicles likely to put Uber out of business?\n\nThat's not likely to happen in the near future. A study commissioned by Forbes Advisor (via Bloomberg) determined that \"93% of Americans have concerns about some aspect of self-driving cars.\" Furthermore, 51% of consumers said they were \"somewhat or very unlikely to own or use a self-driving vehicle in the next five years,\" while \"61% of Americans said they wouldn't trust a self-driving car with their loved ones or children.\"\n\nThus, many consumers don't trust robotaxis. Besides, Uber Technologies CEO Dara Khosrowshahi seems prepared to accept autonomous vehicles into Uber's business model. He assured that autonomous vehicle technology \"holds a promise of safer rides\" and \"holds a promise of expanding the marketplace by lowering prices and making mobility delivery available for a wider swath of the population.\"\n\nUber Technologies is undoubtedly the best-known American ride-sharing service. Despite the advent of robotaxis, Uber should continue to thrive for a long time. Moreover, Uber won't likely have much difficulty integrating robotaxis into its business model.\n\nAlso, the California Supreme Court's ruling upholding of Proposition 22 represents a huge win for Uber. So, this is the time for Uber stock traders to accelerate, not hit the brakes. In other words, grab some Uber shares and prepare for a ride to $80 and higher in 2024's second half.\n\nOn the date of publication, David Moadel did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

But the company has chosen to highlight the success of its autonomous vehicle effort, likely to assuage investors concerned about incoming competition from Tesla, which aims to reveal its first robotaxi in October.\n\nUber said in its second-quarter results statement that the number of trips performed by autonomous vehicles rose 6x from a year earlier - up from what the company didn't say. And, the first thing Uber highlighted in its presentation deck was AVs in a section titled, \"Autonomous Vehicle Spotlight.\" It detailed how the ride-hail and delivery giant has the right utilization, consumer experience and go-to-market expertise to \"drive the greatest value for AV partners.\"\n\nTesla CEO Elon Musk has repeatedly described Tesla's future robotaxi network as having a similar business model to Uber and Airbnb, where Tesla owners could add their properly equipped vehicles to the carmaker's own ride-sharing app. In places where there aren't enough people to share their cars, Tesla would provide a dedicated fleet of robotaxis.\n\nUber began partnering with Waymo, Alphabet's autonomous vehicle subsidiary, in October 2023 to offer robotaxi rides in Phoenix. That progressed to autonomous deliveries in the city in April.\n\nThe company noted in its investor deck that having a hybrid network of autonomous and human drivers \"enables consistent, high-quality and reliable consumer experiences across all geographies, 24/7.\"\n\nUber is also counting autonomous freight shipments in the total AV trip count. The company partnered with AV trucking company Waabi in September 2023, and The two companies have been doing commercial pilots between Dallas and Houston with a driver behind the wheel for the last 11 months. More recently, Uber Freight signed a multi-year deal with Aurora Innovation, another AV trucking startup, that will see the latter's autonomous driving tech being offered on the Uber Freight network through 2030.\n\nUber has also partnered with sidewalk delivery robot companies Serve Robotics and, more recently, Cartken to deliver food autonomously on the Uber Eats network.\n\nUber has not shared how many autonomous vehicle trips it has facilitated over the past year. Neither Waymo nor Waabi immediately responded to requests for comment.\n\nUber said it would announce more details on its AV plans in the coming months.\n\nThat could include its recent deal with BYD to bring 100,000 new EVs onto the platform in Latin America, Europe, Canada, Australia and New Zealand. The tie-up will give drivers discounts on BYD vehicle purchases or rentals, and the two companies will also collaborate on \"future BYD autonomous-capable vehicles\" to be deployed on Uber's platform.\n\n\"BYD has committed to very, very significant investments in the AV space,\" said Uber CEO Dara Khosrowshahi on Tuesday's earnings call. \"And judging from what they have accomplished in the EV space, I would make a bet on them in AV, as well.\"\n\nIn June, BYD announced a $14 billion investment in autonomous vehicle technology.\n\nInvestor response to Uber's results has been positive. Uber's shares were up 6% in premarket trading at the time of writing, and are climbing back to levels it traded on last Thursday, before the broader stock markets tumbled.\n\nUber also reported better-than-expected gross bookings in Q2, which rose 19% to $39.95 billion, slightly higher than the $39.7 billion predicted by analysts. In adjusted terms, Uber recorded net profit of $1.57 billion, again ahead of the $1.5 billion that analysts projected. Uber also said quarterly operating profits hit a record.\n\nUber forecast third-quarter bookings between $40.25 billion to $41.75 billion, and said it expected headwinds to the tune of $400 million

Luckily, we've found one, a low-priced stock that is gushing free cash flow AND buying back shares. Click here to claim your Special Free Report on a fallen angel growth story that is already recovering from a setback.\n\nAs a gig economy marketplace, Uber generates revenue growth by expanding the number of services on its platform (e.g. rides, deliveries, freelance jobs) and raising the commission fee from each service provided.\n\nOver the last two years, Uber's users, a key performance metric for the company, grew 13.5% annually to 156 million. This is solid growth for a consumer internet company.\n\nIn Q2, Uber added 19 million users, translating into 13.9% year-on-year growth.\n\nAverage revenue per user (ARPU) is a critical metric to track for consumer internet businesses like Uber because it measures how much the company earns in transaction fees from each user. This number also informs us about Uber's take rate, which represents its pricing leverage over the ecosystem, or \"cut\" from each transaction.\n\nUber's ARPU growth has been impressive over the last two years, averaging 12.7%. The company's ability to increase prices while growing its users demonstrates its platform's value, as its users continue to spend more each year. This quarter, ARPU grew 1.8% year on year to $68.59 per user.\n\nIt was great to see Uber increase its number of users this quarter. We were also glad its users outperformed Wall Street's estimates. On the other hand, its revenue growth regrettably stalled, although adjusted EBITDA beat expectations by a healthy amount. Guidance was also mixed, with Q3 revenue guidance slightly below but adjusted EBITDA was in line). Zooming out, we think this was still a decent, albeit mixed, quarter, showing the company is staying on track. The stock traded up 3.9% to $60.78 immediately after reporting.\n\nSo should you invest in Uber right now?

Net income of $1bn also came in well ahead of market expectations of $659.5mn for its second quarter.\n\n\"The Uber consumer has never been stronger,\" said Khosrowshahi.\n\nUber's delivery segment had recorded \"healthy\" order growth in the US during the quarter, and \"while there have been some concerns about consumer spend on restaurants and delivery, we are not seeing any impact today\", he added.\n\nHis comments come a day after fears about a weakening US economy plunged global markets into turmoil, with tech companies among the worst hit.\n\nShares in Uber, which have gained almost a third over the past 12 months, rose more than 5 per cent in pre-market trading on Tuesday.\n\nNet income, which rose 158 per cent year on year, was boosted by a $333mn revaluation of Uber's stakes in other groups, including self-driving car company Aurora. Uber's operating profit was $796mn, just below expectations for $799.8mn.\n\nLooking ahead, Uber said it expected its adjusted earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation -- its preferred profit measure -- to be between $1.58bn and $1.68bn in the current period, with the midpoint ahead of analyst expectations of $1.62bn.\n\nGig economy companies, including Uber and its US rivals Lyft and DoorDash, have come under pressure from investors to demonstrate that they can deliver lasting profits while growing their businesses, following an era of furious spending by the groups and years of deep losses.\n\nLast year marked Uber's first full year of operating profitability, a milestone that the company said was an \"inflection point\". Chief financial officer Prashanth Mahendra-Rajah said on Tuesday that Uber's \"top priority\" was investing in growth, including via potential acquisitions.\n\nResilient consumer demand in the latest quarter had been helped by Uber's efforts to make its delivery offerings more affordable, including through merchant promotions on the platform and lower average delivery fees, it said. Improving economies of scale had also driven down Uber's costs and boosted profitability.\n\nA growing ads business helped boost Uber's profitability, with the high-margin unit now at an annual \"revenue run rate\" of more than $1bn, Uber said.\n\nThe total value of Uber's ride-hailing, delivery and freight bookings rose 19 per cent year on year to $40bn, a slight slowdown from the 20 per cent growth reported in the previous quarter and the 22 per cent in the period before that.\n\nStripping out the impact of currency moves, that combined total for the current quarter would increase by between 18 and 23 per cent, in line with the long-term guidance Uber gave at its February investor day.\n\nAs part of its growth plan, the company has been pushing into new markets, including grocery delivery and the deployment of self-driving vehicles on its ride-hailing app through partnerships with companies including Waymo.\n\nUber's growing grocery and retail delivery business had \"a clear path to ebitda profitability\", said the company on Tuesday. Initial results from its partnership with Instacart, which will allow the grocery delivery group's US users to order from restaurants listed on Uber Eats, were \"encouraging\", the company said.", "source": {"uri": "ft.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Financial Times News"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dara_Khosrowshahi", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Dara Khosrowshahi"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uber", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Uber"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economy_of_the_United_States", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Economy of the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Net_income", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Net income"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ridesharing_company", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Ridesharing company"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Active_users", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Active users"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Food_delivery", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Food delivery"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Revenue", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Revenue"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gig_worker", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Gig worker"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Self-driving_car", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Self-driving car"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lyft", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Lyft"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DoorDash", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "DoorDash"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Depreciation", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Depreciation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Waymo", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Waymo"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Instacart", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Instacart"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uber_Eats", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Uber Eats"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economies_of_scale", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Economies of scale"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chief_financial_officer", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Chief financial officer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mobile_app", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Mobile app"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Currency", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Currency"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Business/Investing", "label": "dmoz/Business/Investing", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Stocks_and_Bonds", "label": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Stocks and Bonds", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Business", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Business", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 95}], "image": "https://www.ft.com/__origami/service/image/v2/images/raw/https%3A%2F%2Fwww.ft.com%2F__origami%2Fservice%2Fimage%2Fv2%2Fimages%2Fraw%2Fhttps%253A%252F%252Fd1e00ek4ebabms.cloudfront.net%252Fproduction%252Fa037f1aa-d554-4638-9aa8-b0ae9b398acc.jpg%3Fsource%3Dnext-article%26fit%3Dscale-down%26quality%3Dhighest%26width%3D700%26dpr%3D1?source=next-opengraph&fit=scale-down&width=900", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9794424", "eventUri": "eng-9794424", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-06-30", "textStart": 333, "textEnd": 340}], "sentiment": 0.1843137254901961, "wgt": 161, "relevance": 1}

Among the bunch is a similar pair - Lyft LYFT and Uber Technologies UBER.\n\nBoth stocks have risen in popularity considerably over the years as consumers continuously flock to the platform, leaving taxis in the dust. Concerning performances, LYFT shares have faced notably more pressure in 2024 relative to UBER, as shown below.\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nBut will the performance disparity continue? Let's take a closer look at how expectations stack up heading into their respective releases.\n\nBoth Uber and Lyft have seen their earnings outlook for the upcoming release tick higher, though it's worth noting that the trend has been more pronounced within Lyft. They're expected to post big growth, with Uber's earnings expected to be up 70% and Lyft forecasted to see a 27% climb higher.\n\nIt's also worth noting that Uber's sales expectations have remained unchanged, whereas Lyft has seen positive revisions concerning the top line over recent months. Both companies have enjoyed supercharged sales growth over the years, as shown below.\n\nUber reports its results a bit differently than Lyft, using Trips as a key metric in quarterly releases. The company's Trips have regularly exceeded our expectations but fell modestly short in its latest release, as shown below.\n\nDespite missing expectations, Trips did pencil in strong Y/Y growth, reflecting solid momentum. For the quarter to be released, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for Trips stands at 2.7 billion vs. 2.3 billion in the year-ago period.\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nConcerning Lyft, the company reports several key metrics, including Active Riders. As shown below, the company broke a long streak of negative surprises on the metric in its latest quarter, with Active Riders of 21.9 million up 12% Y/Y.\n\nOur consensus expectation for Active Riders stands at 23.8 million, reflecting a slight uptick from the year-ago mark of 21.5 million.\n\nGiven the current weak sentiment, positivity within the releases concerning rider momentum will likely perk shares back up, with analysts also taking a bullish stance over the last several months.\n\nProfitability and cash flows will also be heavily in focus, which have both been trending higher for both companies over recent periods.\n\nSeveral years ago, we shocked our members by offering them 30-day access to all our picks for the total sum of only $1.

Uber has long aimed to make $1 billion from advertising, and it had a $650 million revenue run rate last year.\n\nThe company -- which was founded as a ride-hailing business in 2009 and expanded into food delivery in 2014 with Uber Eats -- sells ads across both applications.\n\nIn June, Uber began selling Journey Ads -- the in-app ads that run during a user's rideshare -- programmatically through partnerships with Google, The Trade Desk and Yahoo. The company also partnered with T-Mobile on a deal to sell ads on digital screens inside rideshare vehicles via JourneyTV, which plays on a tablet (usually hanging from the vehicle's headrest) during a ride.\n\nIndependent retail media analyst Andrew Lipsman attributed Uber Advertising's growth to its global scale. That's unique among most retail media networks -- except for Amazon, of course.\n\n\"We can talk to brands on a multimarket basis very effectively, which they like,\" Paul Wright, head of international markets for Uber Advertising, told ADWEEK. \"[We also have] a very strong identifiable audience, which is consistent in most markets.\"\n\nUber Eats in particular has seen strong momentum, particularly among large consumer packaged goods brands interested in multimarket campaigns, he added. Uber Eats launched sponsored listing and display ads in partnership with Criteo one year ago.\n\nOne media buyer described DoorDash and Gopuff as platforms \"ahead of the game\" for CPG advertisers in the U.S. They're planning on reassessing Uber's ad platform at the end of the year because of the investments Uber has put into advertising.\n\nRestaurants generally represent local advertisers that only buy ads in the markets they operate and deliver within. Uber is also attracting non-endemic advertisers that fall into categories like financial services, social networks, tech, entertainment and luxury, Wright explained.\n\n\"[Journey Ads] appeal to brands that really want to get some long-term engagement and aren't chasing a performance-based, programmatic, lower-funnel-type approach,\" Wright said. \"The ad unit is only one ad per journey, so you're not competing with anyone else.\"\n\nIn one case study that Uber shared with ADWEEK, L'Or\u00e9al ran an ad campaign for a new perfume, targeting riders headed to London's Heathrow and Gatwick airports. To encourage travelers to stop by duty-free shops, the ad offered a free sample to anyone who clicked on it.\n\nL'Or\u00e9al's campaign had a 342-second average view time compared to a benchmark of 90 to 100 seconds; a 7.68% swipe rate versus a 2.5% to 3% benchmark; and a 4.76% click-through rate versus a 2.5% to 3% benchmark, the company said.", "source": {"uri": "adweek.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Adweek"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ridesharing_company", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Ridesharing company"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uber", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Uber"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advertising", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Advertising"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uber_Eats", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Uber Eats"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Trade_Desk", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "The Trade Desk"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Food_delivery", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Food delivery"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Google"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amazon_(company)", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Amazon (company)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adweek", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Adweek"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fast-moving_consumer_goods", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Fast-moving consumer goods"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/T-Mobile", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "T-Mobile"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yahoo!", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Yahoo!"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tablet_computer", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Tablet computer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Independent", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "The Independent"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gopuff", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Gopuff"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heathrow_Airport", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Heathrow Airport"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DoorDash", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "DoorDash"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Benchmarking", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Benchmarking"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gatwick_Airport", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Gatwick Airport"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Duty-free_shop", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Duty-free shop"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/L'Or\u00e9al", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "L'Or\u00e9al"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perfume", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Perfume"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Online_advertising", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Online advertising"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Click-through_rate", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Click-through rate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Financial_services", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Financial services"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_network", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Social network"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Restaurant", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Restaurant"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/London", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "London"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "London"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Business", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Business", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Opportunities", "label": "dmoz/Business/Opportunities", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Opportunities/Opposing_Views", "label": "dmoz/Business/Opportunities/Opposing Views", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Technology", "label": "news/Technology", "wgt": 56}], "image": "https://static-prod.adweek.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/uber-ad-busines-billion-2024-600x315.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9794424", "eventUri": "eng-9794424", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.192156862745098, "wgt": 148, "relevance": 1}

Log in.\n\nIt's playing in a highly competitive landscape, duking it out for media budgets alongside market leaders Meta, Google, and Amazon, with their billions of users and tried-and-tested adtech.\n\nPaul Wright, head of international at Uber Ads, told Business Insider the company is exploring ways it can help advertisers get more tactical about the context of a user's trip -- such as whether they're heading to a restaurant, airport, or event.\n\n\"We know they're going to a Taylor Swift concert because we know their destination is Wembley Arena. That contextual element there is really powerful because I think a lot of location-based marketing up to now on digital has been a little bit of a guess,\" Wright said in an interview.\n\nWright declined to provide a new revenue target, but said there are several other key areas where Uber Ads is targeting its next pockets of growth, such as providing advertisers with tools to measure consumers' attention. It's also testing a format called \"Playable Ads\" that allow users to play advertiser games to unlock promotions.\n\n\"A lot of retail media platforms are great at the transactional elements but they don't necessarily have brand opportunities in the same way. One of the unique things about our platform is the ability to do both effectively in a non-cluttered environment,\" Wright said.\n\nUber Ads is also looking to third-party partnerships to spur its growth. As of earlier this year, advertisers could buy Journey Ads in the Uber Rides app via platforms like The Trade Desk, Yahoo DSP, and Google's Display & Video 360. In June, it announced a partnership with T-Mobile to roll out Uber's in-car JourneyTV to more than 50,000 vehicles in the US this year.\n\nUber on Tuesday reported a 16% increase in revenue year-on-year to $10.7 billion in the quarter ended June 30, beating Wall Street estimates. Its shares rose 6% in pre-market trading.\n\nLast month, Tom Champion, a senior research analyst at investment bank Piper Sandler, described Uber as a \"sleeping giant\" and was bullish on the prospects for Uber Ads because of its two-sided marketplace and its scale relative to other apps in the gig economy space.\n\nPiper Sandler raised its price target for Uber's stock to $88 from $86.

(Plus, you'll likely never see this person again.)\n\nThe TikTok struck a nerve with people online, gaining more than 3.8 million views and hundreds of comments.\n\nIn it, Bradley says every time she gets in a ride share, she checks to see if the child lock is on. She does this by immediately opening and closing the door twice.\n\n\"if youre alone, check before you get in & if youre w a friend, make sure they dont close their door yet,\" Bradley said in the caption.\n\nAnd Bradley isn't the first one to adopt this particular precaution. There are several news articles, forum discussions, at least one viral tweet, and even a petition on the matter.\n\nWriter Tiffany Jackson followed up her viral tweet by explaining that she'd been in an Uber before that had the child lock on \"and definitely hit homie with the 'Son, I don't know what's going on but whatever you thinking, you got the WRONG one.'\"\n\nHere are a few more steps you can take in addition to Bradley's tip to protect yourself:\n\nPeople, especially women, have a reason to be concerned. Just a few years ago a man impersonating an Uber driver reportedly killed 21-year-old college student Samantha Josephson. He had the child locks on, 9News reported.\n\nThere have also been dozens of sexual assault cases -- that span alleged groping, kidnapping, and rape -- launched against the app, NPR reported.\n\nThese victims say Uber has a responsibility to make rides safer. They have also claimed that Uber's background checks aren't up to par. They've called on the company to do fingerprint background checks, have dashcams recording each ride, and remove drivers after sexual assault allegations are filed.\n\nCompetitor Lyft is facing similar lawsuits, Consumer Notice reported.\n\n\"When growth is the ultimate goal and top line revenue is the ultimate goal, I think that, despite what they know, they're picking profits over people. There are tried and true methods to making this truly a safer alternative, as opposed to a magnet for predators,\" said Kevin Conway, managing partner at Peiffer Wolf, which is representing dozens of sexual assault cases against Uber.\n\nIn response, Uber spokesperson Gabriela Condarco-Quesada said the following to NPR: \"Sexual assault is a horrific crime, and we take every report of this nature very seriously. While we cannot comment on pending litigation, we are deeply committed to the safety of all users on the Uber platform.\"\n\nPeople in the comments section of Bradley's video had mixed reactions. Some pointed out that this might not be all that effective in newer vehicles.\n\n\"Noted! will be doing this in the future,\" a person said.\n\n\"My parents can turn it on/off with a button on the drivers side door,\" another shared.\n\n\"Some cars can child lock the doors with the window lock,\" a commenter pointed out.\n\nThe Daily Dot reached out to Bradley, Uber, and Lyft for comment via email.", "source": {"uri": "dailydot.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Daily Dot"}, "authors": [{"uri": "stacy_fernandez@dailydot.com", "name": "Stacy Fernandez", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TikTok", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "TikTok"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uber", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Uber"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Viral_video", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Viral video"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sexual_assault", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Sexual assault"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Murder_of_Samantha_Josephson", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Murder of Samantha Josephson"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nine_News", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Nine News"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tiffany_&_Co.", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Tiffany & Co."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Background_check", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Background check"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NPR", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "NPR"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rape", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Rape"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kidnapping", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Kidnapping"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mobile_app", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Mobile app"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jackson,_Mississippi", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Jackson, Mississippi"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Jackson, Mississippi"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lyft", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Lyft"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kevin_Conway_(actor)", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Kevin Conway (actor)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Daily_Dot", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "The Daily Dot"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dashcam", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Dashcam"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fingerprint", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Fingerprint"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lawsuit", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Lawsuit"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Email", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Email"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Relationships", "label": "dmoz/Society/Relationships", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Advice", "label": "dmoz/Society/Advice", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Technology", "label": "news/Technology", "wgt": 54}], "image": "https://uploads.dailydot.com/2024/08/check-childlock-lyft-uber.jpg?auto=compress&fm=pjpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9794424", "eventUri": "eng-9794424", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.2, "wgt": 121, "relevance": 1}

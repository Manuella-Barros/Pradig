Lois Alter Mark I hesitate to share this information because I think my friend and I would be perfect for the job but GetYourGuide, in partnership with On Location Tours, is kicking off a search for a couple of Swifties to lead Taylor Swift-themed tours in two major cities. The Ultimate Swiftie Tour Guides will receive compensation and training with professional tour guides in New York City or London as well as complimentary tickets for their friends and family members to join them on the tours they lead. \u201cWe\u2019re hoping to not only appoint the best tour guide for Swifties in New York, but also create an experience you won\u2019t find anywhere else,\u201d Madison Pietrowski, Director of Brand US at GetYourGuide, told Forbes exclusively. \u201cSwifties will never forget when Taylor Swift moved to the Big Apple in 2014. Since then, the city has acquired a Taylor-inspired allure, which only a true fan can help uncover.\u201d Offhand, we\u2019re thinking a tour could stop by Cornelia Street, the Chelsea Hotel, Coney Island, the High Line, the dive bar on the East Side (where you at?), Housing Works Bookstore and, on a Tuesday night, maybe dinner and a glass of wine at Olive Garden. In addition to the city celebrated in Swift\u2019s \u201cWelcome to New York,\u201d fans can also apply to be a tour guide in the English capital she sings about in songs like \u201cLondon Boy\u201d and \u201cSo Long, London.\u201d MORE FOR YOU Trump Trial Prosecutor Ends Closing Argument After Nearly 5 Hours Jury Instructions Set For Wednesday Gas Explosion In Downtown Youngstown Ohio Injures At Least 7 Take Advantage Of The Best Memorial Day Laptop Sales Still Live To apply, post a video on Instagram or TikTok, explaining why you should be the Ultimate Swiftie Tour Guide and tagging @GetYourGuide and #UltimateSwiftieGuide. Applicants who make it to the second round will be notified by DM and invited to go through a formal application and interview process. For more information, check out the GetYourGuide website or follow them on Instagram and TikTok for updates. Swifties, GetYourGuide wants YOU! GetYourGuide GetYourGuide is all about offering unique travel experiences \u2013 I\u2019ve done many tours around the world through them, including a once in a lifetime opportunity to open the doors of the Vatican in the morning \u2013 and this one promises to be the answer to Swifties\u2019 wildest dreams. The popular travel booking platform decided to create the positions after a brand survey revealed that 44% of travelers globally choose a destination based on their passions and interests and that 22% of Americans have chosen a destination based on a celebrity or influencer recommendation. It\u2019s hard to imagine a bigger influence on, well, almost anything at the moment than Taylor Swift. Not only was she named Time magazine\u2019s 2023 Person of the Year but she continues to break records with her Eras tour and her new, two album set, The Tortured Poets Department. Swift will be bringing her tour to Wembley Stadium for three sold-out shows in June and another five sold-out shows in August. While you\u2019re in London, you\u2019ll want to book some of GetYourGuide\u2019s exclusive tours. The new, customizable 30 minute photoshoot is the perfect way to capture whatever era you\u2019re in right now. Follow me on Twitter or LinkedIn. Check out my website.

{"id": 225051076, "title": "Canadian MPs Unanimously Vote for Bill to Prohibit Replacement Workers During Strikes", "text": "Canada\u2019s \u201canti-scab\u201d bill has unanimously passed its third and final reading in the House of Commons this week, as Ottawa looks to ban federal employers from using replacement workers during strikes. Bill C-58 seeks to amend the Canada Labour Code and the Canada Industrial Relations Board Regulations to prohibit the use of replacement workers if there\u2019s a strike or lockout in a federally regulated workplace. \u201cI think it is a real message to workers right across this country that they are valued and that parliamentarians have heard them, and that scab labour is wrong,\u201d Labour Minister Seamus O\u2019Regan told reporters following the vote. \u201cSo, this is a big moment for workers in this country. It\u2019s a big moment for labour. And we\u2019re thrilled that it passed unanimously.\u201d Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, Conservative Leader Pierre Poilievre, and Bloc Quebecois Leader Yves-Francois Blanchet all cast their votes in favour virtually, while NDP Leader Jagmeet Singh supported the bill in-person. Mr. Singh credited his party for forcing the Liberals to forge ahead with the legislation, calling the May 27 vote a \u201chistoric day.\u201d Once made law, the bill will hand power back to the workers while \u201ctaking away power from the CEOs,\u201d Mr. Singh told reporters prior to casting his vote. \u201cWe hope that not only will we make sure this is banned at the federal level, but we can inspire provinces and territories to put in place similar legislation so that we can, once and for all, ban scab workers at every level across this country,\u201d he added. \u201cThat\u2019s our ultimate goal.\u201d Both British Columbia and Quebec already have legislation in place that bans the use of replacement workers, and Mr. O\u2019Regan said he is hoping other provinces will follow suit. \u201cWorkers have fought for generations to get to this day, but there is still a final step,\u201d Unifor National President Lana Payne said in a press release. \u201cC-58 modernizes Canada\u2019s labour relations system to reflect the current social and economic context of this country, where increased corporate power and wealth requires an effective counter-balance. We call on the Senate to pass C-58 as soon as possible and put it to work without delay.\u201d Canadian Labour Congress president Bea Bruske called the bill a \u201csignificant milestone in the history of the labour movement.\u201d \u201cWith a ban on the use of replacement workers, we take a real step toward true protection for workers\u2019 rights, restoring fairness to the collective bargaining process, less labour disruptions, avoiding work stoppages and building a more balanced economy,\u2019\u2019 Ms. Bruske said in a press release. She said the passage of the bill was made possible due to \u201cthe efforts of thousands of union activists across the country who stood up and demanded better from the government.\u201d The legislation applies to a wide variety of workplaces including airports, banking, broadcasting, railways, and telecommunications as well as federal Crown corporations. If a company chose to use scab labour during strikes or lock-outs, it would face fines of $100,000 a day under the legislation. Bill C-58 would also require employers and unions to come to an agreement within 15 days to determine what work needs to continue during a strike or lockout, if any. If the parties cannot come to an agreement, the Canada Industrial Relations Board (CIRB) would decide what activities need to be maintained within 90 days. When the bill was first introduced, Mr. O\u2019Regan said it would be implemented within 18 months of its passage. He said this week, however, that the legislation would take effect 12 months after its adoption.", "summary": "Canada\u2019s \u201canti-scab\u201d bill has unanimously passed its third and final reading in the House of Commons this week, as Ottawa looks to ban federal employers from using replacement workers during strikes.

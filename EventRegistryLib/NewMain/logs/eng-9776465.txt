How could this escalate into a larger regional conflict? What exit ramps does the world have to prevent this conflict from spilling over?\n\nIran has vowed to retaliate, especially since the Hamas leader was in Iran for the presidential swearing-in ceremony. Iran's response will likely involve a mix of hybrid tactics, including actions by Hezbollah, Houthi rebels, cyberattacks, and possibly a large-scale attack similar to the 300-missile and drone assault on Israel in April. Although this attack was intercepted by the U.S., allies, and Israel's Iron Dome, it cost over a billion dollars to defend against.\n\nOne thing is clear: Iran and Hezbollah will be the clear winners if this conflict escalates further, which risks dragging the U.S. into direct conflict as it defends Israel.\n\nFrom today's likely strike killing Hamas chief Haniyeh in Tehran to Tuesday's Israeli airstrike on Beirut's southern suburbs, which targeted a senior Hezbollah commander linked to a deadly rocket attack on a football pitch in the Golan Heights, it is clear the conflict is escalating.\n\nThese actions are expected to intensify hostilities between Israel and Hezbollah, further emboldening Iran. The Iranian president has vowed to make the \"occupiers regret their cowardly act\" on Iranian soil, adding to Iran's embarrassment from its failure to intercept Israeli missiles that hit Iranian air defense system on April 19 which was Israel's response following Iran's own 300-missile and drone attack on Israel which was in response to Israel killing an Iranian military commander in Syria. Every attack is a response to a previous event, showing an escalation of tit for tat.\n\nAmid heightened tensions, Israel is fortifying its defenses and preparing for further retaliatory actions. Anticipating escalation, Israel is targeting other Hezbollah commanders and bolstering its forces for a potential ground invasion. Israel aims to eliminate the Hezbollah threat by pushing it back to the Litani River, 29 kilometers north of the Israel-Lebanon border. Simultaneously, Israel is strengthening its air defenses in anticipation of another costly barrage of Iranian missiles. The full extent of Iran's and Israel's retaliation plans remains unknown, but Israel's security cabinet has authorized a military response to the recent attack, leaving civilians on both sides of the border and the wider region bracing for further conflict.\n\nIsraeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, influenced by his nationalist coalition partners, has adopted a hardline stance following the attack, which has allowed him to maintain power despite a fracturing coalition. The United States has been leading global diplomatic efforts to dissuade Israel from further strikes on Beirut or Lebanese infrastructure, aiming to prevent the situation from escalating into a full-scale conflict. However, U.S. efforts have previously fallen on deaf ears. Despite these efforts, U.S. Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin emphasized on Tuesday that while the U.S. hopes for a diplomatic resolution, it will defend Israel if Hezbollah attacks from Lebanon, or if Iran attacks again. This statement emboldens Israel to act while putting U.S. diplomats and military stations around the Middle East at risk from Iran's other proxies.\n\nIsrael cannot win a war against Hezbollah in Lebanon, and all parties should know this. Any escalation could be more deadly than previous encounters, as Hezbollah is now better trained and equipped compared to Hamas in Gaza, where Israel is still fighting and taking casualties. Iran's increased and overt support adds complexity and heightens the risk of a broader conflict, potentially leading to another missile exchange between Iran and Israel.\n\nMilitary analysts indicate that Hezbollah's arsenal includes between 120,000 and 200,000 short-range guided ballistic missiles, short- and intermediate-range unguided ballistic missiles, and drones capable of targeting Israeli troops and overwhelming Israel's defense systems. This significant military capability is bolstered by potential support from Iran, Iraq, Syria, and Yemen, with offers to send tens of thousands of fighters to assist Hezbollah. The human toll of the conflict is already severe, with over 300 Hezbollah fighters and numerous civilians killed by Israeli strikes, and more than two dozen Israeli soldiers and civilians killed by Hezbollah attacks. These attacks have also caused tens of thousands of displacements on both sides.\n\nIran stands to gain from this conflict by further destabilizing Israel through its support for Hezbollah, while the world watches for Iran's next move. Iran's new president, Masoud Pezeshkian, sworn in on Tuesday, faces a complex challenge: balancing a moderate approach to reduce Western sanctions while confronting Israeli aggression, all while recognizing that Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei retains ultimate authority.\n\nBeyond direct missile attacks on Israel, Iran could further embolden the Iranian-backed Houthis in Yemen, escalating attacks on ships in the Red Sea. Iran might also threaten or attempt to block the Strait of Hormuz, disrupting global oil and LNG supplies. Such actions would likely provoke a unified and robust response from the United States, as both major U.S. political parties support a tough stance on Iran.", "source": {"uri": "atalayar.com",

It has developed a \"Unification of the Arenas\" strategy which coordinates all its proxies, including Hezbollah in Lebanon, Hamas and Islamic Jihad in Gaza, Iraqi Shia militias and the Houthis in Yemen.\n\nAs such, Iran is encircling Israel in order to be able to create a multifront war against it. The intention is to enable Iran to provide a nuclear umbrella to its proxies, threatening the survival of the Jewish state. Just as Russia wields its nuclear weapons to deter the West from greater involvement in Ukraine, imagine if Iran had a nuclear weapon and was able to provide Hamas and Hezbollah with a nuclear umbrella. Iran would be able to restrain Israel from entering Gaza to eliminate Hamas.\n\nIn contrast, Israel can only allocate its resources to a single arena at any one time - such as Gaza now to dismantle Hamas - or conduct individual strikes against Hezbollah in Lebanon. It cannot realistically contend with a full-blown conflict against Hezbollah, Hamas and Iran simultaneously.\n\nIsrael and Iran's strategic competition sits against the backdrop of the US lacking a coherent Iran strategy. At the start of his administration, President Biden said his priority was, \"how we move forward and what is needed to allow us to move back into the JCPOA.\" By November 2022, however, President Biden admitted that the JCPOA was \"dead\". Since then the US has failed to formulate a replacement strategy for Iran.\n\nThe US and Israel have not responded significantly to Iran's provocations across the region, enabling it to act with impunity and never face any consequences for its actions. Despite Iran seeking to escalate and regionalise the conflict, the Biden administration's priority of localising it led the US to initially deny Iran's involvement in the October 7 massacre. At best, the US merely responds rather than pre-empting Iranian-led threats. Israel has similarly adopted a restrained approach towards the Iranian regime, focusing on preventing Iran from establishing a military base on its border with Syria by conducting airstrikes on Iranian proxies or the IRGC when it operates near Israel's borders.\n\nSimilarly, Israel has sought to delay Iran's nuclear programme rather than focus on preventing it from going nuclear. Instead of destabilising the regime, Israel has participated in tit-for-tat shadow warfare with Tehran.\n\nAs a result, Iran has been encouraged to establish new normals for the levels of accepted terrorism. The international community instead draws an artificial distinction between Iran's proxies and the regime that sponsors these proxies. Iran is not held to account for threatening international shipping by wielding the Houthis to close the Bab el-Mandeb Strait and conducting piracy near the Strat of Hormuz. Similarly, the Houthis in Yemen and Hezbollah in southern Lebanon have increased their rocket fire against Israel.\n\nIran's regional dominance has led to it setting the agenda vis a vis Israel's conflict against Hamas in Gaza. In January 2024, representatives of the Biden administration met Iranian Deputy Foreign Minister Ali Bagheri Kani to request that Iran restrain Yemen's Houthi rebels and that its proxies in Iraq and Syria cease targeting US forces. In response, Kani made this contingent upon the US brokering a ceasefire in Gaza. In turn, the Biden administration became increasingly critical of the manner in which Israel was conducting the war in Gaza and began to advocate a ceasefire. This created daylight between the US and Israel and emboldened Iran.\n\nAfter attacking Israel directly on 13 April, Iran's mission to the UN posted on X that this \"is a conflict between Iran and the rogue Israeli regime, from which the US MUST STAY AWAY!\". Qatari news outlet Al-Araby Al-Jadeed reported that the US administration insisted that Israel did not carry out a large strike in response to the attack, in exchange for the US accepting Israel's military operation in Rafah. The rationale for rejecting a proposed Israeli counterattack against Iran was that it would erode deterrence and escalation tensions in the region. Thus the blame was inverted: it became Israel's responsibility, not Iran's, to avoid causing regional escalation.\n\nMy recent report Restoring Deterrence: Destabilising the Iranian Regime asserts that making the de-escalation of tensions a priority and overlooking Iranian aggression only contributes to Iran escalating tensions. Give the association of Iranian proxies with the regime itself, the US and Israel need to be willing to target nuclear facilities, drone factories and IRGC bases on Iranian soil. As such, Israel should expand its power projection with the aim of destabilising the Iranian regime and preventing it from hiding behind its proxies.", "source": {"uri": "thejc.com", "dataType":

The US war in Iraq was won by Iran and allowed it to increase influence the whole region\n\nYa Libnan Editorial\n\nIran's influence in the Middle East has grown significantly over the past few decades, primarily through its support of various militant groups and political factions. Iran considers Hezbollah in Lebanon as \"Iran in Lebanon,\" the Popular Mobilization Forces (PMF) in Iraq as \"Iran in Iraq,\" the Houthis in Yemen as \"Iran in Yemen,\" Hamas in Gaza as \"Iran in Gaza,\" and the Shiite militias in Syria as \"Iran in Syria.\" This network of proxies has allowed Iran to extend its reach and assert its presence across the region, often destabilizing countries and undermining their sovereignty.\n\nTo counter this influence peacefully, the United States must adopt a multifaceted strategy that includes diplomatic, economic, and social approaches. Here are some key points to consider:\n\nConclusion\n\nReducing Iran's influence in the Middle East requires a comprehensive and peaceful approach that addresses the root causes of its power. By strengthening diplomatic ties, enforcing targeted economic measures, promoting good governance, countering propaganda, and providing humanitarian assistance, the United States can help create a more stable and prosperous Middle East. This strategy not only reduces Iran's destabilizing influence but also supports the aspirations of the people in the region for peace and self-determination.

This comes after several months of a lull in such attacks. Iranian-backed militias had increased attacks after the Hamas attack on Israel on October 7.Iranian media is taking credit for an attack in Syria on July 26. \"Resistance groups have reportedly targeted a US military base with missiles in Deir Ezzor in eastern Syria,\" Iran's IRNA said.\n\nIn January, the Iranian-backed Kataib Hezbollah killed three US soldiers in an attack on Jordan. The group recently also threatened the US and Saudi Arabia, claiming it could escalate attacks due to the war in Gaza. At the same time, the Houthis did escalate, targeting Tel Aviv on July 19.\n\nNow, Iran is operationalizing its militias in Syria to increase attacks on the US. This is all part of a well-planned and orchestrated attempt by Iran to exert its own maximum pressure on the US and to open up a multiple-front war against Israel.\n\nPro-Iran media claimed that \"the resistance fighters [Iranian-backed militias] targeted the US base in the Koniko gas field in Syria,\" according to Al Mayadeen. IRNA in Iran published the same report. \"The missile attack hit the military base and the sound of explosions were heard in the nearby villages,\" IRNA noted.\n\nThe report also claimed the US had retaliated. Iran also has used its militias in Iraq to begin new attacks on US forces in Iraq. There was an attack targeting US forces at Asad base in Iraq on July 24. It is one of two recent attacks in Iraq that illustrate Iran has ordered its militias to return to targeting the US.\n\n\"Regional resistance groups have repeatedly targeted US and Israeli interests in the region since the onset of the US-backed Israeli war on the Gaza Strip last October,\" IRNA noted.\n\nWhy is Iran returning to attacks on the US in Iraq and Syria?\n\nWhy is Iran returning to attacks on the US in Iraq and Syria? It comes in the context of the Houthi escalation against Israel and the escalation by Hezbollah against Israel. There is also escalation by Iranian-backed groups targeting the Golan. Iran calls all these groups an \"axis of resistance.\"\n\nIn Iraq, for instance, the Iranian-backed groups have claimed to be coordinating with the Houthis in \"joint\" attacks. The Iraqi militias recently claimed to target Eilat with a drone attack. Similarly, the Houthis made numerous claims since July 20 that they would retaliate for Israeli airstrikes on Hodeidah on July 20. Israel was retaliating for the Houthi attack on Tel Aviv.\n\nIran's escalation comes as it senses the US is focused on domestic political issues. It may also want to try to take advantage of US President Joe Biden pulling out of the race for President, and Iran may want to test Vice-President Kamala Harris, who has been elevated to the likely Democratic candidate in the US.\n\nThe US may want to try to reduce tensions via talks in Oman or elsewhere.

vows revenge", "body": "FEARS of a fresh war in the Middle East are rising after a suspected Israeli airstrike took out a senior Hamas leader and sparked fury among the terror group's allies.\n\nIran, staunch backer of Hamas, said it is \"Tehran's duty\" to seek \"revenge for Ismail Haniyeh's blood\" after he was killed in the capital.\n\nIranian supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, vowed to enact a \"harsh punishment\".\n\nHamas also sworn to seek \"dire consequences\" for the strike that killed its political leader, responsible for conducting crucial negotiations outside of the war-torn Gaza Strip.\n\nHezbollah, another Iran-backed ally in the \"axis of resistance\", promised to stir up anti-Israel sentiment amongst its allies.\n\nAnd the Houthis, based in Yemen, said it marks a \"major escalation\" in the Middle East.\n\nIsrael's Mossad assassins could easily have taken Haniyeh out as he led ceasefire talks in Qatar but appeared to watch and wait until he set foot on the territory of arch enemy Iran before taking him out.\n\nHaniyeh and just one bodyguard were killed in the precision missile strike as they slept in a military veterans' building in Tehran.\n\nIsrael's Shin Bet intelligence arm somehow discovered exactly which room he was staying in within scores in the block.\n\nA guided missile was then fired through the window of his room and detonated inside, killing him and his aide instantly.\n\nThe move was intended to limit political fallout - but sparked vows of Iranian revenge within hours.\n\nA direct attack on Iranian soil and the death of its close ally will put pressure on Tehran to hit back against Israel.\n\nHours before the strike, Haniyeh sat alongside other leaders from Iran's so-called \"axis of resistance\" - Hezbollah, the Houthis and the Palestinian Islamic Jihad.\n\nThe terror group leaders, dressed in suits, sat alongside one another in the front row for the swearing in of Iran's new president, Masoud Pezeshkian.\n\nChants of \"death to America\" and \"death to Israel\" spilled from the crowd as a speaker mentioned the ongoing war between Israel and Hamas in Gaza.\n\nTensions in the Middle East are already swirling after almost ten months of brutal and bloody war in the Gaza Strip.\n\nAnalysts previously told The Sun that Iran's network of bloodthirsty proxy groups across the region are \"primed and ready\" to spark a second front in the ongoing conflict.\n\nSome 35,000 Palestinians have been killed by Israeli forces in the months since the October 7 massacre which saw Hamas kill 1,200 people in Israel.\n\nOut of 250 Israelis taken hostage, many are still in Gaza and around a third are presumed dead.\n\nIranian backed groups across the Middle East; Hamas in Gaza, Hezbollah in Lebanon and the Houthis in Yemen, have been exchanging fire with the IDF in increasing numbers ever since.\n\nOn Saturday evening an alleged Hezbollah strike fired from Lebanon hit a Druze village in Golan Heights, an area occupied by Israel.\n\nSome 12 young people, including children, were killed as the rocket hit a football pitch.\n\nIsrael's foreign minister told Channel 12 that \"Hezbollah has crossed all the red lines here, and the response will reflect that\".\n\nHe warned: \"We are nearing the moment in which we face an all-out war.\"\n\nThen just hours before Hamas leader Haniyeh was killed on Monday, Hezbollah's most senior military commander Fuad Shukr was taken out by a \"targeted\" Israeli strike.\n\nIran warned that any military \"adventures\" by Israel in Lebanon could spark \"unforeseen consequences\".\n\nAnd a Hezbollah official said that his group would be ready to fight a war with Israel after the Beirut strike took out their top military chief.\n\nEgypt on Wednesday morning called for the situation in the region to be handled so as to avoid it spiralling out of control.\n\nExperts have previously warned The Sun about an all out war breaking out in Lebanon as Israel takes on Hezbollah.\n\nIsrael's Defence Forces (IDF) have been gearing up for a possible invasion by the group - and preparing to defend against one - for years.\n\nThe militant cult is thought to have 30,000 to 50,000 fighters and between 120,000 and 200,000 missiles, rockets, attack and reconnaissance drones.", "source": {"uri": "the-sun.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The US Sun"},

Iran's supreme leader vowed revenge against Israel.\n\nThere was no immediate comment from Israel, which has pledged to kill Haniyeh and other Hamas leaders over the group's Oct. 7 attack on southern Israel. The strike came just after Haniyeh had attended the inauguration of Iran's new president in Tehran -- and only hours after Israel targeted a top commander in Iran's ally Hezbollah in the Lebanese capital Beirut.\n\nThe assassination of Hamas' top political leader was potentially explosive amid the region's volatile, intertwined conflicts -- because of its target, its timing and the decision to carry it out in Tehran. Most dangerous was the potential to push Iran and Israel into direct confrontation if Iran retaliates.\n\n\"We consider his revenge as our duty,\" Iranian supreme leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei said in a statement on his official website. He said Israel had \"prepared a harsh punishment for itself\" by killing \"a dear guest in our home.\"\n\nBitter regional rivals, Israel and Iran risked plunging into war earlier this year when Israel hit Iran's embassy in Damascus in April. Iran retaliated and Israel countered in an unprecedented exchange of strikes on each other's soil, but international efforts succeeded in containing that cycle before it spun out of control.\n\nHaniyeh's killing could also prompt Hamas to pull out of negotiations for a cease-fire and hostage release deal in the 10-month-old war in Gaza, which U.S. mediators had said were making progress.\n\nAnd it could inflame already heightening tensions between Israel and Hezbollah -- which international diplomats were trying to contain after a weekend rocket attack that killed 12 young people in the Israeli-controlled Golan Heights.\n\nTuesday evening, Israel carried out a rare strike in the Lebanese capital that it said killed a top Hezbollah commander allegedly behind the rocket strike. Hezbollah, which denied any role in the Golan strike, said Wednesday that it was still searching for the body of Fouad Shukur in the rubble of the building that was hit in a Beirut suburb, killing two women and two children, according to the Lebanese Health Ministry.\n\nThere was no immediate reaction from the White House to the killing of Haniyeh. A key question was whether Israel told its top ally the U.S. ahead of time about the strike.\n\nAsked about Haniyeh's killing during a visit to Singapore, U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken said, \"This is something we were not aware of or involved in.\"\n\nSpeaking to Channel News Asia, Blinken said he would not speculate about the impact on cease-fire efforts. \"But I can tell you that the imperative of getting a cease-fire, the importance that that has for everyone, remains.\"\n\nIn Manila, U.S. Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin said he still had hopes for a diplomatic solution on the Israeli-Lebanon border.\n\n\"I don't think that war is inevitable,\" he said. \"I maintain that.

But this year, the volatile state of the Middle East, and Iran's key role in shaping events through its influence over a network of militant groups, were also prominent themes.\n\nOn Tuesday, Mr. Pezeshkian, a heart surgeon who has portrayed himself as a reformer and beat a hard-line conservative in a July runoff vote, placed his hand on the Quran to take the oath of office, standing at a podium decorated with green, white and red flowers -- the colors of Iran's flag. In his speech, he addressed Iran's support for the Palestinian cause.", "source": {"uri": "nytimes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The New York Times"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hezbollah", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Hezbollah"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lebanon", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Lebanon"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Lebanon"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iran", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Iran"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Iran"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israel", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Israel"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Israel"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beirut", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Beirut"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Beirut"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Lebanon"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Masoud_Pezeshkian", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Masoud Pezeshkian"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strike_action", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Strike action"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tehran", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Tehran"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Tehran"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Iran"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nasser_Kanaani", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Nasser Kanaani"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ministry_of_Foreign_Affairs_(Iran)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Ministry of Foreign Affairs (Iran)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sovereignty", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Sovereignty"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oath_of_office", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Oath of office"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israeli\u2013Palestinian_conflict", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Israeli\u2013Palestinian conflict"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quran", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Quran"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conservatism", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Conservatism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Middle_East", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Middle East"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yemen", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Yemen"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Yemen"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syria", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Syria"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Syria"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iraq", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Iraq"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Iraq"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Nationalism", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Nationalism", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Religion_and_Spirituality/Zoroastrianism", "label": "dmoz/Society/Religion and Spirituality/Zoroastrianism", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 62}], "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/07/30/multimedia/30iran-president-vbwf-LIVE-copy/30iran-president-vbwf-videoSixteenByNine3000.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9776465", "eventUri": "eng-9776465", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.4352941176470588, "wgt": 163, "relevance": 1}

Iran-backed Hamas blamed Israel for killing him, but Israel has so far declined to comment. He was visiting Iran for the inauguration of the country's new president.\n\nJust hours before, on Tuesday evening, Hezbollah, the powerful Lebanese militia that is also allied with Iran, may have lost a prominent figure of its own to an Israeli strike on a Beirut suburb. Israel said it had targeted Fuad Shukr, a senior commander who Israel said was responsible for the attack on the Israeli-controlled Golan Heights on Saturday that killed 12 children and teenagers. But neither side confirmed he was killed.\n\nQatar's foreign ministry warned that the strike, on top of Israel's ongoing military offensive in Gaza, \"could lead the region to slip into chaos.\"\n\nThe statement echoed the fears of people across the Middle East that the war would not only drag on, but also metastasize into an even bigger and bloodier one.\n\nIsrael has been battling Iran-backed groups on several fronts over the past 10 months, including Hamas in Gaza to the south and Hezbollah in Lebanon across the northern border. Earlier this month, Israeli fighter jets bombed a port in Yemen controlled by the Houthi militia in retaliation for a drone attack that hit Tel Aviv. Iran-linked militias in Iraq have also occasionally joined in attacks on Israel.\n\nTime and again, analysts and U.S. officials say, the warring parties have had chances to strike in a way that would set off a larger war but always chose a more limited option that enabled them to claim they had retaliated effectively without drawing an outsized response.\n\n\"All sides over the last 10 months had reason to full-out escalate, and they didn't, which suggests the calculus hasn't changed and isn't changing,\" said Andreas Krieg, a Middle East security expert at King's College London. \"Deterrence on both sides somehow works.\"\n\nThis round may be no different.\n\nThough Hezbollah, the Houthis in Yemen or Iran-backed militias in Iraq might all launch attacks at Israeli or Israel-linked targets to avenge the most recent attacks, analysts said, the assassinations may not be reason enough for them to mount a full-blown response.\n\nDespite his title as Hamas's political leader, Mr. Haniyeh is replaceable as a leader, said Joost Hiltermann, the Middle East and North Africa program director for the International Crisis Group.\n\nIran might be embarrassed that the assassination took place on its soil, at the inauguration of its new president. But Haniyeh was not Iranian, making his death less of a slap to Iran than the killings of senior Iranian Revolutionary Guards Corps officers at the Iranian Embassy in Damascus earlier this year, Mr. Hiltermann said.\n\n\"Hamas will survive. They have plenty of other leaders,\" he said, adding that things were unlikely to escalate \"as long as the Iranian overall interest isn't harmed, and it really isn't by Haniyeh's loss.\"\n\nIn fact, Mr. Hiltermann and Mr. Krieg said, the assassination could provide a way out of the war altogether by allowing Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of Israel to claim a signal victory, giving him space to back down in Gaza and perhaps agree to a cease-fire.\n\nBut that will only happen if Mr. Netanyahu wants to find a way out, which the analysts said was far from sure given his need to work with the hawkish political factions that shore up his governing coalition.", "source": {"uri": "dnyuz.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "DNyuz"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

The Houthi militia's terror campaign against Red Sea shipping, allegedly in solidarity with Hamas against \"the Zionist entity,\" has damaged the interests of America's Middle East allies. Egypt's revenue from the Suez Canal declined 40% at the beginning of 2024 compared to the previous year, worsening the country's already precarious economic situation.\n\nBeyond the Middle East, Iran has made significant inroads in Africa - and bolstered its nuclear program in doing so. The Islamic Republic - which is \"probably one or two weeks away\" from being able to produce enough fissile material for a nuclear weapon, according to US Secretary of State Antony Blinken - has signed a uranium deal with the Tehran-supported regime in Niger. Additionally, Tehran backs the Polisario Front, which attacks Morocco in the Western Sahara and threatens the interests of America's Gulf allies by funneling weapons to a bloody civil war in Sudan.\n\nThe Islamic Republic's ambitions, however, are not limited to its training and support of a network of regional proxies. Tehran has also cultivated a military partnership with Russia to undermine the US-led global order. After a visit to Russia in October 2022, Iranian diplomats commented that \"the Russians had asked for more drones and Iranian ballistic missiles with improved accuracy.\"\n\nTehran seized the opportunity to dominate the Russian market and began with a joint Shahed drones production site in Tatarstan. By doing so, Khamenei killed two birds with one stone. He solidified Putin's friendship and made sure that IRGC's militias and proxies would remain well-armed.\n\nMore importantly, and contrary to popular belief, Tehran's attacks on Israel in April have, in fact, achieved an important political goal. Though the US and partners like Jordan demonstrated cooperation by repelling most of the over 200 drones and missiles, Tehran gained valuable intelligence for its drones; learned how to quickly assemble its proxies in Lebanon, Iraq, and Yemen; gauged the reaction of US allies in the region; and, most importantly, saw that America would not punish Iran for attacking its ally.\n\nIran improves relations with Russia, China\n\nBeyond improving its military capabilities by directly confronting the US and weakening its allies, Iran's relationship with China and Russia has improved, helping the Islamic Republic in international forums. Following the attacks, Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov reiterated his condemnation of the Israeli airstrike on the Iranian consular office in Damascus and described it as \"political killing.\" Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi declared that \"China has noted Iran's statement that its action taken was limited and was an act of self-defense.\"\n\nBy defying the US-led global order, Iran has also gathered political support that could shift the UN Security Council in its favor. When President Joe Biden advised Netanyahu to \"take the win\" following Iran's thwarted attack on Israel, he failed to consider that Iran had achieved these numerous goals.\n\nNetanyahu's proposal to establish an \"Abraham Alliance\" is pragmatic. The US-led efforts to normalize relations between Israel and its Arab neighbors have been jeopardized by a US foreign policy that does not address Iran's increasing influence over the Middle East. Iran is on the path of fortifying its offensive-dominant regime, and Israel is not the only one at risk.\n\nIn addition to helping Israel consolidate its links with neighbors who share its determination to counter the Islamic Republic's actions, the Abraham Alliance will be crucial in undermining a disruptive force whose actions imperil the national security of the United States.\n\nEspecially since Iran has utilized its political gains in the region to influence US-Israel relations, John Kirby, White House national security communications advisor, said that \"Iran has been funding and encouraging some of the protest activity here in the US.\"\n\nThe next administration should abandon the framing of the Gaza war as an Israeli-Palestinian conflict, encourage an Abraham Alliance, and adopt Netanyahu's view that the region is engaged in a greater battle where the US-led order opposes the Islamic Republic's ambitions, and Hamas's actions are just the tip of the iceberg.\n\nThe writer is a research fellow and program manager of Hudson Institute's Center for Peace and Security in the Middle East, in Washington.", "source": {"uri": "jpost.com", "dataType":

Within just 48 hours, Israel -- considered Iran's staunch adversary -- executed strategic military operations that have left Tehran reeling. An Israeli airstrike targeted a Hezbollah stronghold in Beirut and the assassination of the head of the political bureau of Hamas in Tehran have not only demonstrated Israel's tactical prowess but also signalled a potential shift in the geopolitical balance of the Middle East.\n\nIsrael's airstrike on Beirut's southern suburbs, which resulted in the death of Hezbollah's senior commander Fuad Shukr, represents a calculated military manoeuvre with far-reaching implications. The strike, conducted in retaliation for a cross-border rocket attack attributed to Hezbollah, highlights Israel's commitment to maintaining its security and its willingness to take bold actions against perceived threats.\n\nThe precision of the airstrike showcases Israel's intelligence capabilities and its ability to target high-ranking officials within militant organisations. Fuad Shukr, a close aide to Hezbollah Secretary-General Hassan Nasrallah, played a crucial role in orchestrating attacks against Israel. His elimination sends a clear message to Hezbollah and its Iranian backers that Israel's reach extends beyond its borders challenging the sanctuaries they rely upon.\n\nThe strike resonated strongly both domestically and internationally. In Israel, the public, reeling from the tragic deaths of 12 youths in the prior attack, saw the airstrike as a justified response, reinforcing national resolve and government accountability. Internationally, the operation garnered support from allies including the United States, which reiterated its commitment to Israel's security against Iran-backed threats.\n\nWhile the airstrike drew condemnation from Hezbollah's allies, Israel's careful handling of the situation, including signals of restraint to avoid further escalation, demonstrated diplomatic acumen. By balancing military action with diplomatic channels Israel managed to achieve its objectives without plunging the region into an all-out war.\n\nThe airstrike not only debilitated Hezbollah's leadership but also exposed vulnerabilities within Iran's strategic network across the Middle East. Hezbollah, long seen as Iran's proxy in Lebanon, now faces increased pressure to recalibrate its operations in light of heightened Israeli vigilance.\n\nWith Hezbollah's leadership momentarily destabilised, Iran's ability to project power through its proxy networks faces setbacks. This scenario challenges Tehran's broader strategy of maintaining a unified front against Israel potentially straining its alliances with other regional actors like Hamas and Syria.\n\nBy successfully neutralising a key Hezbollah figure, Israel reinforces its deterrence capabilities, signalling to adversaries that aggression will be met with decisive responses. This strategic edge not only safeguards Israel's borders but also strengthens its position in future diplomatic negotiations.\n\nIran's dual setback\n\nWhile Israel's actions mark a significant triumph, Iran grapples with setbacks on two critical fronts, both in Beirut and within its own borders in Tehran.\n\nThe Tehran assassination\n\nIn a separate but equally impactful development, Ismail Haniyeh, the head of the political bureau of Hamas, was killed in Tehran under mysterious circumstances. This incident, occurring just after Iran's presidential inauguration, represents a severe blow to Iran's efforts to solidify its position as a leader of the Resistance axis against Israel.\n\nThe killing of Haniyeh, allegedly by operatives linked to Israel, marks a rare occurrence of direct confrontation within Iran's own territory. This act challenges Tehran's perceived invulnerability and raises questions about its ability to protect key allies within its borders.\n\nThe assassination has sparked outrage among Iran's leadership, who now face mounting pressure to respond effectively. President Pezeshkian's earlier vows of unwavering support for Resistance forces are now tested as Iran's credibility as a protector of its allies is questioned. The incident exposes potential weaknesses in Iran's security apparatus, potentially fuelling internal discontent and further complicating its foreign policy objectives.\n\nThe dual losses in Beirut and Tehran expose the vulnerabilities within Iran's extensive network of proxies and allies across the region. As Iran contends with these setbacks, its ability to orchestrate coordinated resistance against Israel and its allies faces significant challenges.\n\nWith Hezbollah and Hamas leaders targeted, Iran's proxy alliances face increased scrutiny and pressure. This situation may lead to internal discord and weaken the cohesion of the so-called Resistance axis potentially prompting a reevaluation of strategic priorities among Iran's allies.\n\nIran's standing in the region may suffer as it struggles to project strength and maintain influence amid these setbacks.

Iran and Israel have fought a covert war for years, blaming each other for sabotage, abductions and targeted killings across the region.\n\nTehran has also accused Israel of past assassinations inside Iran. Here are some of those high-profile cases:\n\nIran's top nuclear scientist\n\nIn November 2020, Mohsen Fakhrizadeh, a scientist described by U.S. and Israeli intelligence agencies as a leading figure in Iran's nuclear weapons program, was shot and killed in an ambush. The killing was carried out with a remote-controlled machine gun, officials said.\n\nMr. Fakhrizadeh was one of Israeli intelligence's top targets for years, and Iran angrily accused Israel of killing him. Israel has never publicly commented on the assassination. Mr. Fakhrizadeh was an academic, but U.S. intelligence assessments said that was a cover for his work on nuclear weapons.\n\nHe wasn't the first scientist linked to the nuclear program to be attacked on Iranian soil. Two others were targeted with car bombs 20 minutes apart in different areas of Tehran, the capital, in 2010. One was killed, the other injured.\n\nA Revolutionary Guards commander\n\nIn May 2022, two assassins on motorcycles shot and killed Col. Sayad Khodayee, an officer in Iran's Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps. Iran blamed Israel and vowed revenge.\n\nAs in other such cases, Israel made no public comment on the killing, but it told the United States it had targeted the officer. Israeli officials said Colonel Khodayee was the deputy commander of a unit that planned and carried out covert operations around the world, including assassinations and abductions.\n\nIsraeli officials said that group, called Unit 840, was a part of the Quds Force, the arm of the Revolutionary Guards that specializes in covert operations and espionage. A U.S. drone strike killed Qassim Suleimani, the Quds Force leader, in Iraq in 2020.\n\nMysterious poisonings\n\nIn May 2022, two Iranian scientists suddenly fell ill and died within days of each other, in cities hundreds of miles apart.\n\nAyoub Entezari, an aeronautical engineer at a military research facility, and the geologist Kamran Aghamolaei both developed symptoms of food poisoning, and their conditions deteriorated rapidly. Iran believed Israel had poisoned their food, according to an Iranian official.\n\nIsrael had no comment. But if it were behind the men's deaths, it would have suggested an expansion of the campaign of assassinations, going beyond high-ranking officials in the nuclear program and senior military

However, he will now be under severe pressure from Iran's security apparatus to retaliate against Israel - widely assumed to be behind the assassinations - which would make any rapprochement stillborn. While if he resists retaliation, it would undermine his rule before he has had a chance to establish his authority.\n\nThe pressure to respond decisively is immense, particularly from the hardline Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC). They issued a swift and strongly worded statement promising a \"harsh and painful response\". against Benjamin Netenyahu's government in Tel Aviv.\n\nHowever, Pezeshkian must weigh internal pressures against broader strategic considerations. Western powers, especially the United States, are likely to react strongly to any significant Iranian counter-attack. A significant military response could potentially escalate tensions dramatically, causing further international isolation at a time when Iran is already grappling with economic challenges and diplomatic hurdles and a potential Donald Trump presidency after November's US presidential election.\n\nOn the other hand, maintaining the current policy of relative restraint risks appearing weak, potentially undermining Pezeshkian's legitimacy among more hawkish elements within Iran's political establishment and leading to his removal. Allowing Israel to attack its proxies with impunity might also hasten the collapse of Iran's so-called \"resistance axis\" across the region.\n\nThe assassination has exposed vulnerabilities in Iran's security apparatus, and represents a humiliating blow to the nation's image as a regional power. The inability to protect a high-profile guest like Haniyeh not only raises questions about Iran's intelligence capabilities but also sends a troubling message to other allies and proxies who rely on Iran's support and protection. As one Israeli commentator noted following the hit on Haniyeh, \"[Yemen's] Houthis and Khamenei will not sleep easy tonight.\"\n\nIsrael's actions demonstrate a calculated strategy of targeting key figures in Iran's proxy network while maintaining plausible deniability. This approach also allows Israel to assert its power without crossing thresholds that would cause a full-scale conflict. In essence, Israel is playing a long game, methodically weakening Iran's regional influence while avoiding direct confrontation.\n\nNetanhayu's actions, however, may be born out of weakness rather than strength. Arguably Netanhayu is resorting to assassinations to compensate for Israel's growing isolation over its war crimes in Gaza, something that was on display even during his recent trip to the United States, where he expected a standing ovation but was not offered that by Congress.\n\nIsrael's recent actions suggest a pattern of escalation. These assassinations indicate that Netanyahu is not seeking a ceasefire or the release of prisoners but rather aims to expand the scope of the war. He may reason that this would maintain his government and stave off his prosecution for alleged fraud.\n\nHow Pezeshkian reacts to Netanyahu's escalation will mark his presidency, and could destroy any hopes for peace in the region.", "source": {"uri": "intellinews.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Intellinews                        "}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

During this period, Israel has allegedly conducted about two dozen operations most of which targetted at Tehran's nuclear program. Here is a timeline of the attacks launched by the Zionist regime on targets in Iran since January 12, 2010.\n\nSince 2010, Israel has allegedly conducted at least two dozen operations - including assassinations, drone strikes and cyberattacks - on Iran. Most of the targets were connected to Tehran's controversial nuclear program, which Israel considers an existential threat. In 2022, however, two facilities that were part of Iran's increasingly advanced drone program were hit by drones.\n\nIn the latest raid on July 30, 2024, which is a continued escalation of the Gaza conflict, Hamas blamed Israel for the killing of its chief Ismail Haniyeh during an attack on his headquarters residence in Tehran on Tuesday morning. The incident sparked condemnation from Iran and several other countries even as Israel said it was taking a 'situational assessment' of the happening. Iran's supreme leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei has strongly reacted to the killing, vowing \"harsh punishment\" for Israel for the assassination of the Hamas leader. It triggered fears of further escalation of the Gaza conflict.\n\nThe following is a timeline of attacks by Israel on Iran since 2010.\n\nJan. 12, 2010: Masoud Ali Mohammadi, a physics professor at Tehran University, was killed by a remote-controlled bomb planted on a motorcycle. The device detonated as he left home in northern Tehran to go to work. The government described Ali Mohammadi as a nuclear scientist but said he did not work for the Atomic Energy Organization of Iran. The State media blamed Israel and the United States for the assassination.\n\nNov. 29. 2010: Professor Majid Shariari, a member of the nuclear engineering faculty at Shahid Beheshti University in Tehran, was killed in his car on his way to work. His wife was wounded in the blast. Ali Akbar Salehi, the head of the Atomic Energy Organization of Iran, said that Shariari was involved in one of the country's biggest nuclear projects but did not elaborate. Accounts of the assassination varied. A Western intelligence expert said that an explosive was planted on the vehicle beforehand and detonated remotely. Iranian media reported that men on motorbikes attached bombs to cars belonging to Shariari and another scientist, Fereydoon Abbasi Davani, on the same day.\n\nJuly 23, 2011: Darioush Rezaeinejad, an electrical engineer working at a national security research facility, was killed by two gunmen on a motorcycle in Tehran. State media initially identified the man as Rezaei, a physics professor. Hours later, state media backtracked and said the victim was Darioush Rezaeinejad, an electronics student. Deputy Interior Minister Safarali Baratloo claimed that he was not involved in the nuclear program. But a foreign government official and a former U.N. nuclear inspector alleged that Rezaeinejad was working on high-voltage switches, parts necessary to start explosions needed to trigger a nuclear warhead. Iran blamed the United States and Israel for the assassination.\n\nJan. 11, 2012: Mostafa Ahmadi Roshan, a chemical engineering graduate, was killed after two people on a motorbike placed a bomb on his car in northern Tehran. Roshan and the driver died, and at least two other people at the scene were reportedly injured. Iran identified Ahmadi Roshan as a supervisor at the Natanz Uranium Enrichment facility. It held Israel and the United States responsible for the killing. \"The bomb was a magnetic one and the same as the ones previously used for the assassination of the scientists, and the work of the Zionists [Israelis],\" deputy Tehran governor Safarali Baratloo claimed.\n\nJan. 31, 2018: A Mossad team raided a warehouse in Tehran that housed a vast archive of Iran's nuclear program. The agents used torches to cut through 32 safes. The team smuggled some 50,000 pages and 163 compact discs out of the country. On April 30, Israeli Prime Minister Netanyahu announced that Israel obtained some 100,000 \"secret files that prove\"\n\nJuly 2, 2020: An explosion caused extensive damage to Iran's main nuclear enrichment site at Natanz and set the program back months.

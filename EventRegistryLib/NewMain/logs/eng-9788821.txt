Mandatory Credit: Kiyoshi Mio-USA TODAY Sports / Kiyoshi Mio-USA TODAY Sports\n\nThe Los Angeles Rams experienced a scary situation with star wider receiver Puka Nacua when he suffered an injury during a joint practice with the Los Angeles Chargers.\n\nInitially, head coach Sean McVay stated he \"wasn't sure\" what happened with Nacua, who was on the sidelines with his pads and helmet but was also sporting an ice bag on his knee.\n\nThough the injury might have sparked some concern for fans and the team, McVay offered a new update on the second-year receiver's availability.\n\nPer Rams beat writer Jourdan Rodrigue, \"Sean McVay says Puka Nacua (knee) is week to week but anticipated him being ready for prep for the opener and for that opener.\"\n\nThe knee injury that Nacua suffered has placed him on a \"week-to-week\" basis, but he should also be ready for the season opener.\n\nThe biggest negative from this development is that Nacua will miss training camp time and getting reps in preseason. However, his health will be far more important during the regular season, so it's far better to sit him now and let his knee heal.\n\nNacua stormed into the league after he was drafted by the Rams in the fifth round of the 2023 NFL Draft.\n\nAfter just two games, the former BYU receiver logged 266 yards and two touchdowns. His production would continue to skyrocket throughout the entire regular season.\n\nNacua would go on to secure 1,486 yards, six touchdowns, and 105 receptions. His receptions and yards became the new rookie record in the NFL.\n\nNacua would end up leading the Rams in receiving yards and became a favorite target for quarterback Matthew Stafford. He took full advantage of Cooper Kupp dealing with a hamstring injury at the beginning of the season.\n\nNow, with a fully healthy Kupp, the pair can be one of the best wide receiver tandems in the entire NFL. The issue is that Nacua will have to ensure his knee injury does not lead to missing time.\n\nCoach McVay did indicate that he fully expects Nacua to be ready for the regular season, which is certainly some good news.\n\nThe Rams have been hit hard by the injury bug. On top of Nacua being hurt, the offensive line has been decimated by injury. Jonah Jackson, Alaric Jackson, and Rob Havenstein are all considered \"week-to-week\" as well.\n\nThe Rams are dealing with a host of injuries on both sides of the ball, but at least most of their injured players will hopefully be ready to go in Week 1.", "source": {"uri": "si.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Sports Illustrated"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Puka_Nacua", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Puka Nacua"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los_Angeles_Rams", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles Rams"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sean_McVay", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Sean McVay"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Training_camp", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Training camp"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los_Angeles_Chargers", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles Chargers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Loyola_Marymount_University", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Loyola Marymount University"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wide_receiver", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Wide receiver"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Head_coach", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Head coach"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los_Angeles", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reception_(gridiron_football)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Reception (gridiron football)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BYU_Cougars_football", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "BYU Cougars football"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Touchdown", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Touchdown"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lineman_(gridiron_football)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Lineman (gridiron football)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rob_Havenstein", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Rob Havenstein"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cooper_Kupp", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Cooper Kupp"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matthew_Stafford", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Matthew Stafford"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hamstring", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Hamstring"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rookie", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Rookie"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quarterback", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Quarterback"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jackson,_Mississippi", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Jackson, Mississippi"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Jackson, Mississippi"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Ten-Pin", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Ten-Pin", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Instructors", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Instructors", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Candlepin", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Candlepin", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 99}], "image": "https://images2.minutemediacdn.com/image/upload/c_crop,w_4921,h_2768,x_0,y_0/c_fill,w_1440,ar_16:9,f_auto,q_auto,g_auto/images/ImagnImages/mmsport/ram_digest/01j4n22evw8q8tkemg1w.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9788821", "eventUri": "eng-9788821", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.07450980392156858, "wgt": 208, "relevance": 1}

The knee bothered him again while running a route later in practice, and the Rams shut him down and put ice on the knee.\n\n\"He had a bursa sac that kind of burst and it's going to be week to week with him,\" McVay said. \"Nothing serious, nothing structurally, he'll be in good shape. ... I don't anticipate him being affected in even prep for that opener.\"\n\nNacua set NFL rookie records in 2023 with 105 receptions and 1,486 yards receiving after being a fifth-round pick out of BYU.\n\nThe Rams' injury luck on the offensive line somehow got even worse over the weekend.\n\nAlready down three starters of the five, rookie reserve K.T. Leveston had a teammate roll up on his ankle during joint practice on Sunday and he was unable to practice Tuesday. Warren McClendon Jr., who has been filling in at right tackle, also rolled his ankle against the Chargers but got taped up and returned to the field. He was a partial participant in Tuesday's practice.\n\nThese injuries come after left guard Jonah Jackson (shoulder) and right tackle Rob Havenstein (ankle) were ruled week to week in their injury recoveries. The Rams had initially hoped that left tackle Alaric Jackson (ankle) would practice on Sunday, but he was downgraded to week to week.\n\n\"A lot of guys are having to push through,\" McVay said.\n\nMcVay said Alaric Jackson did not suffer a setback, and that the team was merely taking a cautious approach with his recovery. McVay wouldn't commit Tuesday to all three of the injured starters being cleared to play in Week 1 in Detroit, but he also said he couldn't rule it out at this point, either.\n\nStill, the Rams took some precautions on Tuesday by signing three offensive linemen, Conor McDermott, Matt Kaskey and Alec Lindstrom.\n\nMcDermott, a former UCLA standout, is the most experienced of the three. In eight seasons with the Buffalo Bills, New York Jets and New England Patriots, he has played in 54 games with 17 starts. With the Bills, he played for Rams offensive line coach Ryan Wendell, who was then Buffalo's assistant O-line coach, so McDermott has some experience with the verbiage the Rams use up front.\n\nKaskey has bounced around preseason rosters and practice squads, and he participated in training camp with the Rams as an undrafted rookie in 2019. Lindstrom spent the last two years with the Dallas Cowboys, mostly on the team's practice squad.\n\n\"We'll get familiar with those guys,\" McVay said. \"There is some familiarity with Conor McDermott from a lot of guys that are on our coaching staff and even some of our players.

The injuries are troublesome for the dynamics of the Rams' offense.\n\n\"Week-to-week\" is an alarming phrase head coach Sean McVay has had to use quite often lately. Offensive lineman Jonah Jackson, Alaric Jackson, Rob Havenstein, and sophomore wideout Nacua are all considered \"week-to-week.\"\n\nThe Rams were short the three offensive linemen in their joint practice with the Chargers on Sunday which allowed the Bolts' defense to force six turnovers.\n\nLos Angeles spent millions in rebuilding their offensive line, and if players aren't healthy enough to make an impact on the field, then all the moves the Rams made in the offseason won't matter.\n\nAlaric was one of the Rams' offseason acquisitions and his status was recently downgraded to \"week-to-week.\"\n\n\"We want to be smart,\" McVay said regarding Alaric's return, via the team's transcript. \"It was a weird deal where he kind of just rolled up his ankle. It's nothing that we expected to be long-term. It was day-to-day, now it's kind of week-to-week. But I thought he was having a great camp and I think the worst thing we could do is rush him back. In the meantime, we're going to learn about some guys and I mean it's a Rolodex of guys that are in there right now, even with that first group. And I think it's only going to force those guys to mature and accelerate their learning process.\"\n\nNacua suffered a knee injury on Sunday in the joint practice with the Chargers. The record-setting receiver is week to week and ESPN's Adam Schefter reported that the injury was \"not serious.\"\n\nNevertheless, the term 'week to week' is frightening to hear for an impact player like Nacua. In his rookie season, Nacua had 105 catches for 1,486 yards. His emergence was a pleasant surprise for Los Angeles as they drafted him as a fifth-round pick in last year's draft.\n\nThe timing of Nacua's success couldn't have been better since Rams star receiver Cooper Kupp was sidelined for the first four games of the season due to a hamstring injury. Los Angeles has a chance for both star receivers to be healthy at the start of the season if Nacua can recover from his knee injury.\n\nMcVay is looking at the upside of these injuries by focusing on the guys who are available to play.\n\n\"No, here's the one thing I've tried to be disciplined about is these guys... you sit there and you start saying 'Oh man, you're bummed out.' And it's like how selfish of me. What about these guys?\" McVay said Thursday. \"I know they want to be out here. I think the important thing is let's pour into the guys that are not able to be out here and the ones that are able to be out here. So we'll be better when those guys are back, whenever that timetable is.

The fifth-round pick out of BYU went on to record 105 catches for 1,486 yards and six touchdowns over the course of the season, setting the NFL rookie receptions and receiving yards record.\n\nSetting the receiving yards record was an especially impressive feat as the record had stood for over 60 years from when Bill Groman exploded for 1,473 yards as a rookie in 1960.\n\nNacua additionally set the rookie single-game receptions record, as well as the rookie single-game playoffs receiving yards record after recording 181 yards in the Rams' 24-23 wildcard loss to the Detroit Lions.\n\nAs a rookie, Nacua established a great connection with quarterback Matthew Stafford and helped propel the Rams' offense. Losing Nacua would be a big blow, as the Rams are hoping to have Nacua and Cooper Kupp on the field together all season for the first time.\n\nKupp has missed time in each of the last two seasons due to injuries. He missed the first few games of 2023 due to a hamstring injury but returned for the rest of the year. Having both Nacua and Kupp on the field will make the offense much more dynamic. If Nacua is not ready to go, the offense will have to rely on Kupp as they are also missing top tight end Tyler Higbee, who is coming off a torn ACL.\n\nIn addition to a potential injury to Nacua, the Rams are dealing with several injuries along the offensive line. Jonah Jackson, Alaric Jackson, and Rob Havenstein are all currently \"week to week.\"\n\nMore Rams:", "source": {"uri": "si.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Sports Illustrated"}, "authors": [{"uri": "eva_geitheim@si.com", "name": "Eva Geitheim", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Puka_Nacua", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Puka Nacua"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los_Angeles_Rams", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles Rams"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rookie", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Rookie"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reception_(gridiron_football)", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Reception (gridiron football)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Athletic", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "The Athletic"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los_Angeles_Chargers", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles Chargers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sean_McVay", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Sean McVay"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wide_receiver", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Wide receiver"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Head_coach", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Head coach"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bill_Groman", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Bill Groman"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BYU_Cougars_football", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "BYU Cougars football"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Touchdown", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Touchdown"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lineman_(gridiron_football)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Lineman (gridiron football)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NFL_playoffs", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "NFL playoffs"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rob_Havenstein", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Rob Havenstein"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tyler_Higbee", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Tyler Higbee"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cooper_Kupp", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Cooper Kupp"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matthew_Stafford", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Matthew Stafford"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anterior_cruciate_ligament_injury", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Anterior cruciate ligament injury"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hamstring", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Hamstring"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wild_card_(sports)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Wild card (sports)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Detroit_Lions", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Detroit Lions"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quarterback", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Quarterback"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Business/Arts_and_Entertainment/Music", "label": "dmoz/Business/Arts and Entertainment/Music", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Music/Collecting", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Music/Collecting", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Arts_and_Entertainment/Beauty_Pageants", "label": "dmoz/Business/Arts and Entertainment/Beauty Pageants", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Rodeo/Rodeo_Queens", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Rodeo/Rodeo Queens", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Audio/Home_Recording", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Audio/Home Recording", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://images2.minutemediacdn.com/image/upload/c_crop,w_5309,h_2986,x_0,y_0/c_fill,w_1440,ar_16:9,f_auto,q_auto,g_auto/images/ImagnImages/mmsport/ram_digest/01j4fjfayfv5sd9k47fr.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9788821", "eventUri": "eng-9788821", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.1215686274509804, "wgt": 190, "relevance": 1}

Mandatory Credit: Jayne Kamin-Oncea-USA TODAY Sports / Jayne Kamin-Oncea-USA TODAY Sports\n\nThe injury bug appears to have hit the Los Angeles Rams in a very hard way. The team has already been dealing with three injuries on the offensive line, with Jonah Jackson dealing with a shoulder injury, Alaric Jackson dealing with an ankle injury, and Rob Haventstein also dealing with an ankle injury.\n\nAll three starting offensive linemen are considered \"week-to-week\" and will be missing training camp time as a result of their injuries.\n\nNow, star wide receiver Puka Nacua is also considered \"week-to-week\" after he suffered what appeared to be a knee injury during a joint practice with the Los Angeles Rams on Sunday.\n\nThough Nacua was still on the sidelines with his helmet and pads on, he was spotted with a bag of ice wrapped around his knee.\n\nHead coach Sean McVay stated he was \"not sure\" what happened with Nacua after practice. Whatever happened appears to be significant enough to hold Nacua from practicing.\n\nThere is a lot of hope surrounding the second-year wide receiver, who exceeded all expectations last season.\n\nAfter being drafted by the Rams at No. 177 overall in the 2023 NFL Draft, Nacua took the league by storm. In his first two games, the star rookie amassed 266 yards and two touchdowns. He only got better as each game passed.\n\nNacua would end the 2023 regular season with 1,486 yards and 105 receptions, setting the rookie records for both receptions and yards.\n\nNow entering his second season, the hope is he can continue to be dominant alongside fellow star wide receiver Cooper Kupp. Kupp had a rough start to his 2023 season as a hamstring injury kept him from appearing at the start of the regular season.\n\nKupp appears to be fully healthy heading into 2024, but now the team will have to see what level of knee injury Nacua is dealing with and if that injury will keep him out of the start of the regular season.\n\nThere are a few weeks left of training camp and preseason games, and it would be hugely beneficial if Nacua was back on the field during the third \"dress rehearsal\" preseason game to get in some valuable reps from quarterback Matthew Stafford.\n\nHaving Kupp and Nacua out on the field will be paramount for the success of the Rams' offense. When both are on the field at the same time, they are one of the best wide receiver tandems in the league.", "source": {"uri": "si.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Sports Illustrated"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los_Angeles_Rams", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles Rams"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wide_receiver", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Wide receiver"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Puka_Nacua", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Puka Nacua"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lineman_(gridiron_football)", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Lineman (gridiron football)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reception_(gridiron_football)", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Reception (gridiron football)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Training_camp", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Training camp"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jackson,_Mississippi", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Jackson, Mississippi"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Jackson, Mississippi"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Loyola_Marymount_University", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Loyola Marymount University"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los_Angeles", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Football_helmet", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Football helmet"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sean_McVay", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Sean McVay"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rookie", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Rookie"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Head_coach", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Head coach"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cooper_Kupp", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Cooper Kupp"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matthew_Stafford", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Matthew Stafford"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hamstring", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Hamstring"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quarterback", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Quarterback"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Touchdown", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Touchdown"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Ten-Pin", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Ten-Pin", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Instructors", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Instructors", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Candlepin", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Candlepin", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 97}], "image": "https://images2.minutemediacdn.com/image/upload/c_crop,w_2639,h_1484,x_0,y_0/c_fill,w_1440,ar_16:9,f_auto,q_auto,g_auto/images/ImagnImages/mmsport/ram_digest/01j4hf01hygjccw11k39.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9788821", "eventUri": "eng-9788821", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.2313725490196078, "wgt": 190, "relevance": 1}

Demarcus Robinson, I think you're seeing Tutu [Atwell]. I really thought as a whole, this is as good of depth as we have at the receiver position. Tyler Johnson's comfortable in his second year, Xavier Smith's made some good strides and Jordan Whittington is a really mature young rookie.\"\n\nThe Rams' primary receiver outside of Nacua is of course Pro Bowler Cooper Kupp. Kupp has dealt with injuries over the last two seasons but is currently healthy heading into the 2024 season.\n\nOutside of Kupp, the Rams have former Kansas City Chiefs receiver Demarcus Robinson heading into his second year with the team. He caught 26 passes for 371 yards and four touchdowns during his first season with the Rams.\n\nThe Rams are also hoping to see Tutu Atwell take the next step as a receiver after putting in a career 483 yards and three touchdowns in 2023. Atwell has also shared that he wants to get involved in special teams to help the Rams capitalize on the new kickoff return rules.\n\nBoth Tyler Johnson and Xavier Smith are looking to make a bigger impact heading into their second season with the Rams. Johnson signed with the Rams in 2023 after over two seasons with the Tampa Bay Buccaneers. He had two receptions for eight receiving yards.

The Chargers tipped numerous passes, batted away several more and came up with three interceptions.\n\nThe Rams defense also is adjusting because of injuries.\n\nStarting cornerback Darious Williams has been week to week because of a hamstring injury suffered on the second day of training camp.", "source": {"uri": "latimes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Los Angeles Times"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los_Angeles_Rams", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles Rams"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Puka_Nacua", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Puka Nacua"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rookie", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Rookie"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tutu_Atwell", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Tutu Atwell"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Demarcus_Robinson", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Demarcus Robinson"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tackle_(gridiron_football_position)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Tackle (gridiron football position)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cooper_Kupp", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Cooper Kupp"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sean_McVay", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Sean McVay"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/California_Lutheran_University", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "California Lutheran University"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dallas_Cowboys", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Dallas Cowboys"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/End_zone", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "End zone"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oxnard,_California", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Oxnard, California"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Oxnard, California"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jackson,_Mississippi", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Jackson, Mississippi"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Jackson, Mississippi"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Warren_McClendon", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Warren McClendon"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Darious_Williams", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Darious Williams"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guard_(gridiron_football)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Guard (gridiron football)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rob_Havenstein", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Rob Havenstein"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zach_Thomas", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Zach Thomas"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Training_camp", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Training camp"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hamstring", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Hamstring"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interception", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Interception"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cornerback", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Cornerback"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Ten-Pin", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Ten-Pin", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Instructors", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Instructors", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Candlepin", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Candlepin", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 95}], "image": "https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/a274a21/2147483647/strip/true/crop/2370x1333+0+123/resize/1200x675!/quality/75/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F98%2F2b%2F7a6f54cd4060851a33643dfcde5b%2F1459691-sp-0611-rams-16-rcg.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9788821", "eventUri": "eng-9788821", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.2862745098039216, "wgt": 185, "relevance": 1}

Nacua would would leave \"a little over an hour\" in and didn't return to participate, but was on the sidelines \"in uniform and helmet\" on according to Jourdan Rodrigue of The Athletic as Rams head coach Sean McVay was \"not sure\" on what took place.\n\n\"Puka Nacua left practice a little over an an hour into it after a team drills period, and did not return to play but stayed in uniform and helmet on sideline,\" Rodrigue wrote on her X, formerly Twitter, account. \"He had a bag of ice wrapped around his right knee. Sean McVay says he is \"not sure\" what happened.\"\n\nThere seems to be some mystery with what caused the injury, but the issue does seem to be somewhere in the right knee area as the bag of ice was on that part reportedly by Rodrigue. Even worse, it remains to be seen how severe or serous the injury is and if Nacua were to miss anytime of the regular season with the opener about a month away.\n\nNacua was electric for the Rams last season\n\nNacua was a superstar in his rookie season as filling in for the injury of star wide receiver Cooper Kupp for a majority of the time, the BYU product caught 105 passes for 1,486 yards to go along with six touchdowns. While the goal is to build off of that first year, it is not known if he will miss a significant amount of time as he played all 17 games last season.\n\nThe 23-year old is a great story as he was taken with the Rams' 177th overall pick in the fifth round as a part of the 2023 NFL Draft and immediately shined right from the jump. In Week 1 last season against the Seattle Seahawks, he recorded 10 receptions on 15 targets for 119 yards and would even do better in Week 2 vs. the San Francisco 49ers where Nacua caught 15 passes on 20 targets for 147 yards.\n\nNacua could play anywhere on the field whether it be on the outside or in the slot which makes him a dangerous weapon for Rams quarterback Matthew Stafford.

That matched the Rams up against the Detroit Lions for a road playoff game. Los Angeles played a hard-fought game but they lost 24-23 to Detroit. The team is looking to carry some of that momentum from 2023 into 2024.\n\nOne of the most important players on their roster in 2023 was rookie WR Puka Nacua. Nobody expected Nacua to have the type of production he did in his first season. An injury to WR Cooper Kupp early on gave Nacua an increased role. He quickly became the team's #1 target while Kupp was out. ESPN's Adam Schefter reported that Puka Nacua is now considered week-to-week after leading a joint practice early on Sunday with a knee injury. Not what the Rams want to see with the season about a month away.\n\nWide receiver Puka Nacua was a fifth-round pick by the Rams in 2023 out of BYU. To start last season, the Rams were without WR Cooper Kupp for the first four weeks. That's where Puka Nacua made a name for himself. The rookie WR dominated his first four weeks of the 2023 season. In his first professional game, Nacua had 10 catches on 15 targets for 119 yards. Additionally, he had 100+ yards in three of his first four games. That's how the 23-year-old was able to set the NFL record for most receptions (105) and receiving yards (1,486) by a rookie in league history.\n\nAfter a knee injury he suffered on Sunday, the Rams say that Ncaua is now week-to-week. Los Angeles is off from practice on Monday and they will be back on Tuesday. Their first game of the 2024 season is Sunday, September 8 vs. the Detroit Lions. A rematch of last season's wildcard matchup. Nacua had nine catches for 181 yards and a touchdown in last season's playoff loss.

The results of the day of work were mixed, depending on which side of the ball you were watching.\n\nThe Rams defense had a strong day, albeit against backup quarterback Easton Stick. The front won its matchups and clogged up running lanes, with Byron Young and Braden Fiske in particular causing chaos until the latter left practice to tend to a large blister on his foot.\n\nThe Rams offense was another story.\n\nThis wasn't difficult to predict given the state of the team as it arrived at the Bolt, the Chargers' new facility. The Rams were down three starting offensive linemen, including both tackles, as Rob Havenstein (ankle), Alaric Jackson (ankle) and Jonah Jackson (shoulder) are all week to week.\n\nSo with a makeshift offensive line against a Chargers front headlined by Joey Bosa and Khalil Mack, the results were predictable. In the first period of work between the Rams' first-team offense and the Chargers' first-team defense, the Rams gave up three sacks, committed one holding penalty and allowed one tipped pass at the line of scrimmage that turned into an interception.\n\nThose trends continued for the rest of the day, with the tipped passes in particular halting any momentum the Rams tried to put together.\n\n\"I think they're doing as well as they can. I think there's a lot of learning right now,\" head coach Sean McVay said. \"We might not have our guys throughout the course of the season. We were able to stay relatively healthy last year and then we saw what it looked like the year before. That's not gonna be an excuse for us.\"\n\nSunday was the first serious test of Warren McClendon Jr., a fifth-round pick in 2023 who didn't get much work with the first-team offense a year ago during joint practices with the Raiders and Broncos.\n\nHe was thrown into the fire against the Chargers, playing right tackle in Havenstein's absence. McVay said he liked some of the things he saw from McClendon at the point of the attack in the run game, which was generally successful against the Chargers. Pass blocking reps were a different matter as McClendon struggled to stay in front of Bosa and Mack, not that Joe Noteboom faired any better on the left side of the line.\n\n\"I can remember before the '21 season we practiced against the Raiders, we had a really tough day of practice. The guys collectively responded the right way and we were fairly decent on offense that year,\" McVay said. \"What I'm interested in is guys improving every single day.\"\n\nSunday was also center Steve Avila's first day to work on pre-snap identifications against a new defense rather than practice looks against his own team.\n\n\"His command is just exactly what I've been seeing,\" Stafford said. \"He and I were on the same page on pretty much everything we did out there today so that was a positive.\"\n\nSo no, not all doom and gloom on Sunday, but definitely a day that left the Rams offense wanting more, whether all 11 starters participated or some backups had to step into the spotlight in their absence.\n\n\"Our job is to be able to get this roster ready to go and we're going to continue to focus on that,\" McVay said. \"But make no mistake about it, some of the things I saw, particularly offensively, got way higher standards than what we looked like today consistently down in and down out.\"\n\nRams receiver Puka Nacua left midway through practice and was on the sidelines with ice on his knee. Nacua took a couple of hits during the joint practice, one on a jet sweep and the other on a jump ball in the corner of the end zone. Nacua went down to the grass after the catch, then got up gingerly before walking off the field.\n\nMcVay said after practice he was not sure what happened to Nacua and had no update on his status.

Chargers", "body": "The Los Angeles Rams left Loyola Marymount University on Sunday to join the Los Angeles Chargers in El Segundo for joint practice against their city rival.\n\nWhile the Chargers were missing starting quarterback Justin Herbert, the joint practice gave the Rams the chance to go up against another team ahead of their preseason opener against the Dallas Cowboys next week.\n\nHere were the standout moments for the Rams:\n\nThe Rams defensive line got off to a hot start, as the young core featuring Kobie Turner, Jared Verse, Byron Young, and Braden Fiske overwhelmed the Chargers' offensive front. One of the storylines for the Rams this offseason has been the team missing Aaron Donald, but their current front is showing up strong early in camp.\n\nRams head coach Sean McVay is particularly high on rookie second-round pick Braden Fiske, shouting him while appearing on Inside the Rams this weekend.\n\n\"I've been really pleased with Braden Fiske from the very first day we put the pads on,\" McVay said. \"I thought he took the offseason program and he started exactly where he left off.\"\n\nThe injuries to offensive linemen Jonah Jackson, Alaric Jackson, and Rob Havenstein were evident during joint practice as the Chargers defensive front featuring Joey Bosa, Bud Dupree, and Khalil Mack got the best of them early in the day. The Chargers notched three sacks quickly on the Rams at practice.\n\nStill, head coach Sean McVay is not going to let injuries to the offensive line be an excuse for the Rams' performance.\n\n\"We might not have our guys throughout the course of the season,\" McVay told reporters. \"We were able to stay relatively healthy last year and then we saw what it looked like the year before. That's not gonna be an excuse for us.\"\n\nEven more apparent than the offensive line struggles were the struggles against the Chargers defensive backs and linebackers. The Chargers defense continued to swarm the Rams receivers and playmakers, notching tipped passes, interceptions, and turnovers throughout the day.\n\nThe Rams of course were not running their best offense, but still ended the day disappointed with their performance.\n\n\"Make no mistake about it, some of the things I saw,\" McVay said. \"Particularly offensively, got way higher standards than what we looked like today\n\nFiske left practice early Sunday, which McVay later noted was out of precaution. Fiske got a huge blister according to McVay.\n\nRams star second-year wide receiver Puka Nacua also left practice early.

Rams head coach Sean McVay was \"not sure\" what transpired.\n\n\"Puka Nacua left practice a little over an hour into it after a team drills period, and did not return to play but stayed in uniform and helmet on sideline,\" Rodrigue wrote on her X, formerly Twitter, account. \"He had a bag of ice wrapped around his right knee. Sean McVay says he is \"not sure\" what happened.\"\n\nThe cause of the injury is somewhat unclear, but it appears to involve the right knee area, as Rodrigue reported a bag of ice was placed there. The severity of the injury and whether Nacua will miss any regular-season games, with the opener about a month away, is yet to be determined.\n\nNacua had an outstanding rookie season, stepping in for injured star wide receiver Cooper Kupp for most of the time. The BYU alum caught 105 passes for 1486 yards and six touchdowns. It's uncertain if he will be sidelined for a significant period, as he played all 17 games last season.\n\nThe 23-year-old's journey is remarkable, having been selected with the Rams' 177th overall pick in the fifth round of the 2023 NFL Draft. He made an immediate impact, with 10 receptions on 15 targets for 119 yards in Week 1 against the Seattle Seahawks, and even better performance in Weer 2 against the San Francisco 49ers, catching 15 passes on 20 targets for 147 yards.\n\nNacua's versatility allows him to play on the field, either on the outside or in the slot, making him a valuable asset for Rams quarterback Matthew Stafford. Fans are anxiously awaiting updates as the Rams aim to build on last season's 10-7 record, which placed them second in the NFC West, as they start the season on the road against the Detroit Lions, the team that eliminated from the playoffs.\n\nRelated: WNBA Legend Sue Bird Makes Stance On Caitlin Clark-Angel Reese Rookie of the Year Race Clear", "source": {"uri": "postandcourier.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Post and Courier"}, "authors": [{"uri": "richard_pereira@postandcourier.com", "name": "Richard Pereira", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Puka_Nacua", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Puka Nacua"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sean_McVay", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Sean McVay"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wide_receiver", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Wide receiver"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2017_Los_Angeles_Rams_season", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "2017 Los Angeles Rams season"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Athletic", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "The Athletic"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los_Angeles_Chargers", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles Chargers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los_Angeles_Rams", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles Rams"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Head_coach", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Head coach"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cooper_Kupp", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Cooper Kupp"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BYU_Cougars_football", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "BYU Cougars football"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Touchdown", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Touchdown"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twitter", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Twitter"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NFL_playoffs", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "NFL playoffs"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NFC_West", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "NFC West"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matthew_Stafford", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Matthew Stafford"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/San_Francisco_49ers", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "San Francisco 49ers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Women's_National_Basketball_Association", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Women's National Basketball Association"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rookie", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Rookie"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seattle_Seahawks", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Seattle Seahawks"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Detroit_Lions", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Detroit Lions"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quarterback", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Quarterback"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Ten-Pin", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Ten-Pin", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Instructors", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Instructors", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Candlepin", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Candlepin", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 99}], "image": "https://bloximages.newyork1.vip.townnews.com/postandcourier.com/content/tncms/custom/image/6903687a-a7dc-11e9-896c-0bef6d6c9301.jpg?resize=600%2C314", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9788821", "eventUri": "eng-9788821", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.08235294117647063, "wgt": 176, "relevance": 1}

Nacua stayed on the sideline in full uniform and had his helmet on. He had a bag of ice around his right knee.\n\nLos Angeles Rams head coach Sean McVay said after practice he was \"not sure\" what happened to Nacua, who blossomed into a star on a young roster in 2023. He had no further update. The Rams have Monday off, then will practice at their old facilities in Thousand Oaks, Calif., starting Tuesday.\n\nThe injury bug has bitten the team hard so far into August. Starting cornerback Darious Williams is week-to-week with a hamstring injury, while backup cornerback Derion Kendrick suffered a season-ending torn ACL as training camp began. Williams got a workout on the sideline with athletic trainers but did not practice.\n\nThree starting offensive linemen are week-to-week: Left guard Jonah Jackson (shoulder), left tackle Alaric Jackson (ankle) and right tackle Rob Havenstein (ankle). It was a positive sign for Alaric Jackson's progress that he was actually in attendance at Sunday's practice, though not dressed to participate.\n\nPlaying backups at those positions, including Joe Noteboom, Zach Thomas and Warren McClendon, was a challenge Sunday against a group of Chargers outside linebackers that includes Khalil Mack, Joey Bosa (who left practice gingerly with an athletic trainer after some contact in the final period), Tuli Tuipulotu and Bud Dupree.\n\n\"I think they are doing as well as they can, I think there is a lot of learning right now,\" said McVay, who was visibly frustrated after practice. \"I think that any time you go against a front like this, it's a great challenge. And there (are) no excuses. We might not have 'our guys' throughout the course of the season. We were able to stay relatively healthy last year, and then we saw what it looked like the year before -- that is not going to be an excuse for us.\"\n\nThe Rams' first- and second-team offenses had issues with protection up front. Ball security was also a problem as batted and tipped passes led to two Matthew Stafford interceptions and running back Blake Corum fumbled on a carry when the ball was punched out by Alohi Gilman and the Chargers recovered.\n\n\"It was up and down a little bit,\" Stafford said, \"they did a nice job, they got their hands up at the line of scrimmage a couple of times. Tipped balls in this league don't hit the ground. It was a nice job by them; we had some good creases in the run game.\"\n\nThe Chargers forced three turnovers (split between the Rams' first- and second-team offenses) in the opening team period alone. The highlight for the Rams of that period was a one-handed catch from tight end Colby Parkinson, but Stafford may have been sacked in a live situation (and he faced pressure all day, including at least two red zone period sacks, one after which Stafford was intercepted).\n\nStafford and receiver Cooper Kupp couldn't quite find their typical sideline or end zone connection on some deeper concepts, though got going in two-minute and game-ending situations on quick passes. Chargers cornerback Kristian Fulton (who also had an interception late in the day off a tipped ball) had good coverage on back-to-back plays first deep down the left sideline first against Kupp (who was ruled out of bounds at the catch point by the sideline referee) and then as a part of a tandem defending Nacua.\n\nMcVay said the Rams have \"a lot of things to learn from\" on offense after the practice. He stayed with the offense on the third field for all of the team drills, which were broken up by special teams periods in the middle of the three fields at the Chargers' new facility in El Segundo, Calif. The first- and second-team Rams defense faced the Chargers' first- and second-team offense on the first field.\n\n\"We had too many turnovers, way too many offensively today,\" McVay said, \" ... You have to have some, 'patience' is not something that I'm very familiar with, as you know. But I think there is an understanding of, 'let's keep building' especially if you have got some guys getting reps for the first time based on some people that we do have out.\n\n\" ... What I am interested in is guys improving every single day, and I think a lot of guys have done that. Sometimes it has been a little bit halted with some position groups, because of the injuries that we have sustained. Again, that's not going to be an excuse for me. Our job is to be able to get this roster ready to go, and we're going to continue to focus on that. Make no mistake about it, some of the things I saw particularly offensively -- got way higher standards than what we looked like today consistently, down in and down out.\"\n\nI stayed with the offense on Sunday to more clearly understand the group against real competition and will move to defense during the second practice with the Chargers later this month. As a reminder, the Rams' rules for credentialed media prohibit reporting of schemes, specific play-by-play or anything they feel is a competitive advantage.\n\nMore observations and notes:\n\n* All three Rams tight ends -- Parkinson, Davis Allen and Hunter Long -- were extremely active in 11-on-11s with both the first- and second-team offenses. Whether rotating with each other or combining forces, the tight ends continue to be a bright spot on this roster and McVay and the Rams may need to take a long look at this group if they are missing either their offensive linemen, or Nacua, or all of the above for a significant amount of time. When Stafford and the first-team offense finally did get into the end zone in the red zone period, it was off a throw to Allen amid heavy contact.\n\n* After Nacua left practice, several receivers rotated into the 11-on-11 period including veteran Tyler Johnson, rookie Jordan Whittington, second-year former undrafted free agent Xavier Smith and fourth-year player Tutu Atwell. Whittington showed enthusiasm for getting involved in some of the group's blocking assignments.\n\n* Much focus from some team personnel at practice was on second-year lineman McClendon, who filled in for injured veteran Havenstein. McClendon drew a tough assignment in the first meaningful practice snaps of his career -- he faced a rotation of Mack and Bosa, or sometimes both loaded up on his side among others. The day was a mixed bag for McClendon, who drew praise a couple of times after pass-protection reps. After one of these, Stafford got the ball to Kupp downfield. Overall, pressure got to Stafford frequently off either side of the line. Sacks are a bit subjective when the quarterback can't get hit, but in comparing notes with my colleague Daniel Popper (the Chargers beat reporter), the defense got to Stafford at least five times.\n\n* Rookie defensive tackle Braden Fiske had to get care for a blister on his foot that McVay said was the size of the space between the base of his hand to the tip of his index finger.\n\n* The Rams practiced the new kickoff for the first time against an opponent, between team periods on Sunday. McVay said it \"just feels weird.\"\n\n\"It doesn't look like anything I have been familiar with with football,\" he said. \"I know the intent is right, and we'll try to figure it out. ... It's a very foreign-looking play. Ultimately, however we feel about it, we've got to be able to adjust and make sure that we adapt and that it's something that can be an advantage to us.\"\n\nMcVay added he doesn't believe that teams will show many of their ideas for the kickoff in the preseason games themselves. The Rams scheduled four joint practices with various teams in part to work through it without putting anything on tape.\n\n* Rookie kicker Josh Karty was four-for-four on his end-of-game field goals, which moved him from hash to hash and also increased in distance (32 yards, 39 yards, 44 yards, and about 50 yards or a little higher).\n\n* As is typical for a third-string quarterback, Stetson Bennett got very few snaps on Sunday. However, when he did get a series he threw a strike up the left hash to rookie undrafted free-agent receiver J.J. Laap.\n\n* Outside linebacker Brennan Jackson did not practice but got a workout on the side of the field beforehand with athletic trainers.", "source": {"uri": "nytimes.com", "dataType": "news",

(AP) -- Los Angeles Rams wide receiver Puka Nacua is week to week after sustaining a knee injury in a joint practice against the Chargers on Sunday, but coach Sean McVay expects him to be available in time to play in the season opener at Detroit on Sept. 8.\n\n\"Really just had a little bit of bursa sac kind of bursted, and it's just going to be week to week with him,\" McVay said Tuesday. \"Nothing serious, nothing structurally. He'll be in good shape and he'll recover and we'll be ready to go. No threat of anything for Detroit.\"\n\nNacua took advantage of a hamstring injury to Cooper Kupp in training camp last season to set the stage for a breakout rookie season, finishing with 105 catches for 1,486 yards and six touchdowns after being drafted in the fifth round out of BYU.\n\nThe injury happened when Nacua tried to make a catch in a red zone drill, McVay said. Nacua continued practicing before discomfort in the knee led him to leave the workout at the Chargers' new facility in El Segundo, California early.\n\nNacua's absence makes him the fourth starter on offense unavailable right now because of injury.\n\nRight tackle Rob Havenstein (ankle), left tackle Alaric Jackson (ankle) and left guard Jonah Jackson (should) are all week to week.\n\nWith reserves Warren McClendon Jr. and KT Leveston also dealing with ankle injuries, the Rams made three offensive line signings earlier on Tuesday, bringing in Conor McDermott, Matt Kaskey and Alec Lindstrom.\n\n\"A lot of guys are having to push through,\" McVay said. \"Added a few offensive linemen, we'll get familiar with those guys.\"\n\nMcDermott is the most experienced of the three additions, having played 54 games with 17 starts for the Buffalo Bills, New York Jets and New England Patriots. The 31-year-old McDermott, who played in college at UCLA, started five games at tackle for the Patriots last season.\n\n\"He's a guy that has played a lot of meaningful football in this league,\" McVay said.", "source": {"uri": "hosted.ap.org", "dataType": "news", "title": "Associated Press"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Detroit", "type": "loc", "score":

The Rams' came into Saturday's practice already dealing with injuries to three key offensive linemen, and two of their linemen had their status downgraded.\n\nBoth Rob Havenstein and Alaric Jackson, each dealing with ankle injuries, had their statuses downgraded to \"week to week,\" according to head coach Sean McVay, per The Athletic's Jordan Rodrigue. Jackson was previously said to be \"day to day\" earlier this week.\n\nAlong with Havenstein and Jackson, Jonah Jackson is also injured as he deals with a shoulder injury, that is also a \"week to week\" injury. The Rams are optimistic that Jackson's injury will not make him miss any time during the regular season, which is just over a month away.\n\nJackson was one of the Rams' major offseason additions, as Los Angeles signed the former Pro Bowler to a three-year, $51 million deal in March. Jackson enters the fifth season of his career after spending his previous four in Detroit with the Lions.\n\nHavenstein, one of the longest-tenured players on the Rams, is working through an ankle injury. McVay noted that Havenstein's injury is not season-ending, but it is unclear when he will be ready to return. Havenstein is entering his 10th season with the Rams and is a key part of the team's stability along the line.\n\nAlaric Jackson is also dealing with an ankle injury, but McVay noted that keeping him out of practice is primarily out of precaution.\n\n\"We want to be smart [with Alaric Jackson],\" McVay told reporters. \"It was a weird deal where he kind of just rolled up his ankle. It's nothing that we expected to be long-term. It was day-to-day, now it's kind of week-to-week. But I thought he was having a great camp and I think the worst thing we could do is rush him back.\"\n\nThe Rams will hope to have their offensive line get healthier over the next month before their regular season opener against the Detroit Lions. A strong offensive line is also important to protect star quarterback Matthew Stafford, who is far from the NFL's most mobile quarterback heading into his age-36 season in 2024.\n\nRams Stars Join Forces With Arsenal to Tackle Tough Questions From Kids", "source": {"uri": "si.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Sports Illustrated"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lineman_(gridiron_football)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Lineman (gridiron football)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los_Angeles_Rams", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles Rams"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jackson,_Mississippi", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Jackson, Mississippi"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Jackson, Mississippi"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alaric_Jackson", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Alaric Jackson"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Athletic", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "The Athletic"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rob_Havenstein", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Rob Havenstein"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sean_McVay", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Sean McVay"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Training_camp", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Training camp"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Head_coach", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Head coach"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pro_Bowl", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Pro Bowl"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los_Angeles", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Detroit", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Detroit"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Detroit"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tackle_(gridiron_football_position)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Tackle (gridiron football position)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matthew_Stafford", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Matthew Stafford"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Detroit_Lions", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Detroit Lions"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quarterback", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Quarterback"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Instructors", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Instructors", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 95}], "image": "https://images2.minutemediacdn.com/image/upload/c_crop,w_5189,h_2918,x_0,y_0/c_fill,w_1440,ar_16:9,f_auto,q_auto,g_auto/images/ImagnImages/mmsport/ram_digest/01j4d481d2nckpfe0k4z.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9788821", "eventUri": "eng-9788821", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.2784313725490196, "wgt": 165, "relevance": 1}

Los Angeles reached the postseason last year, despite many around football believing that they were more of a bottom-feeder than a playoff contender.\n\nThe organization lost All-Pro Aaron Donald to retirement this summer but still sees themselves as potential Super Bowl contenders. However, practice hasn't gone as smoothly as some may think so far.\n\nRams head coach Sean McVay was visibly frustrated at practice with the team recently in the joint practice with the Los Angeles Chargers. He spoke after the fact with the media and made no excuses for his guys.\n\n\"I think they are doing as well as they can, I think there is a lot of learning right now,\" said McVay, who was visibly frustrated after practice. \"I think that any time you go against a front like this, it's a great challenge. And there (are) no excuses. We might not have 'our guys' throughout the course of the season. We were able to stay relatively healthy last year, and then we saw what it looked like the year before -- that is not going to be an excuse for us.\"\n\nLos Angeles's offense seemed to struggle a ton going up against the Chargers' tough front line. The Chargers have Khalil Mack, Joey Bosa, Bud Dupree, and others that can cause havoc on an offense.\n\nWhile the Rams' offense was one of the better units last season, McVay knows that the team will have a target on their back this year. Nobody will be sleeping on the Rams this season, especially with the offensive weapons that they have at their disposal.\n\nWide receivers Puka Nacua and Cooper Kupp lead the charge, giving quarterback Matthew Stafford a lot to work with. Nacua left practice with an injury but the Rams' offensive attack still should have been a little better than they were.\n\nStafford credited the Chargers front line for causing issues for the Rams' offense.\n\n\"It was up and down a little bit,\" Stafford said. \"They did a nice job.

The team was missing three starting offensive linemen, as well as Darious Williams in the secondary and two other starters left practice early, resulting in a lopsided day that favored the Chargers.\n\nSean McVay sees a ton of value in joint practices, though, and he was pleased with the work the Rams got in - even if it wasn't as clean or efficient as he hoped. Here's a recap of their joint practice with the Chargers.\n\n1 Rams offense struggles badly\n\n(Photo by Kevork Djansezian/Getty Images)\n\nIt was not a good day for the Rams offense. In total, they turned the ball over six times, according to Chargers team reporter Eric Smith, five of which were by the first-team offense. Matthew Stafford threw three interceptions, two coming off passes that were deflected at the line, and Blake Corum also fumbled one time after a reception, according to Rams reporter Stu Jackson.\n\nSean McVay said after practice that he has \"way higher standards\" for the Rams offense than what he saw on the field Sunday, which is indicative of how poorly the unit played against the Chargers.\n\n2 Another injury added to the list\n\n(Photo by Kevork Djansezian/Getty Images)\n\nThe Rams' list of injuries is rival the length of a CVS receipt. Alaric Jackson, Jonah Jackson and Rob Havenstein were already out for the starting offense Sunday, and during practice, Puka Nacua suffered a knee injury that sidelined him for the rest of the day.\n\nMcVay didn't know what happened, but Adam Schefter reported Monday that Nacua's injury is \"not serious\" and he's considered week-to-week.\n\n3 Offensive line tested by Chargers' defenders\n\nKirby Lee-USA TODAY Sports\n\nWith three starting linemen missing, the Rams' big men up front were tested by a very good Chargers front that features Joey Bosa and Khalil Mack. Warren McClendon Jr. stepped in as the starting right tackle and though McVay didn't exactly say he struggled, he wants to watch the tape to see how he performed.\n\nThe Chargers reportedly got to Stafford pretty frequently, which isn't surprising considering the Rams were missing three starting linemen.\n\n\"I think they're doing as well as they can,\" McVay said of the offensive line. \"There's a lot of learning right now. I think anytime that you go against a front like this, it's a great challenge. There's no excuses. We might not have our guys throughout the course of the season. We were able to stay relatively healthy last year and then we saw what it looked like the year before. That's not going to be an excuse for us. We have to do a good job as coaches. The players have to accelerate their learning curve. And then we have to be able to figure out what does that look like if we need to alter some of the things that maybe we anticipated being our identity. That's part of my job as a coach and something that I'm excited about the challenge with our other coaches. I think there were some good things and then some things that we absolutely can improve upon.\"\n\n4 Robinson, Parkinson make one-handed grabs\n\nKiyoshi Mio-USA TODAY Sports\n\nTeam reporter Stu Jackson highlighted two impressive catches made by the Rams during Sunday's session: a one-handed grab by Demarcus Robinson and another hauled in by Parkinson.\n\nThey both occurred during team drills along the sidelines, so that should elicit some confidence from Stafford when targeting those two pass catchers.\n\nWhile the offense had its challenges, there were still some good moments. Tight end Colby Parkinson and wide receiver Demarcus Robinson each made an impressive one-handed catch near the sideline during team drills.\n\n5 New kickoff \"feels weird\"\n\n(Photo by Kevork Djansezian/Getty Images)\n\nFor the first time this year, the Rams practiced the new kickoff setup against another team. It slightly resembles an offensive play and will undoubtedly lead to more kickoff returns, but McVay hasn't fully grasped the new play yet.\n\n\"It just feels weird,\" McVay said. \"It doesn't look like anything that has been anything I've been familiar with football. I know the intent is right. We'll try to figure it out. I know everybody that's been involved in that has their intentions in the right place but it's a very foreign-looking play. However we feel about it, we have to be able to adjust and make sure that we adapt and it can be something that's an advantage to us.\"", "source": {"uri": "theramswire.usatoday.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Rams Wire"}, "authors": [{"uri": "cameron_dasilva@theramswire.usatoday.com", "name": "Cameron DaSilva", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lineman_(gridiron_football)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Lineman (gridiron football)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los_Angeles_Rams", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles Rams"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sean_McVay", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Sean McVay"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matthew_Stafford", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Matthew Stafford"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jackson,_Mississippi", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Jackson, Mississippi"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Jackson, Mississippi"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blake_Corum", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Blake Corum"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Darious_Williams", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Darious Williams"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los_Angeles_Chargers", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles Chargers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stu_Jackson", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Stu Jackson"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fumble", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Fumble"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interception", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Interception"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Warren_McClendon", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Warren McClendon"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Puka_Nacua", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Puka Nacua"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rob_Havenstein", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Rob Havenstein"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joey_Bosa", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Joey Bosa"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tackle_(gridiron_football_position)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Tackle (gridiron football position)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Khalil_Mack", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Khalil Mack"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adam_Schefter", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Adam Schefter"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colby_Parkinson", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Colby Parkinson"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Demarcus_Robinson", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Demarcus Robinson"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reception_(gridiron_football)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Reception (gridiron football)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kickoff_(gridiron_football)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Kickoff (gridiron football)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wide_receiver", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Wide receiver"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_football", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "American football"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Advice", "label": "dmoz/Society/Advice", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 97}], "image": "https://theramswire.usatoday.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/64/2024/08/2164856983.jpg?w=640", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9788821", "eventUri": "eng-9788821", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.1607843137254902, "wgt": 162, "relevance": 1}

After he did not return to practice, it was reported by Adem Schefter on X that Nacua's injury status is week to week.\n\nA large blister on Fiske's foot will keep him sidelined from offseason training until it can heal. The rookie is on a day-to-day watch with the blistered foot. Sean McVay stated that the blister is the \"size of his foot\".\n\nThe veteran right tackle endured an ankle injury during the Rams' practice last week, making him the third Rams lineman to go down with an injury. With a full month preceding the regular season, Havenstein is taking the recovery slowly on a week-to-week basis.\n\nJackson is another Rams lineman recovering from an ankle injury this offseason. He was initially placed on day-to-day status but has transitioned to week-by-week, which suggests his recovery time is going to be longer than expected.\n\nThe third member of the injured linemen trio is Jonah Jackson, who is dealing with a bruised scapula in his shoulder. His recovery is expected to last at least six weeks, which will leave him out of the preseason games and put him at risk of missing the first few weeks of the regular season.\n\nThe speedy new addition to the Rams' defense has been sidelined since the second day of offseason practice with a hamstring injury. Williams, the former Jaguars cornerback, is on a week-to-week recovery status. This injury may delay Williams' second debut in a Rams uniform.\n\nThe most serious injury among Rams players has been dealt to Kendrick. Unfortunately, he endured one of the most common and devastating sports injuries on the first day of the Rams' training camp.

Veteran right tackle Rob Havenstein is week to week with an ankle injury, head coach Sean McVay said following practice.\n\nHavenstein suffered the injury Thursday and was unable to return that day after being tended to by trainers. He was not on the field with the Rams during Saturday's session, the last at Loyola Marymount University this preseason.\n\nThe nine-year veteran is the latest Rams offensive line to be sidelined for an extended period of time this preseason. Starting left guard Jonah Jackson, the Rams' big free-agent acquisition in the offseason, is nursing a shoulder injury that also earned him a \"week to week\" designation from McVay.\n\nAnd on Saturday, McVay downgraded starting left tackle Alaric Jackson to week to week with his ankle injury. As recently as Thursday, McVay had said the expectation was for Jackson to return to practice Sunday.\n\n\"It was a weird deal where he kind of just rolled up his ankle. It's nothing that we expect to be long term,\" McVay said. \"It was day to day, now it's kind of week to week. I thought he was having a great camp, and I think the worst thing we can do is rush him back. In the meantime, we're going to learn about some guys.\"\n\nThat learning process will kick into overdrive Sunday during a joint practice with the Chargers. The crosstown rival's roster looks very different than it did a year ago, but the Chargers still feature edge rushers Joey Bosa and Khalil Mack, a duo that will challenge the Rams' makeshift offensive line.\n\nVeteran Joe Noteboom, long valued by McVay for his versatility, has been working at left tackle since Alaric Jackson's injury. Zach Thomas and Warren McClendon Jr. have filled in at left guard and right tackle, respectively. McClendon played a total of 32 snaps on offense as a rookie last season, while Thomas has played a total of 36 in his two seasons in the NFL.\n\n\"There are certain spots right now that based on some of the injuries that we are a little bit - I don't know that thinner is the right word - but we're having guys play that we didn't count on at this point with some of the first groups,\" McVay said. \"So I'm looking forward to seeing how our team handles it.\"\n\nThe Rams had expected to move into their new Woodland Hills practice facility following training camp at Loyola Marymount, but that move has been delayed until later this month.\n\nWith permits for the new facility taking long to acquire than expected, the Rams will spend the next three weeks back at Cal Lutheran, using their old temporary facility one last time.\n\n\"They're doing a great job of being able to expedite that construction,\" McVay said. \"I think it's as big a deal as we make it. ... I don't worry about it, but what I do want to make sure is the functionality in terms of everything that we need to be able to prepare.\"\n\nTeam president Kevin Demoff said returning to Cal Lutheran had always been the backup plan, so the practice fields have been kept in working order. He added it's mostly just weight room and training equipment that still needs to be moved, and that will happen when the team travels to Houston for a joint practice and preseason game with the Texans during the last weekend of August.\n\n\"We'll get that process really started this week and, assuming we get the permits, we'll have some staff start to move in this week,\" Demoff said. \"It does give us a chance to have it be perfect. It'll be great to get some of the staff in, personnel wise, and others to go use it to start to troubleshoot it as well.\"", "source": {"uri": "ocregister.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Orange County Register"}, "authors": [{"uri": "adam_grosbard@ocregister.com", "name": "Adam Grosbard", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lineman_(gridiron_football)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Lineman (gridiron football)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tackle_(gridiron_football_position)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Tackle (gridiron football position)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los_Angeles_Rams", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles Rams"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alaric_Jackson", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Alaric Jackson"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jonah_Jackson", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Jonah Jackson"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guard_(gridiron_football)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Guard (gridiron football)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rob_Havenstein", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Rob Havenstein"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zach_Thomas", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Zach Thomas"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sean_McVay", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Sean McVay"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Loyola_Marymount_University", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Loyola Marymount University"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_agent", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Free agent"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Head_coach", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Head coach"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los_Angeles", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Warren_McClendon", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Warren McClendon"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joey_Bosa", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Joey Bosa"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Khalil_Mack", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Khalil Mack"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rookie", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Rookie"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jackson,_Mississippi", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Jackson, Mississippi"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Jackson, Mississippi"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/California_Lutheran_University", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "California Lutheran University"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Houston", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Houston"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Houston"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Useless_Pages", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Useless Pages", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Advice", "label": "dmoz/Society/Advice", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 98}], "image": "https://www.ocregister.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/LDN-L-RAMS-0730-DC-4.jpg?w=640", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9788821", "eventUri": "eng-9788821", "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.3411764705882353, "wgt": 157, "relevance": 1}

They wrapped up their time at Loyola Marymount with their final practice on Saturday afternoon and will now return to Cal Lutheran for the next couple of weeks until their Woodland Hills facility is ready.\n\nDespite missing several key players due to injury, the Rams still had a productive and encouraging two weeks at Loyola Marymount for camp. Here are eight players who really helped themselves in practice with the regular season approaching, raising their stock and increasing their chances of not only making the team, but contributing in 2024.\n\nSean McVay was asked after the Rams' final training camp practice which players stood out the most at Loyola Marymount, and the first name out of his mouth was Fiske's. The rookie defensive tackle has been outstanding all offseason, consistently wreaking havoc on the Rams offense with his ability to generate pressure and also make stops in the run game.\n\nThere was little question about whether he would be a starter in Week 1 but he's cemented his place in the lineup after a standout camp.\n\nDurant looks like he's in line to be one of the Rams' top three cornerbacks to start the season, which means he'll be playing a good portion of the defensive snaps. His emergence in the slot and as an outside corner gives Chris Shula options, and also allows the Rams to keep Quentin Lake at safety rather than pigeonholing him to the slot out of necessity.\n\nDurant has repeatedly been a standout player in the eyes of McVay and Shula this summer.\n\nParkinson is making the Rams look very wise for signing him in free agency with Tyler Higbee still on the shelf. He's stood out in practice in a big way (quite literally), making impressive catches and helping in the run game as a blocker. He and Davis Allen have done such a good job that Matthew Stafford said the Rams' tight end group is as deep and talented as he he's had since coming into the NFL in 2009.\n\nJohnson is making a strong case to land a spot on the 53-man roster this year as the Rams' fourth or fifth receiver. He should be safe as the No. 6 option, assuming the Rams go six deep, but he's contending for meaningful snaps behind the starters. He's someone McVay has been \"really impressed\" by, calling him \"one of the bright spots\" of the offseason so far.\n\nTutu Atwell and Jordan Whittington are also in the mix, but Johnson is in his second year with the Rams and seems to be getting more and more comfortable by the day.\n\nYoung has made big strides in Year 2, according to McVay, which bodes well for the defense as a whole. He's going to be one of the Rams' two starting edge rushers, likely alongside Jared Verse, and he'll be looking to build on an eight-sack rookie campaign in 2023.\n\nYoung bulked up this season, adding nearly 10 pounds to his frame, yet he still feels just as fast as he was, so that could be a dangerous combination for the second-year edge rusher.\n\nCurl has exceeded all expectations already in practice, and the Rams had high hopes for him when he was signed in free agency. He's been a playmaker in the secondary, someone just about every coach has raved about consistently all summer. He's creating turnovers, breaking up passes and is active against the run, showing why he's going to be such an important piece for the Rams in 2024. He should be an upgrade over Jordan Fuller, who was still a quality starter for the last four years.\n\nWhittington is a sixth-round rookie who is looking to secure a spot on the 53-man roster, and his performance in camp puts him an on inside track to making the team. He's gotten first-team reps, earned high praise from coaches for his work ethic and has caught the attention of Cooper Kupp, who called him \"pretty special.\" Whittington won't have the type of impact that Nacua had as a rookie last season, but he has a chance to play meaningful reps this year.\n\nLake was always going to be a starter somewhere in the secondary, it was just a matter of which position fit him best.

Superstar Aaron Donald finally retired from the NFL, and the rest of the team's core players (Stafford and Kupp) aren't getting any younger. Los Angeles needs to make a strong push in the postseason while they have their core together. Unfortunately, that could prove difficult if their offensive line does not get healthy.\n\nAccording to ESPN's Adam Schefter, the Rams are dealing with a number of offensive line injuries. The Rams lost starting left guard Jonah Jackson to a shoulder injury this week. They also have two players, left tackle Alaric Jackson and right tackle Rob Havenstein, who are \"week-to-week\" with ankle injuries.\n\nThese offensive line injuries could have serious consequences for the Rams if they linger into the regular season. A suspect offensive line will make it harder to be as efficient in the running game, which is a significant part of McVay's system.\n\nMatthew Stafford is getting old in the tooth as well. He is still a feisty player who can make things work behind a subpar offensive line, but there is no question that the Rams are more dangerous when Stafford is kept clean.\n\nLos Angeles does not have good offensive line depth, which makes these injuries particularly worrisome. Zach Thomas, Mike McAllister, and Joe Noteboom are next in line if Alaric Jackson, Jonah Jackson, or Rob Havenstein miss any significant time.\n\nKupp missed 13 games over the past two seasons with ankle and hamstring injuries. Thankfully, it sounds like he is finally healthy.\n\nAccording to ESPN's Dan Graziano and Jeremy Fowler, Kupp is all the way back from injury. He is looking like his old self and is ready to take the NFL by storm next to second-year wide receiver Puka Nacua.\n\n\"He's on an absolute mission,\" a source close to Kupp told ESPN. \"He was deeply affected about not being out there for parts of last year.\"\n\nThus far through training camp, Kupp has looked like he did three years ago when the Rams acquired Stafford from the Lions. Kupp quickly became Stafford's go-to receiver and the pair produced an incredibly productive season. In fact, Kupp logged a whopping 145 receptions for 1,947 yards and 16 touchdowns that season.\n\nThe idea of recreating that, with the addition of Puka Nacua and Kyren Williams, should be scary for the rest of the NFL.", "source": {"uri": "clutchpoints.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "ClutchPoints"}, "authors": [{"uri": "ben_strauss@clutchpoints.com", "name": "Ben Strauss", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lineman_(gridiron_football)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Lineman (gridiron football)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los_Angeles_Rams", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles Rams"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matthew_Stafford", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Matthew Stafford"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tackle_(gridiron_football_position)", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Tackle (gridiron football position)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alaric_Jackson", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Alaric Jackson"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NFL_playoffs", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "NFL playoffs"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rob_Havenstein", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Rob Havenstein"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aaron_Donald", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Aaron Donald"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adam_Schefter", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Adam Schefter"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ESPN", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "ESPN"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los_Angeles", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guard_(gridiron_football)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Guard (gridiron football)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Puka_Nacua", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Puka Nacua"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kyren_Williams", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Kyren Williams"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reception_(gridiron_football)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Reception (gridiron football)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zach_Thomas", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Zach Thomas"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hamstring", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Hamstring"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wide_receiver", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Wide receiver"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Touchdown", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Touchdown"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Antiques_and_Collectibles/Religious_and_Inspirational", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Antiques and Collectibles/Religious and Inspirational", "wgt": 8}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Coaching", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Coaching", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Human_Resources/Training_and_Safety", "label": "dmoz/Business/Human Resources/Training and Safety", "wgt": 9}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Support_Groups/Prevention_Issues", "label": "dmoz/Health/Support Groups/Prevention Issues", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Running/Training", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Running/Training", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 99}], "image": "https://wp.clutchpoints.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/Matthew-Staffords-offensive-line-in-shambles-with-latest-injury-update.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9788821", "eventUri": "eng-9788821", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.3803921568627451, "wgt": 153, "relevance": 1}

Several starters have gone down and missed time already, including Puka Nacua, Jonah Jackson and Darious Williams.\n\nThe list of injuries keeps growing by the day, unfortunately, and it's becoming difficult to keep track all of the injured players on the Rams' roster. With a month until Week 1, the Rams do have time for most of these players to return, so they don't want to rush anyone back and risk further injury.\n\nNacua injured his knee on an attempted catch in the end zone during the Rams' practice against the Chargers.

He's week-to-week but will hopefully return soon and get some valuable reps in with his new teammates in the secondary.\n\nInjury: Torn ACLStatus: Out for season\n\nKendrick tore his ACL on the first day of training camp, a devastating blow for the third-year cornerback.

However, the Rams' training camp has gotten off to a rough start. Three starting offensive linemen have been hurt.\n\nMore news: Cardinals Defensive Standout Out For Season With Torn ACL\n\nThe Rams announced that starting left guard Jonah Johnson suffered a shoulder injury, and would be considered day-to-day going forward. Joining him on the IR is starting left tackle Alaric Jackson, who suffered an ankle injury, and starting right tackle Rob Havenstein is also down with an ankle injury.\n\nAdam Schefter of ESN shared the news of the Rams' bad luck on his X account, and longtime Rams beat writer Jourdan Rodrigue of The Athletic also shared more details on the statues of the injured offensive linemen.\n\nAccording to Rodrigue, Alaric, Jonah, and Havenstein are all considered to be \"week-to-week\" right now. Training camp has only just begun, and losing three starters on the offensive line is sure to derail the plans head coach Sean McVay had to get his team started off on the right foot.\n\nThe bigger issue relating to these injuries is what the team will do if their injuries keep these players out for some of the regular season. The offensive line will need to be in top shape to protect quarterback Matthew Stafford.\n\nStafford just agreed to a one-year restructured deal to remain with the Rams, but his future with the team could be in jeopardy should he suffer another injury.\n\nStafford has dealt with several ailments in the past two seasons, which began in 2022 when he received offseason elbow surgery. He would also suffer a concussion in Week 9, resulting in his having to miss two games.\n\nThe injuries would not stop for Stafford, who sprained his UCL in Week 8 and would be sidelined until Week 11. Stafford is now 36 and though he is as resilient as they come, his age could be a huge factor regarding his recent string of injuries.\n\nMore news: New Star Lions Defender Unsure If He'll Be Ready for Week 1\n\nThe offensive line for the Rams will need to hold strong to keep him off the turf, but that will be increasingly difficult with the team facing a reality where they are down three starting offensive linemen.\n\nThe good news is these injuries are not season-ending, but a week-to-week status does not inspire the utmost confidence in their availability short-term.

They wrapped up their time at Loyola Marymount with their final practice on Saturday afternoon and will now return to Cal Lutheran for the next couple of weeks until their Woodland Hills facility is ready.\n\nDespite missing several key players due to injury, the Rams still had a productive and encouraging two weeks at Loyola Marymount for camp. Here are eight players who really helped themselves in practice with the regular season approaching, raising their stock and increasing their chances of not only making the team, but contributing in 2024.\n\nDT Braden Fiske\n\nKirby Lee-USA TODAY Sports\n\nSean McVay was asked after the Rams' final training camp practice which players stood out the most at Loyola Marymount, and the first name out of his mouth was Fiske's. The rookie defensive tackle has been outstanding all offseason, consistently wreaking havoc on the Rams offense with his ability to generate pressure and also make stops in the run game.\n\nThere was little question about whether he would be a starter in Week 1 but he's cemented his place in the lineup after a standout camp.\n\nCB Cobie Durant\n\nKirby Lee-USA TODAY Sports\n\nDurant looks like he's in line to be one of the Rams' top three cornerbacks to start the season, which means he'll be playing a good portion of the defensive snaps. His emergence in the slot and as an outside corner gives Chris Shula options, and also allows the Rams to keep Quentin Lake at safety rather than pigeonholing him to the slot out of necessity.\n\nDurant has repeatedly been a standout player in the eyes of McVay and Shula this summer.\n\nTE Colby Parkinson\n\nJayne Kamin-Oncea-USA TODAY Sports\n\nParkinson is making the Rams look very wise for signing him in free agency with Tyler Higbee still on the shelf. He's stood out in practice in a big way (quite literally), making impressive catches and helping in the run game as a blocker. He and Davis Allen have done such a good job that Matthew Stafford said the Rams' tight end group is as deep and talented as he he's had since coming into the NFL in 2009.\n\nWR Tyler Johnson\n\nKiyoshi Mio-USA TODAY Sports\n\nJohnson is making a strong case to land a spot on the 53-man roster this year as the Rams' fourth or fifth receiver. He should be safe as the No. 6 option, assuming the Rams go six deep, but he's contending for meaningful snaps behind the starters. He's someone McVay has been \"really impressed\" by, calling him \"one of the bright spots\" of the offseason so far.\n\nTutu Atwell and Jordan Whittington are also in the mix, but Johnson is in his second year with the Rams and seems to be getting more and more comfortable by the day.\n\nOLB Byron Young\n\nKirby Lee-USA TODAY Sports\n\nYoung has made big strides in Year 2, according to McVay, which bodes well for the defense as a whole. He's going to be one of the Rams' two starting edge rushers, likely alongside Jared Verse, and he'll be looking to build on an eight-sack rookie campaign in 2023.\n\nYoung bulked up this season, adding nearly 10 pounds to his frame, yet he still feels just as fast as he was, so that could be a dangerous combination for the second-year edge rusher.\n\nS Kamren Curl\n\n(Photo by Kevork Djansezian/Getty Images)\n\nCurl has exceeded all expectations already in practice, and the Rams had high hopes for him when he was signed in free agency. He's been a playmaker in the secondary, someone just about every coach has raved about consistently all summer. He's creating turnovers, breaking up passes and is active against the run, showing why he's going to be such an important piece for the Rams in 2024. He should be an upgrade over Jordan Fuller, who was still a quality starter for the last four years.\n\nWR Jordan Whittington\n\nJayne Kamin-Oncea-USA TODAY Sports\n\nWhittington is a sixth-round rookie who is looking to secure a spot on the 53-man roster, and his performance in camp puts him an on inside track to making the team. He's gotten first-team reps, earned high praise from coaches for his work ethic and has caught the attention of Cooper Kupp, who called him \"pretty special.\" Whittington won't have the type of impact that Nacua had as a rookie last season, but he has a chance to play meaningful reps this year.\n\nDB Quentin Lake\n\nKirby Lee-USA TODAY Sports\n\nLake was always going to be a starter somewhere in the secondary, it was just a matter of which position fit him best. It appears he'll play more of a traditional safety role this year after being the nickel defender last season, while also giving him opportunities to come down and cover the slot at times, too.\n\nLake has performed well in practice this offseason and even held his own in one-on-one matchups with Kupp, showing the type of versatility he possesses.", "source": {"uri": "theramswire.usatoday.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Rams Wire"}, "authors": [{"uri": "cameron_dasilva@theramswire.usatoday.com", "name": "Cameron DaSilva", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Loyola_Marymount_Lions", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Loyola Marymount Lions"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los_Angeles_Rams", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles Rams"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Training_camp", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Training camp"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Defensive_tackle", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Defensive tackle"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cornerback", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Cornerback"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sean_McVay", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Sean McVay"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/California_Lutheran_University", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "California Lutheran University"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rookie", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Rookie"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Woodland_Hills,_Los_Angeles", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Woodland Hills, Los Angeles"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Woodland Hills, Los Angeles"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Davis_Allen_(American_football)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Davis Allen (American football)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quentin_Lake", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Quentin Lake"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cobie_Durant", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Cobie Durant"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chris_Shula", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Chris Shula"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tutu_Atwell", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Tutu Atwell"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colby_Parkinson", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Colby Parkinson"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reception_(gridiron_football)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Reception (gridiron football)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tyler_Higbee", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Tyler Higbee"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matthew_Stafford", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Matthew Stafford"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_agent", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Free agent"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wide_receiver", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Wide receiver"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Byron_Young_(American_football,_born_1998)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Byron Young (American football, born 1998)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jared_Verse", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Jared Verse"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kamren_Curl", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Kamren Curl"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jordan_Fuller", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Jordan Fuller"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cooper_Kupp", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Cooper Kupp"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Defensive_back", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Defensive back"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linebacker", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Linebacker"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Advice", "label": "dmoz/Society/Advice", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Job-Related", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Job-Related", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 99}], "image": "https://theramswire.usatoday.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/64/2024/08/USATSI_23877002.jpg?w=640", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9788821", "eventUri": "eng-9788821", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.09019607843137245, "wgt": 141, "relevance": 1}

NFL fans might have to wait a few weeks before seeing Nacua in action again. Following an injury in training camp, Nacua will likely miss some time during the preseason. NFL insider Adam Schefter reported that Nacua is \"week-to-week after suffering a knee injury this weekend that one source described as 'not serious'\".\n\nInjuries have been a minor issue for Nacua dating back to his time in college. Nacua dealt with a few injuries at Washington before transferring to BYU. At BYU, Nacua missed the season opener in 2021 due to injury. In 2022, Nacua suffered a sprained ankle in the season opener at USF that sidelined him for a handful of games that season. Some NFL fans have wondered how a talent like Nacua fell to the fifth round in the NFL Draft, and injuries is the most likely answer. When he was available, Nacua was absolutely dynamic for BYU. His availability, or lack thereof, in college limited his draft stock the most.\n\nNacua was recently named to the NFL top 100, coming in at no. 33.

Several starters have gone down and missed time already, including Puka Nacua, Jonah Jackson and Darious Williams.\n\nThe list of injuries keeps growing by the day, unfortunately, and it's becoming difficult to keep track all of the injured players on the Rams' roster. With a month until Week 1, the Rams do have time for most of these players to return, so they don't want to rush anyone back and risk further injury.\n\nHere's the latest on every injured Rams player.\n\nWR Puka Nacua\n\n(Photo by Kevork Djansezian/Getty Images)\n\nInjury: Knee\n\nStatus: Week-to-week\n\nNacua injured his knee on an attempted catch in the end zone during the Rams' practice against the Chargers. He was unable to return and a day later, Adam Schefter reported that Nacua's injury is \"not serious,\" but he's considered week-to-week.\n\nDT Braden Fiske\n\nKirby Lee-USA TODAY Sports\n\nInjury: Foot blister\n\nStatus: Day-to-day\n\nThe Rams are being cautious with their rookie defensive tackle, who has a blister \"the size of his foot.\" That doesn't sound fun at all, so Fiske could be sidelined for a few days while that heals.\n\nRT Rob Havenstein\n\nJayne Kamin-Oncea-USA TODAY Sports\n\nInjury: Ankle\n\nStatus: Week-to-week\n\nHavenstein is the most recent lineman to go down with an injury, suffering an ankle injury last week in practice. He's considered week-to-week and the Rams won't rush their veteran right tackle back too quickly.\n\nLT Alaric Jackson\n\nDarren Yamashita-USA TODAY Sports\n\nInjury: Ankle\n\nStatus: Week-to-week\n\nJackson went from being day-to-day to week-to-week, which wasn't exactly encouraging to hear. Like Havenstein, they're not going to rush Jackson back from his ankle injury with a month until the regular season starts.\n\nLG Jonah Jackson\n\nJunfu Han / USA TODAY NETWORK\n\nInjury: Bruised scapula\n\nStatus: Out about 6 weeks\n\nJackson's shoulder injury is the most concerning of the three linemen who are banged up. He's expected to miss around six weeks, which could put him in danger of missing the start of the regular season.\n\nCB Darious Williams\n\nKirby Lee-USA TODAY Sports\n\nInjury: Strained hamstring\n\nStatus: Week-to-week\n\nWilliams injured his hamstring on the second day of practice but he has yet to return. He's week-to-week but will hopefully return soon and get some valuable reps in with his new teammates in the secondary.\n\nCB Derion Kendrick\n\nKirby Lee-USA TODAY Sports\n\nInjury: Torn ACL\n\nStatus: Out for season\n\nKendrick tore his ACL on the first day of training camp, a devastating blow for the third-year cornerback. He's officially out for the season after being placed on IR.\n\nTE Tyler Higbee\n\nDavid Reginek-USA TODAY Sports\n\nInjury: Torn ACL and MCL\n\nStatus: On PUP list\n\nHigbee is still on the PUP list with no timetable for return.

Left tackle Alaric Jackson was also downgraded by McVay from \"day to day\" to \"week to week\" with an ankle injury, and left guard Jonah Jackson is also week to week with a shoulder injury.\n\nMcVay clarified that he did not expect Havenstein's injury to be season-ending. While there is no set timeline for any of their return, team sources seemed optimistic that none of these starters would miss significant time into the regular season (though could miss some).\n\n\"Sixth man\" offensive lineman Joe Noteboom can and has been playing left tackle in Alaric Jackson's place, while multiple players have rotated at left guard and right tackle. Warren McClendon will get snaps at right tackle when the Rams have joint practice against the Chargers in El Segundo, Calif., on Sunday morning. Noteboom could eventually move to left guard or right tackle, depending on the injury timelines for the regular starters.\n\n\"We're gonna learn about some guys,\" said McVay, \"it's a rolodex of guys in there right now even with that first group. I think it's only going to force those guys to mature and accelerate their learning process.\"\n\nThe Rams invested heavily into their offensive line in free agency this spring, placing Alaric Jackson on a one-year tender (he is a former undrafted free agent so was eligible) and signing guards Jonah Jackson and Kevin Dotson to three-year deals.\n\nThey also moved second-year lineman Steve Avila from left guard to center. Avila played some center in college at TCU, but has spent the entire spring and summer to this point building chemistry with veteran quarterback Matthew Stafford, and has not moved from his new role.\n\nWhere the coaching staff may not have previously considered switching Avila back to guard, after yet another injury update on Saturday, McVay sounded more open to the possibility.\n\n\"I think what we have to be able to plan for are some of the unforeseen things,\" he said, \"God forbid if -- whether it's a Kevin Dotson, or however long Jonah is out -- if we deem that whoever can plug in at center gives us a better opportunity for (Avila) to play at guard, then that's what we will do. We will find the best five.\n\n\"He has gotten a bunch of reps (at center).

Cooper Kupp led the Los Angeles Rams to a championship during the 2021-22 campaign, seizing the wide receiver triple crown, Offensive Player of the Year award and Super Bowl 56 MVP honors. His body has not been the same since.\n\nKupp has played in just 22 games over the last two years, enduring ankle and hamstring injuries that prevented him from maintaining his elite level of play. He is still a high-level pass-catcher, to be sure, but it is difficult to envision the 31-year-old becoming \"The Guy\" again. He is not even the most discussed receiver on his own team anymore, as Puka Nacua dazzled football fans with his historic rookie season.\n\nBut No. 10 is no background dancer. He remains a prominent piece of the Rams' offense whom head coach Sean McVay heavily relies upon to make things happen on the field. A healthy Kupp is LA's most optimal path back towards another Super Bowl. Fortunately for the team and fan base, he is looking sharp at training camp.\n\nMoreover, the former All-Pro is playing like a man with something to prove to himself. \"He's on an absolute mission,\" a source close to Kupp told ESPN. \"He was deeply affected about not being out there for parts of last year.\"\n\nRams look to benefit from a healthy and dialed in Kupp\n\nAn extremely motivated Cooper Kupp spells trouble for defesnive coordinators around the league. While no one can predict how the veteran's health will hold up as the season progresses, starting off on the right note at camp could be an indicator that he is ready to reestablish himself as a premier weapon.\n\nThe identity of this Rams team is inextricably linked to their passing attack, and with quarterback Matthew Stafford displaying excellent chemistry with both Kupp and Nacua, fans have every reason to believe that LA is capable of doing something special once again.\n\nKupp may not be able to attain his 2021-22 form, but maybe he can help his franchise reach the same heights it did during that time.", "source": {"uri": "clutchpoints.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "ClutchPoints"}, "authors": [{"uri": "alex_house@clutchpoints.com", "name": "Alex House", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los_Angeles_Rams", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles Rams"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cooper_Kupp", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Cooper Kupp"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Super_Bowl_Most_Valuable_Player_Award", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Super Bowl Most Valuable Player Award"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wide_receiver", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Wide receiver"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Super_Bowl", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Super Bowl"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Track_and_field", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Track and field"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Puka_Nacua", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Puka Nacua"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sean_McVay", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Sean McVay"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rookie", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Rookie"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Head_coach", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Head coach"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_football", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "American football"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matthew_Stafford", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Matthew Stafford"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/All-Pro", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "All-Pro"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quarterback", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Quarterback"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ESPN", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "ESPN"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los_Angeles", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Ten-Pin", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Ten-Pin", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Instructors", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Instructors", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Agriculture_and_Forestry/Cooperatives", "label": "dmoz/Business/Agriculture and Forestry/Cooperatives", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Cooperatives", "label": "dmoz/Business/Cooperatives", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 72}], "image": "https://wp.clutchpoints.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/Rams-news-Why-Cooper-Kupp-is-on-an-absolute-mission-in-2024.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9788821", "eventUri": "eng-9788821", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1450980392156862, "wgt": 115, "relevance": 1}

The Rams' starters won't be playing but it's an all-important game for backups and reserves as they battle for positioning on the depth chart and roster spots.\n\nWith training camp in the rearview mirror and the preseason upon us, it's time for another 53-man roster projection. Some positions are harder to project than others and there are always some surprise cuts and selections, but this is our best guess as to who might make the Rams' initial regular-season roster.\n\nQuarterback (2)\n\nJayne Kamin-Oncea-USA TODAY Sports\n\nMatthew Stafford\n\nStetson Bennett\n\nBennett is clearly situated behind Jimmy Garoppolo as the No. 3 quarterback, but he'll be the backup for the first two weeks while Garoppolo serves his two-game suspension. Therefore, Garoppolo won't count toward the 53-man roster initially.\n\nRunning back (4)\n\nKiyoshi Mio-USA TODAY Sports\n\nKyren Williams\n\nBlake Corum\n\nRonnie Rivers\n\nBoston Scott\n\nThere hasn't been much said about the Rams' running backs beyond Williams and Corum, who have both been impressive in practice. Rivers seemingly has the best chance to be the No. 3 running back, while Scott's value on special teams also gives him an edge. Zach Evans needs a strong showing in the preseason.\n\nWide receiver (6)\n\n(Photo by Kevork Djansezian/Getty Images)\n\nCooper Kupp\n\nPuka Nacua\n\nDemarcus Robinson\n\nTutu Atwell\n\nJordan Whittington\n\nTyler Johnson\n\nIt appears the top six is pretty much set at wide receiver, though Xavier Smith has made some noise in practice, too. With his speed and return skills, he could be a sleeper to make the 53-man roster if he stands out in the preseason.\n\nThis is a group that's as deep as the Rams have had, according to Sean McVay.\n\nTight end (3)\n\nKirby Lee-USA TODAY Sports\n\nColby Parkinson\n\nDavis Allen\n\nHunter Long\n\nNo movement here. The Rams have their top three tight ends set already with Tyler Higbee still out and it's unlikely to change before Week 1. Parkinson, Allen and Long have all reportedly had strong showings in training camp.\n\nOffensive tackle (4)\n\nJayne Kamin-Oncea-USA TODAY Sports\n\nAlaric Jackson\n\nRob Havenstein\n\nJoe Noteboom\n\nWarren McClendon Jr.\n\nI considered putting A.J. Arcuri in this group because of the injuries Havenstein and Jackson have suffered, but the Rams are entrusting Noteboom and McClendon as their backup tackles. There could still be room for Arcuri, but that's TBD.\n\nGuard (4)\n\nMark J. Rebilas-USA TODAY Sports\n\nJonah Jackson\n\nKevin Dotson\n\nZachary Thomas\n\nKT Leveston\n\nI went up from three to four guards in this projection because, well, the Rams just need more offensive line depth. Jackson is out for several weeks, which will give Thomas an opportunity to prove himself again, potentially as the backup left guard. He's gotten first-team reps and appears ahead of Leveston on the depth chart.\n\nCenter (2)\n\nKiyoshi Mio-USA TODAY Sports\n\nSteve Avila\n\nBeaux Limmer\n\nAvila is the only starting lineman who hasn't missed any time this summer (knock on wood) so we haven't had to see anyone replace him in the lineup. Limmer has a lot of upside as a rookie but will need to beat out Mike McAllister in the preseason.\n\nDefensive line (5)\n\nKiyoshi Mio-USA TODAY Sports\n\nKobie Turner\n\nBobby Brown III\n\nBraden Fiske\n\nTyler Davis\n\nDesjuan Johnson\n\nHow deep will the Rams go on the defensive line? They aren't exactly rich with talent at this position beyond the three projected starters, but Davis is a run-stopping rookie at nose tackle and someone the Rams will need to back up Brown. Johnson is more of a defensive tackle who can help provide depth behind Turner and Fiske.\n\nEdge rusher (6)\n\n(Photo by Kevork Djansezian/Getty Images)\n\nByron Young\n\nJared Verse\n\nMichael Hoecht\n\nBrennan Jackson\n\nNick Hampton\n\nOchaun Mathis\n\nThe preseason will be very important for Hampton and Mathis, who are both fighting for reps at outside linebacker. Fortunately for them, there isn't a lot of pressure coming from behind them with only Keir Thomas and Zach VanValkenburg lower on the depth chart.\n\nInside linebacker (3)\n\nVincent Carchietta-USA TODAY Sports\n\nErnest Jones\n\nChristian Rozeboom\n\nJacob Hummel\n\nThree inside linebackers may not be enough for the Rams but they're not a team that deploys many players at this position anyway. Troy Reeder could make the roster as a special teams player so don't be surprised if Los Angeles does go with four linebackers initially.\n\nCornerback (6)\n\nKirby Lee-USA TODAY Sports\n\nDarious Williams\n\nTre'Davious White\n\nCobie Durant\n\nTre Tomlinson\n\nJerry Jacobs\n\nCharles Woods\n\nWoods has reportedly stood out in practice lately, making a positive impact on defense. Given White's injury history and Williams' current absence, the Rams could use some depth at cornerback. Six feels like a good number, especially with Quentin Lake and Russ Yeast's position versatility.\n\nSafety (5)\n\n(Photo by Kevork Djansezian/Getty Images)\n\nKamren Curl\n\nQuentin Lake\n\nJohn Johnson III\n\nRuss Yeast\n\nKamren Kinchens\n\nCurl and Lake are separating themselves as the two starting safeties, with Johnson, Yeast and Kinchens backing them up.

That means we won't see Matthew Stafford, Cooper Kupp or Kobie Turner on the field when the Rams play their three preseason games, giving key backups an opportunity to prove themselves before Week 1.\n\nThere are close position battles happening on both sides of the ball as players jockey for playing time and a spot on the 53-man roster. Looking ahead to the preseason, which begins for the Rams on Sunday when they host the Cowboys, these nine players have the most to prove in these exhibition games.\n\n1 QB Stetson Bennett\n\nJayne Kamin-Oncea-USA TODAY Sports\n\nBennett didn't exactly light it up in the preseason last year and ended up leaving the Rams for the entire 2023 season, so he has a ton to prove this summer - maybe more than any other player. There's added pressure on Bennett, too, because Jimmy Garoppolo is suspended for the first two weeks of the season, so Bennett has a chance to be the No. 2 quarterback in Weeks 1 and 2.\n\nNot only does Bennett need to play well for his own confidence and standing on the depth chart, but the Rams need him to show he can be a legitimate backup until Garoppolo returns.\n\n2 RB Zach Evans\n\nJayne Kamin-Oncea-USA TODAY Sports\n\nKyren Williams and Blake Corum are going to be the top two running backs in Los Angeles, followed by Ronnie Rivers, most likely. Then there's Boston Scott and Evans, who are battling to make the Rams' 53-man roster. Scott has an advantage because of his return skills, but Evans seemingly has more upside as a pure running back.\n\nAfter failing to gain the trust of the coaching staff last season when Williams and Rivers were out injured, Evans will try to remain on the Rams' roster by doing the little things this year.\n\n3 OL Logan Bruss\n\nJayne Kamin-Oncea-USA TODAY Sports\n\nBruss was a third-round pick in 2021 and after missing his rookie year with a knee injury, he failed to make the 53-man roster last year. Bruss has gotten buried on the depth chart in Year 3, even with all of the injuries the Rams have suffered along the offensive line.\n\nWhether it's as a backup tackle or guard, Bruss is trying to do anything he can to make the team. That won't be easy, especially after the Rams drafted KT Leveston and Beaux Limmer this year. This is a critically important three-game preseason for Bruss and his NFL future.\n\n4 LT A.J. Arcuri\n\nKirby Lee-USA TODAY Sports\n\nArcuri is behind Alaric Jackson and Joe Noteboom at left tackle, so even with the former injured, Arcuri isn't in line to play any snaps as long as Noteboom is healthy. He's a former seventh-round pick, which isn't enough to secure him a roster spot in 2024, meaning he has a lot of work to do in the preseason.\n\n5 DL Larrell Murchison\n\n(Photo by Ronald Martinez/Getty Images)\n\nThere are some questions on the Rams' defensive line after the top three starters, which opens the door for someone like Murchison to emerge as a key backup. He's hung around in the last year-plus with the Rams, clinging to a roster spot last year. He has yet to carve out a meaningful role for himself but he's a versatile defender who can play multiple positions, which might come in handy for the Rams and Chris Shula.\n\n6 OLB Ochaun Mathis\n\nMark J. Rebilas-USA TODAY Sports\n\nMathis is competing with Nick Hampton, Keir Thomas and Zach VanValkenburg for a roster spot and playing time, but he hasn't exactly stood out in training camp the way Jared Verse, Byron Young, Michael Hoecht and Brennan Jackson have. He has some juice as a pass rusher but he needs to show up a bit more this preseason if he wants to stick around on the 53-man roster.\n\n7 CB Tre Tomlinson\n\nKirby Lee-USA TODAY Sports\n\nTomlinson was one of the standout players of camp last year and he'll try to rekindle that magic this summer. He has an even better chance to make the 53-man roster with Derion Kendrick on the shelf, so there's an opening for him to be the fourth or fifth corner on the depth chart.\n\nAs a rookie last season, Tomlinson was a bit overaggressive at times in coverage but if he's learned from that, he could be improved in Year 2.\n\n8 S Jason Taylor II\n\nKirby Lee-USA TODAY Sports\n\nTaylor's stock took a hit when the Rams brought back John Johnson, adding yet another safety to an already-crowded position group. With how deep the Rams are at safety, Taylor might need to earn a spot on the roster by playing special teams, which he'll certainly get a chance to do this preseason.\n\nAssuming Quentin Lake, Kamren Curl and Johnson don't play in the preseason, Taylor could be in line for a lot of snaps.\n\n9 K Joshua Karty\n\nD. Ross Cameron-USA TODAY Sports\n\nKarty was deadly accurate in college but the preseason will be his first taste of kicking in the NFL - not that it's terribly different. He has to hold off Tanner Brown for the Rams' kicker spot this summer and it's likely that both guys will get opportunities to kick field goals this preseason.\n\nKarty should be the Rams' kicker this season but that's no guarantee.", "source": {"uri": "theramswire.usatoday.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Rams Wire"}, "authors": [{"uri": "cameron_dasilva@theramswire.usatoday.com", "name":

And after watching it in action, it seems Sean McVay still doesn't know how he feels about the play.\n\nThe Rams held a joint practice with the Chargers on Sunday, and after the two teams left the field, McVay was asked to give his thoughts on the new kickoff rule. It seems he's not completely sold on it just yet.\n\n\"It just feels weird,\" McVay said, via quotes distributed by the team. \"It doesn't look like anything that has been anything I've been familiar with football.\"\n\nUnder the new rule, 21 of the 22 players on the field for the play will be lined up in the return team's territory. Of the 11 players on the kicking team, 10 of them will have to have their foot on the return team's 40-yard line while the kicker will be allowed to hang back at his own 35 where he'll be kicking off from.\n\nAs for the return team, it has a 5-yard setup zone that runs from its own 30 to its 35-yard line. Seven players from the receiving team must have their foot on the 35-yard line. The receiving team can also have two more players who are in the setup zone, but who aren't touching the 35-yard line. Those two players will be lined up outside the hashes. The receiving team can put one or two returners back to field the football, but if they decide to utilize just one returner, then the extra player has to line up in the set-up zone between the 30- and 35-yard line.\n\nHere's what the new kickoff looked like in the Hall of Fame game on Aug. 1:\n\nMcVay understands that the NFL is trying to cut down on collisions on kickoffs, but he still thinks the play is weird.\n\n\"I know the intent is right,\" McVay said. \"We'll try to figure it out. I know everybody that's been involved in that has their intentions in the right place, but it's a very foreign-looking play. However we feel about it, we have to be able to adjust and make sure that we adapt and it can be something that's an advantage to us.\"\n\nThe Rams head coach also said it was nice to practice the new kickoff rule against another team because that means his team can now start to look to make \"adjustments.\"\n\n\"It's one thing to work it against each other, but when you see it against some other teams, there will be a lot that we can really dive into with the film,\" McVay said.\n\nAfter practicing it in training camp, the Rams will finally get to use the new rule in an actual game in less than a week. Los Angeles will be opening up its preseason on Aug. 11 with a home game against the Dallas Cowboys.", "source": {"uri": "cbssports.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "CBS Sports"}, "authors": [{"uri": "john_breech@cbssports.com", "name": "John Breech", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los_Angeles_Rams", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles Rams"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sean_McVay", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Sean McVay"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_football", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "American football"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Placekicker", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Placekicker"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pro_Football_Hall_of_Fame", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Pro Football Hall of Fame"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dallas_Cowboys", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Dallas Cowboys"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Head_coach", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Head coach"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los_Angeles", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Paintball/Teams", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Paintball/Teams", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Football/American", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Football/American", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Instructors", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Instructors", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Airsoft/Teams", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Airsoft/Teams", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 81}], "image": "https://sportshub.cbsistatic.com/i/r/2024/07/31/2ac9af73-e43c-400b-b815-82e10d7c4e00/thumbnail/1200x675/8a4f2750d1b155c7c8c66c716bdbbbad/gettyimages-1243055104-1.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9788821", "eventUri": "eng-9788821", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-08-01", "textStart": 1566, "textEnd": 1572}, {"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-08-11", "textStart": 2539, "textEnd": 2546}], "sentiment": 0.04313725490196085, "wgt": 111, "relevance": 1}

I know the intent is right. We'll try to figure it out. I know everybody that's been involved in that has their intentions in the right place but it's a very foreign-looking play. However we feel about it, we have to be able to adjust and make sure that we adapt and it can be something that's an advantage to us.\"\n\nMcVay added that he and the coaching staff will continue to look at ways to make sure the execution of the play can benefit the team.\n\n\"I think we also need to probably have some fluidity with it if there are adjustments as we go,\" McVay said. \"When you see it against some other teams... it's one thing to work it against each other but when you see it against some other teams, there will be a lot that we can really dive into with the film. That's what I mean by interesting.\"\n\nThe Rams will get their first chance to see the new kickoff in game action during Sunday's preseason matchup with the Cowboys. But as other coaches have said, McVay isn't anticipating that teams will show much from the new kickoffs until the games count. That's part of why the joint practices are valuable.\n\n\"This was a good opportunity to really get familiar with it in terms of just seeing it against another opponent in a little bit more of a controlled setting,\" McVay said. \"There's a lot of work to be done. I think that'll continue on as we get closer and closer to the opener. I don't believe that the preseason is going to give us an indication of what this play looks like because I think a lot of teams that have some schematic things, they're not going to show it just like we wouldn't as well.\"", "source": {"uri": "nbcsports.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "NBC Sports"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los_Angeles_Rams", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles Rams"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sean_McVay", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Sean McVay"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pro_Football_Hall_of_Fame", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Pro Football Hall of Fame"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Head_coach", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Head coach"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_football", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "American football"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Useless_Pages", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Useless Pages", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Interactive", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Interactive", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Advice", "label": "dmoz/Society/Advice", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 84}], "image": "https://nbcsports.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/c6c75a8/2147483647/strip/true/crop/4014x2258+0+0/resize/1440x810!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fnbc-sports-production-nbc-sports.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2Fbe%2Fbd%2Fab9281f84337b2130295fc48c954%2Fhttps-delivery-gettyimages.com%2Fdownloads%2F2164858857", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9788821", "eventUri": "eng-9788821", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.2156862745098038, "wgt": 101, "relevance": 1}

The Cowboys have even taken it upon themselves to work in a joint practice or two with either the Chargers or Rams in recent years (and even the Raiders, back when they were in town).\n\nBoth of those traditions are set to continue this week as the Cowboys will host the Rams at camp on Thursday, then make the 65-mile drive to SoFi Stadium to play a preseason game against them on Sunday.\n\nAfter weeks of practicing against their own teammates, players getting to finally square off against opponents in a different uniform generally causes tempers to flare. Things got nasty on consecutive days just this week, for example, between the Giants and Lions practicing together in East Rutherford, with several marquee players throwing punches.\n\nBut Cowboys head coach Mike McCarthy explained that he's not interested in similar extracurricular activity when the Rams come to Oxnard for their work session.\n\n\"It's a waste of time,\" McCarthy said Tuesday during his pre-practice press conference. \"I don't want guys fighting. That's not toughness; it's lack of discipline. We want the work to get to that emotional edge, to push each other, but you've got to handle those spots. That's all part of the emotional challenge in the game of football.\"\n\nHe's delivered the same message in years past, but it hasn't necessarily worked in keeping players' fists to themselves.\n\nA quick scuffle between then-Cowboys guard Connor Williams and Rams All-Pro Aaron Donald marred their last joint practice in 2021. And a 2015 joint practice was famously shut down early by coaches Jason Garrett and Jeff Fisher after an all-out brawl erupted and spread into a viewing area packed with fans.\n\nMcCarthy expects things to run much smoother on Thursday; he says he and Rams coach Sean McVay discussed the topic earlier in the spring when the session was first scheduled.\n\nBut that doesn't mean there won't a little extra pop- for both teams- when the pads go on against actual opponents.\n\nBecause there always is.\n\n\"There's no concern, but we want to have a hell of a practice. That's why we're working together,\" McCarthy said. \"I think the work Thursday will be great.\"", "source": {"uri": "sports.yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo Sports"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los_Angeles_Rams", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles Rams"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mike_McCarthy", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Mike McCarthy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SoFi_Stadium", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "SoFi Stadium"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Head_coach", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Head coach"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oxnard,_California", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Oxnard, California"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Oxnard, California"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/East_Rutherford,_New_Jersey", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "East Rutherford, New Jersey"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "East Rutherford, New Jersey"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guard_(gridiron_football)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Guard (gridiron football)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sean_McVay", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Sean McVay"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aaron_Donald", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Aaron Donald"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jeff_Fisher", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Jeff Fisher"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/All-Pro", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "All-Pro"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jason_Garrett", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Jason Garrett"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_football", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "American football"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Instructors", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Instructors", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Paper_and_Pencil/Tic-Tac-Toe", "label": "dmoz/Games/Paper and Pencil/Tic-Tac-Toe", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 84}], "image": "https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/DNXLh3Nrj5kGKPxt0jF1Ug--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyMDA7aD04ODE7Y2Y9d2VicA--/https://media.zenfs.com/en/dallas_cowboys_wire_usa_today_sports_articles_693/1ad37837a314eabb2f125c48449d4822", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9788821", "eventUri": "eng-9788821", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.02745098039215688, "wgt": 99, "relevance": 1}

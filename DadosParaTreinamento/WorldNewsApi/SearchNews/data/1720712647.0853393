A 2023 report by The Hague Centre for Strategic Studies, a defence and security think tank based in the Netherlands, lists graphite as a critical mineral whose supply chain is under threat. The report said European militaries need graphite for fighter aircraft, battle tanks, submarines, artillery and ammunition. Boulanger says it\u2019s \u201cunusual\u201d in recent history for governments to openly declare they are investing in a mine for defensive purposes. Teresa Kramarz, co-director of the University of Toronto\u2019s Environmental Governance Lab, says she isn\u2019t surprised about the Department of Defence funding, adding that North American and European governments are investing heavily in critical minerals like graphite in order to be less dependent on Chinese exports. She says it\u2019s part of a policy of establishing trade relationships with allies to secure supplies. China is far and away the leader in graphite production. In 2022 Canada was ranked sixth, mining about one per cent of global production; China was at 66 per cent, according to Natural Resources Canada. In a statement, Natural Resources Canada said the funding doesn\u2019t mean Lomiko Metals will have to give the Canadian and U.S. governments privileged access to the material produced. But Boulanger said he would be \u201cvery surprised\u201d if the governments of Canada and the U.S. aren\u2019t in discussions with the company about securing its graphite. Whatever the graphite is used for, Kramarz says people living near mines fear that the operations will displace ecosystems and lead surrounding communities to be economically dependent on them. As well, she said, residents fear being displaced themselves when land is cleared for mines. \u201cPeople need to have serious say in what happens in their communities,\u201d she said. \u201cThose are the rules of democracy.\u201d", "summary": "The Pentagon said Lomiko Metals' graphite will be used for \"defence applications\" \u2014 words that make those who live near the site of the Quebec mine uneasy.", "url": "https://montrealgazette.com/news/local-news/laurentian-residents-against-graphite-mine-fear-powering-pentagon-environmental-ruin", "image": "https://smartcdn.gprod.postmedia.digital/montrealgazette/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/que-graphite-mine-20240609.jpg", "video": "https://cdn.jwplayer.com/videos/nlrhKyJ3-SZnIQkEn.mp4", "publish_date": "2024-06-09 16:14:22", "author": "The Canadian Press", "authors": ["The Canadian Press"], "language": "en", "catgory": "politics", "source_country": "ca", "sentiment": 0.006}

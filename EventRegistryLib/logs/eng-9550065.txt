The nine Florida hospitals will be auctioned off on July 30.\n\nSteward, based in Dallas, operates hospitals in eight states.\n\nWhen Steward announced its bankruptcy filing, the company and Massachusetts officials both said they do not expect any interruptions in day-to-day operations.\n\nSteward has been subject of a year-and-a-half-long CBS News investigation. Records reviewed by CBS News showed Steward hospitals nationwide have unpaid bills. As a result, hospitals risked a shortage of potentially lifesaving supplies.\n\nMassachusetts Gov.

In December, they signed a new three-year contract with the hospital.\n\nSteward's eight hospitals in Massachusetts include St. Elizabeth's Hospital and Carney Hospital, both in Boston. It filed for protection in the U.S. Bankruptcy Court for the Southern District of Texas.\n\nMassachusetts Attorney General Andrea Campbell said Wednesday she is pushing for the creation of a Patient Care Ombudsman to advocate for patients and employees throughout the bankruptcy process. She also said she has the authority to review any proposed sale under her office's antitrust powers.\n\n\"The office has authority to review any proposed sale, and we would do so in order to best protect access to a competitive and affordable healthcare marketplace,\" she said in a written statement. \"If we find violations of the law, we will address them.\"\n\nSteward's troubles in Massachusetts have drawn the ire of political figures including U.S. Sens. Elizabeth Warren and Edward Markey, who have said the company's previous private equity owners \"sold (Steward) for parts\" and \"walked away with hundreds of millions of dollars.\"\n\nMassachusetts Gov. Maura Healey said Monday that the state had been preparing for a possible bankruptcy filing. Despite the filing, she said, Steward hospitals will remain open and patients should keep their appointments.\n\n\"This situation stems from and is rooted in greed, mismanagement and lack of transparency on the part of Steward leadership in Dallas, Texas,\" Healey said Monday. \"It's a situation that should never have happened and we'll be working together to take steps to make sure this never happens again.\"\n\nSteward said it is finalizing the terms of \"debtor-in-possession financing\" from its landlord Medical Properties Trust for initial funding of $75 million and \"up to an additional $225 million upon the satisfaction of certain conditions.\"\n\n\"Steward Health Care has done everything in its power to operate successfully in a highly challenging health care environment,\" Dr. Ralph de la Torre, CEO of Steward said in a news release.\n\nHe pointed in part to what he described as insufficient reimbursement by government payers as a result of decreasing rates at a time of skyrocketing costs.\n\nTorre said that by seeking bankruptcy protections, Steward will be better positioned to \"responsibly transition ownership of its Massachusetts-based hospitals.\"\n\nIn March, the company announced it had struck a deal to sell its nationwide physician network to Optum, a subsidiary of UnitedHealth Group, as it works to stabilize its finances.\n\nHave an interesting story?

But we don't want to see any of these communities fail to be served.\"\n\nThe privately-owned company closed a hospital in Massachusetts earlier this year, and officials in that state have criticized Steward's management and its former private equity owners for making short-sighted financial decisions that undermined patients' care. Massachusetts officials in particular criticized a series of transactions that sold off the company's real estate and saddled it with long-term rent costs at its hospitals.\n\nIn court documents filed before the hearing, Steward said it had over $9 billion in total liabilities, including $1.2 billion in loans, $6.6 billion in long-term rent obligations, nearly $1 billion in unpaid bills from medical vendors and suppliers, and $290 million in unpaid employee wages and benefits.\n\nSchrock said Steward has real value, despite carrying a $9 billion debt load. The company had $6 billion in annual revenue before filing for bankruptcy, and it has been pursuing a sale of its physician group, Stewardship Health Care, to UnitedHealth subsidiary Optum Care for an amount that would repay the company's loans and allow it to pay some of its vendors, Schrock said.\n\nSteward had hoped to use the proceeds of that sale to avoid bankruptcy. But stalled regulatory approvals forced the company to seek short-term emergency financing that did not give Steward enough cash to continue operations for long, Schrock said.\n\n\"It never really stabilized the company,\" Schrock said. \"The company was always very close to running out of cash.\"\n\nAt Tuesday's hearing, Lopez allowed Steward to borrow $75 million from Medical Properties Trust, which owns the real estate where Steward's hospitals are located and is owed $6.6 billion on leases that run until 2041. Steward hopes to borrow an additional $225 million from Medical Properties Trust later in its bankruptcy.\n\nSteward is putting all of its hospitals up for sale. It intends to hold auctions on June 28 auction for its hospitals outside of Florida and July 30 for its nine hospitals in Florida. Schrock said those timelines were negotiated as part of the new $75 million bankruptcy loan, and that Steward would seek more time to sell its hospitals if necessary.\n\n\"What we don't want to do is have a fire sale of the assets,\" Schrock said. \"There is a lot of value here.\"\n\n(Reporting by Dietrich Knauth, Editing by Alexia Garamfalvi and Michael Ernab)", "source": {"uri": "ca.finance.yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo!

The company operates eight Bay State hospitals and has been sinking under a pile of debt to vendors and its de facto landlord. It has also been feeling the pressure from Massachusetts officials who are focused on making sure Bay Staters have appropriate access to care and that Steward's floundering does not worsen the capacity crunch at Massachusetts hospitals.\n\nJudge Christopher Lopez of the U.S. Bankruptcy Court for the Southern District of Texas held a hearing on initial motions related to Steward's bankruptcy Tuesday, primarily requests from Steward to pay certain bills or meet specific obligations while its more than 100,000 creditors scramble to try to ensure they will be paid. Among the motions was one to authorize (but not require) Steward to pay wages, salaries, employee benefits, expenses, and other compensation while the bankruptcy case moves ahead. Lopez said he was comfortable with the request and approved it after the hearing in the absence of objections from creditors.\n\n\"This case feels different. It's real patients who are showing up at the hospital like right now and I want them to feel comfortable that the physician that they are going to see, that there are nothing in the back of their mind other than their treatment and the care that they're going to receive. I have no doubt the physicians would do their best and would honor their duties,\" the judge said. \"But I'm going to make sure that any concerns are taken off the table, especially when the folks with the money on the line have not objected to this relief.\"\n\nAn attorney for Steward told the court that the company pays approximately $150 million a month in employee wages, mostly in arrears. And as of Monday, Steward owed approximately $68 million for accrued, but unpaid, wages that had already been earned. As of February, there were 9,753 employees on Steward's payroll in Massachusetts and 6,405 licensed independent practitioners working within Steward hospitals, the state said.\n\nMassachusetts state government was represented at Tuesday's hearing by Andrew Troop, a lawyer who leads the Insolvency & Restructuring Practice Group in the New York office of Pillsbury Winthrop Shaw Pittman. The Amherst College graduate previously represented Massachusetts and other states in the Chapter 11 bankruptcy of Purdue Pharma and has served on the board for Greater Boston Legal Services for more than a decade.\n\n\"Health care cases, as everyone has acknowledged, are not your typical cases. This is not an issue for someone in a manufacturing job,\" Troop said in support for the wages motion Tuesday. \"On this one, your honor, making sure that the people who provide critical care services leave today confident that their base pay is going to be paid in tomorrow's payroll is both the right thing to do [and] well within your authority and power to execute on.\"\n\nHe added, \"Vendors are waiting for the outcome of this hearing. Patients are waiting for the outcome of this hearing.\"\n\nSteward operates eight hospitals in Massachusetts: St. Elizabeth's in Brighton, Carney Hospital in Dorchester, Good Samaritan Medical Center in Brockton, Holy Family Hospital in Methuen and Haverhill Hospital in Haverhill, Morton Hospital in Taunton, Nashoba Valley Medical Center in Ayer, Norwood Hospital (which is closed as it undergoes restoration work) and St. Anne's in Fall River.\n\nGov. Maura Healey and other state leaders have said they want to see Steward exit the Massachusetts health care world but Healey's Health and Human Services Secretary Kate Walsh has also noted that due to the company's debt and lease arrangements, \"People can't figure out what they're buying.\"\n\nOne state filing in bankruptcy court said the state's objective is to get \"results where Steward no longer operates hospitals in Massachusetts.\"\n\nSteward has been working for months to find other operators interested in buying its hospitals. Ray Schrock, Steward's lawyer from the firm Weil, Gotshal & Manges, told the court Tuesday that Steward faces a June 25 deadline to auction its hospitals in Massachusetts and other states except for Florida under the terms of a $75 million loan the company got from its landlord. But he also said that timeline isn't likely to be satisfied.\n\n\"We'll see how the timing goes. We'll see whether or not this is revisited. We're going to keep our word and do everything we can to meet it. But I'm here to tell you now, you can't close these hospital sales on the timeline of likely into June. It's not feasible, OK? It's not something that I can sit here and say that you can do it without violating state law. So we'll have to work with parties.\"\n\nSchrock said Steward's \"sales strategy is the foundation of these cases, it's going to be critical to maximizing recoveries\" for creditors, but that the company does not want to \"fire sale the assets.\"\n\n\"I know that [landlord Medical Properties Trust] has a strong desire to get ... new tenants in here. But we want to proceed deliberately and we don't want to pursue a value-minimizing strategy,\" he said.\n\nBecause MPT owns the land that Steward's for-sale hospitals sit on, Schrock said he expects there will be \"tension between MPT and some of the stakeholders in these cases that we're just going to have to work through.\"\n\n\"MPT, listen, they're here to maximize the real estate value and maximize the value of their claims. That's their job. The other stakeholders are looking at the sale processes and say, 'Listen, there's an operational value that's really the crux of these hospitals and these operations.' And how you sort between the operational value of a hospital and the real estate value of a hospital, I'll just say people could logically debate,\" Schrock said. He added, \"How you get that value between the [operating company] and the lease is something that's going to have to be resolved.\"\n\nSince Steward's financial troubles came to the surface earlier this year, the Department of Public Health has conducted regular monitoring visits to all Steward hospitals, wanting to ensure the facilities continued to comply with state laws and regulations.\n\n\"Based on the findings of the Department's monitoring, it has become clear that Steward's fiscal challenges have already presented patient safety and health challenges, which to date have been isolated, and DPH has been able to detect and remediate quickly. These challenges include maintaining the physical premises (e.g., fire safety equipment) as well as critical supplies and equipment,\" DPH Commissioner Robbie Goldstein wrote in a filing. \"For the most part, the cause of any issues the monitors have identified is lack of funding made available to the hospitals from the Steward corporate level.\"\n\nMassachusetts' filings in bankruptcy court shed a more detailed light on the financial problems at Steward.\n\nSince 2022, there have been at least 21 lawsuits filed by vendors and staff against Steward and/or its Massachusetts hospitals for alleged nonpayment of more than $60 million, the state said. In November, Goldstein said, DPH learned that Steward's hospitals here owed a collective $540,908.16 to UMass Chan Medical School's New England Newborn Screening Program for newborn screening tests performed from January 2022 to September 2023. As of April 30, Steward had accrued additional debt related to this program for a total balance of $766,691.99.\n\nOn Jan. 9, DPH found out that Good Samaritan Medical Center in Brockton owes $1.2 million to Brockton Hospital for nurses that Brockton Hospital provided on loan. Brockton Hospital also told the state that it was providing products, like sterile surgical drapes, to other Steward hospitals in Massachusetts.\n\nAnd late last month, one \"critical vendor\" got in touch with DPH and Health and Human Services Secretary Walsh about an outstanding debt owed by Steward and threatened to cease servicing its equipment unless Steward made a cash payment by May 1. (The state's filing does not indicate whether that payment was made).\n\n\"Steward enters bankruptcy with its hospitals in Massachusetts compromised by fiscal and operational mismanagement, the nature and scale of which it actively concealed from both the government and the public. Steward created an untenable situation by over-leveraging its hospitals and imposing exorbitant and unsustainable rental obligations on each hospital. It is now clear that not long after creating this situation, hospital operations could not bear the excessive rent costs, Steward could not service the debt it had incurred, and Steward started to shirk its obligations to pay vendors and suppliers. All the while, Steward continued to enrich its investors and management,\" the state wrote in a brief. \"Instead of advancing a global solution to stabilize its financial situation, Steward pivoted to a plan to sell its physician network to pay off its landlords and senior lenders, to whom Steward had leveraged all available accounts receivable and, in effect, given nearly exclusive control over the survival of Steward's Massachusetts Hospitals.\"", "source": {"uri": "nbcboston.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "NBC Boston"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

But we don't want to see any of these communities fail to be served.\"\n\nIn court filings, Steward disclosed that it has $9 billion in liabilities, including $1.2 billion in loans, $6.6 billion in rent obligations, $1 billion owed to medical vendors and suppliers, and $290 million in unpaid employee wages and benefits.\n\nThe company plans to hold auctions on June 28 for its hospitals outside of Florida, according to court filings. The deadline was negotiated as part of a $75 million bankruptcy loan, but Schrock said Steward may seek more time to sell its hospitals if necessary.\n\n\"What we don't want to do is have a fire sale of the assets,\" Schrock told the judge, according to published reports. \"There is a lot of value here.\"\n\nSteward, the largest private for-profit hospital chain in the country, operates 31 hospitals across eight states -- including Holy Family Hospital in Methuen and Haverhill -- and employs more than 30,000 people, according to its website.\n\nThe company also operated New England Sinai Hospital in Stoughton, which closed in April, leaving behind millions of dollars in unpaid rent and fees.\n\nSteward's management has cited an increase in operating costs and insufficient federal government-program reimbursement among the factors leading to the Chapter 11 bankruptcy filing.\n\nGov. Maura Healey has blamed \"greed and mismanagement by Steward's management, and says the bankruptcy process will increase transparency in the company's hospital system.\n\nHealey has stressed that medical care will continue at the Steward hospitals throughout the bankruptcy proceedings and that patients won't go without medical care.\n\n\"Ultimately, this is a step toward our goal to getting Steward out of Massachusetts, and it allows us to do that to protect access to care, preserve jobs, and stabilize our health care system,\" she told reporters at a Tuesday briefing on the company's bankruptcy filing.\n\nThe Healey administration has activated an \"emergency operations plan\" in response to Steward's financial woes, including a command center to monitor the company's hospitals in the state and manage the fallout of a bankruptcy filing.\n\nIn a court fling ahead of Tuesday's bankruptcy hearing in Texas, Attorney General Andrea Campbell argued that Steward \"extracted value\" from its Massachusetts hospitals to \"pay substantial dividends to investors and expand their network in other states.\"\n\n\"These diversions have threatened to impact the debtors' hospitals' ability to provide health care within the commonwealth,\" she wrote. \"The debtors' hospitals have been left without adequate resources to timely acquire and maintain needed equipment and infrastructure or even ensure an uninterrupted supply of emergency room drugs. Many are in disrepair.\"\n\nHealey and members of the state's congressional delegation, including Sen. Elizabeth Warren, have criticized the private equity firm Cerberus Capital Management's role in Steward's finances. Cerberus created Steward after buying St. Elizabeth's and five other Catholic hospitals in Massachusetts in 2010, according to the company's website.\n\nIn a statement, the company's Chief Executive Officer, Ralph de la Torre, said the bankruptcy proceeding will ensure that the company is \"better positioned to responsibly transition ownership of its Massachusetts-based hospitals, keep all of its hospitals open to treat patients, and ensure the continued care and service of our patients and our communities.\"\n\nMaterial from the Associated Press was used in this report.

We've got people here who recognize that we need to work with the communities to do the right thing,\" Schrock assured the court. \"Our goal remains that there are zero hospitals closed on our watch.\"\n\nIts lawyers told the court that Steward Healthcare owes $6.6 billion on their future rent obligations, that they've stiffed hundreds of vendors on over $1 billion in unpaid invoices, that they owe another $1.2 billion to their lenders, and a quarter million in unpaid wages and benefits to their employees.\n\nDespite this, Schrock started his address to the court by claiming the company and its CEO have been unfairly targeted with public criticism, and that only one side of the story has been shared.\n\nThe company got its start in 2010 by buying six \"struggling\" Massachusetts hospitals in a $895 million deal approved by then Attorney General Martha Coakley as \"good for the health-care landscape in general.\"\n\nCaritas Christi Health Care CEO Dr. Ralph de la Torre, now the CEO of Steward, told the Herald in 2010 that the sale would benefit \"our patients, employees and pensioners and tremendously benefits the communities.\"\n\nHis company's bankruptcy attorney said the years following that purchase saw exponential growth and expansion into other states. Schrock seemed to indicate it grew too fast and that attempts to sell properties and turn a profit were stalled by regulations.\n\nBefore things went south, the company was making $6 billion in annual revenue, Schrock said.\n\n\"It is an impressive company, it provides care to millions of people. Certainly Dr. de la Torre and as well as Steward have been taking a lot of flak, and frankly taking a lot of punches in the press over the last several months,\" Schrock said. \"You only hear half of the story.\"\n\nSteward currently operates eight hospitals in seven Massachusetts cities and towns. Negotiations for a $75 million loan the company has secured as part of the bankruptcy process also include plans to sell those hospitals, along with properties in several other states. The company's properties outside of Florida are scheduled for auction on June 28, and the remaining nine facilities in Florida will go up for sale two days later, though Schrock told the court those dates may change.\n\nA Department of Public Health spokesperson told the Herald that it's too soon to say precisely how the bankruptcy proceedings or the sale of those hospitals will affect services in the Bay State, but stressed the situation will be closely monitored by state officials.\n\n\"Steward has committed to a responsible transition of its Massachusetts hospitals. The Healey-Driscoll administration continues to collaborate and coordinate with health care leaders across the state to ensure the stability of our health care system, especially in areas where Steward operates. Working across government, with health care leaders, and external advisors, we continue planning for the best way to provide in-patient care, behavioral health care, maternity care, and much needed primary and specialty outpatient services in each region where Steward operates,\" the spokesperson said.\n\nFall River Mayor Paul Coogan said St. Anne's Hospital, the Steward facility in his city, has already seen interest from prospective buyers. It's a busy hospital, Coogan said, and he thinks it turns enough of a profit that it isn't in danger of closing.\n\nIf the hospital did close its doors, it would be \"devastating to Fall River,\" the mayor said.\n\n\"The jobs, the tax revenue, the services to our citizens -- It's been there a long, long time. It's a key piece of the south end of the city and they serve a ton of people,\" Coogan said.\n\nTaunton Mayor Shaunna O'Connell said her city's Morton Hospital is \"is integral to the health and well-being of our residents and we will work with all of our stakeholders to ensure it remains open\" and that, as the bankruptcy process plays out, the most important take away is that Steward Hospitals are still seeing patients.\n\n\"While the announcement that Steward had filed for bankruptcy was not surprising, it is of great concern to the City of Taunton. However, the Chapter 11 Bankruptcy filing by Steward allows for the reorganization and restructuring process to ensure our hospitals remain open to our communities,\" she told the Herald in a statement.\n\nOther Steward facilities include St. Elizabeth's Medical Center and Carney Hospital in Boston, Good Samaritan Medical Center in Brockton, Holyoke Hospitals in Haverhill and Methuen, and Nashoba Valley Medical Center in Ayer. The company's Norwood Hospital has been closed since 2020 due to flooding, and the company permanently shuttered New England Sinai Hospital on April 2.", "source": {"uri": "bostonherald.com",

It's real patients who are showing up at the hospital like right now and I want them to feel comfortable that the physician that they are going to see, that there are nothing in the back of their mind other than their treatment and the care that they're going to receive. I have no doubt the physicians would do their best and would honor their duties,\" the judge said. \"But I'm going to make sure that any concerns are taken off the table, especially when the folks with the money on the line have not objected to this relief.\"\n\nAn attorney for Steward told the court that the company pays approximately $150 million a month in employee wages, mostly in arrears.\n\nAnd as of Monday, Steward owed approximately $68 million for accrued, but unpaid, wages that had already been earned.\n\nAs of February, there were 9,753 employees on Steward's payroll in Massachusetts and 6,405 licensed independent practitioners working within Steward hospitals, the state said.\n\nMassachusetts state government was represented at Tuesday's hearing by Andrew Troop, a lawyer who leads the Insolvency & Restructuring Practice Group in the New York office of Pillsbury Winthrop Shaw Pittman.\n\nThe Amherst College graduate previously represented Massachusetts and other states in the Chapter 11 bankruptcy of Purdue Pharma and has served on the board for Greater Boston Legal Services for more than a decade.\n\n\"Health care cases, as everyone has acknowledged, are not your typical cases. This is not an issue for someone in a manufacturing job,\" Troop said in support for the wages motion Tuesday. \"On this one, your honor, making sure that the people who provide critical care services leave today confident that their base pay is going to be paid in tomorrow's payroll is both the right thing to do [and] well within your authority and power to execute on.\"\n\nHe added, \"Vendors are waiting for the outcome of this hearing. Patients are waiting for the outcome of this hearing.\"\n\nSteward operates eight hospitals in Massachusetts: St. Elizabeth's in Brighton, Carney Hospital in Dorchester, Good Samaritan Medical Center in Brockton, Holy Family Hospital in Methuen and Haverhill Hospital in Haverhill, Morton Hospital in Taunton, Nashoba Valley Medical Center in Ayer, Norwood Hospital (which is closed as it undergoes restoration work) and St. Anne's in Fall River.\n\nGov. Maura Healey and other state leaders have said they want to see Steward exit the Massachusetts health care world but Healey's Health and Human Services Secretary Kate Walsh has also noted that due to the company's debt and lease arrangements, \"People can't figure out what they're buying.\"\n\nOne state filing in bankruptcy court said the state's objective is to get \"results where Steward no longer operates hospitals in Massachusetts.\"\n\nSteward has been working for months to find other operators interested in buying its hospitals.\n\nRay Schrock, Steward's lawyer from the firm Weil, Gotshal & Manges, told the court Tuesday that Steward faces a June 25 deadline to auction its hospitals in Massachusetts and other states except for Florida under the terms of a $75 million loan the company got from its landlord. But he also said that timeline isn't likely to be satisfied.\n\n\"We'll see how the timing goes. We'll see whether or not this is revisited. We're going to keep our word and do everything we can to meet it. But I'm here to tell you now, you can't close these hospital sales on the timeline of likely into June. It's not feasible, OK? It's not something that I can sit here and say that you can do it without violating state law. So we'll have to work with parties.\"\n\nSchrock said Steward's \"sales strategy is the foundation of these cases, it's going to be critical to maximizing recoveries\" for creditors, but that the company does not want to \"fire sale the assets.\"\n\n\"I know that [landlord Medical Properties Trust] has a strong desire to get ... new tenants in here. But we want to proceed deliberately and we don't want to pursue a value-minimizing strategy,\" he said.\n\nBecause MPT owns the land that Steward's for-sale hospitals sit on, Schrock said he expects there will be \"tension between MPT and some of the stakeholders in these cases that we're just going to have to work through.\"\n\n\"MPT, listen, they're here to maximize the real estate value and maximize the value of their claims. That's their job. The other stakeholders are looking at the sale processes and say, 'Listen, there's an operational value that's really the crux of these hospitals and these operations.' And how you sort between the operational value of a hospital and the real estate value of a hospital, I'll just say people could logically debate,\" Schrock said. He added, \"How you get that value between the [operating company] and the lease is something that's going to have to be resolved.\"\n\nSince Steward's financial troubles came to the surface earlier this year, the Department of Public Health has conducted regular monitoring visits to all Steward hospitals, wanting to ensure the facilities continued to comply with state laws and regulations.\n\n\"Based on the findings of the Department's monitoring, it has become clear that Steward's fiscal challenges have already presented patient safety and health challenges, which to date have been isolated, and DPH has been able to detect and remediate quickly. These challenges include maintaining the physical premises (e.g., fire safety equipment) as well as critical supplies and equipment,\" DPH Commissioner Robbie Goldstein wrote in a filing. \"For the most part, the cause of any issues the monitors have identified is lack of funding made available to the hospitals from the Steward corporate level.\"\n\nMassachusetts' filings in bankruptcy court shed a more detailed light on the financial problems at Steward.\n\nSince 2022, there have been at least 21 lawsuits filed by vendors and staff against Steward and/or its Massachusetts hospitals for alleged nonpayment of more than $60 million, the state said. In November, Goldstein said, DPH learned that Steward's hospitals here owed a collective $540,908.16 to UMass Chan Medical School's New England Newborn Screening Program for newborn screening tests performed from January 2022 to September 2023. As of April 30, Steward had accrued additional debt related to this program for a total balance of $766,691.99.\n\nOn Jan. 9, DPH found out that Good Samaritan Medical Center in Brockton owes $1.2 million to Brockton Hospital for nurses that Brockton Hospital provided on loan. Brockton Hospital also told the state that it was providing products, like sterile surgical drapes, to other Steward hospitals in Massachusetts.\n\nAnd late last month, one \"critical vendor\" got in touch with DPH and Health and Human Services Secretary Walsh about an outstanding debt owed by Steward and threatened to cease servicing its equipment unless Steward made a cash payment by May 1. (The state's filing does not indicate whether that payment was made).\n\n\"Steward enters bankruptcy with its hospitals in Massachusetts compromised by fiscal and operational mismanagement, the nature and scale of which it actively concealed from both the government and the public. Steward created an untenable situation by over-leveraging its hospitals and imposing exorbitant and unsustainable rental obligations on each hospital. It is now clear that not long after creating this situation, hospital operations could not bear the excessive rent costs, Steward could not service the debt it had incurred, and Steward started to shirk its obligations to pay vendors and suppliers. All the while, Steward continued to enrich its investors and management,\" the state wrote in a brief.\n\n\"Instead of advancing a global solution to stabilize its financial situation, Steward pivoted to a plan to sell its physician network to pay off its landlords and senior lenders, to whom Steward had leveraged all available accounts receivable and, in effect, given nearly exclusive control over the survival of Steward's Massachusetts Hospitals,\" the state wrote.", "source": {"uri": "masslive.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "MassLive"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

Although its financial problems have been building for years and spiraled into a crisis last year after falling behind on hundreds of millions of dollars in rent and payments to suppliers, Steward could run out of money to operate its hospitals as soon as the week of June 14, the company disclosed in its bankruptcy filing Monday. It received a court-approved $75 million loan this week, but the company said it would need additional backing to continue operating.\n\nOnly days into its bankruptcy proceeding, Steward is already under the gun. The company's lawyer on Tuesday warned the federal judge overseeing the bankruptcy that a deadline to sell the Massachusetts hospitals by late June may be unfeasible. The aggressive timeline was a condition of a $75 million loan Steward will receive while it reorganizes its debts.\n\nA spokeperson for Steward did not respond to a request for comment.\n\nIn Massachusetts, Steward's hospitals include St. Elizabeth's Medical Center in Brighton, Carney Hospital in Dorchester, Good Samaritan in Brockton, Holy Family in Methuen and Haverhill, Morton Hospital in Taunton, Nashoba Valley in Ayer, and Saint Anne's in Fall River. It also runs Norwood Hospital, which has been closed since 2020 due to flooding.\n\nSteward has hired multiple investment banks to sell different groups of hospitals; its two hospitals in the northern part of the state, for example are being marketed by one bank, while another is handling the hospitals in the southern tier.\n\nIn its own filing, Steward said it has heard from multiple potential buyers for some of its Massachusetts hospitals, but not for those in the northern part of the state, which are struggling financially.\n\nThe company has \"received indications of interest from multiple potential buyers for its southern Massachusetts, Arizona, and Texas hospital operations,\" Steward said.\n\nBut as to its northern Massachusetts facilities, the company said only that it was \"in discussions with various third parties interested in operating the company's hospitals ... as well as with state officials and regulators to facilitate the transition of such hospitals to new operators.\"\n\nThe company has said it owes more than $9 billion to various creditors including escalating rent payments over the coming years. In its filing, the attorney general said rent payments on the eight Massachusetts hospital alone amount to $110 million a year.\n\nThe hospital real estate is owned by Medical Properties Trust, which bought them from Steward in 2016 and leases them back to the system. That ownership picture could further complicate a speedy sale of the hospitals, as some bidders may want to buy MPT's real estate holdings as part of any deal. That could lead to fight with other Steward creditors about the distribution of proceeds from the sales.\n\nAt health care systems across eastern Massachusetts, hospital leaders are struggling with whether to bid for Steward's hospitals, said Marc Bard, president of mB2, a national health care consultant based in Holderness, N.H. Bard advised Steward in its early days but said he no longer works with the company.\n\n\"At some level, it's a business decision,\" he said. \"But at some level, it's a moral decision. The dilemma for all the health care systems in Massachusetts is to what degree do they take responsibility for patients in their area who need care and whether that could detract from their primary mission of running their own hospitals. It's an awful dilemma.\"\n\nWhatever they do, both patients and medical staff will almost certainly end up at nearby hospitals if Steward's hospitals reduce types of patient care or shutter operations, Bard said. The question is whether other hospitals will have enough beds and resources to accommodate more patients, he said.\n\nSome hospitals in areas where Steward operates are already seeing an increase in patients.\n\nDr. Abha Agrawal, chief executive of Lawrence General Hospital, said the volume of patients in its emergency room has ticked up 13 percent over the past two months.\n\nShe attributed the increase partly to uncertainty over the future of Steward-operated Holy Family Hospital, which has campuses in Haverhill and Methuen, and partly to a new accelerated care unit Lawrence General recently opened to triage acute care patients.\n\nOn Monday, the day Steward filed for bankruptcy, Agrawal said Lawrence General activated its internal incident command center. She also reached out to Dr. Gregg Meyer, who runs the state Department of Public Health's new command center, to ask how they could work together to assure patient access to care.\n\n\"It is important for a community like Lawrence, and other communities in the Merrimack Valley, that the health care should be delivered locally,\" Agrawal said. \"For many of our residents, there are cultural issues, there are transportation issues.\"\n\nAgrawal declined to comment whether Lawrence General might bid for Holy Family. But she noted that while her hospital accommodates 65,000 to 70,000 patients annually in its emergency department, Holy Family also gets roughly 65,000 emergency room visits a year at its two sites.\n\nSimilarly, about 1,400 babies are delivered each year at Lawrence General, and about 1,100 at Holy Family, she said.\n\n\"The real issue is having the staff and the supplies to make sure hospitals can manage an additional influx of patients,\" Agrawal said. \"We need a solution for maintaining capacity for local access to care.\"\n\nCampbell's filings also shed some new light on the state's investigations into patient care at Steward hospitals.\n\nAmong the information disclosed in the document were details of the state's inquiry into the death of a new mother who died last year at Steward's St. Elizabeth's Medical Center. Medical equipment that could have been used to treat her emergency had been repossessed by a vendor for nonpayment, the state found. The Globe first reported the incident in February.", "source": {"uri": "bostonglobe.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Boston Globe"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

However, he said they never stabilized the company, and Steward was \"always very close to running out of cash.\"\n\nThe Dallas-based for-profit had hoped to sell its physician group, Stewardship Health, to UnitedHealth subsidiary Optum Care to settle some debts. The two companies began discussing terms in December 2023 and had hoped to close the deal by March.\n\nProceeds from the Stewardship sale would have been \"more than enough\" to pay off Steward's asset-based and bridge loans, and possibly keep Steward out of bankruptcy court, according to Shrock. However, he said the deal \"got held up in regulatory approval.\"\n\nMassachusetts regulators disagree with that characterization and say Steward is to blame for hold up. Steward filed notice of intent to complete the deal 43 days ago. However, since then it hasn't given the state key paperwork, according to Mickey O'Neill, communications director for the Massachusetts Health Policy Commission.\n\n\"In situations in which the HPC timely receives all necessary documents and information to review a Material Change Notice, a timeline of a month and a half is not unheard of,\" said O'Neill over email. \"In this case, however, the HPC has not received the single most important document for its review: the definitive agreement.\"\n\nU.S. Bankruptcy Judge Chris Lopez approved Medical Properties Trust's $75 million loan to Steward during the hearing, which will be used to fund its operations during the Chapter 11 proceedings. MPT owns the real estate where Steward's 31 hospitals are located, and Steward also owes MPT $6.6 billion on leases running through 2041.\n\nSteward had a consortium of lenders prior to declaring bankruptcy, but now MPT will be its only DIP financier.\n\nThe operator wanted MPT as its sole partner after other lenders pressured Steward to issue Worker Adjustment and Retraining Notification Act notices, which precede either site closures or mass layoffs.\n\nSchrock told the court it would be irresponsible to issue such notices.\n\n\"We couldn't think of a more destabilizing event,\" he said. \"We don't think there's going to be any closures.\"\n\nMPT's financing comes with hefty strings attached. To secure an additional $225 million of funding later, Steward will have to sell hospitals beginning in June and finish sales by July.\n\nSteward began marketing hospitals in January, according to Schrock. However, Steward has not finalized any sales.\n\nThe transactions are likely to be complex.\n\n\"Some of the hospitals are very profitable, and some of them are not,\" Schrock said. \"We're trying to sell all of these hospitals ... and conducting a massive M&A process like this, we need to get it done efficiently. We need to get it done fast, but we also need to do it safely.\"\n\nThe attorney said he was unhappy with the agreed upon timeline but called it necessary for financing. He warned the court that it was unlikely Steward would reach its targets.\n\n\"We're going to keep our word and do everything we can to meet it, but I'm here to tell you now, you can't close these hospital sales,\" Shrock said. \"The timeline of likely into June is not feasible, okay? That's not something I can sit here and say that you can do it without violating state law.\"\n\nThe hospital sales are a key issue to watch going forward as lenders vie for priority status to get paid.\n\nAttorney Kris Hansen, who represented the asset-based lenders, pushed back on tying hospital sales to DIP financing and accused MPT of trying to ensure it gets paid first before all other lenders.\n\n\"This is an absolute land grab by MPT, Your Honor.

The most recent citation involved a patient who died while waiting to be transferred, according to state officials. In a hearing at the Louisiana Legislature in April, former staff members described searching the hospital for basic, essential supplies mid-procedure and watching the repossession of everything from beds to coffee pots following nonpayment to vendors.\n\nIn the hearing and a press release following the filing, Steward representatives said they do not expect interruptions in day-to-day operations.\n\nIn a statement, CEO Ralph de la Torre said the bankruptcy filing allowed Steward to \"be better positioned to ... keep all of its hospitals open to treat patients, and ensure the continued care and service of our patients and our communities.\"\n\nThe statement blamed insufficient reimbursements from Medicare and Medicaid alongside rising labor costs and financial stress from the pandemic as the driving reasons behind the bankruptcy.\n\nThe sale\n\nBids for Glenwood are due by June 25, with an auction on June 28, according to documents presented by Steward's lawyers during a hearing Tuesday in federal bankruptcy court in Houston.\n\nMarketing for Glenwood began in January and is being handled by the Cain Brothers, a New York-based investment banking firm.\n\nIn April, the interim CEO of Glenwood, Jonathan Turton, said the hospital had entered into \"casual conversations\" with other facilities, including nearby St. Francis Medical Center, owned by Franciscan Missionaries of Our Lady Health System, Willis Knighton Health in Shreveport, and Ochsner LSU Health in Shreveport, in the event that the hospital was shut down by the state due to the lack of staff and supplies.\n\nSteward is $9 billion in debt, according to court documents, which it hopes to pay down with the sale of all 31 hospitals.\n\nSteward has faced criticism from public officials, particularly in Massachusetts, where it owns nine hospitals. In Louisiana, lawmakers at an April 9 hearing blasted Glenwood's parent company for what they said was negligence that injured patients.\n\nSteward's landlord\n\nComplicating the sale is Steward's landlord, Medical Properties Trust, a Birmingham-based real estate investment trust that Steward sold its hospital buildings and land to in 2016 and 2017. Medical Properties Trust leases the hospitals, including Glenwood, back to Steward. That makes a sale more difficult, Rep. Michael Echols, R-Monroe, said. Steward has not maintained Glenwood, and the staff and services have been gutted, he said.\n\n\"The only thing that has value is the physical asset, which they don't own,\" said Echols. \"That's where I think Medical Properties Trust should be coming to the table with other stakeholders to look at either a sale or lease back.\"\n\nSteward may also retain some of its hospitals, according to hearing documents, which said Steward is marketing all hospitals while also \"exploring a reorganization around a smaller footprint of hospitals.\"\n\nEchols said West Monroe residents don't want Glenwood to be one of them. The hospital belongs in the hands of an operator that is \"stable and reliable.\"\n\n\"Getting Steward out of the community as quickly as possible is what our constituents want,\" he said.", "source":

Steward does not expect any interruptions in its day-to-day operations, which will continue in the ordinary course throughout the Chapter 11 process. Steward's hospitals, medical centers and physician's offices are open and continuing to serve patients and the broader community and its commitment to employees will not change, the company said.\n\n\"Steward Health Care has done everything in its power to operate successfully in a highly challenging health care environment. Filing for Chapter 11 restructuring is in the best interests of our patients, physicians, employees, and communities at this time,\" said Dr. Ralph de la Torre, Chief Executive Officer of Steward. \"In the past several months we have secured bridge financing and progressed the sale of our Stewardship Health business in order to help stabilize operations at all of our hospitals. With the delay in closing of the Stewardship Health transaction, Steward was forced to seek alternative methods of bridging its operations. With the additional financing in this process, we are confident that we will keep hospitals open, supplied, and operating so that our care of our patients and our employees is maintained. By working collaboratively with stakeholders in this court-supervised controlled environment, and having the benefit of our earlier strategic efforts, Steward will be better positioned to responsibly transition ownership of its Massachusetts-based hospitals, keep all of its hospitals open to treat patients, and ensure the continued care and service of our patients and our communities.\"\n\n\"Odessa Regional Medical Center and Scenic Mountain Medical Center have served this region for almost 50 years. Our hospitals and clinics remain open and ready to take care of our patients, both locally and in the surrounding region. We appreciate your patience as we work through this process\" said Stacey Brown, President of both local hospitals.\n\nThe other primary factor driving this voluntary Chapter 11 case is, in large part, due to Steward continuing to face challenges created by insufficient reimbursement by government payors as a result of decreasing reimbursement rates while at the same time facing skyrocketing labor costs, increased material and operational costs because of inflation, and the continued impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic. It is Steward's goal to resolve the Chapter 11 process as quickly as possible, with the help of the court, with a view to the long-term and sustainable financial health of the system, the company said in a statement.", "source": {"uri": "yourbasin.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yourbasin"}, "authors": [{"uri": "erica_miller@yourbasin.com", "name": "Erica Miller", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chapter_11,_Title_11,_United_States_Code", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Chapter 11, Title 11, United States Code"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Odessa,_Texas", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Odessa, Texas"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Odessa, Texas"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_Properties_Trust", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Medical Properties Trust"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steward_Health_Care_System", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Steward Health Care System"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/KPEJ-TV", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "KPEJ-TV"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/KMID_(TV)", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "KMID (TV)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Debtor-in-possession_financing", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Debtor-in-possession financing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_bankruptcy_court", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States bankruptcy court"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health_system", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Health system"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bankruptcy", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Bankruptcy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_Spring,_Texas", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Big Spring, Texas"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Big Spring, Texas"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Texas", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Texas"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Texas"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bridge_loan", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Bridge loan"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health_care", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Health care"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physician", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Physician"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chief_executive_officer", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Chief executive officer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Impact_of_the_COVID-19_pandemic_on_sports", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on sports"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brown_University", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Brown University"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inflation", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Inflation"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Health/Medicine", "label": "dmoz/Health/Medicine", "wgt": 33}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Medicine/Facilities", "label": "dmoz/Health/Medicine/Facilities", "wgt": 40}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Education", "label": "dmoz/Health/Education", "wgt": 26}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Philanthropy/Medical_Relief", "label": "dmoz/Society/Philanthropy/Medical Relief", "wgt": 28}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Public_Health_and_Safety/Patient_Safety", "label": "dmoz/Health/Public Health and Safety/Patient Safety", "wgt": 30}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 85}], "image": "https://www.yourbasin.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/78/2020/12/ORMC-Hospital.jpg?strip=1&w=640", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9550065", "eventUri": "eng-9550065", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.6627450980392158, "wgt": 178, "relevance": 1}

He said it, along with its CEO Ralph de la Torre, M.D., has \"been taking a lot of flak, and frankly taking a lot of punches in the press over the last several months\" amid word of its unpaid vendor obligations, $50 million in overdue rent and impending financial implosion.\n\n\"You're only hear[ing] half of the story,\" the lawyer told U.S. Bankruptcy Judge Christopher Lopez early in the full-to-bursting virtual hearing.\n\nSteward has a particularly complex structure with nearly 170 debtors, \"thousands and thousands of vendors\" and a mix of \"very profitable\" and not-so-profitable hospitals, Schrock said. Pre-bankruptcy it claimed about $6 billion in annual revenue but has about $9 billion in total liabilities -- $1.2 billion in loans, $6.6 billion in rent obligations through 2041, almost $1 billion in unpaid vendor bills and $290 million in unpaid wages and benefits.\n\nPer his comments during the hearing and documents filed as part of the bankruptcy, the system plans to begin selling all of its hospitals in phases denoted by their geography: Texas and Arizona hospitals first, Massachusetts, Pennsylvania and Ohio hospitals second and Florida (its \"most profitable\" portion of the portfolio) third. That marketing process kicked off in January and is planned to run through July, though Schrock said there are concerns that a quick timeline is \"not feasible\" and could hamper the facilities' return.\n\n\"We're trying to sell all of these hospitals, but conducting a massive M&A process like this, we need to get it done efficiently, we need to get it done fast -- but we also need to do it faithfully. And we think that there are homes for all of these facilities,\" he said while noting some promising early valuations from potential buyers.\n\nLopez did grant Steward an extended timeline, about two months, to provide the court with a full disclosure of its assets and liabilities.\n\nThe judge also signed off on a $75 million debtor-in-financing arrangement with its landlord, Medical Properties Trust, which could also provide an extra $225 million should the system meet outlined conditions including the tight timeline of hospital selloffs.\n\nSchrock described Medical Properties Trust as a \"steadfast partner\" through the process. Both Steward and Medical Properties Trust, in its own separate statement, have sought to distance the system's rent obligations as a primary factor in its financial stress as opposed to other operational challenges and \"market trends\" like high labor costs, payer mix changes and inflation.\n\nSchrock noted that Steward's operations ran into difficulty last year when it could close a loan that would have paid off some of its debt and other bills \"created a cycle where it was just very difficult [for Steward] to catch up, and was keeping the company in kind of a constant state of extremis. No matter where we were trying to run to or turn to, it was difficult to get up in front of that without a major sale.\"\n\nThe company's largest pending sell-off is the planned divestiture of its physician group to Optum. Discussions began late last year and the deal was made public in late March. The arrangement \"would have been more than enough to settle\" Steward's outstanding loans but has been gummed up in regulatory review, the lawyer said.\n\n\"We're still working through that. It is what it is, ... we've already reached out to the Department of Justice and told them, 'Listen, we're going to be in Chapter 11, we're going to need to move along as quickly as possible.'\"\n\nSchrock reaffirmed statements made by the health system on Monday that its goal \"remains that there are zero hospitals closed on our watch\" over the course of the bankruptcy proceedings. Government officials, particularly those in Massachusetts, have been quick to set up response systems and oversight to keep the company true to its word and prevent service interruptions.\n\nThey were also among the first to critique Schrock's portrayal of Steward as a victim of external financial circumstances. Massachusetts Attorney General Andrea Campbell told the court in a filing that Steward had \"extracted value from Massachusetts,\" had \"over-leveraged its hospitals\" and \"continued to enrich its investors and management\" while putting off its vendor obligations.\n\nThe state's view of Steward's business has been echoed by federal regulators, lawmakers and clinicians alike, many of whom have pointed to the system's prior private equity owner Cerberus Capital Management as the source of its financial distress.\n\nAnother court hearing on the bankruptcy proceedings is scheduled for June 3.", "source": {"uri": "fiercehealthcare.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "FierceHealth"}, "authors": [{"uri": "dave_muoio@fiercehealthcare.com", "name": "Dave Muoio", "type": "author", "isAgency":

There's going to be a change in ownership in many hospitals, we recognise that. But we don't want to see any of these communities fail to be served.\"\n\nCourt documents filed prior to the first hearing disclosed that Steward's existing liabilities include around $6.6bn in long-term rent obligations, $1.2bn in loans, nearly $1bn in unpaid bills from vendors and medical suppliers, as well as $290m in unpaid wages and benefits for employees.\n\nDespite the substantial debt, Schrock emphasised that Steward holds real value, with $6bn in annual revenue prior to the bankruptcy filing.\n\nSchrock highlighted that the company has been negotiating the sale of its physician group, named 'Stewardship Health Care', to Optum Care, a subsidiary of UnitedHealth, which could potentially repay the company's loans and partially settle vendor debts.\n\nStewardship Health Care's sale was initially seen as a way to prevent bankruptcy. However, delays in regulatory approvals led to a need for emergency financing, which Schrock stated was insufficient for sustained operations.\n\nDuring 7 May's hearing, Judge Lopez has approved a $75m loan from Medical Properties Trust, the real estate owner of Steward's hospital locations, which is also a creditor with $6.6bn in lease obligations.\n\nSteward is also planning to auction its hospitals on 28 June for facilities outside Florida and a 30 July auction for its nine Florida hospitals.\n\nThese dates are part of the terms of new bankruptcy loan, and Schrock indicated that the company might request more time for hospital sales, if necessary.\n\n\"Steward Health puts US hospitals for sale after filing bankruptcy \" was originally created and published by Hospital Management, a GlobalData owned brand.", "source": {"uri": "finance.yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo!

Not surprisingly, its hospitals have had to juggle necessary staff and supplies. This act goes back months and in some cases years, causing care to deteriorate.\n\nSteward has a long and sorry record of deception. Governor Maura Healey put it well at her Monday press conference: \"One of the good things about bankruptcy is that Steward and its CEO and its management team will no longer be able to lie.\"\n\nSo you have to wonder why the Healey administration is echoing de la Torre's happy talk. \"I want to be very clear in telling the public that these hospitals will remain open and folks should continue to keep their appointments and seek care as needed, including if you need to see an emergency room,\" the governor said at her Monday press conference.\n\nBut as the Globe's reporting has made clear, as Steward went into a financial tailspin and stopped paying vendors, quality of care has severely suffered. In January, the Globe reported that a new mother, Sungida Rashid, had died at Steward's St. Elizabeth's Hospital last October because, according to hospital staff, a device needed for her emergency surgery had been repossessed due to Steward's failure to pay overdue bills.\n\nHere's the balancing act behind the Healey administration's misleading reassurances. Healey has long said that her goal is to keep the hospitals operating until they can be sold and to prevent a state bailout. Steward's lawyer, Ray Schrock, told the bankruptcy judge Tuesday that the chain hopes to auction off most of its hospitals, including those in Massachusetts, by June 28.\n\nIn the meantime, Healey shares with de la Torre the goal of preventing a financial death spiral in which patients desert Steward hospitals, there is less money coming in from patient bills and insurance claims, and staff layoffs ensue. That would make it even harder for the hospitals to find buyers. It would also put pressure on other nearby hospitals, many of which are already overwhelmed.\n\nThis explains the Healey administration's need for some kind of soft landing (or even a crash landing) and her reassuring words that seem at odds with good medical advice. Despite the governor's reassurance that \"these hospitals will remain open and folks should continue to keep their appointments and seek care as needed,\" I would not seek care there. I'm not sure that the governor would either.\n\nHere's the other problem. Bankruptcy law doesn't protect hospital operations. It protects creditors. Attorney General Andrea Joy Campbell has been granted status at the bankruptcy hearings to represent the interests of the Commonwealth and Steward staff and patients.\n\nShedding debts will help Steward's balance sheet somewhat, but it won't produce enough money to ensure these hospitals provide acceptable medical care. This will increase pressure on Healey to put some taxpayer money into the pot to attract a decent buyer.\n\nThere's a better place to look for the money that these hospitals need. That would be court-mandated restitution from the various players who have looted Steward hospitals for their own enrichment. Those include de la Torre, the partners of Cerberus Capital, who took $1.25 billion out of hospital operations in the 2016 sale-leaseback deal with Medical Properties Trust, as well as MPT executives.\n\nThere are plenty of grounds on which to launch a criminal investigation, including what may be illegal self-dealing and fraudulent conveyance. For the moment, Healey and de la Torre have the same shortterm interest -- keeping Steward hospitals open and finding a buyer. But their interests soon diverge. Healey's is to avoid a state bailout. De la Torre's is to avoid prosecution if any criminal and/or civil charges are filed and hold on to some of his ill-gotten wealth.\n\nMajor restitution could be part of a settlement of a criminal prosecution. Healey is a former attorney general. Though the current AG has been circumspect in her public statements about possible prosecutions, it's hard to believe that a criminal investigation is not already in process.", "source": {"uri": "bostonglobe.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Boston Globe"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bankruptcy", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Bankruptcy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Governor", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Governor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lawyer", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Lawyer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maura_Healey", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Maura Healey"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deception", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Deception"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emergency_department", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Emergency department"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chief_executive_officer", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Chief executive officer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/St._Elizabeth's_Medical_Center_(Boston)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "St. Elizabeth's Medical Center (Boston)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Repossession", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Repossession"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bailout", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Bailout"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Auction", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Auction"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Layoff", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Layoff"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Insurance", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Insurance"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Massachusetts", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Massachusetts"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Massachusetts"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Restitution_and_unjust_enrichment", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Restitution and unjust enrichment"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_Properties_Trust", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Medical Properties Trust"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fraudulent_conveyance", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Fraudulent conveyance"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cerberus_Capital_Management", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Cerberus Capital Management"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leaseback", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Leaseback"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Self-dealing", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Self-dealing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Settlement_(litigation)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Settlement (litigation)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Attorney_General", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "United States Attorney General"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Creditor", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Creditor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commonwealth_of_Nations", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Commonwealth of Nations"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Health", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Health", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/End-of-Life", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/End-of-Life", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Public_Health_and_Safety/First_Aid", "label": "dmoz/Health/Public Health and Safety/First Aid", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Reproductive_Health/Abortion", "label": "dmoz/Health/Reproductive Health/Abortion", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 94}], "image": "https://bostonglobe-prod.cdn.arcpublishing.com/resizer/04MiwvR688escdf3gsWRuY8TFYU=/506x0/cloudfront-us-east-1.images.arcpublishing.com/bostonglobe/QOOJ222JEAK7NPUSO6SS5VYDIU.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9550065", "eventUri": "eng-9550065", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-06-28", "textStart": 1675, "textEnd": 1682}], "sentiment": 0.05882352941176472, "wgt": 168, "relevance": 1}

The most recent citation involved a patient who died waiting for transfer, according to state officials. In a hearing at the Louisiana Legislature in April, former staff members described searching the hospital for basic, essential supplies mid-procedure and watching everything from beds to coffee pots be repossessed following nonpayment to vendors.\n\nIn the hearing and a press release following the filing, Steward representatives said they do not expect interruptions in day-to-day operations.\n\nIn a statement, CEO Ralph de la Torre said the bankruptcy filing allowed Steward to \"be better positioned to ... keep all of its hospitals open to treat patients, and ensure the continued care and service of our patients and our communities.\"\n\nThe statement blamed insufficient reimbursements from Medicare and Medicaid alongside rising labor costs and financial stress from the pandemic as the driving reason behind the bankruptcy.\n\nBids are due by June 25, with an auction on June 28, according to documents presented by Steward's lawyers during a hearing Tuesday in a federal bankruptcy court in Houston.\n\nMarketing for Glenwood began in January, and is being handled by the Cain Brothers, a New York-based investment banking firm.\n\nIn April, the interim CEO of Glenwood, Jonathan Turton, said the hospital had entered into \"casual conversations\" with other facilities, including nearby St. Francis Medical Center, owned by Franciscan Missionaries of Our Lady Health System, Willis Knighton Health in Shreveport, and Ochsner LSU Health in Shreveport, in the event that the hospital was shut down by the state due to the lack of staff and supplies.\n\nSteward is $9 billion in debt, according to court documents, which it hopes to pay down with the sale of all 31 hospitals.\n\nThis is a developing story.

Morton Hospital in Taunton, Mass., and Holy Family Hospital in Methuen, Mass., received two stars. All are Steward-operated facilities.\n\nRegardless of quality, Ms. Healey has pushed to keep the hospitals open and operating until they can be sold to another operator to keep a state bailout from

finding a buyer for the hospitals more difficult.\n\nWhile reducing Steward's debt will be helpful for the health system's balance sheet, Mr. Kuttner fears it won't be enough money to make sure the hospitals are providing sufficient care to patients.\n\n\"Despite the governor's reassurance that the 'hospitals will remain open and folks should continue to keep their appointments,' I would not

The first part of the cash infusion came in $205 million from MPT to invest in overseas hospitals in a joint venture with Steward. The second half was covered when MPT forgave the mortgage for a Steward hospital and paid $200 million for two Utah hospitals.\n\nIn the end, Cerberus ended up with a whopping $800 million in profit while Steward filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy this week, WSJ reported.\n\nOh, and de la Torre bought a $40 million yacht with the proceeds of a 2021 payout related to his ownership of Steward.\n\nDangers at a North Carolina Psychiatric Hospital\n\nOver-medicating patients and under-training staff, as well as rampant falsification of patient records, plagued a North Carolina psychiatric hospital, according to an ongoing series of reports from North Carolina Health News.\n\nMore than a dozen former employees of Brynn Marr Hospital in Jacksonville, North Carolina described a chaotic and violent environment dangerous for both patients and staff, according to the reports. One former mental health technician said the hospital over-relied on medication, saying it felt the hospital's plan was \"let's see how much medication we can get pumped through these kids instead of being proactive and developing a treatment plan.\"\n\nOther employees said that patients weren't given treatments that would preventively address violence -- and that staff weren't adequately trained to handle violent patients. They described feeling like \"punching bags\" on the unit for teen boys, the reports stated.\n\nPatients were at risk, too. One 11-year-old who was involuntarily committed was bullied and sexually harassed by other patients, which escalated to physical violence. The patient left the hospital with a concussion that the hospital had not treated, according to North Carolina Health News. Sexual violence and rape was a recurrent issue; police reportedly responded to 129 calls for alleged sexual assault and rape at the hospital from January 2019 to September 2023.\n\nFormer staff and patients also described incorrect, exaggerated, and falsified patient records, which was allegedly encouraged by management. Other hospitals owned by the same parent company as Brynn Marr, Universal Health Services, have reported similar issues, according to North Carolina Health News.\n\nTake for example one patient at South Florida State Hospital in Pembroke Pines, who was admitted to the hospital for schizophrenia and psychosis but became suicidal after a tragic and brutal attack from another patient left him blind, the Herald reported.\n\nThis patient's former roommate attacked him and ripped his eyes out of their socket. A lapse in management led to the two being left unsupervised for an hour. Camera footage showed that the attack went on for 7 minutes before any staff were notified. Once staff arrived, they waited an hour before contacting law enforcement.\n\nThis attack -- and the victim becoming suicidal -- was detailed in a report by the Agency for Health Care Administration (AHCA) that declared patients at the hospital in \"immediate jeopardy\" meaning that the hospital's mistakes \"placed the health and safety of [patients] in its care at risk for serious injury, serious harm, serious impairment or death.\" This designation was eventually lifted after the hospital's correction plan was accepted.\n\nStill, the AHCA report and the Miami Herald article shine a light on a pattern of incidents in which the hospital delayed calling law enforcement and cleaned up crime scenes before they arrived.", "source": {"uri": "medpagetoday.com", "dataType": "news",

That includes Florence Hospital as well as St. Luke's Behavioral Center in Phoenix.\n\nCompany attorney Ray Schrock told U.S. Bankruptcy Judge Chris Lopez that the company plans to keep all of its properties open during the bankruptcy procedure and sales.\n\nSt. Luke's, Mountain Vista Medical Center, St. Luke's Behavioral Health Center in Phoenix and Florence Hospital in Florence are to be auctioned on June 28 along with all 18 Steward hospitals in Arkansas, Louisiana, Massachusetts, Ohio, Pennsylvania and Texas. Its nine hospitals in Florida will be auctioned July 30.\n\nMichael Neely, director of business development, marketing and public relations at Tempe St. Luke's, said he was not authorized to comment and referred questions about the impact of the filing on the Arizona properties to Steward corporate headquarters.\n\n\"Steward Health Care has done everything in its power to operate successfully in a highly challenging health-care environment,\" Chief Executive Officer Dr. Ralph de la Torre said in a statement. \"Filing for Chapter 11 restructuring is in the best interests of our patients, physicians, employees and communities at this time.\"\n\nThe company had struggled with finances for months, failing to pay bills and taking out emergency loans.\n\nSchrock said Steward has $9 billion in total liabilities, which it hopes to reduce significantly by the end of this summer through the sale of its hospitals. He did not say what the plans are for any hospital that might not sell.\n\n\"Our goal remains that there are zero hospitals closed on our watch,\" Schrock said in court. \"There's going to be a change in ownership in many hospitals, we recognize that. But we don't want to see any of these communities fail to be served.\"\n\nSteward said that among its debts are $1.2 billion in loans, $6.6 billion in long-term rent, nearly $1 billion in unpaid bills from medical vendors and suppliers, and $290 million in unpaid employee wages and benefits.\n\nIt was not immediately clear if any St. Luke's employees or at any other Steward hospitals in the state were shorted on pay or benefits. It has nearly 30,000 employees, including 4,500 primary and specialty-care physicians at 400 locations.\n\nTempe St. Luke's, 1500 S. Mill Ave., south of 13th Street, started as a 10-bed, wooden-floored clinic designed to deliver babies in 1944 on a then-desolate parcel just south of what grew to be downtown Tempe.\n\nToday, it has nearly 80 beds and several award-winning departments.\n\nA celebration of its 80th anniversary for staffers on March 1 was as small and humble as those beginnings. It was planning a larger, public observance of its eight decades, according to Neely.\n\n\"We are proud to have delivered exceptional health care to the residents in and around Tempe for the past 80 years,\" Damon Brown, Arizona regional-market president of Steward Health Care System, LLC., said at the celebration. \"Tempe St. Luke's Hospital has come a long way since our humble beginnings eight decades ago . . . to today, a 70-bed full-service, acute-care facility with nationally recognized programs.\n\n\"Tempe St. Luke's Hospital is deeply rooted within this community and strives to treat each and every patient as we would a member of our own family.\"\n\nTempe Mayor Corey Woods proclaimed March 1 Tempe St. Luke's Hospital Day to mark its anniversary.\n\nSt. Luke's offers comprehensive health-care services, including emergency, orthopedics, advanced surgical procedures, diagnostic imaging, pain management, wound care and a broad range of medical conditions.\n\nThe hospital's Metabolic and Surgical Weight Management program last year again earned the Bariatric Centers of Excellence from the Clinical Sciences Institute of Optum.\n\n\"The Centers of Excellence designation from Optum is a prestigious and hard-earned accreditation, and to have earned it for a second year in a row recognizes our commitment to providing the highest quality of patient care and safety for our bariatric-surgery patients,\" Brown said.\n\nThe program is accredited as a Comprehensive Center by the Metabolic and Bariatric Surgery Accreditation and Quality Improvement Program, a joint Quality Program of the American College of Surgeons and the American Society for Metabolic and Bariatric Surgery. The accreditation is recognized as the \"gold standard\" for bariatric-surgical programs.\n\nA year ago, St. Luke's rolled out a comprehensive stroke-care program that earned Primary Stroke Center Certification, which allows Tempe EMS crews to bring patients directly to St. Luke's to receive rapid and effective treatment.\n\n\"We are very proud of our team and its dedication to bringing such an important program to our hospital, but we're more excited for the residents of Tempe who can now receive comprehensive stroke care here at Tempe St. Luke's. It's a game changer for our patients,\" Brown said.\n\nIndustry experts have criticized Steward for selling off its real estate and saddling the company with long-term rent at its hospitals. Schrock told the judge that Steward had $6 billion in annual revenue before filing for bankruptcy after those moves.\n\nSchrock added that Steward also tried to sell its physician's group, Stewardship Health Care, to repay loans and some vendors to avoid bankruptcy.\n\n\"The company was always very close to running out of cash,\" he said.\n\nGoing, going...\n\nSteward Health Care's Arizona hospitals that will be auctioned on June 28 include:\n\nTempe St. Luke's Hospital\n\n1500 S. Mill Ave.\n\nTempe\n\nMountain Vista Medical Center\n\n1301 S. Crismon Road\n\nMesa\n\nSt. Luke's Behavioral Health Center\n\n1800 E. Van Buren St.\n\nPhoenix\n\nFlorence Hospital\n\n4545 N.

mounts after operator of Sebastian Medical Center files for bankruptcy", "body": "Steward Health is one of the largest private hospital operators in the country, and in addition to running Sebastian's only hospital, operates medical centers in Brevard, Broward and Miami-Dade.\n\nINDIAN RIVER COUNTY, Fla. -- Steward Health Care System, the operator of Sebastian River Medical Center, filed for Chapter 11 Bankruptcy Monday, a chapter of the United States Bankruptcy Code that allows individuals and businesses to reorganize their finances while continuing to operate.\n\nSteward Health is one of the largest private hospital operators in the country, and in addition to running Sebastian's only hospital, operates medical centers in Brevard, Broward and Miami-Dade counties.\n\nIn Sebastian, the healthcare hub is the community's go-to for most healthcare needs and just completed an $80 million expansion in 2020.\n\n\"All there is is this hospital,\" said resident Deborah Young, who has sought treatment at the hospital before. \"I was surprised. \"People want to go to the closest place there is, and this is it.\"\n\nIn a press release, the company said primary factors for filing bankruptcy, included skyrocketing labor costs, increased material and operational costs due to inflation, and the continued impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\n\"With the additional financing in this process, we are confident that we will keep hospitals open, supplied, and operating so that our care of our patients and our employees is maintained,\" the company said in an official statement.\n\nWPTV went straight to an expert source, Harvard Health Policy and Management Professor Dr. John McDonough, to find the truth.\n\n\"Bankruptcy is a way to clean up debts and get the financial house in order, but on the other hand, for places like an acute care hospital, there are reputational risks,\" McDonough said.\n\nBy that, he means if current staff have other opportunities, with the uncertainty of bankruptcy, staff may be more likely to leave, and said less providers, often means less quality care.\n\n\"It's also an unwelcome sign in terms of people who might want to come there and start working, because who wants to come into a place that's in bankruptcy,\" McDonough said.\n\nMcDonough also points to other cases where bankruptcy didn't end well.\n\nHahnemann University Hospital in Philadelphiaclosed its doors and laid of its more than 2,500 staff members in July of 2019 after filing for bankruptcy.\n\nDelaware County Memorial Hospital in suburban Philadelphia also closed its doors in 2022, four years after the company that bought it out promised to keep it open.\n\nSteward Health itself closed a hospital in Quincy in 2014 despite the company's promise to keep it open for 6.5 to 10 years.\n\nIn its own filing, Steward Health said it has heard from multiple potential buyers for some Massachusetts hospitals, but the state's attorney general, Andrea Joy Campbell told our NBC affiliate in Boston Steward's financial crisis is a \"dire situation\" for the health care of the area.\n\n\"These guarantees are kind of worth nothing in terms of what actually will happen and I think it's important for them to say it,\" McDonough said.\n\nSebastian River Medical and Steward Health Care System didn't respond back to WPTV's request for a further comment.\n\nThe hospital's website showed it employs about 600 staff and as of March had more than 18,500 patient days, patients who otherwise would have to go to Vero Beach or Palm Bay for care.\n\n\"That would not be good, because I'm sure they're overwhelmed,\" Young said. \"Everyone's overwhelmed, because it's growing, and growing and so fast.\"\n\nIndian River officials project the county to grow by 25% in the next 25 years, and WPTV previously reported on how growth on the Treasure Coast is straining the area's healthcare network.\n\nWPTV took the problem to city, county, regional and state officials, including the state's Agency for Health Care Administration.\n\nU.S. Congressman Bill Posey issued WPTV a statement saying he's also been in touch with AHCA since January to address the issue.\n\nSebastian councilman Fred Jones told WPTV he has concerns about the health care system filing bankruptcy, but has no say in the matter, since the hospital is technically outside city limits.\n\nBoth AHCA and Attorney General Ashley Moody's office told WPTV they are looking into the situation.\n\n\"And I shall stay optimistic with that,\" Young said.\n\nTo read Steward

(MPW) reported Thursday that its first-quarter Funds from operations or FFO was loss of $639.96 million, compared to last year's profit of $186.28 million.\n\nFFO loss per share was $1.07, compared to profit of $0.31 a year ago.\n\nThe latest results included around $693 million or $1.16 per share of impairments, including the full reserve of the company's approximate $360 million loan to its tenant Steward Health Care System, which recently filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy Steward, along with its equity investment in Steward and its loan to the International Joint Venture.\n\nNormalized Funds from Operations or NFFO was $142 million or $0.24 per share, compared to $222 million or $0.37 per share in the year earlier period. The primary cause of the decrease in NFFO year-over-year was the significant decrease in revenue related to Steward.\n\nNet loss was $736 million or $1.23 per share, compared to prior year's net income of $33 million or $0.05 per share.\n\nTotal revenues for the period declined to $271.32 million from last year's $350.21 million.\n\nAnalysts on average expected the company to report earnings of $0.07 per share on revenues of $276.45 million, according to figures compiled by Thomson Reuters.

Maura Healey's administration and state lawmakers to focus exclusively on Steward and forget about two hospitals in North Central Worcester County that have already filed for bankruptcy.\n\nThose hospitals are Athol Hospital and Heywood Hospital in Gardner, both under Heywood Healthcare's ownership umbrella that filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy in October.\n\n\"I'm very worried about North Central Massachusetts,\" said Dickson. \"We have to push the state not to forget about the two hospitals north of us, in bankruptcy, and not see all the money go to Steward.\" A proposed merger of UMass Memorial Health and Heywood Healthcare ended in January 2023. The parties cited bad financial timing.\n\nHeywood Healthcare reported a .8% operating margin for the fiscal year quarter than ended Dec. 31, according to the Center for Health Information and Analysis. Quarterly operating margins at Heywood Healthcare's three entities were 1.3% for Athol Hospital, 1.7% for Heywood Hospital and -35.8% for Heywood Medical Group.\n\nThe report defined operating margin as a critical ratio that measures how profitable the entity is when looking at the performance of its primary activities.\n\nBased on a prepared statement from Healey's administration, Dickson shouldn't worry about any possible funds to help bail out Steward that would lead to neglect of troubled hospitals in Worcester County.\n\n\"The Healey-Driscoll administration is committed to protecting access to care, preserving jobs and stabilizing the health care system for the entire state, including in Central and North Central Massachusetts,\" said a spokesperson at the Massachusetts Executive Office of Health and Human Services. \"There are important lessons to learn from this situation with Steward and the administration will work with partners to evaluate how to protect the stability of our health care system in the long term.\"\n\nHeywood Healthcare received a financial jolt of $26.5 million from MassHealth, the state's Medicaid insurance program, according to the state's Executive Office of Health and Human Services. The cash infusion was authorized under the hospital sustainability program enacted in 2023 by the state Legislature.\n\nRoughly half of the funds ($13.3 million) were paid to Heywood Healthcare in April 2023. The rest came in monthly $2.2 million installments from October 2023 through the end of February.\n\nThird hospital in the mix?\n\nA third hospital is potentially in the mix that could lead to health care upheaval in the county.\n\nNashoba Valley Medical Center in Ayer, located on the Worcester County line near Fitchburg and Leominster, is one of eight bankrupt Steward-owned hospitals in Massachusetts.\n\n\"We can't afford to lose three emergency departments and three hospitals in North Central Massachusetts,\" said Dickson.\n\nNashoba is the least critical of the three hospitals, said Dickson, because Emerson Hospital in Concord is located nearby. Athol and Heywood Hospitals must remain in business, said Dickson, because the nearest hospital to Athol, Baystate Franklin Medical Center in Greenfield, might be too far away for some patients.\n\nMeanwhile, UMass Memorial Health is likely not in a position to absorb a patient surge should the hospitals in Athol and Gardner close. Reasons cited by Dickson include the UMass health system recently finished the purchase of Harrington Hospital locations in Southbridge and Webster. Plus, UMass continues the process of completing its corporate affiliation with Milford Regional Medical Center.\n\n\"We're maxed out,\" said Dickson.\n\nBesides, Dickson said hospitals statewide are currently at 100% capacity and not in a position to take on a slew of new patients.\n\nDickson doesn't see a repeat of the UMass field hospital at the DCU Center during the early stages of the COVID-19 pandemic should Steward hospitals in Massachusetts shut down. The volume of patients wouldn't be nearly as high compared to the early months of the pandemic, he said.\n\nUMass is working with less-acute-care settings, including skilled nursing facilities, to plan for a possible influx of patients from Steward's fallout. Dickson said those facilities have a higher vacancy rate, compared to hospitals, and could take new patients, if needed.\n\nDoing what it can\n\nThe Edward M. Kennedy Community Health Center, with operations in Worcester, Milford and Framingham that serve more than 32,000 patients, will do what it can to admit patients should Steward hospitals cease operations in Massachusetts, said Stephen J. Kerrigan, Kennedy Health's president and chief executive officer.\n\nKerrigan doesn't anticipate a wave of Steward patients coming to Worcester, but Kennedy Health's operations in Milford and Framingham could see a significant increase in patient numbers because they're located closer to Steward hospitals.\n\n'Huge impact'\n\nWhat concerns Kerrigan is a \"huge impact\" on Kennedy Health should Athol, Heywood and Nashoba shut down.\n\nMore doctors and care teams would need to be hired, and extra space would have to come from buildouts or new construction to absorb a patient surge. Those steps can't be accomplished overnight.\n\nThere's also the uncertainty of where the money will come from to fund those added expenses.\n\nKennedy Health never closed during the COVID-19 pandemic, when it served as a relief valve for hospital emergency rooms and urgent care centers, said Kerrigan. However, that valve could break if thousands of new patients descend on Kennedy from displaced patients coming from North Central Worcester County. Such a scenario could overwhelm Kennedy staff, forcing patients to local emergency rooms for routine care, said Kerrigan.\n\nMore authority needed\n\nFor-profit health care has a place in Massachusetts, said Dickson. However, he believes the state needs tighter controls over for-profit companies that want to buy nonprofit health systems.\n\n\"We have to tighten regulations and give more authority to the attorney general and the Health Policy Commission to make sure if anything moves from nonprofit to for-profit, it's truly scrutinized,\" he said.\n\nIf careful review isn't done before the paperwork is finalized, Dickson said it's game over because there's little that can be done at that point about problems that surface.\n\nMassachusetts has many recent examples of for-profits scooping up nonprofits, and they often happen when nonprofits are in the midst of financial problems. That was the case in 2018, when Optum Care, part of UnitedHealth Group, bought nonprofit Reliant Medical Group. Optum outbid UMass Memorial Health in that deal.\n\nOptum surfaced again in 2022 when it bought nonprofit Atrius Health, which was reportedly dealing with severe financial strains at the time.\n\nSteward entered the picture in 2010 when it bought several Massachusetts hospitals from financially troubled nonprofit Caritas Christi Health Care, which was under the control of the Archdiocese of Boston. Steward was backed at the time by the private equity firm Cerberus Capital Management.\n\nFinancial problems started when Steward sold its Massachusetts hospitals to Medical Properties Trust in 2016 on a leaseback deal for $1.25 billion. Steward used the funds to buy hospitals nationwide, went into debt and is reportedly relying on a potential sale to Optum of its doctors' network, Stewardship Health, to get the cash to pay off creditors.\n\nThis week, Steward reportedly said it will sell off its Massachusetts hospitals, plus six more in other states, by the end of June. Whether or not that happens, Dickson feels the state needs more control over hospital transactions.\n\n'Not solvent is not an option'\n\nSen. John Cronin, D-Lunenburg, senate co-chair of the state Joint Committee on Health Care Financing, is focused on the precarious developments swirling around Steward.\n\nHowever, like Dickson, Cronin believes the survival of Athol and Heywood Hospitals is critical to maintaining stability in the state's health care system. \"Heywood's system not solvent is not an option, because it would have a hugely detrimental impact on the rest of the system.\"\n\nDebate starts next week; never again in Mass.\n\nMeanwhile, the Massachusetts House plans to debate and vote next week on a sweeping bill that includes more oversight over the health care industry and hospital transactions that was promoted by the Steward developments.\n\n\"It is the Legislature's responsibility to ensure that what happened with Steward Health Care never happens again,\" said House Speaker Ron Mariano, D-Quincy, in a prepared statement. \"Next week, the House will take up comprehensive legislation to address gaps in our regulatory process that Steward exploited, to stabilize the health care system, and to address the rising cost of health care.\"\n\nLike Dickson at UMass, Cronin supports more authority given to the state attorney general and the Health Policy Commission to regulate hospital transactions.\n\nHe cited frustration over Steward's failure to turn over financial records requested by the state. Cronin also stated a desire to rid Massachusetts of the kind of \"perverse incentives\" by Steward Chief Executive Officer Ralph de la Torre to \"bankrupt a health care system to make himself immensely wealthy.\"\n\nAs Cronin sees it, it's time for debate, passage and getting a measure to Healey's desk for her signature to make it law.\n\n\"At the heart of this, our health care system is a public-private partnership,\" said Cronin. \"For-profit or nonprofit, every health care operation relies on hundreds of millions, hundreds of billions of state and federal tax funds. The state absolutely needs to have conversations about the role of future for-profit operations (in Massachusetts).\n\n\"It's a debate we need to have, and we need to get it right.\"", "source": {"uri": "eu.telegram.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Telegram & Gazette"}, "authors": [{"uri": "worcester_telegram@eu.telegram.com", "name": "Worcester Telegram", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UMass_Memorial_Health", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "UMass Memorial Health"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_Massachusetts", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Central Massachusetts"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_Massachusetts_Amherst", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "University of Massachusetts Amherst"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health_system", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Health system"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_F._Kennedy", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "John F.

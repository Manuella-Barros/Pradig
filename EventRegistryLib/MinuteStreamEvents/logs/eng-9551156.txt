We will continue to evaluate our operation and make the necessary changes to reach our championship-caliber goals. We all take accountability, and it's my job, along with Josh and ownership, to build a championship team.\"\n\nThe Suns will now have a third different head coach in three seasons. This is after Vogel said he had \"full support\" from Suns team owner Mat Ishbia going into Game 4 against the T-Wolves they lost at home to end the season.\n\nThe Suns had extensive talks for days in evaluating the team and determining whether to keep or fire Vogel, who has been a head coach with four different NBA teams. The Republic reported Tuesday a decision would \"soon\" be made on Vogel.\n\nVogel replaced Monty Williams, who was fired after leading the Suns to three consecutive playoff appearances as they reached the finals in 2021. Vogel signed a five-year, $31-million deal with the Suns last summer. The Suns won a franchise-best 64 games in the 2021-22 season and made that third straight trip to the postseason last year, but never returned to the finals.\n\nThey were bounced from the playoffs in the second round in 2022 and 2023, losing the elimination games in embarrassing fashion at home to Dallas in Game 7 in 2022 and eventual NBA champion Denver in Game 6 in 2023.\n\nAnother one bites the dust:NBA 'Super Teams' don't guarantee job security for head coaches, as these 6 learned\n\nThat factored in the Suns firing Williams a few months into Ishbia's tenure as team owner and hiring Vogel, who coached the Lakers to the 2019-20 title. The billionaire mortgage lender bought the Suns and WNBA's Phoenix Mercury for a record $4 billion in February 2023.\n\nWith Devin Booker, Kevin Durant and Bradley Beal, the Suns were viewed as having tremendous offensive firepower. Vogel's hiring made sense in that he preaches defense to give the Suns balance and has coached superstars like LeBron James, who led that 2019-20 championship squad in Los Angeles.\n\nHowever, Phoenix dealt with injuries early that factored in the Big 3 playing a total of 41 games together. There seemed to be a disconnect between the players and Vogel at various times, but the Suns won seven of their last 10 games of the regular season and entered the postseason with momentum.\n\nThen they were swept by the Timberwolves, a team the Suns went 3-0 against in the regular season with the final victory coming at Minneapolis in the final regular season game.", "source": {"uri":

Shams Charania of The Athletic was the first to break the news.\n\nVogel, who the Suns hired last June, was new owner Mat Ishbia's pick to lead the Suns and their All-Star trio of Kevin Durant, Devin Booker, and Bradley Beal. Unfortunately, injuries played a major part in the Suns' demise this season. As a result of constant lineup changes, Phoenix limped into the postseason as the 6-seed in the Western Conference, struggling to find consistent play from their core each and every night.\n\nIn the first round of the playoffs, the Suns lost all four games played against the Timberwolves by an average of 15.0 points per game. After averaging 116.2 points per game during the regular season, the 10th-best average in the league, the Suns averaged just 103.3 points per game against Minnesota in the postseason. Their failure to make adjustments both during and after games was a major concern for the Suns.\n\nQuestions about Vogel's leadership had grown louder heading towards the end of the season, especially after he reportedly sounded off on the team during their loss to the Los Angeles Clippers on April 9. Vogel was yelling so loudly that his voice could be heard outside of the locker room, but some Suns players believed this outburst to be forced and unnecessary, according to The Athletic. The disconnect and lack of respect from the player's perspective for their coaching staff continued to grow larger heading into the postseason.\n\nA roster highlighted by three All-Stars in Durant, Beal, and Booker was not supposed to lose in the first round of the playoffs, yet alone get swept by a young, inexperienced team when it comes to fighting in the postseason.\n\nWhile many factors played into their demise this season, Vogel was the head coach of a team that underperformed the championship aspirations that were placed on their shoulders. As a result, he is the scapegoat in this situation since the Suns truly don't have any other moves to make.\n\nWhat Suns' decision to fire Frank Vogel means\n\nAs they enter the offseason, the Suns are pressed for what they can do to try and improve their immediate championship outlook. Durant, Booker, and Beal are under contract for over $150 million next season. Attempting to move any of the three stars would be tough to do financially, and Phoenix can't hit the \"reset button\" due to trading away all of their first-round picks.\n\nThere needed to be some sort of change, hence why the decision to fire Vogel amid all of the internal disconnect was made.\n\nNow, the Suns embark on yet another coaching search, one that could very well make or break their decision to go \"all-in\" with Durant, Booker, and Beal as the backbone of their franchise. Regardless of who the Suns potentially hire, this organization will be pressed for time.\n\nAfter being swept in the first round of the playoffs, the Suns championship window has shrunk immensely.

Vogel is done in Phoenix after a single season produced a 49-33 record.\n\nHow will Suns address roster issues?\n\nThe Suns sacrificed depth in reconstructing their roster around All-NBA guard Devin Booker. They traded away key players including Mikal Bridges and Cam Johnson to the Brooklyn Nets in addition to four first-round picks in order to acquire Durant during the 2022-23 season. They dealt Chris Paul and Landry Shamet last offseason to acquire Bradley Beal from the Washington Wizards.\n\nThe deals depleted the Phoenix bench and left the Suns without a true point guard in the rotation. Instead, Booker and Beal -- both primarily scoring guards -- split time running the Suns offense.\n\nThe Suns also lack size up front outside of starting center Jusuf Nurki\u0107. That lack of size was exposed against the bigger Timberwolves, who feature multi-time All-Stars Rudy Gobert and Karl-Anthony Towns and Sixth Man of the Year Naz Reid on their front line. The Timberwolves secured a 46.3-32.5 advantage in rebounds per game over the Suns in their four-game series.\n\nThe hope in Phoenix was that the top-heavy roster would lead to the Suns competing for a championship. Instead, it's become clear that it's not built to compete at the top of the Western Conference as constructed.\n\nDismissing Vogel won't solve those roster woes. It does give the Suns a starting point to make adjustments in the offseason.\n\nVogel is back on the job market after 19 seasons on NBA sidelines as an assistant or head coach. He's spent his last 12 NBA seasons as a head coach including previous stints with the Los Angeles Lakers, Orlando Magic and Indiana Pacers. He coached the Lakers to an NBA championship in the 2019-20 season.\n\nThe Suns, on the other hand, will now look for a third head coach in as many years.", "source": {"uri": "aol.com", "dataType":

This is after Vogel said he had \"full support\" from Suns team owner Mat Ishbia going into Game 4 against the T-Wolves they lost at home to end the season.\n\nThe Suns had extensive talks for days in evaluating the team and determining whether to keep or fire Vogel, who has been a head coach with four different NBA teams.\n\nVogel replaced Monty Williams, who was fired after leading the Suns to three consecutive playoff appearances as they reached the finals in 2021. Vogel signed a five-year, $31-million deal with the Suns last summer. The Suns won a franchise-best 64 games in the 2021-22 season and made that third straight trip to the postseason last year, but never returned to the finals.\n\nThey were bounced from the playoffs in the second round in 2022 and 2023, losing the elimination games in embarrassing fashion at home to Dallas in Game 7 in 2022 and eventual NBA champion Denver in Game 6 in 2023.\n\nThat factored in the Suns firing Williams a few months into Ishbia's tenure as team owner and hiring Vogel, who coached the Lakers to the 2019-20 title. The billionaire mortgage lender bought the Suns and WNBA's Phoenix Mercury for a record $4 billion in February 2023.\n\nAnother one bites the dust: NBA 'Super Teams' don't guarantee job security for head coaches, as these 6 learned\n\nWith Devin Booker, Kevin Durant and Bradley Beal, the Suns were viewed as having tremendous offensive firepower. Vogel's hiring made sense in that he preaches defense to give the Suns balance and has coached superstars like LeBron James, who led that 2019-20 championship squad in Los Angeles.\n\nHowever, Phoenix dealt with injuries early that factored in the Big 3 playing a total of 41 games together. There seemed to be a disconnect between the players and Vogel at various times, but the Suns won seven of their last 10 games of the regular season and entered the postseason with momentum.\n\nThen they were swept by the Timberwolves, a team the Suns went 3-0 against in the regular season with the final victory coming at Minneapolis in the final regular season game.", "source": {"uri": "azcentral.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "AZ Central"}, "authors": [{"uri": "arizona_republic@azcentral.com", "name": "Arizona Republic", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_playoffs", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "NBA playoffs"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frank_Vogel", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Frank Vogel"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phoenix_Suns", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Phoenix Suns"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Head_coach", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Head coach"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monty_Williams", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Monty Williams"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_Conference_(NBA)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Western Conference (NBA)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mat_Ishbia", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Mat Ishbia"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Basketball_Association", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "National Basketball Association"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dallas", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Dallas"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Dallas"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Devin_Booker", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Devin Booker"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phoenix_Mercury", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Phoenix Mercury"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_Finals", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "NBA Finals"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minnesota_Timberwolves", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Minnesota Timberwolves"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bradley_Beal", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Bradley Beal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los_Angeles_Lakers", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles Lakers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Women's_National_Basketball_Association", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Women's National Basketball Association"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LeBron_James", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "LeBron James"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kevin_Durant", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Kevin Durant"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Denver", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Denver"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Denver"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los_Angeles", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minneapolis", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Minneapolis"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Minneapolis"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Browser_Based", "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Browser Based", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Professional", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Professional", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Alternative/Coaching", "label": "dmoz/Health/Alternative/Coaching", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Coaching", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Coaching", "wgt": 18}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Board_Games/Developers_and_Publishers", "label": "dmoz/Games/Board Games/Developers and Publishers", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 92}], "image": "https://www.gannett-cdn.com/authoring/authoring-images/2024/04/06/PPHX/73225826007-usatsi-22952007.jpg?auto=webp&crop=2154,1212,x0,y588&format=pjpg&width=1200", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9551156", "eventUri": "eng-9551156", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.1137254901960785, "wgt": 215, "relevance": 1}

This is after Vogel said he had \"full support\" from Suns team owner Mat Ishbia going into Game 4 against the Timberwolves, which they lost at home to end their season.\n\nThe Suns had extensive talks for days in evaluating the team and determining whether to keep or fire Vogel, who has been a head coach with four different NBA teams.\n\nVogel replaced Monty Williams, who was fired after leading the Suns to three consecutive playoff appearances as they reached the finals in 2021. Vogel signed a five-year, $31 million deal with the Suns last summer. The Suns won a franchise-best 64 games in the 2021-22 season and made a third consecutive trip to the postseason last year, but never returned to the finals.\n\nThey were bounced from the playoffs in the second round in 2022 and 2023, losing the elimination games in embarrassing fashion at home to Dallas in Game 7 in 2022 and eventual NBA champion Denver in Game 6 in 2023.\n\nThat factored in the Suns firing Williams a few months into Ishbia's tenure as team owner and hiring Vogel, who coached the Lakers to the 2019-20 title. The billionaire mortgage lender bought the Suns and WNBA's Phoenix Mercury for a record $4 billion in February 2023.\n\nWith Devin Booker, Kevin Durant and Bradley Beal, the Suns were viewed as having tremendous offensive firepower. Vogel's hiring made sense in that he preaches defense to give the Suns balance and has coached superstars like LeBron James, who led that 2019-20 championship squad in Los Angeles.\n\nHowever, Phoenix dealt with injuries early that factored in the Big 3 playing a total of 41 games together. There seemed to be a disconnect between the players and Vogel at various times, but the Suns won seven of their last 10 games of the regular season and entered the postseason with momentum.\n\nThen they were swept by the Timberwolves, a team the Suns went 3-0 against in the regular season with the final victory coming at Minneapolis in the final regular season game.", "source": {"uri": "sports.yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo Sports"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_playoffs", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "NBA playoffs"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frank_Vogel", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Frank Vogel"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Head_coach", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Head coach"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minnesota_Timberwolves", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Minnesota Timberwolves"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mat_Ishbia", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Mat Ishbia"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monty_Williams", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Monty Williams"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phoenix_Suns", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Phoenix Suns"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_Conference_(NBA)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Western Conference (NBA)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Basketball_Association", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "National Basketball Association"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dallas", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Dallas"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Dallas"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Devin_Booker", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Devin Booker"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phoenix_Mercury", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Phoenix Mercury"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_Finals", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "NBA Finals"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bradley_Beal", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Bradley Beal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los_Angeles_Lakers", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles Lakers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Women's_National_Basketball_Association", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Women's National Basketball Association"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LeBron_James", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "LeBron James"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kevin_Durant", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Kevin Durant"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Denver", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Denver"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Denver"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los_Angeles", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phoenix,_Arizona", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Phoenix, Arizona"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Phoenix, Arizona"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minneapolis", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Minneapolis"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Minneapolis"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Professional", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Professional", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Coaching", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Coaching", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Show_Basketball", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Show Basketball", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/History", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/History", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 91}], "image": "https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/yID34CHSEuDtUCbq23O8Ow--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyMDA7aD03NjQ7Y2Y9d2VicA--/https://media.zenfs.com/en/usa_today_sports_articles_558/94363b63eee8d4189edc7f2de7d27d60", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9551156", "eventUri": "eng-9551156", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.05882352941176472, "wgt": 211, "relevance": 1}

The decision comes after a disappointing season in which the Suns, who expected to compete for the NBA championship, were swept out of the first round by a Minnesota Timberwolves team that had not won a playoff series in 20 years. Vogel lasted only one year on the job in Phoenix.\n\n\"As we said at the press conference on May 1, team leadership including myself, Josh Bartelstein, and ownership would be looking across basketball operations to determine what changes needed to be made,\" Suns President of Basketball Operations and General Manager James Jones said in a team statement.\n\n\"After a thoughtful review of the season, we concluded that we needed a different head coach for our team. We appreciate Frank's hard work and commitment. We are here to win a championship and last season was way below our expectations. We will continue to evaluate our operation and make the necessary changes to reach our championship-caliber goals. We all take accountability, and it's my job, along with Josh and ownership, to build a championship team.\"\n\nVogel was a somewhat surprising choice for the Phoenix job. Many reports indicated that the Suns were leaning towards promoting top assistant Kevin Young to the head job, but they ultimately elected to hire Vogel and make Young the highest-paid assistant in the NBA. The decision fit the apparent timeline new owner Mat Ishbia was operating under. After trading for Kevin Durant, the Suns were all in on winning immediately. Vogel had recently won a championship leading the Los Angeles Lakers, while Young had never been an NBA head coach.\n\nBut Vogel's message seemingly failed to resonate with the Suns roster, and The Athletic's Shams Charania and Doug Haller detailed several elements of dysfunction within the team this season after Phoenix was eliminated on Sunday. He reported that Durant \"was not always happy with how he was used,\" and \"Phoenix's players questioned the coaching staff's inability to structure the offense.\" Before Game 4, Vogel expressed to reporters that he was confident he would return to the Suns next season. \"I have the full support of Mat Ishbia,\" Vogel said.\n\nUltimately, Ishbia chose to move on, and Vogel has now lost two head coaching jobs in the past three years after blockbuster trades backfired. Despite winning the 2020 championship for the Lakers, Vogel was fired in 2022 after the team's acquisition of Russell Westbrook ended with them missing the playoffs.\n\nThe Suns, meanwhile, are making a change a critical point in the franchise's history if they plan to make good on the championship hopes that the Durant and Bradley Beal trades created. Young is seemingly not a candidate for the job this time around as he has taken the head coaching job at BYU. The Suns are likely starting from scratch in their second coaching search since last spring, and because of restrictions introduced in the new CBA, they probably won't be able to make major roster changes to accommodate their hire.\n\nThat makes this decision absolutely essential to Phoenix. The Suns will likely run back a version of this year's team next season with only a new coach in place to make the changes needed to get Phoenix back into the title hunt. In a loaded Western Conference, that will be no easy task.", "source": {"uri": "cbssports.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "CBS Sports"}, "authors": [{"uri": "sam_quinn@cbssports.com", "name": "Sam Quinn", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frank_Vogel", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Frank Vogel"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Head_coach", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Head coach"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basketball", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Basketball"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kevin_Durant", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Kevin Durant"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phoenix,_Arizona", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Phoenix, Arizona"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Phoenix, Arizona"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Josh_Bartelstein", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Josh Bartelstein"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phoenix_Suns", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Phoenix Suns"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_Finals", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "NBA Finals"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minnesota_Timberwolves", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Minnesota Timberwolves"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_manager", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "General manager"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Basketball_Association", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "National Basketball Association"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mat_Ishbia", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Mat Ishbia"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Athletic", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "The Athletic"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los_Angeles_Lakers", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles Lakers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_playoffs", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "NBA playoffs"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bradley_Beal", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Bradley Beal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Continental_Basketball_Association", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Continental Basketball Association"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_Ten_Conference", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Big Ten Conference"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russell_Westbrook", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Russell Westbrook"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Health/Alternative/Coaching", "label": "dmoz/Health/Alternative/Coaching", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Coaching", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Coaching", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Show_Basketball", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Show Basketball", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/History", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/History", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 93}], "image": "https://sportshub.cbsistatic.com/i/r/2024/05/09/9412e73a-0bd5-4267-852b-bf3d5c456224/thumbnail/1200x675/75df25dba2b31d8003f64bf7a2190f75/frank-vogel-suns-g.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9551156", "eventUri": "eng-9551156", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-05-01", "textStart": 494, "textEnd": 499}], "sentiment": 0.2, "wgt": 206, "relevance": 1}

We appreciate Frank's hard work and commitment.\"\n\nThe move by the Suns under Mat Ishbia comes after Vogel said before Game 4 of a first-round series loss to the Minnesota Timberwolves that he was \"very\" confident he would return for 2024-25, adding that he believed he had the \"full support of Mat Ishbia.\"\n\nThe sweep by the T-Wolves ended a massively disappointing postseason finish and was a far cry from the championship expectations set upon Vogel's arrival.\n\nWhile Phoenix finished with a 49-33 record, it was disjointed and sloppy all season. The Suns had clear problems developing into a cohesive unit and that led to struggles in basic areas, which made it impossible to figure out what the group's identity was. There were points during the 82-game campaign when it looked like the Suns were clicking into place, and just when that occurred, the same issues would rise back to the surface.\n\nThis all came to a head in the postseason, when their inconsistencies were greatly exposed against a quality opponent. The Suns showed some positives against Minnesota before they started to spiral out of control in the mid-third quarter across the first three consecutive contests, failing to make any of them competitive in the final period. Phoenix put together a competitive Game 4 but ultimately struggled to execute down the stretch to seal the sweep with a 122-116 loss.\n\nThrough whatever the lack of connectivity was a result of behind the scenes, as well as their own inability to step up above the circumstances, the Suns' hyped-up Big 3 of Bradley Beal, Devin Booker and Kevin Durant all played poorly in the series. None of them were able to reach a special level in the first three games, another telling sign a change in the leadership dynamic was needed.\n\nThe Athletic dropped a report under an hour after the Suns were eliminated, noting a few troubling signs for Vogel's future. He \"lit into\" the team after a poor loss to the Los Angeles Clippers in the last week of the regular season, only for his players to not buy his passion then and at shootaround the next day. Players questioned the offensive system put together by coaches, including Durant never feeling comfortable in his role.\n\nVogel was hired by Phoenix after it let go of head coach Monty Williams last offseason. Williams immediately rebuilt the Suns into a respectable, competitive team in his first year before their surprising run to the NBA Finals in 2021. Expectations rose, and despite them winning 64 games the following year, Phoenix bowed out in the second round.\n\nIt did so again the following season, with both elimination game losses coming in embarrassing blowout fashion at Footprint Center.\n\nThat was enough for Williams' tenure to end, even though he had a few years left on his most recent contract extension. His exit came shortly after the Suns and Phoenix Mercury were sold by Robert Sarver to Ishbia. The new owner traded for Durant at the trade deadline in Feb. 2023, and the core of the roster continued to reset from there with Chris Paul and Deandre Ayton departing for Beal, Jusuf Nurkic and Grayson Allen.\n\nNonetheless, it meant Vogel was expected to have Phoenix remain among the elite of the NBA and win a title.\n\nVogel had previously achieved this level of success in his first year with the Los Angeles Lakers in 2019-20, and given his defensive background on a team full of offensive talent, the fit seemed to be there.\n\nThe Suns not only didn't come close to reaching their end goal but were never in the realm of looking like a team that could do so, with the regular season lacking any minor spurt that suggested Vogel's team was capable.\n\nPhoenix began the season 14-15, dealing with injuries to Durant, Booker and mainly Beal through a battle to establish any sort of continuity. On top of that, season-long problems of execution in the fourth quarter and turnovers popped up early and often. A loss on Christmas to the Dallas Mavericks was marked as the starting point of a potential turnaround, with the Suns going 19-7 from there up to the All-Star break.\n\nVogel's Suns had learned how to at least win, but the roots were dug in from the first 29 games across the majority of that more promising stretch.\n\nPhoenix was often unorganized, lacking proper structure on both ends. The offense would bounce between running proper, movement-heavy sets before slowing down the pace and relying on isolation-style basketball. The defense immensely lacked the execution as a team to compensate for its inability to contain dribble penetration within its scheme. This forced the Suns into rotations often and it was a rare sight to see more than a few each game involving multiple efforts that were sound.\n\nOn top of that, the Suns were a historically bad team in the fourth quarter. The way they turned the ball over was alarming, often of the live-ball variety with mind-numbing decision-making in unforced errors. Despite a team-wide understanding of the group requiring more 3-point shots, they were constantly getting out-gunned in attempts. This made Phoenix play uphill most nights, battling the math of losing the possession battle on turnovers and the math battle on 3-pointers.\n\nAll of this came to a head after the All-Star break, when the Suns regressed instead of improving. They continuously dropped games to a mix of poor teams and opponents without the opposing best player. A lot of it was off an evident lack of energy, effort and focus, shocking characteristics for a Suns group that was facing a play-in tournament fate.\n\nA stunning pair of fixtures against the Los Angeles Clippers in the last week of the regular season indicated Vogel's team had entirely checked out and was ready to go to the play-in tournament before a brief spark via two victories to end the season got Phoenix the sixth seed in the playoff bracket. This led to some optimism that the Suns had perhaps turned the corner at the last second possible before the first round showed that was not the case.\n\nVogel's one-year tenure with the Suns ends his fourth head coaching stint in the NBA. He got started as one with the Indiana Pacers in the 2010-11 season on an interim basis before earning the permanent position for five more seasons. The Pacers went 250-181 and made two trips to the Eastern Conference Finals.\n\nHis contract was not renewed in 2016 and he was quickly scooped up by the Orlando Magic, a less successful stint of a 54-110 record across two years that had him fired.\n\nAfter a year off, Vogel was brought on by the Lakers in the summer of 2019 and won the aforementioned title right away. L.A. then lost in the first round the next season before going 33-49 in Vogel's final season before he was fired.", "source": {"uri": "arizonasports.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Arizona

He succeeded Monty Williams, who was fired after the team's Western Conference semifinals loss to the Denver Nuggets. Following the 122-116 loss in Game 4 to the Timberwolves on April 28, the Suns have now lost six straight playoff games -- the longest playoff losing streak in franchise history.\n\nPrior to being swept Vogel said he was \"very\" confident that he would return next season and that he had \"full support\" of Ishbia.\n\nThis was Vogel's fourth time as a head coach, after stops with the Los Angeles Lakers, Orlando Magic and Indiana Pacers. He has a career mark of 479-422.\n\nBefore winning a title in L.A., Vogel led the Pacers to the Eastern Conference semifinals twice. Vogel had the NBA's top-rated defense three times in his career -- twice with Indiana and once with the Lakers, according to ESPN Stats & Information data.\n\nThe Suns enter the offseason with $209 million in salary, the biggest payroll of any NBA team, and face a projected luxury tax penalty of $116 million.\n\nThe Suns are also above the so-called second apron of the luxury tax for at least the next three years if they keep their core together.

A lack of depth and roster construction issues plagued the Suns all season, resulting in a poor playoff showing. The owner's win-now mentality led to a coaching change.\n\nAfter a first-round sweep at the hands of Anthony Edwards and the Minnesota Timberwolves, the Phoenix Suns have parted ways with head coach Frank Vogel.\n\nVogel was at the helm in Phoenix for just one season and took the Big Three of Kevin Durant, Devin Booker, and Bradley Beal to the playoffs as the sixth seed, but they were promptly swept in the first round.\n\nThe Suns went all-in on Durant last season and Beal in the offseason, adding them to their All-Star backcourt already featuring Booker. The Suns ended up lacking depth and a primary playmaker and were an easy first-round matchup for Minnesota.\n\nPhoenix Needed a Scapegoat Poor roster construction and a first-round exit got Vogel fired\n\nThe Suns went championship-or-bust under the orders of owner Matt Ibisha. Ibisha, CEO of United Wholesale Mortgage, decided that he could build a competitive NBA roster by throwing money at big-name stars without consideration for chemistry, role, and sense.\n\nDespite this season being defined as a failure by any definition of the word, Ibisha went out of his way to justify his roster decisions and suggested that most NBA GMs would change places with him due to the amount of talent on his roster.\n\nMany pundits have criticized the \"buy a championship\" strategy for one simple reason: it rarely works. The NBA is moving towards a build-from-scratch model, and Big Threes are becoming increasingly outdated.\n\nCharles Barkley tried to come to the aid of Darvin Ham and Frank Vogel and encouraged putting the blame on the players when a season ends prematurely.\n\nThe end result in Phoenix was similar to that of the Los Angeles Lakers, who also got bounced in the first round and fired their head coach Darvin Ham shortly thereafter.\n\nUnlike the Lakers, the Suns are in the running for Mike Budenholzer, the premier coach on the market.\n\nWhat's Next for the Suns? Budenholzer is included in the coaching search\n\nIf the Phoenix Suns don't make drastic roster changes but do manage to land Budenholzer, ownership will continue to push the narrative that the Suns can win a championship. The Milwaukee Bucks won with Budenholzer at the helm, and they were also led by three All-Stars: Khris Middleton, Jrue Holiday, and Giannis Antetokounmpo.\n\nThe Bucks, however, factored in chemistry and roster construction over just amassing talent, which is the approach Ibisha has opted for.\n\nThe Suns appear poised to run it back next season and try to make a deeper playoff run while also not making any meaningful changes to their roster. If Vogel really is to blame for all their failures this season, then swapping him out for a different coach with championship experience should be a recipe for success.\n\nRelated Former NBA Champion Sentenced to Jail for Insurance Fraud Scheme Glen Davis, among others, faces prison time for defrauding the NBA's insurance plan.", "source": {"uri": "givemesport.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "GiveMeSport"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frank_Vogel", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Frank Vogel"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phoenix_Suns", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Phoenix Suns"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Head_coach", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Head coach"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bradley_Beal", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Bradley Beal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Basketball_Association", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "National Basketball Association"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kevin_Durant", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Kevin Durant"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_playoffs", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "NBA playoffs"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Devin_Booker", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Devin Booker"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_All-Star_Game", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "NBA All-Star Game"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minnesota_Timberwolves", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Minnesota Timberwolves"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Darvin_Ham", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Darvin Ham"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mike_Budenholzer", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Mike Budenholzer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_Barkley", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Charles Barkley"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los_Angeles_Lakers", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles Lakers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minnesota", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Minnesota"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Minnesota"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jrue_Holiday", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Jrue Holiday"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Khris_Middleton", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Khris Middleton"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glen_Davis_(basketball)", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Glen Davis (basketball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Giannis_Antetokounmpo", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Giannis Antetokounmpo"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Milwaukee_Bucks", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Milwaukee Bucks"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_Finals", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "NBA Finals"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Professional", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Professional", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Coaching", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Coaching", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Show_Basketball", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Show Basketball", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/History", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/History", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 85}], "image": "https://static0.givemesportimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/phoenix-suns-frank-vogel-1.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9551156", "eventUri": "eng-9551156", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.1215686274509804, "wgt": 198, "relevance": 1}

Ibisha, CEO of United Wholesale Mortgage, decided that he could build a competitive NBA roster by throwing money at big-name stars without consideration for chemistry, role, and sense.\n\nThe end result was similar to that of the Los Angeles Lakers, who also got bounced in the first round and fired their head coach Darvin Ham shortly thereafter.\n\nUnlike the Lakers, the Suns are in the running for Mike Budenholzer, the premier coach on the market.\n\nRelated Former NBA Champion Sentenced to Jail for Insurance Fraud Scheme Glen Davis, among others, faces prison time for defrauding the NBA's insurance plan.", "source": {"uri": "givemesport.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "GiveMeSport"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frank_Vogel", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Frank Vogel"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phoenix_Suns", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Phoenix Suns"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Head_coach", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Head coach"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Devin_Booker", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Devin Booker"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bradley_Beal", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Bradley Beal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kevin_Durant", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Kevin Durant"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_playoffs", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "NBA playoffs"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_All-Star_Game", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "NBA All-Star Game"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minnesota_Timberwolves", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Minnesota Timberwolves"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Darvin_Ham", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Darvin Ham"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glen_Davis_(basketball)", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Glen Davis (basketball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mike_Budenholzer", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Mike Budenholzer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_Finals", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "NBA Finals"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los_Angeles_Lakers", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles Lakers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Basketball_Association", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "National Basketball Association"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minnesota", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Minnesota"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Minnesota"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Professional", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Professional", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Coaching", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Coaching", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Show_Basketball", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Show Basketball", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 56}], "image": "https://static0.givemesportimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/phoenix-suns-frank-vogel-1.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9551156", "eventUri": "eng-9551156", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.1607843137254902, "wgt": 198, "relevance": 1}

How close they are to a championship. He mocked national commentary that suggested the organization's house is on fire. The Suns, he said, are in great shape.\n\nA week later, Ishbia and general manager James Jones fired the head coach, dismissing Frank Vogel after one disappointing season. Expected to contend for a title, Phoenix was a first-round flameout, eliminated and mostly uncompetitive in four games against the Minnesota Timberwolves. Someone had to take the fall. On Thursday, Vogel was that person.\n\nA grinder who began his NBA career in the video room, Vogel did not have much of a chance in the desert. He was a defensive-minded coach with a defensive-challenged roster. He expected a scrappiness the Suns, built around the star power of Devin Booker, Kevin Durant and Bradley Beal, could not deliver. In addition, the Suns lacked a true point guard. They did not have a strong bench. These were the least of Vogel's problems.\n\nAs the season unfolded and frustration mounted, players lost trust in the head coach. A lot of this happened behind closed doors, but it also could be seen during games. How players reacted to Vogel during timeouts or when coming off the court revealed a fatal disconnect. What the Suns didn't say publicly was reflected in their body language.\n\nWith Phoenix's \"Big 3\" locked in for $150 million next season, Ishbia made the only major move he could make. A head coach and a lost locker room cannot coexist, especially if that locker room lacks the leadership to sort through such things. Vogel might have deserved better, but he had to go, a scapegoat for all that went wrong. This is how it usually works.\n\nGive Ishbia credit for making a difficult decision -- Vogel was his hire, after all, signed to a five-year deal last June -- but don't let him off the hook. Since he assumed ownership of the organization, he has made the Suns impossible to ignore, attracting the WNBA and NBA All-Star Games to the desert, putting games on free television and upgrading facilities. But despite the upbeat message delivered last week, the basketball product has suffered mostly because of moves he pursued or approved. Two years removed from the NBA Finals, Phoenix last season lost in the Western Conference semifinals to eventual champ Denver. This season they didn't win a single postseason game. That Minnesota has gone on to take a 2-0 series lead against reigning champ Denver in the semifinals should not change anyone's view. Regardless of first-round matchup, the Suns weren't advancing far.\n\nAfter their Game 4 elimination loss, the \"Big 3\" and others discussed the importance of continuity and the benefits of building off experience. Durant pointed out that Minnesota, Denver, Boston and Oklahoma City, among others, had played together for two or three seasons and that he looked forward to similar team building. Guard Grayson Allen agreed. The Suns, he said, learned what works and what does not.\n\nThe problem is Phoenix has been stuck, wheels spinning, in this mode since acquiring Durant at the 2023 trade deadline. \"Figuring it out\" has become an organization motto, a promise for a day that never comes. Last year the Suns insisted they fell short because they did not have enough time to fully integrate Durant. This year they struggled because they didn't have enough time to fully integrate Beal, who missed 29 games because of injury, or to develop the chemistry needed to reach a higher level.\n\nNext season they'll have a new coach.\n\nIshbia has been great for Phoenix mostly because he's proved that he's not afraid to spend, to do whatever it takes to produce the franchise's first championship. That's all fans want, but the moves have to pay off. A team expected to contend cannot narrowly avoid the Play-In Tournament. It cannot get swept in the first round no matter how well the opponent plays. That's what made last week's season-ending news conference with Ishbia so bizarre. He talked as if the Suns were right on track, that everything here was rosy. The conviction was admirable but the message bombed. And for the first time, Ishbia lost some trust within the fan base.\n\nDecades ago, when this franchise was in its infancy, then-GM Jerry Colangelo interviewed three head-coaching candidates. The first was K.C. Jones, a former player and eight-time NBA champion. The second was University of Washington head coach Tex Winter, inventor of the triple-post offense. The third was Kansas State coach Cotton Fitzsimmons. Of the three, Fitzsimmons stood out as the best communicator, the type who could adjust to a roster, talented or flawed, and get the best out of it. He got the job, and eventually, through two stints in Phoenix, became one of the best coaches in franchise history.\n\nThat's what Phoenix needs. A head coach who can connect. He'll need a strong staff that can help the Suns defensively. He'll need to convince role players to buy in and do the dirty work. But more than anything, the new head coach will need to connect with Booker, Durant and Beal and maximize their offensive potential. It may not get Phoenix a championship, but it's how these Suns are built. And for now, it's their only hope.", "source": {"uri": "theathletic.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Athletic"}, "authors": [{"uri": "doug_haller@theathletic.com", "name": "Doug Haller", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frank_Vogel", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Frank Vogel"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Head_coach", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Head coach"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phoenix,_Arizona", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Phoenix, Arizona"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Phoenix, Arizona"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kevin_Durant", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Kevin Durant"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mat_Ishbia", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Mat Ishbia"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Jones_(basketball,_born_1980)", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "James Jones (basketball, born 1980)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Behind_closed_doors_(sport)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Behind closed doors (sport)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Devin_Booker", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Devin Booker"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phoenix_Suns", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Phoenix Suns"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minnesota_Timberwolves", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Minnesota Timberwolves"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bradley_Beal", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Bradley Beal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_manager", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "General manager"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Point_guard", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Point guard"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Basketball_Association", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "National Basketball Association"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Denver", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Denver"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Denver"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minnesota", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Minnesota"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Minnesota"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_All-Star_Game", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "NBA All-Star Game"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_Finals", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "NBA Finals"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_Ten_Conference", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Big Ten Conference"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Women's_National_Basketball_Association", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Women's National Basketball Association"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basketball", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Basketball"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boston", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Boston"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Boston"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oklahoma_City", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Oklahoma City"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Oklahoma City"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grayson_Allen", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Grayson Allen"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kansas_State_Wildcats_men's_basketball", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Kansas State Wildcats men's basketball"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cotton_Fitzsimmons", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Cotton Fitzsimmons"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tex_Winter", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Tex Winter"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/K._C._Jones", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "K.

It's sometimes a struggle, but I thought he did a great job this year.\"\n\nThe Suns didn't commit to Vogel when speaking with reporters last week, though they wanted to remain patient when making a switch. Many believe their eyes were still on Clippers coach Ty Lue - a figure they coveted in last year's search for a head coach - though it appears Los Angeles is intent on keeping Lue around after their postseason exit.\n\nMoving into the offseason, Phoenix is financially limited in areas they can improve their squad.

What Vogel said he wanted that to be, what the end product wound up as and then the Suns getting defiantly swept in the first round made firing him the team's only available decision after one season.\n\nVogel at his opening press conference in June said \"our number one habit we develop all year is that we have to play harder and tougher and with more hustle than our opponents every night.\" He described it as a \"scrappy as hell\" group and later on in training camp said they will play with pace offensively and get up 3s at a high level.\n\nNone of that came close to translating, not even for just a few weeks. There was not one set, signature style of play. Kevin Durant had a nod to that after the Suns were eliminated.\n\nAll of this was because of Vogel's ineffectiveness at making his principles show up on the floor. At some point, he lost buy-in from his players.\n\nIt's not clear when this happened, and maybe more reports will follow on the why. But his ability to properly motivate them and keep the group focused was nonexistent, as evidenced by over a dozen horrible losses and a few dozen uninspiring victories Phoenix had in the regular season.\n\nEven the Suns' much-hyped closing 10-game stretch of 7-3 included two abysmal efforts against the Los Angeles Clippers and the Oklahoma City Thunder smoking them without Shai Gilgeous-Alexander. The Athletic's post-mortem report on the Suns' season noted that the first Clippers outing was followed by a Vogel postgame outburst that players didn't take seriously, which was properly reflected in their embarrassing play the following night.\n\nThe Suns never reached sustainability, an end goal of sorts to finally begin improving substantially enough to contend. There was no hope of finding constant 48-minute efforts or even just 40. There were only a few all year.\n\nExecution and organization doomed them constantly. The fourth quarter was a nightmare. The types of turnovers mirrored those of a 25-win team. All of the negative trends on the court pointed back to a tremendous lack of connectivity off of it.\n\nPresident of basketball operations and general manager James Jones a few separate times at his end-of-season availability referenced a lack of chemistry and cohesion, noting that the team first has to get on the same page before finding improvement. In a vacuum, those three things are most directly associated with the head coach's starting responsibilities of stabilizing a locker room.\n\nA head coach's fate is always going to be decided by the players, and not just by how they perform. Whether it's a young group that doesn't know any better or a veteran-laden squad that does, how a locker room connects to a coach will dictate the amount of success it can have.\n\nUltimately, on a roster with large figures like the Suns, it can oftentimes come down to a personality match. And that's where the biggest failure in this Suns season was. Devin Booker took on a bigger leadership role with Chris Paul's exit but there was never going to be a definitive top player presence either alongside or behind him. That was always going to have to be the coach, and Phoenix's key decision-makers picked one the team never had unwavering respect for.\n\nAs the season went on, indications that the Suns did not click with Vogel became more and more pronounced and confirmed. At times in the first round, once Vogel was done drawing up his play in the huddle before speaking on specifics, Booker had seen enough and walked away. He wasn't sticking around to hear the particulars or the \"rah-rah speeches.\" There was Bradley Beal's shouting at Vogel, jog-by of his extended hand or Beal's choice not to say, \"Yes, I would love to see coach back this year\" when asked at exit interviews if he wants Vogel to return.\n\nIs all of this Vogel's fault? Of course not. Perhaps the largest concern on the docket for the Suns' future is that their best players appear to be difficult to work with, or at least were for one well-respected head coach. But that's been the case with a lot of talented NBA rosters over the years, and if those three aren't fully bought in with the coach, then what are we doing here? Come on. There was no other choice.\n\nVogel did show this current roster iteration can succeed enough defensively. It finished tied for 12th in defensive rating and actually played better on that end against Minnesota than offensively. There were large spurts of great Suns team defense. The problem is that's not how playoff basketball works, because the small spurts of significant slippage lost them all four games.\n\nBut the undoing of Vogel and his coaching staff was the offensive system. The part we'll never know was how much of this was due to what the staff was emphasizing and running, along with how much of this was the players ignoring them and/or not executing. Either way, it was a complete mess.\n\nPhoenix would go through personality changes mid-game, utilizing player movement to maximize the pressure Beal, Booker and Durant put on a defense to activate ball movement and force defenses to rotate, before halting all of that. The Suns would often run just one set motion, looking for a singular point of attack and either plodding the activity down to go at that or attempting to reset when the space wasn't there, doing so in an awkward way that routinely killed possessions.\n\nThey never consistently found pace when the opportunities presented themselves. If you watched the Suns bench after a defensive rebound against Minnesota, most of the coaches were urging the players to push the tempo.\n\nThe initiation skills of Booker and Beal never properly synergized to run the offense. Booker, a more than capable player with this skillset, was moved off the ball more in January to make Beal the \"point guard.\" This was surely a decision by Vogel and his staff to give Beal a more defined role and make him feel valued, a foolish move in the moment and even more so in hindsight.\n\nThe dynamic was faulty, and even when Beal found success with the position, the capped ceiling was inescapable. Phoenix was 19-6 when Booker had eight-plus assists. The offense was at its best when the balance between the two shifted more toward him. Booker eventually just took over those duties midway through the first round. Too little too late.\n\nThis juggle and the turmoil of however much yelling and extended angst went on behind the scenes had Booker put in his worst regular season since the bubble year. Booker in ways is an easier player to monitor than most because he is always in rhythm. But he didn't have that this year. He rarely found his flow and the disconnect of camaraderie screeched his defensive progression to a full stop, even taking him back down a few notches.\n\nWhy was he not able to play beyond the circumstances like we saw him do at the beginning of his career through all sorts of nonsense and four head coaches in four years? The Suns will hope a fresh start at the top of totem pole is what he needed. Suns owner Mat Ishbia first named \"the head coach\" and Booker as leaders of the team during his availability.\n\nThe usage of Durant bordered on schizophrenia all season. The best of his time in Brooklyn was with him moving into space off the ball through angled screens. Those variations could flow into Durant getting the ball up top to run pick-and-roll, which could then flow into further ball movement. That was small example of how Phoenix's blender could have developed a way to get Durant attacking downhill without initiating to avoid the turnover concerns. From there, once he got rolling, the on-ball work could really explode.\n\nIt was far too hit-or-miss when the Suns would turn to this process, and instead, they relied the most on Durant's mid-post isolations. The good news is this would often bring over double-teams. The bad news is in Game 3 of the regular season, the Los Angeles Lakers stacked that side of the court in a way to properly rotate back in time and Phoenix since then was rarely opportunistic enough through the ball rotations when Durant was doubled, the whole point of running it.\n\nDurant spent a fair amount of time just standing in the corner as a spacer, a way in which the Suns do benefit from his gravity while also giving the defense a break by not even involving him in the action. The Athletic reported Durant was not a huge fan of this. That is not surprising after Williams used him in similar ways.\n\nJones responded to that report, claiming no team has ever maximized Durant before and the Suns want to be the first.\n\nThat is a bold claim, one the new top dog should take note of.\n\nSpeaking of, the replacement for Vogel feels like it has to be someone very specific, a coach who will undoubtedly have the attention of the locker room and reign over it. For the second straight year, we will watch Phoenix circle the Ty Lue wagon over in Los Angeles (metaphorically speaking, of course). For the second straight year, he's the best option by far, with others lacking the proper combination of gusto and comfort. For the second straight year, it is possible Lue won't be on the open market.\n\nThe Suns will be competing to fill a job at the same time as the Los Angeles Lakers.\n\nMike Budenholzer does not seem like that type of leader but is the free agent with the best resume, which is likely why he is \"prominent\" in the search, per ESPN's Adrian Wojnarowski. Maybe Sam Cassell is that type of leader, a 15-year pro who is currently putting in Year No. 15 as an assistant. He doesn't have head coaching experience, though.\n\nScott Brooks does and oversaw the start of Durant's career. Brett Brown seems primed for another opportunity after his time with The Process 76ers, and other uninspiring ex-head coaches include Kenny Atkinson, James Borrego, Dave Joerger and Terry Stotts.\n\nWhen it comes to offense, there are three out-of-the-box suggestions. Does Ishbia get bold, influenced by his own collegiate roots and give a call to UConn's Dan Hurley? Does Ishbia get bold, influenced by nostalgia and give a call to Mike D'Antoni? Does Ishbia get bold, influenced by top-tier podcast content and give a call to JJ Redick?\n\nBecky Hammon is due. Ditto for Miami assistant Chris Quinn. Goodness gracious, is that Mark Jackson's music?!\n\nIt's not great and the Suns have nothing obvious to fall back on. The way their players responded also left them no other way to move forward.", "source": {"uri": "arizonasports.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Arizona Sports"}, "authors": [{"uri":

The Suns plan to run it back, ESPN's Brian Windhorst said on the Rich Eisen Show (hat tip Real GM).\n\n\"Do people in the league say [they may have to break up the Suns]? Yes, they do.

The Suns already have an estimated $206 million payroll for next season, well over the estimated $171 luxury tax line and about $16.3 million above the second apron (and they haven't filled out the roster yet). Being over the second apron means Phoenix does not have a mid-level exception to use this summer, it cannot aggregate multiple contracts in a trade, it cannot take back more money than it sends out in a trade, it cannot send out cash in a trade, and once the season starts it cannot bring in players on the buyout market who made more than the league average salary. Also, the Suns don't control their own first-round draft picks for the next six years, so nothing to trade there.\n\nHowever, it sounds like the Suns will run this back for a year.

Plus, they paired them with an NBA champion coach in Frank Vogel after firing Monty Williams, and it seemed like a pretty good match.\n\nBut, that three-headed monster turned out to be not so monstrous, and things never really gelled in Phoenix all year. After an underachieving 49 wins in the regular season, the Suns were unceremoniously swept by the Minnesota Timberwolves in the first round of the Western Conference Playoffs.\n\nThat meant that someone had to shoulder the blame. It's one thing if you win a a few rounds and come up short with high expectations. But, to be swept by a team whose core had never won a playoff series together meant someone's head had to roll. That head turned out to be Frank Vogel.\n\nVogel was fired by Suns owner Matt Ishbia on Thursday after just one season at the helm. It's reported that former Milwaukee Bucks coach Mike Budenholzer will be a big-time candidate for the job.\n\nThe easiest guy to fire is always the head coach. It's a lot easier to get rid of him than it is underperforming, high-paid players, and the GM isn't going to recommend firing himself. But I'm not sure that was the right play here. At the very least, it may be unfair to Frank Vogel.\n\nUltimately, the pieces of this roster just didn't fit together well, at all. Any time you have three players on max contracts like Booker, Beal, and Durant, your depth is going to suffer. That means that if you're going to build the \"big three\" type of team, those guys have to fit together.\n\nThink of the way that Paul Pierce, Ray, Allen, and Kevin Garnett fit together, and then add in the fact they had a young point guard who wanted to distribute the ball in Rajon Rondo. Meanwhile, the Suns' big three all need the ball in their hands to stay engaged at varying degrees, none of them are great defenders at this stage of their careers, and they're not high-energy players either.\n\nThat's why the real scapegoat should be the move to bring in Bradley Beal. That trade resulted in them trading away a good center who plays decent defense in Deandre Ayton due to money issues later last offseason. Plus, it handicapped their ability to get other players who may fit better, as they pretty much have no assets left to improve the roster with now.\n\nBeal's at his best when he's the primary focus of the offense. That's never going to be the case in Phoenix and is superfluous. No one would claim that Frank Vogel did the best job of his coaching career this year. But, given a team whose pieces didn't fit and a bench devoid of valuable NBA players, squeezing 49 wins out of them may have been an okay job.\n\nUltimately, the Suns are going to have to get lucky this offseason to significantly upgrade their roster to the point it can compete with the top teams in a Western Conference that is seeing young and athletic teams dominate the playoffs so far. No matter who they hire as head coach, that is what will be most important.", "source": {"uri": "brobible.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "BroBible"}, "authors": [{"uri": "garrett_carr@brobible.com", "name": "Garrett Carr", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frank_Vogel", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Frank Vogel"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_Finals", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "NBA Finals"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bradley_Beal", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Bradley Beal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kevin_Durant", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Kevin Durant"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Devin_Booker", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Devin Booker"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monty_Williams", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Monty Williams"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phoenix_Suns", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Phoenix Suns"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minnesota_Timberwolves", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Minnesota Timberwolves"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phoenix,_Arizona", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Phoenix, Arizona"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Phoenix, Arizona"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mike_Budenholzer", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Mike Budenholzer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_Pierce", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Paul Pierce"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Milwaukee_Bucks", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Milwaukee Bucks"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kevin_Garnett", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Kevin Garnett"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_manager", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "General manager"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_Conference_(NBA)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Western Conference (NBA)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Head_coach", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Head coach"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deandre_Ayton", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Deandre Ayton"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_playoffs", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "NBA playoffs"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rajon_Rondo", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Rajon Rondo"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Point_guard", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Point guard"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Basketball_Association", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "National Basketball Association"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Training", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Training", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Alternative/Coaching", "label": "dmoz/Health/Alternative/Coaching", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Coaching", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Coaching", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 88}], "image": "https://brobible.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Frank-Vogel1.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9551156", "eventUri": "eng-9551156", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1450980392156862, "wgt": 182, "relevance": 1}

Minnesota swept the Suns out of the playoffs.\n\nVogel had his missteps this season, and there appeared to be a disconnect between him and the players at times, but he also did a respectable job given the limitations of what he was handed. Vogel can't turn Jusuf Nurkic into Rudy Gobert in the paint. The team was hot to end the season but ran into a Minnesota team that could exploit their weaknesses.\n\nThis firing wouldn't have happened if Durant or Booker lobbied to keep Vogel.\n\nWhoever is next will be the team's third coach in three years.

With Phoenix in a 3-0 hole against Minnesota, Wojnarowski reported there was a belief the coach was on shaky ground:\n\nNBA Countdown colleague Malika Andrews had teed up Wojnarowski with perhaps the decisive factor pointing toward a change already.\n\nPhoenix is hemmed in with the current roster. The front office has exhausted all of its best draft capital in acquiring Kevin Durant and Bradley Beal, and the more restrictive collective bargaining agreement makes it tough to execute even marginal moves in the free-agent and trade markets.\n\nThe Suns' issues weren't all on Vogel to be clear.\n\nBeal missed 29 games in the regular season. The concerns about the absence of a true facilitator were well-founded as the team ranked 24th in assist-to-turnover ratio (1.82). And there was only so much the coaching staff could do to scheme around the lack of depth behind the trio of Beal, Durant and Devin Booker.\n\nBut firing Vogel is the biggest gambit left for the organization in pursuit of a championship with the current core.\n\nThere's basically no way for president of basketball operations James Jones to make any big additions, and trading Beal, Booker or Durant would mean taking a step back in the short term. The one remaining hope is that a different head coach can get more out of the present squad than Vogel could.\n\nThe defensive-minded Vogel was a poor fit with a roster that leaned so heavily into offense following the Beal trade. A new voice in the locker room with a much different scheme could yield positive results.\n\nAfter the way the 2023-24 campaign unfolded, however, it's worth asking whether the Suns, within the context of wanting to be a title contender, are already cooked.\n\nPhoenix didn't encounter an obvious stroke of bad luck that would point to an improvement by running it back.\n\nBeal did miss time but was on the floor for the playoffs, and his production didn't fall dramatically from his Washington Wizards days. He averaged 18.2 points on 51.3 percent shooting (including 43.0 percent on threes) along with 5.0 assists.\n\nDurant, meanwhile, continued to defy Father Time by scoring 27.1 points a night on 52.3 percent shooting and putting up 6.6 rebounds and 5.0 assists per contest.\n\nBooker matched Durant's scoring average (27.1 points) and set a career high in assists (6.9) while serving as the primary floor general for the first unit.\n\nIn the playoffs, the Suns' star trio combined to average 70.8 points and they all played at or near 40 minutes per contest.\n\nAll of that amounted to 49 wins, the eighth-best net rating (plus-3.1), per NBA.com, and a first-round series in which Phoenix looked totally overmatched.\n\nLooking ahead, where is the jump supposed to come from? Maybe the collective returns of Beal, Booker and Durant can be a little more, but how much more? The supporting cast is where the growth really needs to come from, and in that respect you're looking at a lot of reserves who have maxed out already.\n\nThe West isn't shaping up to be any easier, either.\n\nThis era for the Suns is on track to be a case study in asset mismanagement. With a new coach incoming, the 2024 offseason might be the front office and ownership's last shot at avoiding that outcome.", "source": {"uri": "bleacherreport.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Bleacher Report"}, "authors": [{"uri": "joseph_zucker@bleacherreport.com", "name": "Joseph Zucker", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frank_Vogel", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Frank Vogel"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bradley_Beal", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Bradley Beal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kevin_Durant", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Kevin Durant"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phoenix,_Arizona", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Phoenix, Arizona"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Phoenix, Arizona"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Head_coach", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Head coach"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malika_Andrews", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Malika Andrews"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_Countdown", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "NBA Countdown"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mike_Budenholzer", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Mike Budenholzer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adrian_Wojnarowski", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Adrian Wojnarowski"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Milwaukee_Bucks", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Milwaukee Bucks"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phoenix_Suns", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Phoenix Suns"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minnesota_Timberwolves", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Minnesota Timberwolves"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Draft_(sports)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Draft (sports)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_agent", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Free agent"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ESPN", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "ESPN"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minnesota", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Minnesota"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Minnesota"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_playoffs", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "NBA playoffs"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Devin_Booker", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Devin Booker"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assist_(basketball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Assist (basketball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basketball", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Basketball"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rebound_(basketball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Rebound (basketball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Washington_Wizards", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Washington Wizards"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Basketball_Association", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "National Basketball Association"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Professional", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Professional", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Coaching", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Coaching", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Science", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Science", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 99}], "image": "https://media.bleacherreport.com/image/upload/x_23,y_15,w_1768,h_1180,c_crop/c_fill,g_faces,w_3800,h_2000,q_95/v1714329353/vmaauisgknuqtvt7igkd.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9551156", "eventUri": "eng-9551156", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.003921568627450966, "wgt": 179, "relevance": 1}

Would Phoenix consider trading Kevin Durant?\n\nThey are not. The Suns plan to run it back, ESPN's Brian Windhorst said on the Rich Eisen Show (hat tip Real GM).\n\n\"Do people in the league say [they may have to break up the Suns]? Yes, they do. I talk to multiple people who think that's what they're going to have to do that. Do the Suns say that? No, they do not. I think the Suns' intention is to keep all three of these star players. Tweak the roster, tweak some of their systems and processes and try to be better next year.\"\n\nGood luck with that.\n\nThese playoffs have shown the importance of depth and role players, not just stars. Oklahoma City always has shooters on the court, which makes Shai Gilgeous-Alexander tougher to guard. Minnesota is deep with good defenders and athleticism around Anthony Edwards and Karl-Anthony Towns. Denver won a title partly because of guys like Aaron Gordon and (last year) Bruce Brown around Nikola Jokic. No team is deeper than Boston and they remain the betting favorite to win the title.\n\nPhoenix could be better with more health and continuity among Kevin Durant, Devin Booker, and Bradley Beal, but the team lacks defenders and depth. The problem is they have no good way to add those players.\n\nBeal, Booker and Durant are all under contract for next season for a combined $150.6 million -- the salary cap is expected to be $141 million. The Suns already have an estimated $206 million payroll for next season, well over the estimated $171 luxury tax line and about $16.3 million above the second apron (and they haven't filled out the roster yet). Being over the second apron means Phoenix does not have a mid-level exception to use this summer, it cannot aggregate multiple contracts in a trade, it cannot take back more money than it sends out in a trade, it cannot send out cash in a trade, and once the season starts it cannot bring in players on the buyout market who made more than the league average salary. Also, the Suns don't control their own first-round draft picks for the next six years, so nothing to trade there.\n\nHowever, it sounds like the Suns will run this back for a year. Then they may have some hard choices to make.", "source": {"uri": "nbcsports.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "NBC Sports"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_playoffs", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "NBA playoffs"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kevin_Durant", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Kevin Durant"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phoenix,_Arizona", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Phoenix, Arizona"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Phoenix, Arizona"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brian_Windhorst", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Brian Windhorst"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rich_Eisen", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Rich Eisen"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phoenix_Suns", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Phoenix Suns"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minnesota_Timberwolves", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Minnesota Timberwolves"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_manager", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "General manager"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ESPN", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "ESPN"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anthony_Edwards_(actor)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Anthony Edwards (actor)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shai_Gilgeous-Alexander", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Shai Gilgeous-Alexander"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nikola_Joki\u0107", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Nikola Joki\u0107"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Karl-Anthony_Towns", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Karl-Anthony Towns"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aaron_Gordon", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Aaron Gordon"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bradley_Beal", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Bradley Beal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Denver", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Denver"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Denver"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minnesota", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Minnesota"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Minnesota"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boston", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Boston"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Boston"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oklahoma_City", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Oklahoma City"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Oklahoma City"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Devin_Booker", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Devin Booker"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salary_cap", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Salary cap"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Draft_(sports)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Draft (sports)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_salary_cap", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "NBA salary cap"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Professional", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Professional", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Pets/Free_Services", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Pets/Free Services", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 60}], "image": "https://nbcsports.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/5a04543/2147483647/strip/true/crop/1920x1080+0+0/resize/1440x810!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fhdliveextra-a.akamaihd.net%2FHD%2Fimage_sports%2FNBCU_Sports_Group_-_nbcsports%2F561%2F555%2FDbook.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9551156", "eventUri": "eng-9551156", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.09019607843137245, "wgt": 178, "relevance": 1}

The move comes after Phoenix, with the third-highest payroll and tax in the league this season, got swept in the first round of the playoffs by the Minnesota Timberwolves.\n\nVogel, a former NBA champion head coach with the Los Angeles Lakers, signed a five-year, $31 million deal to become Phoenix's head coach just last offseason.

I still always go back to your best players on the floor. That's a narrative we'll hear a lot, point guard, point guard. Sure, that's great. Who do you want? Who is available given the way we're built? Who can fit with this group? Whose game seamlessly fits with this group and when you put that player on the floor and you take the ball out of someone's hands, whose hands are you taking it out of and who are you putting in that position?\n\n\"It's more than just a position, like a point guard or small forward,\" Jones continued. \"It's the actual player that you can get or you do have.

Those guys really rock with each other, so you just gotta figure out who you can put around those guys to complement their personalities, to complement their game, to make things a lot easier for those three guys and then you move on from there.\"\n\nDo you think the Suns need to shift their strategy and get a point guard to help the team?\n\n(Includes reports from The Republic's Duane Rankin).\n\nMore Suns: Kevin Durant trade odds favor Thunder, 76ers, Spurs, Pelicans over star staying with Suns\n\nThis article originally appeared on Arizona Republic: Suns need point guard with Devin Booker, Kevin Durant, Bradley Beal", "source": {"uri": "sports.yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo Sports"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isaiah_Thomas_(basketball)", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Isaiah Thomas (basketball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phoenix_Suns", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Phoenix Suns"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minnesota_Timberwolves", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Minnesota Timberwolves"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Point_guard", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Point guard"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_playoffs", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "NBA playoffs"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Devin_Booker", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Devin Booker"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bradley_Beal", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Bradley Beal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kevin_Durant", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Kevin Durant"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DeMarcus_Cousins", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "DeMarcus Cousins"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stephen_A._Smith", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Stephen A.

We appreciate Frank's hard work and commitment.\"\n\nGranted, the Suns had far more issues than the head coach, namely in having no true point guard, no rim-protecting center, no depth and very little time for Kevin Durant, Devin Booker and Bradley Beal to jell.\n\nBut sure, it was the head coach's fault.\n\nIt turns out that Vogel's former team, the Los Angeles Lakers, also has a coaching vacancy after firing Darvin Ham last week after just two seasons on the job.\n\nSo yes, as you can imagine, Lakers fans and pundits online were connecting some dots after Thursday's news, to varying degrees of seriousness:\n\nOne of the more fun rumors regarding the Lakers' vacancy has been that former player and current ESPN analyst and podcaster J.J. Redick is a potential candidate for the job, though he's never coached before.\n\nThe Lakers will likely cast a wide net as they look to rebound after yet again needing the Play-In Tournament to reach the postseason, only to be eliminated by the Denver Nuggets in just five games during the first round.\n\nAs for Vogel, he could afford to take a year -- or four! -- away from coaching if he so desired after the Suns signed him to a five-year, $31 million deal a year ago. He can choose to be picky about his future prospects, in other words, and returning to the organization that scapegoated him two years ago for their own poorly constructed roster probably wouldn't make much sense.", "source": {"uri": "bleacherreport.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Bleacher Report"}, "authors": [{"uri": "timothy_rapp@bleacherreport.com", "name": "Timothy Rapp", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los_Angeles_Lakers", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles Lakers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Head_coach", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Head coach"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Josh_Bartelstein", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Josh Bartelstein"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Jones_(basketball,_born_1980)", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "James Jones (basketball, born 1980)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frank_Vogel", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Frank Vogel"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phoenix_Suns", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Phoenix Suns"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minnesota_Timberwolves", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Minnesota Timberwolves"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_Ten_Conference", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Big Ten Conference"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_manager", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "General manager"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basketball", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Basketball"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Devin_Booker", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Devin Booker"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Darvin_Ham", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Darvin Ham"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bradley_Beal", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Bradley Beal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Point_guard", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Point guard"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kevin_Durant", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Kevin Durant"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JJ_Redick", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "JJ Redick"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Denver_Nuggets", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Denver Nuggets"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rebound_(basketball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Rebound (basketball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ESPN", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "ESPN"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Health/Alternative/Coaching", "label": "dmoz/Health/Alternative/Coaching", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Cheerleading", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Cheerleading", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Coaching", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Coaching", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 99}], "image": "https://media.bleacherreport.com/image/upload/x_0,y_37,w_1735,h_1150,c_crop/c_fill,g_faces,w_3800,h_2000,q_95/v1715289201/v2coghddjnd80wbf2rfn.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9551156", "eventUri": "eng-9551156", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-05-01", "textStart": 260, "textEnd": 265}], "sentiment": 0.02745098039215677, "wgt": 162, "relevance": 1}

I still always go back to your best players on the floor. That's a narrative we'll hear a lot, point guard, point guard. Sure, that's great. Who do you want?

There was so much hope for the team this season due to having a three-headed scoring monster with Kevin Durant, Devin Booker, and Bradley Beal. However, the front office's grand plans on paper were shredded as the season played out.\n\nAlso Read: 10 NBA trades we'd love to see this summer, including Trade Young trade out West\n\nThey did a poor job of putting the right pieces around their big three and Beal was a major letdown after posting numbers below his All-Star norms and he only suited up in 53 games. There have been rumors either of the three could be moved this season. Booker would have the most value but Beal is the player the Suns would love to move.\n\nUnfortunately, he has two years and a player option worth as much as $160 million left on his contract. While they may not like what they get in return, one league executive told FOX Sports NBA insider Ric Bucher this week that \"Beal is toxic debt now [but] you have to move on before Book and KD demand trades and you lose leverage in the marketplace.\"\n\nWith that in mind, let's look at three potential bad contract swaps the Phoenix Suns could make to get out from under Bradley Beal's contract and improve their cap space long-term.\n\nThe Suns have enough scoring with Durant and Booker. They need a good floor general to get their stars the ball where they want and play good defense on opposing guards. That is why Chicago Bulls guard Lonzo Ball could be an option. He missed the last two seasons due to a knee injury, but all signs point to him returning in 2024-25 and he recently picked up his player option.\n\nThe Bulls would love to move on from this deal, and Beal could be a solid backup plan if they lose DeMar DeRozan in free agency. The move is risky for both but at least Beal could play like an All-Star next season while it's unclear if Ball will even play at all. But if he doesn't Phoenix still slashes $30 million from their books and his deal expires after the season.\n\nAlso Read: Phoenix Suns decision on Frank Vogel's future to reportedly come 'soon'\n\nSpeaking of an always-injured point guard, Ben Simmons has been a disaster for the Brooklyn Nets the last two seasons. While he has played more than Ball, it hasn't been by much and his numbers haven't been good. While the Nets already have Cam Thomas and Beal on the roster, if they move the former in a deal to address the frontcourt then Beal would make sense.\n\nFurthermore, moving on from Simmons would perk up Brooklyn's ears. For the Suns, if he can play he is the ball handler, rebounder, and defensive player they could use. But if he can't suit up he is still only signed for 2024-25.\n\nAndrew Wiggins has seemingly regressed to the player he was before helping the Warriors win a championship two years ago. His name has been in trade rumors for weeks and is likely to be moved this summer. While he is signed for three more years, it is at a far lower price than Beal, and that is why Kevon Looney would have to be thrown into the deal.\n\nThe Suns get a nice defensive player they can slot between Durant and Booker to guard the opposing team's best wingmen.

With their ballooning payroll making it virtually impossible to improve the roster without blowing it up, it always seemed likely a change would come at head coach.\n\nNow, the Suns will look for a replacement who will likely have to win with the pieces they already have, and they're expected to decide within the next week between a small pool of candidates, according to 98.7 FM Phoenix's John Gambadoro.\n\nHere's a look at some names that could come up, with hypothetical odds for their chances to land the job.\n\n9. Darvin Ham (+2500)\n\nHam suffered a similar fate as Vogel, losing in the first round with a team expected to perform better than the talent it actually has. This wouldn't be a good match for either side.\n\n8. Steve Nash (+2000)\n\nWith Kyrie Irving and James Harden out the picture, maybe Nash and Durant would consider a reunion in Phoenix. They were supposedly close before Nash came to Brooklyn and things came tumbling down.\n\n7. Adrian Griffin (+1500)\n\nNBA players talk, so if things didn't go well between Griffin and the stars in Milwaukee, I'm not sure he'd have a place in Phoenix. But you never know. Maybe things weren't that bad with the Bucks.\n\n6. Kenny Atkinson (+1200)\n\nThe coach who was forced out of Brooklyn when Durant and Kyrie Irving decided to come to town, this might finally be Atkinson's chance to show KD what he's about.\n\n5. Scott Brooks (+1000)\n\nAn assistant for the Portland Trail Blazers last season, Brooks has experience coaching both Durant and Beal. So, he may have some fans in the building.\n\n4. David Fizdale (+800)\n\nFizdale is someone the Suns are already familiar with, as he was an assistant coach for Phoenix last season.\n\n3. J.J. Redick (+600)\n\nRedick has to be mentioned here because he seems to be a hot name on the coaching block, but I doubt Phoenix wants to go the unexperienced route here.\n\n2. Mike D'Antoni (+400)\n\nD'Antoni has a lot of history with this franchise, and plenty experience coaching stars. Maybe he'd be able to get the most out of the offensive talent on this team.\n\n1. Mike Budenholzer (+250)\n\nThe only championship-winning coach on this list, Budenholzer beat these Suns to win his only title and he's a prominent candidate for the job, according to Wojnarowski.", "source": {"uri": "ftw.usatoday.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "For The Win"}, "authors": [{"uri": "prince_j_grimes@ftw.usatoday.com", "name": "Prince J.

His production fell to 16.5 points and the Suns shocking were swept in the first round by Minnesota.\n\nTo say it was a disappointing season is a vast understatement, and Beal has two seasons and $103.8 million remaining on his deal plus a player option for the next one that is worth $57.1 million. Plus he has a no-trade provision.\n\nESPN's Bobby Marks, a former Brooklyn Nets executive, ripped the Suns about making the trade for Beal by calling the no-trade clause \"a killer,\" suggesting the team should have insisted that the clause be removed before acquiring Beal from Washington. Now the Suns are stuck with him, Marks said.\n\n\"I don't think the Bradley Beal contract is movable,\" he said while speaking to Sports360AZ, a multimedia platform covering Arizona athletics. \"... It's the worst contract in the NBA right now.\"\n\nHe took it a step deeper on an ESPN podcast, again emphasizing the problem with the no-trade provision.\n\n\"That should have been a walkaway\" for the Suns, he said. \"Now you are married, again, to that no-trade clause and probably the most toxic contract in NBA history. Bradley Beal's a good player. Bradley Beal's not a $50-million-per-year player. He's not worth the $160 million left on his contract.\"\n\nHe wasn't alone in his criticism. Chris Broussard and Rob Parker pounded away, too, on a recent edition of their Fox Sports Radio show the \"Odd Couple.\" They compared Beal's deal to that of the one the Los Angeles Clippers have with Kawhi Leonard, who also is injury prone and played in just two of the six games in the first-round playoff series his team lost to Dallas. Leonard is due $50 million in each of the next two seasons.\n\n\"Bradley Beal is arguably the (NBA's) worst contract,\" Brussard said. \"... Bradly Beal's contract, Rob, probably is even worse that Kawhi's because Kawai actually plays a little more than Beal and he's obviously better.\"\n\nParker: \"Who in the world is trading for\" Beal?\n\nBroussard: \"Nobody. It's a miracle the Suns traded for him. Here's the other thing, Rob. He's got a no-trade clause.\"\n\nParker: \"How the hell did he earn that?\"\n\nBroussard: \"I don't know, but again congrats to the agent and Beal himself because you all did a heck of a job.\"\n\nBroussard suggest the Suns should trade Durant for several younger players.\n\n\"There's nothing (they) can do with Beal, (they're) stuck with that,\" he said. \"See what you can get for Durant ... some young talent that fits with Devin Booker.\"\n\n0 Comments", "source": {"uri": "stltoday.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "St. Louis Post-Dispatch"}, "authors": [{"uri":

Of course, fans and analysts are questioning star forward Kevin Durant's status with Phoenix along with his basketball legacy. Former Celtics star Paul Pierce provided an optimistic take on Durant's legacy amid his postseason struggles.\n\nPierce does not believe Durant is doing anything wrong by playing for the Suns. However, he must find a way to enhance his all-time standing after four straight early playoff exits.\n\n\"If I'm Kevin Durant, this is like a critical moment. He ain't doing nothing to hurt his legacy but he has has to make a decision of how or where he can go to elevate it even more,\" Pierce told Kevin Garnett via All the Smoke Productions.\n\n\"He's set in stone, one of the greatest already. But where can he go and where can he play, what can he do to take it to another level by maybe winning another championship? Is that going to be in Phoenix? Or is that going to be somewhere else?\" Pierce added.\n\nPaul Pierce believes Durant must find a way to elevate his team to true title contention or join another team to increase his chances. The former Celtics star could see Durant going back to the Bay to play with Stephen Curry and the Golden State Warriors.\n\nMeanwhile, Kevin Garnett likes the idea of Durant going back to New York. There, he could join the rapidly rising Knicks instead of reuniting with the Brooklyn Nets. Both former Celtics have a point, but as Pierce briefly mentioned, Durant must first see if he can make things work with the Suns.\n\nPhoenix has plenty of talent and is just a tweak away from getting back to the top of the NBA.\n\nHow can Suns, Kevin Durant bounce back for 2024-25?\n\nKevin Durant trade rumors erupted after Phoenix's 4-0 series loss to the Timberwolves. The Suns have not been able to escape the second round of the playoffs since Durant joined the team in 2023. Thus, many believe he could want to play elsewhere, just as he desired when things did not work out on the Nets.\n\nHowever, the Suns have no plans of moving Durant in the offseason, per insight from ClutchPoints' Brett Siegel. They are committed to improving the team around their trio of Durant, Devin Booker, and Bradley Beal. So, how can the stars overcome the hump in the West?\n\nThe answer could lie in a change in the center position.\n\nJusuf Nurkic is a serviceable big man who can rebound and get needed interior points. He averaged a healthy double-double of 10.9 points and 11.0 rebounds per game in 2023-24. Yet, the Suns should consider going for a center who is a true rim protector.\n\nPhoenix needs someone to be a defensive anchor to compensate for Durant, Booker, and Beal's focus on offense.\n\nNets center Nic Claxton would be a great fit for Phoenix. He has been top-10 in blocks for the past two regular seasons. In addition, he has chemistry with Durant from their shared time in Brooklyn. The main issue with Claxton is his unrestricted free agency. He is expected to command a contract in the $20 million per year range.\n\nIt is no secret the Suns are paying their stars a hefty load, but if they can ship off enough assets to make the money work, they could find the solution to their problems in Claxton.\n\nAll in all, Kevin Durant's legacy is honorable and has the opportunity to grow. As Celtics legend Paul Pierce alluded, the two-time champion has to find a way to take his current or future team to the next level to further rise the all-time rankings.", "source": {"uri": "clutchpoints.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "ClutchPoints"}, "authors": [{"uri": "christopher_smith@clutchpoints.com", "name": "Christopher Smith", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_playoffs", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "NBA playoffs"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_Pierce", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Paul Pierce"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boston_Celtics", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Boston Celtics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kevin_Durant", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Kevin Durant"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phoenix,_Arizona", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Phoenix, Arizona"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Phoenix, Arizona"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kevin_Garnett", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Kevin Garnett"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minnesota_Timberwolves", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Minnesota Timberwolves"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phoenix_Suns", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Phoenix Suns"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basketball", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Basketball"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stephen_Curry", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Stephen Curry"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brooklyn_Nets", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Brooklyn Nets"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_Knicks", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "New York Knicks"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golden_State_Warriors", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Golden State Warriors"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Basketball_Association", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "National Basketball Association"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Double-double", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Double-double"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Devin_Booker", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Devin Booker"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jusuf_Nurki\u0107", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Jusuf Nurki\u0107"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bradley_Beal", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Bradley Beal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rebound_(basketball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Rebound (basketball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_agent", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Free agent"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brooklyn", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Brooklyn"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Brooklyn"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Science/Astronomy/Stars", "label": "dmoz/Science/Astronomy/Stars", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Professional", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Professional", "wgt": 9}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Bodyart/Studios", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Bodyart/Studios", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Bodyart/Piercing", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Bodyart/Piercing", "wgt": 18}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/History", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/History", "wgt": 8}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 95}], "image": "https://wp.clutchpoints.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Suns-news-Paul-Pierce-will-catch-Kevin-Durants-attention-with-eye-opening-legacy-message.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9551156", "eventUri": "eng-9551156", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1607843137254903, "wgt": 139, "relevance": 1}

Ultimately, you just can't play without a point guard. Even if it's you play a point guard five to 10 minutes each and every half, that's enough.\n\n\"It was taking a toll on a guy like Bradley Beal, it was taking a toll on a guy like Devin Booker. Even Kevin Durant.\"\n\nThomas worked his way back onto an NBA roster after a bout of injuries in the past few seasons and made the postseason roster despite not being in the regular rotation.\n\nHe last played for the Charlotte Hornets in 2022 but used a stint with the G League's Salt Lake City Stars as a launching pad to sign with Phoenix in March.\n\nFrom there, he served as an active veteran voice alongside midseason pickup Thaddeus Young.\n\nThomas said on the Bully Ball podcast that head coach Frank Vogel put his best players \"in a position to do a helluva job\" considering the circumstances but added the first-round sweep of the Timberwolves was about the Suns not being able to match Minnesota's energy.\n\n\"I think it just paid a toll on us in a series where we played against a young, energetic, physical team that kind of knew, like, 'We're going to pressure these guys the whole game to see if they can last,'\" Thomas said of the T-Wolves.\n\nSo what's Thomas' perspective on the Suns' current roster structure beyond the point guard issue? Are there problems festering?\n\nHe's quite aware Phoenix is in a tight spot financially.\n\nAs worries by Suns fans about Kevin Durant and Devin Booker's unhappiness are perpetuated by national trade rumors and hearsay, Thomas is not as concerned about the team figuring things out around its trio of star players.\n\n\"I don't think they're going to trade any of them. When we played well and those guys really played well, you seen what it could look like ... it was just inconsistency at times,\" Thomas said. \"But those guys really rocked with each other. You just got to figure out who you can put around those guys to complement their personalities, to complement their game, to make things a lot easier for those three guys. And then you move on from there. Like you said, there's not a lot of options you can go to.\n\n\"Hopefully I'm around to be able to, you know, make things easier for those guys.

You can talk about it tomorrow on First Take. KD and I had a lengthy conversation. Listen, I'm not into basketball and people like KD and LeBron and some of these other players that I know, they confide in me. And I asked if it was OK to talk about tonight on Nightcap and it just so happens, boom, it comes up.\n\n\"And he said he would have no problem coming down to Miami, if it made sense.\"\n\nOh boy.\n\nMore Suns: Kevin Durant trade odds favor Thunder, 76ers, Spurs, Pelicans over star staying with Suns\n\nKevin Durant trade speculation swirls after Johnson's Miami Heat comments\n\nKevin Durant trade talk had already been circulating before Johnson's comments, but the trade chatter started swirling around the Heat and other teams after his comments.\n\nFansided proposed a 3-team deal with the Heat, Spurs and Suns that sent Durant to Miami and Jimmy Butler, two first-round picks and two first-round pick swaps to Phoenix.\n\nTyler Watts wrote: \"The Suns get a proven winner in Jimmy Butler and two first-round draft picks to make further moves. They should target a defensive anchor and a point guard to organize their offense. This trade could make Phoenix an immediate threat, especially if they use the draft capital wisely.\"\n\nFansided also continued to speculate about Durant potentially landing with the Golden State Warriors.\n\nIt had Phoenix sending Durant to Golden State for Brandin Podziemski, Moses Moody, Gary Payton II, Andrew Wiggins, Jonathan Kuminga, two first-round picks, two first-round pick swaps and two second-round picks.\n\nLior Lampert wrote: \"As for Phoenix, this is not a bad trade if the Suns. You can retool and rebuild around Devin Booker and Bradley Beal, receiving five players who could immediately contribute, plus ammunition to make corresponding moves. However, the ceiling of this roster notably declines, which would make getting the former to sign off on giving up Durant for a multi-year roster overhaul a dangerously daunting task. Moreover, this deal offers the franchise little to no financial relief. So, why not continue to use that money toward a proven commodity and perennial All-Star?\"\n\nTrade Kevin Durant? We asked national NBA media how to fix Phoenix Suns\n\nThe Knicks were brought up as a potential landing spot for Durant by ESPN's Zach Lowe.\n\n\"The most obvious one is Durant for some portion of the Villanova Knicks and draft equity,\" Lowe explained on a recent episode of \"The Lowe Post\" podcast. \"If I'm the Knicks, I gotta see how I do in the playoffs. I kind of like the Villanova Knicks. My fans love the Villanova Knicks. Kevin Durant is 36 years old. Okay, not sure I want to do it.\"\n\nOf course, it wouldn't be trade rumor season without someone speculating about Durant ending up with the Los Angeles Lakers.\n\nLake Show Life had Phoenix receiving Austin Reaves, Jarred Vanderbilt, Rui Hachimura, Gabe Vincent and three first-round draft picks for Durant.\n\nJosh Cornelissen wrote: \"Could the Phoenix Suns find a better offer from another team? Perhaps, but Kevin Durant doesn't want to go play for a team that is not ready to contend, and it's unlikely those teams would want to pay through the nose for a player who will turn 36 before next season. The first-round picks also hold a lot of value given that LeBron and Durant will have likely retired by the time the latter two pay out.\"\n\nPhoenix Suns' Isaiah Thomas: Point guard 'missing piece' against Minnesota Timberwolves\n\nEven the San Antonio Spurs were speculated as a potential trade partner with the Suns for Durant, with Air Alamo having San Antonio send Keldon Johnson, Devonte Graham, Zach Collins and two first-round picks to Phoenix for Durant.\n\nCal Durrett wrote: \"As far as a potential trade, the Spurs could theoretically offer up Keldon Johnson, Devonte Graham, Zach Collins, Chicago's 2025 first, and Charlotte's 2025 first (which would become two seconds if it doesn't convey) for Durant. That would be a fascinating deal for both the Spurs and the Suns. The Suns have traded away most of their assets to build their roster but after a first-round sweep, they have limited ways to improve. That might increase the chances they oblige KD if he were to request a trade. Getting back a starting-caliber wing in Johnson, an offensive big in Collins, and a backup point guard in Graham, as well as two potential firsts for Durant, would be a solid return for a 36-year-old star. But would the Spurs do the deal?\"\n\nWe think the better question would be: Would the Suns do that deal, or any of the above deals for Kevin Durant?\n\nWe have serious doubts, but NBA trade

It also was the first year of the \"Big 3\" -- Kevin Durant, Devin Booker, and Bradley Beal -- playing together.\n\nThe 2023-24 Suns were an example of a roster built around three or more All-Stars via blockbuster trades and free agency drawing championship expectations. When things don't work out, it's easier to get rid of the coach than a star player who carries a hefty contract.\n\nHere are some more examples of coaches fired from Super Teams that fell short over the past decade.\n\nMonty Williams, Phoenix Suns\n\nMaking the Suns relevant again in the tough West and league overall, plus Williams' personal achievements during his four years in Phoenix didn't matter when he was fired last year. Those achievements included a trip to the 2021 finals, which Phoenix lost, and a record-setting 64 franchise wins the following year. He earned the 2021 NBCA Coach of the Year and 2022 NBA Coach of the Year, and had the third-best winning percentage in Suns' history (.628).\n\nAfter the Suns, under new owner Mat Ishbia, acquired Kevin Durant from the Brooklyn Nets in February 2023 to form their first version of the Big 3 with Booker and Chris Paul, expectations soared. But Phoenix was demolished at home for the second straight year in a series-closing Game 6 of the same round to eventual champion Denver in May 2023. Williams was replaced by Vogel soon after.\n\nSteve Nash, Brooklyn Nets\n\nThe Suns legend and Hall of Famer Steve Nash was a rookie head coach in September 2020. He got the ax two years after that when the Brooklyn Nets' Big 3 couldn't get over the hump in the postseason.\n\nJames Harden, Kyrie Irving, and Durant played just 17 regular season games together for the Nets, with injuries a factor and Irving's league suspension in November 2022 that resulted in eight games missed for posting an anti-Semitic video on social media.\n\nBrooklyn completed a four-team trade to get Harden from Houston, which included a whopping eight of Brooklyn's future first-round draft picks in exchange for him in January 2021. In their first season together, they lost to the eventual 2021 champion Milwaukee Bucks in the East semifinals' Game 7 after the Nets took 2-0 and 3-2 series leads. The next season, the Nets were swept out of the first round by Boston. Durant demanded a trade upon the first day of free agency in 2022, and gave an ultimatum to either upload his trade request or have Nash and Nets GM Sean Marks fired. Durant ultimately rescinded his trade request shortly before training camp, but Nash and the team agreed to part ways on Nov. 1, 2022. He finished with a 94-67 record.\n\nAdrian Griffin, Milwaukee Bucks\n\nGriffin was fired in January, seven months after he got the job to replace former coach Mike Budenholzer, who was canned after the Bucks lost in the first round as a top seed to No. 8 Miami in the 2023 playoffs. That was two years after Budenholzer led Milwaukee to its first world title in 50 years.\n\nIn September 2023, the Bucks completed a three-team trade in which they got perennial All-Star Damian Lillard from Portland to have him join their two-time MVP Giannis Antetokounmpo and three-time All-Star Khris Middleton.\n\nWhen Griffin was let go, \"30-13\" was the No. 1 social media trend in reaction to the news because that was Milwaukee's record at the time as a top-three team in the East. There were multiple reports that he lost respect of the players in the locker room, and refused to listen to him in team huddles during games. Antetokounmpo said he was surprised by the decision but had to \"trust the front office\" toward winning a title. Griffin was replaced by Doc Rivers, and the Bucks were eliminated on May 2 as a No. 3 seed to No. 6 Indiana during the first round.\n\nMore Suns:Isaiah Thomas: Point guard 'missing piece' against Timberwolves\n\nDoc Rivers, Philadelphia 76ers\n\nRivers coached Philadelphia for three seasons to replace Brett Brown after their 2020 playoff run ended in the first round. Once the 76ers got Harden after his trade request from Brooklyn in February 2022, their title odds spiked as he was paired with last season's MVP Joel Embiid.\n\nRivers, who won the 2008 title as the Boston Celtics coach, and coached the Los Angeles Clippers for seven years thereafter, added to his unfavorable history of Game 7s last year (6-10). The 76ers, which finished as the East's No. 3 seed, were blown out by his former team Boston in the decisive series closer, after they held a 3-2 series lead. Rivers was terminated two days after losing to Boston.\n\nMike Brown, L.A. Lakers\n\nMike Brown was hired by the Lakers in May 2011 after Phil Jackson's final season with the team. After they had a 41-25 record under him and were eliminated in the second round in the following year, the Lakers made massive trades for five All-Stars. They acquired Dwight Howard from Orlando and Nash from Phoenix to group them with Kobe Bryant, Pau Gasol and Metta World Peace.\n\nThe team didn't win any of its eight preseason games, and had a 1-4 start under Brown before his departure, which is the third-fastest coaching change in league history.\n\nDavid Blatt, Cleveland Cavaliers\n\nBlatt was a former EuroLeague Coach of the Year when he was hired by Cleveland in 2014. When LeBron James left Miami as a free agent after four straight finals runs and two titles, the Cavaliers dealt their No. 1 overall pick Andrew Wiggins to Minnesota in the 2014 off-season for All-Star big Kevin Love. That formed the Cavaliers' core of Love, James and their other then-rising star, Irving.\n\nThe Cavaliers finished 53-29, was the East's second seed, and lost in the finals to the Golden State Warriors. The following season in late January, Blatt was fired as the Cavaliers were atop the conference on a 30-11 record. The team's former GM David Griffin cited \"a lack of fit with our personnel and our vision.\" Blatt was replaced by Tyronn Lue, and they beat Golden State as the only team to ever overcome a 3-1 deficit in the finals.", "source": {"uri": "azcentral.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "AZ Central"}, "authors": [{"uri": "dana_scott@azcentral.com", "name": "Dana Scott", "type": "author",

And not necessarily saying just because I'm on the team that we need to play a point guard, even before I got on the squad, from afar, looking at the Phoenix Suns I always felt like, when it came to the playoffs that kind of would be a missing piece. Ultimately you just can't play without a point guard.\"\n\nThe Suns averaged nearly 15 turnovers per night, tied for sixth-worst in the NBA. Phoenix's fourth quarter net rating of -11.6 was also dead last in the league.\n\nWhen speaking to reporters last week, Suns general manager James Jones offered this perspective on the point guard chatter:\n\n\"I think the team could benefit from having a point guard,\" Jones said.\n\n\"I believe the team could benefit from having backup forwards, backup centers. I still always go back to your best players on the floor. That's a narrative we'll hear a lot, point guard, point guard. Sure, that's great. Who do you want?

Meanwhile, Booker evolved into arguably the league's top shooting guard, averaging 27.1 points on 49.2 percent shooting this season.\n\nBooker and the Suns were swept in the first round of the playoffs by the Minnesota Timberwolves, leaving their future in jeopardy. Two-thirds of their Big Three, Kevin Durant and Bradley Beal, were acquired last offseason, making them potentially more difficult to part ways with. On the alternative, Booker is a desirable addition for almost any championship contender.\n\nWith his name entering trade rumors due to the disappointing exit for Phoenix, the Heat are an organization that comes to mind. Moving on from the inconsistencies of Tyler Herro is a consistent theme. He is one of their young pieces that could persuade Phoenix into a deal.\n\nThe Heat could find their necessary third star to pair with Jimmy Butler and Bam Adebayo, fully committing to a title run. The Suns make the tough decision of trading away their 'franchise guy' in hopes that more depth will better help them compete for a ring. Philadelphia acts as the mediator in this trade, adding minor pieces who could help them acquire a star down the road.\n\nCleveland Cavaliers guard Donovan Mitchell is atop the Heat's offseason wish list, but adding Booker is perhaps an even better solution to push them over the hump.\n\nAnthony Pasciolla works as a contributing writer to Inside the Heat.

Rumor season won't start for another month, but in the meantime, one possible option to consider would be Bradley Beal.\n\nIt sounds ridiculous knowing what Beal is paid and the season he just had in Phoenix. However, Bleacher Report's Greg Swartz explained how Beal still maintains some appeal despite his gargantuan contract.\n\n\"Beal averaged 18.2 points, 5.0 assists, 4.4 rebounds, and 1.0 steals per game this season on a modest 22.7 percent usage rate while shooting a career-high 51.3 percent overall and 43.0 percent from three. His contract (three years, $160.1 million) is rough, but it would look better if he wasn't deferring to two other alpha scorers on a regular basis,\" Swartz wrote.\n\nSwartz explained why Beal wasn't the proper fit in Phoenix and how he would fit better elsewhere.\n\n\"Not having a true point guard on the roster didn't help Phoenix, either,\" Swartz wrote. \"Beal would thrive in a new situation where he gets more shot opportunities and can play alongside a pass-first floor general.\"\n\nBut why would the Kings want him? Swartz explained very briefly why they would have interest in him.\n\n\"The Sacramento Kings might be on the hunt for more star power alongside De'Aaron Fox and Domantas Sabonis.\"\n\nSwartz named the Kings among the teams who would be among the best landing spots for Beal should he become available. While Beal could give the Kings more of a scoring spark, his no-trade clause ultimately determines whether a Kings trade would come to fruition. And that would all depend on if the Suns plan to get rid of him.\n\nBeal's intriguing as a trade option, but it appears that he won't be on the market for the time being. ESPN's Brian Windhorst acknowleged that people around the league believe the Suns may break it up. However, he has heard different.\n\n\"Do people in the league say that?\" Windhorst on the May 6 episode of The Rich Eisen Show. \"Yes, they do. I talk to multiple people who think that's what they're going to have to do that. Do the Suns say that? No, they do not.\n\n\"I think the Suns' intention is to keep all three of these star players. Tweak the roster, tweak some of their systems and processes and try to be better next year.\"\n\nThe Suns will likely see if they can assemble a better roster around their three stars, do some renovations with their coaching staff, and try their best to conserve their guys for another postseason run.\n\nWhile such an approach makes sense, how long of a leash Beal has is something to keep an eye on. The experiment did not work out nearly as well as the Suns would have liked. If it only get worse from here, that could drive down Beal's value, which could make him easier for the Kings to pick up.", "source": {"uri": "aroyalpain.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "A Royal Pain"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bradley_Beal", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Bradley Beal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phoenix,_Arizona", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Phoenix, Arizona"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Phoenix, Arizona"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sacramento_Kings", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Sacramento Kings"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_playoffs", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "NBA playoffs"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steal_(basketball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Steal (basketball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phoenix_Suns", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Phoenix Suns"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charlotte_Hornets", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Charlotte Hornets"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bleacher_Report", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Bleacher Report"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assist_(basketball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Assist (basketball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rebound_(basketball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Rebound (basketball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rich_Eisen", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Rich Eisen"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domantas_Sabonis", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Domantas Sabonis"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Point_guard", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Point guard"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/De'Aaron_Fox", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "De'Aaron Fox"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trade_(sports)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Trade (sports)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ESPN", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "ESPN"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Advice", "label": "dmoz/Society/Advice", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Pets/Free_Services", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Pets/Free Services", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 99}], "image": "https://images2.minutemediacdn.com/image/upload/c_crop,w_4738,h_2665,x_0,y_42/c_fill,w_1440,ar_16:9,f_auto,q_auto,g_auto/images/GettyImages/mmsport/88/01hxdcca8apxqz1jksq2.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9551156", "eventUri": "eng-9551156", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-05-06", "textStart": 2057, "textEnd": 2062}], "sentiment": 0.06666666666666665, "wgt": 125, "relevance": 1}

But after a 121-110 loss to the Phoenix Suns on Tuesday and a 31-48 record, the franchise will leave it without even a playoff appearance.\n\nMany questions lie ahead for the historic franchise this offseason, least of which is the future of coach Frank Vogel. The 48-year-old, who took over the Lakers in 2019 and helped lead the team to a championship in his first season, faces the possibility of not returning to the sideline after a lackluster 2021-22.\n\nIn an exclusive 30-minute interview with The Athletic, Vogel spoke about what's next for him in Los Angeles and tried to explain what exactly went wrong for a team with such high aspirations. He said he tried his best to tune out outside noise about his job security.\n\n\"It's not easy to shut it out,\" Vogel said. \"It's not fun to have those reports hanging over your head or seeing it everywhere you look, especially so early in the season (and) after what we've been able to accomplish here. But to me, that pressure of expectation has been here since the day I signed on.\"\n\nVogel put some of this season's poor record on his team's overall health, as stars like Anthony Davis and LeBron James missed considerable time with injuries.\n\n\"Every game, you're fighting against the current of healthier teams or teams that have more continuity,\" Vogel said. \"Or teams that are just better. Meaning your margin for error is very slim.\"\n\nOne player who did not miss time was former MVP guard Russell Westbrook, who was acquired from the Washington Wizards in exchange for Kyle Kuzma, Montrezl Harrell, Kentavious Caldwell-Pope and a late first-round pick. Westbrook averaged 18.5 points, 7.4 rebounds and 7.1 assists on the season but struggled with efficiency in an up-and-down year. He averaged 29.8 percent on 3.4 3-point attempts a game.\n\nVogel admitted the team struggled when Westbrook did not have both James and Davis on the floor with him.\n\n\"We did not win at a high rate with Russ and another star and the rest of our role players,\" Vogel said. \"Whether it was Russ and AD with Bron out or Russ and Bron with AD out, we just haven't won in those situations.\"\n\nAs for what's next, Vogel wouldn't comment on the situation, saying, \"We'll cross that bridge when we get there.\"\n\nFor more from Vogel on what lies ahead and what went wrong for the Lakers, read the full exclusive interview in the Go Deeper section below.\n\nBill Oram, Lakers beat writer: The key takeaway for readers should be just how aware Vogel is of the issues the Lakers faced this season. Yes, there were key injuries that certainly prevented the Lakers from reaching their full potential, but there were other serious problems with the roster, especially on the defensive side of the ball.\n\nAs Vogel alluded to, the Lakers did not have the personnel to credibly fix one major problem without creating another one. That left Vogel to ping-pong all season between lineups that prioritized spacing around Westbrook and ones with defensive size that created issues offensively.\n\nVogel called it his most challenging season as an NBA head coach, and it's easy to understand why.\n\nOram: While Vogel wouldn't engage on this topic in any form, my sense is that he is anticipating the other shoe dropping just like most fans and media members.\n\nVogel is not the chief culprit in this losing season, but he certainly has his share of accountability, and after the Lakers left him hanging in the wind with a one-year extension in the offseason -- leaving him to a year of speculation about whether he would be fired -- it is almost impossible to envision a scenario where the Lakers do not move on from Vogel.", "source": {"uri": "theathletic.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Athletic"}, "authors": [{"uri": "bill_oram@theathletic.com", "name": "Bill Oram", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frank_Vogel", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Frank Vogel"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los_Angeles_Lakers", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles Lakers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russell_Westbrook", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Russell Westbrook"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Athletic", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "The Athletic"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Naismith_Memorial_Basketball_Hall_of_Fame", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phoenix_Suns", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Phoenix Suns"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_Finals", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "NBA Finals"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LeBron_James", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "LeBron James"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los_Angeles", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anthony_Davis", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Anthony Davis"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kyle_Kuzma", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Kyle Kuzma"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Montrezl_Harrell", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Montrezl Harrell"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kentavious_Caldwell-Pope", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Kentavious Caldwell-Pope"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_Most_Valuable_Player_Award", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "NBA Most Valuable Player Award"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rebound_(basketball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Rebound (basketball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Washington_Wizards", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Washington Wizards"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Head_coach", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Head coach"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Basketball_Association", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "National Basketball Association"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Professional", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Professional", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Show_Basketball", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Show Basketball", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/History", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/History", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 99}], "image": "https://cdn.theathletic.com/app/uploads/2022/04/10183036/XUHpkYeCdyyi_XUHpkYeCdyyi_k4mpLd5lRi5c_original_1440x960.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9551156", "eventUri": "eng-9551156", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.0117647058823529, "wgt": 116, "relevance": 1}

The Suns ended up in the bristles, swept out of the first round of the playoffs, sentenced to an offseason of turbulence.\n\nTurns out, the delay in the former might be to accommodate the latter. The latest and hottest rumor is that Durant would consider a trade to the Miami Heat, if it makes sense to all parties involved. Former NFL wide receiver Chad \"Ochocinco\" Johnson said Durant told him as much in a lengthy conversation, apparently allowing Johnson to go public with the information.\n\nThat says a lot.\n\nIf true, it means Durant has greenlighted another runway departure in his nomadic career.\n\nIf true, it means Durant feels no responsibility or accountability to the current cause or mission in Phoenix.\n\nIf true, it means he's cool abandoning Devin Booker. And that's what worries me most.\n\nBut let's rewind a moment: Vogel was a bad fit for this group from the very beginning. He is not confrontational. He pandered to his star players by always harping on the officiating, choosing to punch down in times of real adversity. He is the rare defensive-minded head coach who is NOT confrontational by nature. As a result, there was a lethal leadership vacuum at the top of the organization.\n\nDurant's alleged unhappiness was first reported on Christmas Day, and Durant soon retorted with a string of stellar performances. But as the season wore on, there were many random scenes where Durant looked unhappy and unconvinced, far removed from the huddle. A damning report in The Athletic detailed how Durant felt unhappy and misused in the Suns' offense. The story also included an alarming anecdote of a desperate and angry Vogel screaming at the top of his lungs, attempting to save a sinking team while his players rolled their eyes.\n\nIn professional sports, you can transform from hardline authoritarian to a user-friendly players' coach. Tom Coughlin did it and won a Super Bowl with the Giants. But you can't go the other direction. You can't go from kissing posterior to busting posterior.\n\nWhen the season ended with another painful elimination-game loss at Footprint Center, owner Mat Ishbia may have landed on the correct strategy: Fire Vogel and run it back with the Big Three, giving them a robust leader, a new voice, a new direction, a new offense and a reason to believe.\n\nBut the lengthy delay on Vogel's job status, along with Ochocinco's recent comments on Durant, have both raised and changed the stakes. If Durant wants to be traded, and if Durant was the player who was truly most unhappy in 2023-24, well, there might be no need to part with Vogel. And this much seems certain to me:\n\nDurant averaged 27.1 points and 37.2 minutes while playing 75 games. His availability, durability and productivity were spectacular. It was a season that will return Durant to the All-NBA team after a short absence.\n\nWhich means this offseason will likely be the last best time to trade KD. And I'm OK with that. This might be the last chance to get a point guard, some athletic wings, some glue guys and give the team back to Booker.\n\nBut it feels like Durant and Booker have grown very close over the past 1.5 seasons. And if Durant is willing to go public with passive third-party trade scenarios, what is Booker's mindset? Is he still our hero forever? Is he loyal to the extreme like Larry Fitzgerald and Shane Doan? Or is he listening to the voices luring him to the Knicks and Madison Square Garden? Is he following Durant's lead?\n\nIf so, we have a calamity on our hands. We will be stuck with an NBA franchise that lost its heart, soul and compass. A franchise no better than the Wizards, suddenly rebuilding around Bradley Beal.", "source": {"uri": "arizonasports.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Arizona Sports"}, "authors": [{"uri": "dan_bickley@arizonasports.com", "name": "Dan Bickley", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kevin_Durant", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Kevin Durant"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_playoffs", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "NBA playoffs"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chad_Johnson", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Chad Johnson"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Devin_Booker", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Devin Booker"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miami_Heat", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Miami Heat"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wide_receiver", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Wide receiver"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phoenix,_Arizona", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Phoenix, Arizona"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Phoenix, Arizona"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Athletic", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "The Athletic"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tom_Coughlin", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Tom Coughlin"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Super_Bowl", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Super Bowl"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Professional_sports", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Professional sports"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Head_coach", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Head coach"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christmas", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Christmas"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mat_Ishbia", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Mat Ishbia"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Footprint_Center", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Footprint Center"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_Three_(Miami_Heat)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Big Three (Miami Heat)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shane_Doan", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Shane Doan"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Larry_Fitzgerald", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Larry Fitzgerald"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bradley_Beal", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Bradley Beal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/All-NBA_Team", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "All-NBA Team"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Madison_Square_Garden", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Madison Square Garden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_Knicks", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "New York Knicks"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Point_guard", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Point guard"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Basketball_Association", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "National Basketball Association"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Useless_Pages", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Useless Pages", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Interactive", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Interactive", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 89}], "image": "http://arizonasports.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/frank-vogel-suns-kevin-durant-1.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9551156", "eventUri": "eng-9551156", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1215686274509804, "wgt": 114, "relevance": 1}

Swartz wrote that the Lakers could use his scoring to help take pressure of James.\n\nBeal's five-year, $251 million contract, is a hefty price for any team as he has a $50.2 million cap hit during the 2024-25 season. With the new CBA limiting teams, Beal's contract handcuffed the Phoenix Suns' ability to add quality role players around their big three.\n\nAccording to Ric Bucher of Fox Sports, an Eastern Conference executive believes the Suns \"have to move\" Beal's contract.\n\n\"Taking the swing to acquire him wasn't without justification,\" the exec said. \"But Beal is toxic debt now. You have to move on before Book and KD demand trades and you lose leverage in the market place.\"\n\nThe contract price and no-trade clause are something the Los Angeles Lakers would have to think about as Beal wasn't the answer in his first season for the Suns.\n\nListing every NBA team's biggest regret this season, Grant Hughes of Bleacher Report wrote that the Phoenix's biggest regret was trading for Beal.\n\n\"Anyone who thought adding a third score-first player (at the cost of roster depth and balance) to a team that already had two elite bucket-getters did a lot of self-satisfied nodding as Phoenix posted the NBA's worst fourth-quarter plus/minus while playing some truly uninspiring \"your turn, my turn\" offense,\" Hughes wrote in an April 16 story.\n\nBeal had the worst season scoring-wise since 2015-16, averaging just 18.2 points per game. However, it was the most efficient scoring season he had in his career in terms of percentages.\n\nBeal's shots per game were down drastically, taking nearly 10 fewer shots per game than he did when he averaged 31.3 during that 2020-21 season. Despite his shooting attempts taking a hit, he shot 51.3% from the field on 13.9 attempts per game and 43.0% from three-point range on 4.4 attempts per game.\n\nIf he can raise his volume to his typical days in Washington, taking more than 19.5 shots and 5.5 three-pointers per game, he could potentially score 25-plus per night.\n\nIf the Los Angeles Lakers got the Washington Wizards Beal, they'd be adding one of the top scorers in basketball.", "source": {"uri": "heavy.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Heavy"}, "authors": [{"uri": "jon_conahan@heavy.com", "name": "Jon Conahan", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phoenix_Suns", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Phoenix Suns"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bradley_Beal", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Bradley Beal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los_Angeles_Lakers", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles Lakers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LeBron_James", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "LeBron James"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bleacher_Report", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Bleacher Report"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anthony_Davis", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Anthony Davis"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_Ten_Conference", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Big Ten Conference"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ric_Bucher", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Ric Bucher"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fox_Sports", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Fox Sports"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eastern_Conference_(NBA)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Eastern Conference (NBA)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Continental_Basketball_Association", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Continental Basketball Association"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Basketball_Association", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "National Basketball Association"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Three-point_field_goal", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Three-point field goal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Washington_Wizards", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Washington Wizards"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basketball", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Basketball"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Washington_(state)", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Washington (state)"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Washington (state)"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Professional", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Professional", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Fan_Pages", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Fan Pages", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/History", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/History", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Science", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Science", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 96}], "image": "https://heavy.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/GettyImages-2150493369-e1715203819338.jpg?quality=65&strip=all&w=780", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9551156", "eventUri": "eng-9551156", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-04-16", "textStart": 1735, "textEnd": 1743}], "sentiment": 0.03529411764705892, "wgt": 114, "relevance": 1}

Reports have broken that Paul George of the Los Angeles Clippers and Kevin Durant of the Phoenix Suns may ask for a trade from their respective franchises once the season concludes, making them prime targets for the Knicks to pursue.\n\nShams Charania of FanDuel's \"Run it Back\" recently revealed that the Clippers have offered multiple contract extensions to George that fell below the max and that while they'll keep trying to ink the 2024 All-Star to a long-term deal to remain in L.A., he's expected to see max offers should he test free agency this summer.\n\nGeorge has a $48.78 million player option for the 2024-25 NBA season, but can test free agency this June. The Knicks could be in the mix to land the Fresno State product, though they are roughly $4 million over the projected $141 million salary cap for next season.\n\nThe 34-year-old had a strong regular season where he averaged 22.6 points 5.2 rebounds, 3.5 assists, and 1.5 steals per game, shooting 47.1 percent from the field and 41.3 percent from the three-point line. Though his scoring slightly decreased, George is the quintessence of an elite do-it-all two-way wing that would give Brunson a fringe-MVP talent to wage a Finals run with next year.\n\nIn addition to George, Durant has also been named as a superstar who could force his way out of Phoenix. The Suns were swept by the Minnesota Timberwolves in the first round of the 2024 NBA Playoffs, marking a disappointing end to the season for their potent big three also including Devin Booker and Bradley Beal.\n\nDurant has yet to win a championship since departing the dynastic Golden State Warriors in the summer of 2019. He's dealt with injuries and has not reached any further than the Conference Semifinals in any of the last four postseasons he's played in.\n\nJonathan Adams of Heavy Sports relayed that Durant could push his way out of Phoenix to finally find a situation where he can capture his third championship. He is under contract until 2025-26, where he'll make $51.17 million and $54.7 million in the next two seasons.\n\nIn order to make the dollars and cents work, the Knicks have several players including Bojan Bogdanovic ($19.5 million) and OG Anunoby ($19.2 million) with large average contracts over the next few seasons along with Mitchell Robinson, Josh Hart, and Donte DiVincenzo to offer.\n\nA wealthy collection of draft picks added to a potential package could entice the Suns to trade Durant to the Big Apple.

There were points during the 82-game campaign when it looked like the Suns were clicking into place, and just when that occurred, the same issues would rise back to the surface.\n\nThis all came to a head in the postseason, when their inconsistencies were greatly exposed against a quality opponent. The Suns showed some positives against Minnesota before they started to spiral out of control in the mid-third quarter across the first three consecutive contests, failing to make any of them competitive in the final period. Phoenix put together a competitive Game 4 but ultimately struggled to execute down the stretch to seal the sweep with a 122-116 loss.\n\nThrough whatever the lack of connectivity was a result of behind the scenes, as well as their own inability to step up above the circumstances, the Suns' hyped-up Big 3 of Bradley Beal, Devin Booker and Kevin Durant all played poorly in the series. None of them were able to reach a special level in the first three games, another telling sign a change in the leadership dynamic was needed.\n\nThe Athletic dropped a report under an hour after the Suns were eliminated, noting a few troubling signs for Vogel's future. He \"lit into\" the team after a poor loss to the Los Angeles Clippers in the last week of the regular season, only for his players to not buy his passion then and at shootaround the next day. Players questioned the offensive system put together by coaches, including Durant never feeling comfortable in his role.\n\nVogel was hired by Phoenix after it let go of head coach Monty Williams last offseason. Williams immediately rebuilt the Suns into a respectable, competitive team in his first year before their surprising run to the NBA Finals in 2021. Expectations rose, and despite them winning 64 games the following year, Phoenix bowed out in the second round.\n\nIt did so again the following season, with both elimination game losses coming in embarrassing blowout fashion at Footprint Center.\n\nThat was enough for Williams' tenure to end, even though he had a few years left on his most recent contract extension. His exit came shortly after the Suns and Phoenix Mercury were sold by Robert Sarver to Ishbia. The new owner traded for Durant at the trade deadline in Feb. 2023, and the core of the roster continued to reset from there with Chris Paul and Deandre Ayton departing for Beal, Jusuf Nurkic and Grayson Allen.\n\nNonetheless, it meant Vogel was expected to have Phoenix remain among the elite of the NBA and win a title.\n\nVogel had previously achieved this level of success in his first year with the Los Angeles Lakers in 2019-20, and given his defensive background on a team full of offensive talent, the fit seemed to be there.\n\nThe Suns not only didn't come close to reaching their end goal but were never in the realm of looking like a team that could do so, with the regular season lacking any minor spurt that suggested Vogel's team was capable.\n\nPhoenix began the season 14-15, dealing with injuries to Durant, Booker and mainly Beal through a battle to establish any sort of continuity. On top of that, season-long problems of execution in the fourth quarter and turnovers popped up early and often. A loss on Christmas to the Dallas Mavericks was marked as the starting point of a potential turnaround, with the Suns going 19-7 from there up to the All-Star break.\n\nVogel's Suns had learned how to at least win, but the roots were dug in from the first 29 games across the majority of that more promising stretch.\n\nPhoenix was often unorganized, lacking proper structure on both ends. The offense would bounce between running proper, movement-heavy sets before slowing down the pace and relying on isolation-style basketball. The defense immensely lacked the execution as a team to compensate for its inability to contain dribble penetration within its scheme. This forced the Suns into rotations often and it was a rare sight to see more than a few each game involving multiple efforts that were sound.\n\nOn top of that, the Suns were a historically bad team in the fourth quarter. The way they turned the ball over was alarming, often of the live-ball variety with mind-numbing decision-making in unforced errors. Despite a team-wide understanding of the group requiring more 3-point shots, they were constantly getting out-gunned in attempts. This made Phoenix play uphill most nights, battling the math of losing the possession battle on turnovers and the math battle on 3-pointers.\n\nAll of this came to a head after the All-Star break, when the Suns regressed instead of improving. They continuously dropped games to a mix of poor teams and opponents without the opposing best player. A lot of it was off an evident lack of energy, effort and focus, shocking characteristics for a Suns group that was facing a play-in tournament fate.\n\nA stunning pair of fixtures against the Clippers in the last week of the regular season indicated Vogel's team had entirely checked out and was ready to go to the play-in tournament before a brief spark via two victories to end the season got Phoenix the sixth seed in the playoff bracket. This led to some optimism that the Suns had perhaps turned the corner at the last second possible before the first round showed that was not the case.\n\nVogel's one-year tenure with the Suns ends his fourth head coaching stint in the NBA. He got started as one with the Indiana Pacers in the 2010-11 season on an interim basis before earning the permanent position for five more seasons. The Pacers went 250-181 and made two trips to the Eastern Conference Finals.\n\nHis contract was not renewed in 2016 and he was quickly scooped up by the Orlando Magic, a less successful stint of a 54-110 record across two years that had him fired.\n\nAfter a year off, Vogel was brought on by the Lakers in the summer of 2019 and won the aforementioned title right away. L.A. then lost in the first round the next season before going 33-49 in Vogel's final season before he was fired.", "source": {"uri": "ksltv.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "KSLTV.com"}, "authors":

We appreciate Frank's hard work and commitment.\n\n\"We are here to win a championship and last season was way below our expectations. We will continue to evaluate our operation and make the necessary changes to reach our championship-caliber goals. We all take accountability, and it's my job, along with Josh and ownership, to build a championship team.\"\n\nThe move by the Suns under Mat Ishbia comes after Vogel said before Game 4 of a first-round series loss to the Minnesota Timberwolves that he was \"very\" confident he would return for 2024-25, adding that he believed he had the \"full support of Mat Ishbia.\"\n\nFormer Atlanta Hawks and Milwaukee Bucks head coach Mike Budenholzer will be a prominent part of the coaching search, according to ESPN's Adrian Wojnarowski.\n\nThe sweep by the T-Wolves ended a massively disappointing postseason finish and was a far cry from the championship expectations set upon Vogel's arrival.\n\nWhile Phoenix finished with a 49-33 record, it was disjointed and sloppy all season. The Suns had clear problems developing into a cohesive unit and that led to struggles in basic areas, which made it impossible to figure out what the group's identity was. There were points during the 82-game campaign when it looked like the Suns were clicking into place, and just when that occurred, the same issues would rise back to the surface.\n\nThis all came to a head in the postseason, when their inconsistencies were greatly exposed against a quality opponent. The Suns showed some positives against Minnesota before they started to spiral out of control in the mid-third quarter across the first three consecutive contests, failing to make any of them competitive in the final period. Phoenix put together a competitive Game 4 but ultimately struggled to execute down the stretch to seal the sweep with a 122-116 loss.\n\nThrough whatever the lack of connectivity was a result of behind the scenes, as well as their own inability to step up above the circumstances, the Suns' hyped-up Big 3 of Bradley Beal, Devin Booker and Kevin Durant all played poorly in the series. None of them were able to reach a special level in the first three games, another telling sign a change in the leadership dynamic was needed.\n\nThe Athletic dropped a report under an hour after the Suns were eliminated, noting a few troubling signs for Vogel's future. He \"lit into\" the team after a poor loss to the Los Angeles Clippers in the last week of the regular season, only for his players to not buy his passion then and at shootaround the next day. Players questioned the offensive system put together by coaches, including Durant never feeling comfortable in his role.\n\nVogel was hired by Phoenix after it let go of head coach Monty Williams last offseason. Williams immediately rebuilt the Suns into a respectable, competitive team in his first year before their surprising run to the NBA Finals in 2021. Expectations rose, and despite them winning 64 games the following year, Phoenix bowed out in the second round.\n\nIt did so again the following season, with both elimination game losses coming in embarrassing blowout fashion at Footprint Center.\n\nThat was enough for Williams' tenure to end, even though he had a few years left on his most recent contract extension. His exit came shortly after the Suns and Phoenix Mercury were sold by Robert Sarver to Ishbia. The new owner traded for Durant at the trade deadline in Feb. 2023, and the core of the roster continued to reset from there with Chris Paul and Deandre Ayton departing for Beal, Jusuf Nurkic and Grayson Allen.\n\nNonetheless, it meant Vogel was expected to have Phoenix remain among the elite of the NBA and win a title.\n\nVogel had previously achieved this level of success in his first year with the Los Angeles Lakers in 2019-20, and given his defensive background on a team full of offensive talent, the fit seemed to be there.\n\nThe Suns not only didn't come close to reaching their end goal but were never in the realm of looking like a team that could do so, with the regular season lacking any minor spurt that suggested Vogel's team was capable.\n\nPhoenix began the season 14-15, dealing with injuries to Durant, Booker and mainly Beal through a battle to establish any sort of continuity. On top of that, season-long problems of execution in the fourth quarter and turnovers popped up early and often. A loss on Christmas to the Dallas Mavericks was marked as the starting point of a potential turnaround, with the Suns going 19-7 from there up to the All-Star break.\n\nVogel's Suns had learned how to at least win, but the roots were dug in from the first 29 games across the majority of that more promising stretch.\n\nPhoenix was often unorganized, lacking proper structure on both ends. The offense would bounce between running proper, movement-heavy sets before slowing down the pace and relying on isolation-style basketball. The defense immensely lacked the execution as a team to compensate for its inability to contain dribble penetration within its scheme. This forced the Suns into rotations often and it was a rare sight to see more than a few each game involving multiple efforts that were sound.\n\nOn top of that, the Suns were a historically bad team in the fourth quarter. The way they turned the ball over was alarming, often of the live-ball variety with mind-numbing decision-making in unforced errors. Despite a team-wide understanding of the group requiring more 3-point shots, they were constantly getting out-gunned in attempts. This made Phoenix play uphill most nights, battling the math of losing the possession battle on turnovers and the math battle on 3-pointers.\n\nAll of this came to a head after the All-Star break, when the Suns regressed instead of improving. They continuously dropped games to a mix of poor teams and opponents without the opposing best player. A lot of it was off an evident lack of energy, effort and focus, shocking characteristics for a Suns group that was facing a play-in tournament fate.\n\nA stunning pair of fixtures against the Clippers in the last week of the regular season indicated Vogel's team had entirely checked out and was ready to go to the play-in tournament before a brief spark via two victories to end the season got Phoenix the sixth seed in the playoff bracket. This led to some optimism that the Suns had perhaps turned the corner at the last second possible before the first round showed that was not the case.\n\nVogel's one-year tenure with the Suns ends his fourth head coaching stint in the NBA. He got started as one with the Indiana Pacers in the 2010-11 season on an interim basis before earning the permanent position for five more seasons. The Pacers went 250-181 and made two trips to the Eastern Conference Finals.\n\nHis contract was not renewed in 2016 and he was quickly scooped up by the Orlando Magic, a less successful stint of a 54-110 record across two years that had him fired.\n\nAfter a year off, Vogel was brought on by the Lakers in the summer of 2019 and won the aforementioned title right away.

The group had some good moments, but was never quite able to gel.\n\nTheNightlyGet in front of tomorrow's news for FREE\n\nJournalism for the curious Australian across politics, business, culture and opinion.\n\nREAD NOW\n\nBeal was hurt for much of the first half of the season. Even when he returned, the Suns were plagued by turnovers and a thin bench. Vogel said before Game 4 against the Wolves he's \"got the full support of (owner) Mat Ishbia\" and expected to be back for a second season.\n\nNow he's out of a job.\n\nVogel always seemed like a strange fit for the Suns, even though he won a championship with the Lakers in 2020 in the Florida bubble. He was a defensive-minded coach in charge of a team that's strength was offense. All season, it felt like the coach was searching for answers.\n\n\"You reflect back on the season, we were just inconsistent with our play and the style of play that we wanted,\" Durant said after the playoff sweep. \"But I think guys will dig deep this summer, work on what they need to work on individually, the coaches will make adjustments because we've got stuff on film from all season on who we can be.\"\n\nBooker and Durant are among the 12 players who will represent the US at this year's Paris Olympics.\n\nIshbia has been unafraid to make big changes in his 1 1/2 years leading the franchise. He dealt for Durant at the trade deadline last season, blowing up a roster that had made the Finals in 2021.

Phoenix recognized his talent and selected him before he even turned 19.\n\nHe's since made four All-Star games, one All-NBA team, and been a 20-plus-point-per-game scorer in every season after his rookie year.\n\nThese aren't empty stats either. Booker has led the Suns to the playoffs in each of the past four seasons. They even made the NBA Finals in 2021 but lost to the Bucks in six games.\n\nBooker has been consistent year in and year out, but his head coaches have been anything but.\n\nMORE: How Knicks can trade for Devin Booker this offseason\n\nUnlike many stars, Booker has been with the same franchise for his entire career despite trade rumors circling . Despite his consistency and commitment to the Suns, the front office can't seem to find a permanent head coach.\n\nThe four-time All-Star has played under six different head coaches in nine seasons. He'll have his seventh head coach in year 10 after the Suns fired Frank Vogel on Thursday.\n\nHere is each head coach Booker has played for in the NBA:\n\n*Hired on an interim basis\n\nBooker's first coach in the NBA was Hornacek, who had been with the Phoenix Suns since the 2013-14 season. Hornacek played six seasons with the Suns during the mid-to-late 1980s and early '90s.\n\nHornacek only coached 49 games in the 2015-16 season before Phoenix fired him. The Suns held a 14-35 record and let him go in February 2016.\n\nMORE: Who are the highest-paid NBA coaches?\n\nWatson was Booker's first true stab at a consistent head coach after the former NBA guard took over for Hornacek in 2016. He began as the interim head coach, but the Suns hired him full-time after the season.\n\nThe 2016-17 season was another dud for Phoenix, who finished 24-58 while Booker eclipsed 22 points per game for the first time. Watson lasted just three games into the 2017-18 season -- all of which the Suns lost by a total of 92 points -- before Phoenix fired him.\n\nTriano stepped in as the interim head coach, essentially coaching the entire 2017-18 season after the organization relieved Watson of his duties.\n\nThat was the end of the line for Triano, however. The Suns finished 21-61, missing the playoffs for the eighth consecutive season.\n\nPhoenix brought in Kokoskov for the 2018-19 season. He became the first person born and raised outside of North America to be an NBA head coach.\n\nHis tenure lasted just one season, however. The Suns had yet another disappointing season after selecting Deandre Ayton with the No. 1 pick in the 2018 NBA Draft. A 19-63 finish ended his brief time in Phoenix.\n\nFor the first time in Booker's NBA career, he finally had a head coach with notable NBA head coaching experience. Williams was the New Orleans Hornets/Pelicans coach for four years beginning in 2010-11.\n\nWilliams was the first \"stable\" coach for the Suns in Booker's time with the organization. He spent four seasons in the desert, reaching the playoffs three times. The Suns even made the NBA Finals in 2021 but lost to the Bucks in six games.\n\nThe Suns ultimately fired Williams in 2023 after back-to-back season-ending losses in the Western Conference semis, the last of which came after the \"all-in\" move of trading for Kevin Durant at midseason.\n\nMORE: Why did the Suns fire Monty Williams?\n\nWith Mat Ishbia taking over as Suns owner in February of 2023, he looked to make a splash by hiring an established, veteran head coach. Vogel spent time with the Indiana Pacers, Orlando Magic, and Los Angeles Lakers before the Suns brought him in, winning a title with the Lakers during the 2020 bubble playoffs.\n\nThe 2023-24 Phoenix roster had similar championship aspirations after trading for Bradley Beal in the offseason. A barrage of injuries and inconsistent play caused the Suns to fall short of expectations again, as the No. 3 Timberwolves swept the No. 6 Suns in the first round.

The group had some good moments but was never quite able to gel.\n\nBeal was hurt for much of the first half of the season. Even when he returned, the Suns were plagued by turnovers and a thin bench.\n\nMr. Vogel said before Game 4 against Minnesota that he had \"the full support of [owner] Mat Ishbia\" and expected to be back for a second season. Now he's out of a job.\n\nMr. Vogel always seemed like a strange fit for the Suns, even though he won the 2020 championship with the Los Angeles Lakers in the Florida bubble. He was a defensive-minded coach in charge of a team that's strength was offense. All season, it felt like the coach was searching for answers.\n\n\"You reflect back on the season -- we were just inconsistent with our play and the style of play that we wanted,\" Durant said after the playoff sweep. \"But I think guys will dig deep this summer, work on what they need to work on individually. The coaches will make adjustments because we've got stuff on film from all season on who we can be.\"\n\nBooker and Durant are among the 12 players who will represent the United States at this year's Paris Olympics.\n\nMr. Ishbia has been unafraid to make big changes in his 1 1/2 years leading the franchise. He dealt for Durant at the trade deadline last season, blowing up a roster that had made the Finals in 2021. He also fired Coach Monty Williams and added Beal in another huge trade last summer.\n\nThose big changes have led to mostly big disappointment.\n\nNow the franchise will be looking for its third head coach in three seasons. Former Bucks Coach Mike Budenholzer, who beat the Suns in the 2021 Finals, is among the potential candidates.\n\n\"We are here to win a championship, and last season was way below our expectations,\" Mr. Jones said. \"We will continue to evaluate our operation and make the necessary changes to reach our championship-caliber goals. We all take accountability.\"\n\nMr. Jones doesn't have much room to maneuver with the roster under the league's salary cap unless major changes are made.

The group had some good moments but was never quite able to gel.\n\nBeal was hurt for much of the first half of the season. Even when he returned, the Suns were plagued by turnovers and a thin bench.\n\nMr. Vogel said before Game 4 against Minnesota that he had \"the full support of [owner] Mat Ishbia\" and expected to be back for a second season. Now he's out of a job.\n\nMr. Vogel always seemed like a strange fit for the Suns, even though he won the 2020 championship with the Los Angeles Lakers in the Florida bubble. He was a defensive-minded coach in charge of a team that's strength was offense. All season, it felt like the coach was searching for answers.\n\n\"You reflect back on the season -- we were just inconsistent with our play and the style of play that we wanted,\" Durant said after the playoff sweep. \"But I think guys will dig deep this summer, work on what they need to work on individually. The coaches will make adjustments because we've got stuff on film from all season on who we can be.\"\n\nBooker and Durant are among the 12 players who will represent the United States at this year's Paris Olympics.\n\nMr. Ishbia has been unafraid to make big changes in his 1 1/2 years leading the franchise. He dealt for Durant at the trade deadline last season, blowing up a roster that had made the Finals in 2021. He also fired Coach Monty Williams and added Beal in another huge trade last summer.\n\nThose big changes have led to mostly big disappointment.\n\nNow the franchise will be looking for its third head coach in three seasons.

He's been working to assemble a coaching staff for a return to a head coaching job and that process is also gathering momentum, sources said,\" Wojnarowski reported on X, formerly Twitter.\n\nA two-time NBA Coach of the Year, Budenholzer is the only remaining available coach with a championship on his resume. He guided Milwaukee to its first NBA championship in 50 years in 2021. But the Bucks fired him two years after following their stunning first-round playoff loss to the Miami Heat last season.\n\nVogel's firing came after the Suns' embarrassing sweep in the first round of the Western Conference playoffs in the first season together of their Big Three of Devin Booker, Kevin Durant and Bradley Beal. Vogel compiled a 49-33 record in his lone season with the Suns after signing a five-year, $31 million deal last year.\n\n\"As we said at the press conference on May 1, team leadership including myself, Josh Bartelstein, and ownership would be looking across basketball operations to determine what changes needed to be made,\" Suns general manager James Jones said in a statement. \"After a thoughtful review of the season, we concluded that we needed a different head coach for our team. We appreciate Frank's hard work and commitment.\"\n\nLike Budenholzer, Vogel also a has a championship on his resume, guiding the Los Angeles Lakers with their star duo of LeBron James and Anthony Davis in the Orlando Bubble in 2020. He was also fired two years later after a disappointing 33-49 finish.\n\nThe Suns are hoping to right the ship with their Big Three following a reported disconnect between Vogel and their stars this season.\n\nDurant was at the center of it, according to Shams Charania and Doug Haller of The Athletic.\n\n\"Durant, among the best scorers in NBA history, was not always happy with how he was used,\" Charania and Haller wrote. \"Sources briefed on the matter told The Athletic that Durant never felt comfortable with his role in Phoenix's offense alongside [Devin] Booker and [Bradley] Beal this season. Those sources said Durant had persistent issues with the offense, feeling that he was being relegated to the corner far too often and not having the proper designs to play to his strengths as the offense was built around pick-and-rolls. At the same time, some teammates and people close to the organization believed Durant needed to voice his concerns more adamantly and directly with Vogel and his coaching staff.\"\n\nIn response to the report, Jones said they want to become the first team to maximize Durant's talent.\n\n\"I tell you, that's a constant focus for us to continue to figure out how to maximize Kevin Durant,\" Jones said during his exit interview on May 1 at Footprint Center. \"No one has done it yet. I believe we will be the first team to do it because if we can maximize him, we can maximize our entire roster. We're a better team, but that's not an issue. I think Kevin had a phenomenal season this year offensively.\"\n\n\"I think he had some of the best stretches of his career this year,\" Jones continued. \"So it wasn't an offensive thing. It wasn't a utilization or usage thing. It was just the totality of figuring out when and where and how to do it together. We just could not get on the same page.\"\n\nDurant averaged 27.1 points on 52/41/86 shooting split across 75 games in his first full season with the Suns. It was the most games the 35-year-old superstar has played since returning from an Achilles injury in 2019.", "source": {"uri": "heavy.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Heavy"}, "authors": [{"uri": "alder_almo@heavy.com", "name": "Alder Almo", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mike_Budenholzer", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Mike Budenholzer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frank_Vogel", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Frank Vogel"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Milwaukee_Bucks", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Milwaukee Bucks"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phoenix_Suns", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Phoenix Suns"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ESPN", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "ESPN"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kevin_Durant", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Kevin Durant"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_Coach_of_the_Year_Award", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "NBA Coach of the Year Award"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adrian_Wojnarowski", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Adrian Wojnarowski"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_Finals", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "NBA Finals"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Houston_Rockets", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Houston Rockets"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bradley_Beal", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Bradley Beal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miami_Heat", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Miami Heat"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LeBron_James", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "LeBron James"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twitter", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Twitter"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Milwaukee", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Milwaukee"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Milwaukee"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anthony_Davis", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Anthony Davis"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Athletic", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "The Athletic"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_playoffs", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "NBA playoffs"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Devin_Booker", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Devin Booker"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_Ten_Conference", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Big Ten Conference"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_manager", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "General manager"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los_Angeles_Lakers", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles Lakers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Head_coach", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Head coach"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basketball", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Basketball"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orlando,_Florida", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Orlando, Florida"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Orlando, Florida"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Footprint_Center", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Footprint Center"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Basketball_Association", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "National Basketball Association"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Professional", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Professional", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Alternative/Coaching", "label": "dmoz/Health/Alternative/Coaching", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Coaching", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Coaching", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Show_Basketball", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Show Basketball", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 87}], "image": "https://heavy.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/GettyImages-2034358353-e1715293314239.jpg?quality=65&strip=all&w=780", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9551156", "eventUri": "eng-9551156", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-05-09", "textStart": 267, "textEnd": 272}, {"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-05-01", "textStart": 1291, "textEnd": 1296, "freq": 2}], "sentiment": -0.1450980392156863, "wgt": 452990868, "relevance": 2}], "totalResults": 102, "page": 1, "count": 1, "pages": 102}}}

The decision came after the No. 6-seeded Suns were swept by the No. 3 Minnesota Timberwolves in the first round of the NBA playoffs.\n\n\"After a thoughtful review of the season, we concluded that we needed a different head coach for our team,\" Suns president of basketball operations James Jones said in a statement. \"We appreciate Frank's hard work and commitment.\"\n\nESPN's Adrian Wojnarowski reported that Phoenix is targeting Mike Budenholzer, who led the Milwaukee Bucks past the Suns in the 2021 Finals, to replace Vogel. Talks between Budenholzer and the Suns are expected to move quickly, per Wojnarowski.\n\nBudenholzer, a two-time Coach of the Year winner, boasts a career record of 484-317 with nine playoff appearances in 10 seasons. Budenholzer, who last coached with Milwaukee in the 2022-23 season, has also been linked to the Los Angeles Lakers' opening. Los Angeles fired Darvin Ham last week following a two-year run.\n\nThe Suns brought in Vogel, who coached the Lakers to a title in 2020, on a reported five-year, $31 million deal last offseason to replace Monty Williams. Phoenix then went out and acquired three-time All-Star Bradley Beal to form a Big Three along with Kevin Durant and Devin Booker.\n\nBut the star-studded Suns didn't come close to reaching their championship aspirations. They finished sixth in the Western Conference at 49-33 as Beal missed 29 regular-season games, Booker missed 14 and Durant missed seven.

The decision came after the No. 6-seeded Suns were swept by the No. 3 Minnesota Timberwolves in the first round of the NBA playoffs.\n\n\"After a thoughtful review of the season, we concluded that we needed a different head coach for our team,\" Suns president of basketball operations James Jones said in a statement. \"We appreciate Frank's hard work and commitment.\"\n\nESPN's Adrian Wojnarowski reported that Phoenix is targeting Mike Budenholzer, who led the Milwaukee Bucks past the Suns in the 2021 Finals, to replace Vogel. Talks between Budenholzer and the Suns are expected to move quickly, per Wojnarowski.\n\nBudenholzer, a two-time Coach of the Year winner, boasts a career record of 484-317 with nine playoff appearances in 10 seasons. Budenholzer, who last coached with Milwaukee in the 2022-23 season, has also been linked to the Los Angeles Lakers' opening. Los Angeles fired Darvin Ham last week following a two-year run.\n\nThe Suns brought in Vogel, who coached the Lakers to a title in 2020, on a reported five-year, $31 million deal last offseason to replace Monty Williams. Phoenix then went out and acquired three-time All-Star Bradley Beal to form a Big Three along with Kevin Durant and Devin Booker.\n\nBut the star-studded Suns didn't come close to reaching their championship aspirations. They finished sixth in the Western Conference at 49-33 as Beal missed 29 regular-season games, Booker missed 14 and Durant missed seven. Phoenix was then swept out of the playoffs by Minnesota, with three of the four first-round losses coming by double figures.\n\nThe Suns' ugly playoff exit has sparked speculation over whether their newly-formed, though expensive, Big Three could be broken up this offseason.

The Suns carry $209 million into the offseason, the highest payroll in the league.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nThe organization could move some key players this offseason to reduce its payroll and luxury tax bills.", "source": {"uri": "foxnews.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Fox News"}, "authors": [{"uri": "chantz_martin@foxnews.com", "name": "Chantz Martin", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fox_News", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Fox News"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frank_Vogel", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Frank Vogel"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Basketball_Association", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "National Basketball Association"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_playoffs", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "NBA playoffs"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kevin_Durant", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Kevin Durant"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Devin_Booker", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Devin Booker"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mike_Budenholzer", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Mike Budenholzer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Milwaukee_Bucks", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Milwaukee Bucks"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phoenix_Suns", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Phoenix Suns"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bradley_Beal", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Bradley Beal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_manager", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "General manager"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phoenix,_Arizona", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Phoenix, Arizona"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Phoenix, Arizona"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_Finals", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "NBA Finals"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ESPN", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "ESPN"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Head_coach", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Head coach"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basketball", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Basketball"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monty_Williams", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Monty Williams"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indiana_Pacers", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Indiana Pacers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Denver_Nuggets", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Denver Nuggets"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orlando_Magic", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Orlando Magic"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los_Angeles_Lakers", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles Lakers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_Conference_(NBA)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Western Conference (NBA)"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Professional", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Professional", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Coaching", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Coaching", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Show_Basketball", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Show Basketball", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/History", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/History", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 97}], "image": "https://a57.foxnews.com/static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2024/05/1024/512/Suns-Frank-Vogel.jpg?ve=1&tl=1", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9551156", "eventUri": "eng-9551156", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-05-01", "textStart": 513, "textEnd": 518}], "sentiment": 0.04313725490196085, "wgt": 452991902, "relevance": 2}], "totalResults": 106, "page": 1, "count": 1, "pages": 106}}}

During those interviews, they mentioned the front office would use this week to evaluate the pros and cons of the 2023-24 season and face tough decisions regarding the future.\n\nVogel was the first domino to fall. Phoenix was swept in the first round by the Minnesota Timberwolves and reports later surfaced of certain players not being thrilled with his offensive system.\n\nWith the same core returning next season and their superstars under contract long-term, perhaps this was the only move that made sense. It's clear the front office knew something had to change, and it's a much cleaner process to swap out coaches than drastically altering a roster that's already hamstrung by large salaries and strict CBA rules.\n\n\"As we said at the press conference on May 1, team leadership including myself, [CEO] Josh Bartelstein, and ownership would be looking across basketball operations to determine what changes need to be made,\" Jones said in a statement. \"After a thoughtful review of the season, we concluded that we needed a different head coach for our team. We appreciate Frank's hard work and commitment.\"\n\nVogel, who still had four years left on his contract, guided the Suns to a 49-33 record and the Western Conference's six seed.

They had the seventh-highest point differential during that span.\n\nNevertheless, it wasn't enough to earn him a second year.\n\n\"We are here to win a championship and last season was way below our expectations,\" Jones continued in the statement. \"We will continue to evaluate our operation and make the necessary changes to reach our championship-caliber goals. We all take accountability, and it's my job, along with Josh and ownership, to build a championship team.\"\n\nAccording to ESPN's Adrian Wojnarowski, the Suns are aggressively targeting former Bucks head coach Mike Budenholzer to replace Vogel. It would be the franchise again opting for championship experience and a coach that's faced a ton of 'title or bust' expectations. Although his tenure with Milwaukee ended on a sour note, Budenholzer has always generated regular season success when star talent is on his side. His coaching record with the Bucks reached 271-120, equivalent to a 57-win pace over five years.\n\nWojnarowski also reports Budenholzer has been working to assemble his coaching staff for next year, regardless of his landing spot.\n\nBudenholzer does have Arizona ties. He was raised in Holbrook, a small town roughly three hours outside of Phoenix.\n\nOnce they settle on a new coach, a critical summer will begin. The Suns will be extremely limited in what they can do, but the execution needs to be next-to-flawless for this team to rise in the West standings:\n\nThe Suns' next head coach will be Devin Booker's seventh in his 10 NBA seasons. He entered the league in 2015 under Jeff Hornacek's system, but soon found himself playing for Earl Watson, Jay Triano, Igor Kokoskov, and Monty Williams -- all within a four-year span.\n\nWilliams lasted four full seasons before Ishbia made the decision to let him go. Vogel was the front office's top choice because of his championship experience with the 2020 Los Angeles Lakers. But with the urgency Phoenix faces as a team deep in the luxury tax and over the second-apron, management knew there was no time to waste.\n\nSo, a new coaching staff will soon enter, and training camp will be another fresh start. That's something Booker is used to hearing by now, but it has to be frustrating.\n\nStability isn't a word he's familiar with in his professional career. His Suns tenure has been anything but stable and free of drama.\n\nFor an All-NBA star, which Booker consistently is, this constant carousel of head coaches just isn't a healthy environment. It's not an exaggeration to say no player has dealt with this many shifts in philosophy and schematic changes before age 28.\n\nBut this is the inherent problem with personnel changes and coaches being let go. Or, should I say, the problem with the national reaction that follows. It's impossible to know who made the final call.\n\nIt could very well have been situation where the Suns' superstars were on board with hitting the reset button and playing for a different coach. After all, it was evident multiple parties weren't on the same page -- offensively and defensively -- as the season winded down.\n\nAt the end of the day, when high-level talent is under contract,

During those interviews, they mentioned the front office would use this week to evaluate the pros and cons of the 2023-24 season and face tough decisions regarding the future.\n\nVogel was the first domino to fall. Phoenix was swept in the first round by the Minnesota Timberwolves and reports later surfaced of certain players not being thrilled with his offensive system.\n\nWith the same core returning next season and their superstars under contract long-term, perhaps this was the only move that made sense. It's clear the front office knew something had to change, and it's a much cleaner process to swap out coaches than drastically altering a roster that's already hamstrung by large salaries and strict CBA rules.\n\n\"As we said at the press conference on May 1, team leadership including myself, [CEO] Josh Bartelstein, and ownership would be looking across basketball operations to determine what changes need to be made,\" Jones said in a statement. \"After a thoughtful review of the season, we concluded that we needed a different head coach for our team. We appreciate Frank's hard work and commitment.\"\n\nVogel, who still had four years left on his contract, guided the Suns to a 49-33 record and the Western Conference's six seed. With the context of Phoenix not having a healthy rotation until late December, it felt as if Vogel squeezed as much as he could out of the situation he was dealt.\n\nAcross the final 52 games of the regular season, Phoenix went 34-18 and ranked top 10 in both offensive and defensive rating. They had the seventh-highest point differential during that span.\n\nNevertheless, it wasn't enough to earn him a second year.\n\n\"We are here to win a championship and last season was way below our expectations,\" Jones continued in the statement. \"We will continue to evaluate our operation and make the necessary changes to reach our championship-caliber goals. We all take accountability, and it's my job, along with Josh and ownership, to build a championship team.\"\n\nAccording to ESPN's Adrian Wojnarowski, the Suns are aggressively targeting former Bucks head coach Mike Budenholzer to replace Vogel. It would be the franchise again opting for championship experience and a coach that's faced a ton of 'title or bust' expectations. Although his tenure with Milwaukee ended on a sour note, Budenholzer has always generated regular season success when star talent is on his side. His coaching record with the Bucks reached 271-120, equivalent to a 57-win pace over five years.\n\nWojnarowski also reports Budenholzer has been working to assemble his coaching staff for next year, regardless of his landing spot.\n\nBudenholzer does have Arizona ties. He was raised in Holbrook, a small town roughly three hours outside of Phoenix.\n\nOnce they settle on a new coach, a critical summer will begin. The Suns will be extremely limited in what they can do, but the execution needs to be next-to-flawless for this team to rise in the West standings:\n\nThe Suns' next head coach will be Devin Booker's seventh in his 10 NBA seasons. He entered the league in 2015 under Jeff Hornacek's system, but soon found himself playing for Earl Watson, Jay Triano, Igor Kokoskov, and Monty Williams -- all within a four-year span.\n\nWilliams lasted four full seasons before Ishbia made the decision to let him go. Vogel was the front office's top choice because of his championship experience with the 2020 Los Angeles Lakers. But with the urgency Phoenix faces as a team deep in the luxury tax and over the second-apron, management knew there was no time to waste.\n\nSo, a new coaching staff will soon enter, and training camp will be another fresh start. That's something Booker is used to hearing by now, but it has to be frustrating.\n\nStability isn't a word he's familiar with in his professional career. His Suns tenure has been anything but stable and free of drama.\n\nFor an All-NBA star, which Booker consistently is, this constant carousel of head coaches just isn't a healthy environment. It's not an exaggeration to say no player has dealt with this many shifts in philosophy and schematic changes before age 28.\n\nBut this is the inherent problem with personnel changes and coaches being let go. Or, should I say, the problem with the national reaction that follows. It's impossible to know who made the final call.\n\nIt could very well have been situation where the Suns' superstars were on board with hitting the reset button and playing for a different coach. After all, it was evident multiple parties weren't on the same page -- offensively and defensively -- as the season winded down.\n\nAt the end of the day, when high-level talent is under contract, those players will either give the green light for a coach ... or they won't.\n\nMaybe this was a situation where the Suns, collectively, knew it was time to cut ties before their championship window closes.", "source": {"uri": "forbes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Forbes"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frank_Vogel", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label":

Coco (2017) Death, dying and grief are profound topics\u2014ones that even adults struggle to talk about or understand. Researchers have long explained how this can be even more difficult for children, who are still coming to terms with what it means to be human and the realities of life and loss. Luckily, Coco provides an ideal opportunity to educate children about death. Its focus on family, remembrance and honoring those who have passed away offers a wholesome way to approach these profound topics. To initiate the conversation, you can start by asking your child about their feelings and thoughts while watching Coco: How did the characters in the Land of the Dead feel about being remembered by their loved ones? Can you think of a time when you felt sad because someone you loved was no longer around? What did Miguel do to honor his great-grandfather and keep his memory alive?

You can explain that it is natural to feel a mix of emotions when someone we love passes away, and that it is okay to talk about those feelings. Thereafter, you can guide your child to understand that\u2014even though it\u2019s hard to comprehend why people are suddenly \u201cgone\u201d\u2014they\u2019ll never truly be gone if we always remember them: Creating memories. Encourage children to talk about their favorite memories with the person who has passed away.

This helps keep the person\u2019s memory alive in a tangible way. Honoring traditions. Explain the importance of traditions and rituals, like those depicted in Coco. Participating in activities such as lighting candles, visiting gravesites or celebrating special holidays dedicated to remembrance can provide comfort and a sense of connection to lost loved ones. Viewing the afterlife positively. Reinforce the idea that, just like in Coco, the \u201cLand of the Dead\u201d is depicted as a beautiful and joyous place. Explain that while it is natural to feel sad when someone we love dies, we can also find comfort in thinking of them as being in a happy and peaceful place.

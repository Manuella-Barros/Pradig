Mosley did not have his mobile phone with him, hampering tracing efforts.Police, the fire brigade, the coast guard and volunteers have been searching on and off the island in the eastern Aegean assisted by a helicopter, drones and rescue dogs.On Saturday, police searches shifted focus to another rocky area, between Pedi and the beach of Agia Marina, after video footage showed Mosley walking through the village of Pedi.\"The search continues,\" spokeswoman Constantina Dimoglidou told Reuters. \"We are investigating on foot another rocky part, the wider area of Agia Marina.\"Also Read | Pakistan, Panama, Somalia, Denmark and Greece elected UNSC non-permanent membersDivers were also involved in the operation and vessels sailing nearby were on alert.Images shared with Reuters from a security camera in Pedi showed what is believed to be Mosley, strolling by at 1:49 p.m. on Wednesday, holding a sun umbrella, suggesting he may have made it safely off the coastal path.Symi Mayor Lefteris Papakalodoukas said that the images and video footage from security cameras had helped sketch out what authorities believed was Mosley's possible route, which he described as \"unconventional\".They indicated that he may have continued further through Pedi into another challenging area around Agia Marina, the mayor said.\"He chose paths which are very difficult to walk in such temperatures and under any circumstances,\" Papakalodoulkas said. \"Cameras show that he did not take the expected way back home.\"Symi, part of the Dodecanese island chain, is about 10 miles (16 km) long and has 2,500 residents. Its remote beaches were filled with sunbathers on Friday.Local authorities said that Mosley's children arrived on Friday on Symi.In a statement on Saturday to the Daily Mail, where Mosley is a columnist, his wife Dr Claire Bailey Mosley said the last three days had been \"the longest and most unbearable days for myself and my children\".\"We will not lose hope,\" she said.Mosley has appeared on programmes including the BBC series Trust Me, I'm a Doctor, the BBC's The One Show and ITV's This Morning.", "summary": "", "url": "https://indianexpress.com/article/world/rescuers-search-for-british-tv-doctor-for-third-day-on-greek-island-9380466/", "image": "https://images.indianexpress.com/2024/06/Left-to-right-2024-06-08T222508.484.jpg", "video": null, "publish_date": "2024-06-08 17:07:02", "author": "Reuters", "authors": ["Reuters"], "language": "en", "source_country": "in", "sentiment": -0.211}

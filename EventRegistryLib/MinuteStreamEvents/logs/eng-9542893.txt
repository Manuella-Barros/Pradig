(AP) - Minnesota Democrats have introduced far-reaching legislation to add abortion and LGBTQ rights to the state's constitution in hopes of making it much harder for future lawmakers to repeal these and other rights in the future.\n\nThe Minnesota Equal Rights Amendment was introduced last week and has its first legislative hearing Monday. It would be among the most expansive protections of abortion and LGBTQ rights in the nation if it is approved by lawmakers this session and then by voters on the 2026 ballot.\n\n\"This isn\u00b4t just about reproductive justice,\" said Betty Folliard, whose group ERA Minnesota has been pushing for such a measure since 2014. \"It\u00b4s also about pay inequity, historic stereotypes and discrimination that keep on being overlooked, generation to generation to generation.\"\n\nMinnesota already has a non-discrimination law, the Human Rights Act, that applies to individuals, businesses, schools and other institutions. The constitutional amendment would apply to state government, and would protect certain laws - including recent ones that have made Minnesota a refuge for out-of-state people seeking an abortion and gender-affirming care - from being repealed by future lawmakers and administrations.\n\nHouse Majority Leader Jamie Long, a Democrat of Minneapolis, said in a statement that he strongly supports the ERA proposal, saying it would \"uphold our key values of equity, non-discrimination, and reproductive freedom.\"\n\nRepublican leaders have not said whether they will support or oppose the proposal.\n\nA green sign that says \"YES on ERA!\" is held by a supporter of the proposed Minnesota Equal Rights Amendment at the Minnesota Capitol building in St. Paul, Minn., Feb. 12, 2024.

(AP Photo/Trisha Ahmed)\n\nOpponents - including anti-abortion groups, religious organizations and conservative lawmakers - say it is overreaching and divisive.\n\nThe amendment's wording would prohibit the state from discriminating against anyone on the basis of race, color, national origin, ancestry, disability or sex - including gender identity, gender expression, sexual orientation. The state also couldn't discriminate over a person \"making and effectuating decisions about all matters relating to one\u00b4s own pregnancy or decision whether to become or remain pregnant.\"\n\nIf approved by the Legislature, voters in 2026 would be asked: \"Shall the Minnesota Constitution be amended to say that all persons shall be guaranteed equal rights under the laws of this state, and shall not be discriminated against on account of race, color, national origin, ancestry, disability, or sex, including pregnancy, gender, and sexual orientation?\"\n\nIf approved, the amendment would take effect on Jan. 1, 2027.\n\nGroups opposing the proposal include Minnesota Family Council, a Christian advocacy group; Minnesota Citizens Concerned for Life, an anti-abortion group; and Minnesota Catholic Conference, a policy organization for the Catholic Church.\n\nMoses Bratrud, a spokesman for Minnesota Family Council, said in an earlier statement, \"The new ERA is about abortion and gender ideology, not protecting the rights of Minnesotans. And while previous versions of the ERA included protections based on 'creed,\u00b4 the new version removes any religious freedom protections. This is troubling to Minnesotans from all religious backgrounds.\"\n\nLast year, a different Minnesota ERA proposal passed in the Senate but did not get a final vote in the House.\n\nDemocratic Rep. Kaohly Vang Her, a chief author of the proposals last year and this year, said several Democrats had previously raised concerns that the ERA proposal needed to do more to protect the transgender community and reproductive rights.\n\nHer, of St. Paul, said increasing attacks on transgender people in recent years and the 2022 overturning of Roe v. Wade by the U.S. Supreme Court have been top of mind for many Democrats.\n\nDemocrats have only narrow majorities in each chamber -- their margin is just one vote in the Senate -- so they need the support of most in their party if Republicans oppose the legislation. If placed on the ballot, the constitutional amendment would need to be approved by a majority of all voters casting ballots, not just a majority of those voting on the question.\n\nThe proposed amendment would be different from the state\u00b4s Human Rights Act, said Megan Peterson, executive director of Gender Justice, an advocacy organization for gender equity that has been involved in crafting the ERA proposal.\n\nThe Minnesota ERA would amend the state\u00b4s constitution, which determines what kinds of laws are acceptable for state lawmakers to pass or enforce. Peterson said the language on abortion and gender expression is meant to prevent the state from banning abortion or gender-affirming care.\n\nTrisha Ahmed is a corps member for the Associated Press/Report for America Statehouse News Initiative.

PAUL, Minn. (AP) -- Minnesota Democrats have introduced far-reaching legislation to add abortion and LGBTQ rights to the state's constitution in hopes of making it much harder for future lawmakers to repeal these and other rights in the future.\n\nThe Minnesota Equal Rights Amendment was introduced last week and has its first legislative hearing Monday.

The state also couldn't discriminate over a person \"making and effectuating decisions about all matters relating to one's own pregnancy or decision whether to become or remain pregnant.\"\n\nIf approved by the Legislature, voters in 2026 would be asked: \"Shall the Minnesota Constitution be amended to say that all persons shall be guaranteed equal rights under the laws of this state, and shall not be discriminated against on account of race, color, national origin, ancestry, disability, or sex, including pregnancy, gender, and sexual orientation?\"\n\nIf approved, the amendment would take effect on Jan. 1, 2027.\n\nGroups opposing the proposal include Minnesota Family Council, a Christian advocacy group; Minnesota Citizens Concerned for Life, an anti-abortion group; and Minnesota Catholic Conference, a policy organization for the Catholic Church.\n\nMoses Bratrud, a spokesman for Minnesota Family Council, said in an earlier statement, \"The new ERA is about abortion and gender ideology, not protecting the rights of Minnesotans. And while previous versions of the ERA included protections based on 'creed,' the new version removes any religious freedom protections. This is troubling to Minnesotans from all religious backgrounds.\"\n\nLast year, a different Minnesota ERA proposal passed in the Senate but did not get a final vote in the House.\n\nDemocratic Rep. Kaohly Vang Her, a chief author of the proposals last year and this year, said several Democrats had previously raised concerns that the ERA proposal needed to do more to protect the transgender community and reproductive rights.\n\nHer, of St. Paul, said increasing attacks on transgender people in recent years and the 2022 overturning of Roe v. Wade by the U.S. Supreme Court have been top of mind for many Democrats.\n\nDemocrats have only narrow majorities in each chamber -- their margin is just one vote in the Senate -- so they need the support of most in their party if Republicans oppose the legislation. If placed on the ballot, the constitutional amendment would need to be approved by a majority of all voters casting ballots, not just a majority of those voting on the question.\n\nThe proposed amendment would be different from the state's Human Rights Act, said Megan Peterson, executive director of Gender Justice, an advocacy organization for gender equity that has been involved in crafting the ERA proposal.\n\nThe Minnesota ERA would amend the state's constitution, which determines what kinds of laws are acceptable for state lawmakers to pass or enforce. Peterson said the language on abortion and gender expression is meant to prevent the state from banning abortion or gender-affirming care.\n\nTrisha Ahmed is a corps member for the Associated Press/Report for America Statehouse News Initiative.

PAUL, Minn. (AP) -- Minnesota lawmakers launched their debate Monday on far-reaching legislation to amend the constitution to protect abortion and LGBTQ rights.\n\nThe Minnesota Equal Rights Amendment would be among the nation's most expansive protections of abortion and LGBTQ rights if it is approved by lawmakers this session and then by voters on the 2026 ballot.\n\nOver 100 people crammed into the legislative hearing room Monday. Supporters wore green clothes and buttons that said \"ERA YES\" while opponents wore bright red shirts that said \"NO CONSTITUTIONAL AMENDMENT to kill unborn babies.\"\n\nBetty Folliard, whose group ERA Minnesota has been pushing for such a measure since 2014, testified in support, as did members of Gender Justice -- an advocacy organization for gender equity -- and OutFront Minnesota, an LGBTQ+ advocacy group.\n\n\"This isn't just about reproductive justice,\" Folliard said in an interview. \"It's also about pay inequity, historic stereotypes and discrimination that keep on being overlooked, generation to generation to generation.\"\n\nThe amendment's wording would prohibit the state from discriminating against anyone on the basis of race, color, national origin, ancestry, disability or sex -- including gender identity, gender expression and sexual orientation. The state also couldn't discriminate over a person \"making and effectuating decisions about all matters relating to one's own pregnancy or decision whether to become or remain pregnant.\"\n\nMinnesota already has a non-discrimination law, the Human Rights Act, that applies to individuals, businesses, schools and other institutions. The constitutional amendment would apply to state government, and would protect certain laws -- including recent ones that have made Minnesota a refuge for out-of-state people seeking an abortion and gender-affirming care -- from being repealed by future lawmakers and administrations.\n\nCarrena Falls testified in opposition. She said she's a college student in the Twin Cities who is \"repulsed\" by the proposal, which would \"enshrine a radical abortion agenda into our Constitution.\"\n\nOthers who testified against the proposal included members of Minnesota Family Council, a Christian advocacy group; Minnesota Citizens Concerned for Life, an anti-abortion group; and Minnesota Catholic Conference, a policy organization for the Catholic Church.\n\nRebecca Delahunt, director of public policy at Minnesota Family Council, said she's concerned the ERA would grant children a constitutional right to gender-affirming care.\n\nRepublican House Minority Leader Lisa Demuth said she is \"very disappointed\" that Democrats developed the proposal without Republican input. Her motion to submit the proposal to questioning in other House committees failed along party lines.\n\nDemocrat House Majority Leader Jamie Long's motion advancing the proposal to the House floor succeeded with a 9-5 vote along party lines.\n\n\"These rights are so incredibly important,\" Long said. \"We know that Legislatures can change, and we know the courts can change. But the Constitution is the one thing that we know will stay in effect.\"\n\nIf approved by the Legislature, voters in 2026 would be asked: \"Shall the Minnesota Constitution be amended to say that all persons shall be guaranteed equal rights under the laws of this state, and shall not be discriminated against on account of race, color, national origin, ancestry, disability, or sex, including pregnancy, gender, and sexual orientation?\"\n\nIf approved, the amendment would take effect on Jan. 1, 2027.\n\nLast year, a different Minnesota ERA proposal passed in the Senate but did not get a final vote in the House.\n\nDemocratic Rep. Kaohly Vang Her, a chief author of both proposals, said several Democrats wanted the ERA to do more to protect transgender and reproductive rights. She said recent attacks on transgender people and the Supreme Court's overturning of Roe v. Wade by the U.S. Supreme Court have been top of mind for many Democrats.\n\nDemocrats have only narrow majorities -- their margin is just one vote in the Senate -- so they need the support of most in their party if Republicans oppose the legislation. If placed on the ballot, the constitutional amendment would need to be approved by a majority of all voters casting ballots, not just a majority of those voting on the question.\n\n___\n\nTrisha Ahmed is a corps member for the Associated Press/Report for America Statehouse News Initiative.

The single bill covers both issues. Next it will go to the floor for a House vote. If approved, it will move to the state Senate. The measure does not require a signature from the governor. With Senate approval, the next stop would be on the 2026 General Election ballot for Minnesota voters to decide. If approved by voters, it would go into effect in January 2027.\n\nThe amendment says the state, agency, or political subdivision of the state shall not discriminate against any person based on race, color, national origin, ancestry, disability, or sex, including but not limited to making and effecting decisions about all matters relating to one's own pregnancy, or the decision whether to become or remain pregnant; gender identity or gender expression, or sexual orientation.\n\nOpponents of the amendment, mostly Republicans, say the measure is problematic on two levels.\n\nFirst, Minnesota already allows abortion up until birth, which is broader than some Minnesotans want. Republicans don't see a reason to put it into the Constitution, making it permanent. Several who testified against the measure asked why the word \"abortion\" is not in the amendment. Without that word, they say, voters may not understand what they are voting for.\n\n\"The apparent strategy is to dupe [voters] into voting for something they overwhelmingly oppose,\" testified Cathy Blaeser of Minnesotans Concerned for Life.\n\n\"This bill cloaks abortion up to birth under the guise of 'pregnancy,' permanently enshrining unlimited abortion in our Constitution through trickery and deceit, because they know they can't win an honest discussion on the issue.\"\n\nBetty Folliard is the founder of ERA Minnesota, a coalition of activists advocating for the passage of the Equal Rights Amendment into state constitutions.\n\n\"It's time to ... end the historic stereotypes and systems of suffering, to recognize the full dignity and humanity of all Minnesotans,\" Ms. Folliard testified. \"The ERA is for all -- and all means all. Equality has no qualifiers. And let me just add that as a person of faith. My faith informs my politics. I'm an elder in the Presbyterian Church.\"\n\nBut the bill she champions does not offer any protection to unborn persons.\n\nThe second problem Republicans expressed about the amendment is that granting gender equality for transgender people creates numerous controversial issues, and it is unclear how they will be settled.\n\n\"It's no mystery how self-identification of gender plays out in society. Males get priority access to women- and girls-only spaces such as restrooms, locker rooms, domestic violence shelter placement, and prison,\" testified Rebecca Delahunt, director of public policy at the Minnesota Family Council.\n\nWould the bill require the state to pay for in-vitro fertilization treatments for women who are otherwise unable to have children? Would the state have to pay for prisoners to gender change medicine and surgery? Would women running businesses seeking state grants still be eligible for such grants?\n\nWith each question, Ms. Her said she was not sure how the law would apply in specific circumstances. She suggested the law would have to be passed first, and then the courts would interpret it.\n\n\"I can't predict, in any law that we pass, how is the court going to interpret that in the future? How is it going to be applied? How are people going to be impacted by that? That is why court case law exists,\" Ms. Her said.\n\n\"I think it is important for us to pass this so that we can figure out in the future how well some of these situations in which...women who've been discriminated against -- not being able to access certain rights -- how does that apply to them as well. This language is important for us to pass so that we can see what plays out in the future, depending on what situations arise.\"\n\nRep. Lisa Demuth, a Republican, said the committee was trying to pass the amendment before knowing how the law applies.\n\nMs. Rarick called for several votes to table the matter or send it to other committees for consideration, but the committee voted against those requests every time.\n\nAs in other states trying to get easy abortion access into the state Constitution, Minnesota Democrats fear the laws will be restricted if Republicans retake political control.\n\n\"We will not be one of those states where women are sitting in parking lots going into sepsis because their doctors are afraid to help,\" Ms. Her said. \"Anyone who believes women are protected right now, you are sorely mistaken.\"", "source": {"uri": "theepochtimes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "www.theepochtimes.com"},

The bill's sponsor, Rep. Kaohly Vang Her, DFL-St. Paul, said there's urgency to put the question to voters after the U.S. Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade and decades of constitutional protections for abortion.\n\n\"We were told Roe v. Wade was as good as law, but it was not. It was only as good as law until it was overturned,\" she said. \"We are seeing rights being limited across the country, whether it's someone's right to choose how they want to plan their families or someone's right to be an individual for themselves.\"\n\nThe hearing was also a preview of what could become an expensive statewide campaign over the proposed amendment, including fierce opposition from religious and anti-abortion groups that accused Democrats of shrouding the intent of the amendment while leaving out protections based on religious beliefs.\n\n\"Abortion advocates know if they were truthful about what they are trying to push into our Constitution, Minnesotans across the state and throughout the Twin Cities would vote a resounding no,\" said Cathy Blaeser, co-executive director of Minnesota Citizens Concerned for Life, the state's largest anti-abortion group. \"The apparent strategy is to dupe them into something they overwhelmingly oppose.\"\n\nTime is running short in the 2024 legislative session and there's pressure on Democrats to pass something while they have full control of the House and the Senate. The House is on the ballot this fall, which means the majority could flip from Democratic to Republican next year. All Republicans voted against the latest version of the amendment in committee on Monday, accusing Democrats of ramming the proposal through at the last-minute for political purposes.\n\n\"You want to jam through an amendment at the very end of session with legitimate concerns thinking if we push this through, this is a winning issue,\" House Minority Leader Lisa Demuth, R-Cold Spring, said. \"That is absolutely irresponsible legislating in this place.\"\n\nSince the Supreme Court's 2022 decision, voters in six states have weighed in on constitutional amendments regarding abortion, with abortion rights groups prevailing in every state. This fall more than a dozen states may have abortion-related measures on their ballot.\n\nA version that passed the state Senate last year with bipartisan votes would ask voters in 2024 if the Minnesota Constitution should be amended to guarantee equal rights to people no matter their \"race, color, creed, sex, sexual orientation, gender identity or expression, age, disability, ancestry, or national origin.\"\n\nConstitutional amendments must pass both the House and Senate before they can go on the ballot. The House didn't take it up last year, arguing that the language needed to more explicitly ensure legal protections for abortion and gender-affirming care.\n\nThe House version passed Monday includes protections for those making decisions \"about all matters relating to one's own pregnancy or decision whether to become or remain pregnant.\" Supporters of the House language said their version will hold up better to legal challenges than the Senate's bill.\n\nSen. Mary Kunesh, DFL-New Brighton, who is carrying the amendment in the Senate, said in a statement that she's \"glad to see the House acting to keep this important conversation going.\" Democrats control the Senate by a single vote, which has been challenged following the arrest and burglary charges facing Sen. Nicole Mitchell, DFL-Woodbury.\n\n\"Our caucus needs time to review and discuss the new language,\" Kunesh said. \"We share a commitment to equal rights and protections, and will work within our caucus and with the House to bring our paths together and pass the Equal Rights Amendment.\"\n\nOpponents said the House version attempts to trick voters by referring to \"pregnancy\" protections rather than using the word abortion. They also criticized the proposed amendment for leaving out religion and creed in its list of protections.\n\n\"Religion should be included in this ERA as it is in most civil rights ordinances,\" said Jason Adkins, executive director of the Minnesota Catholic Conference. \"Doing so is consistent with both policy and core American values.\"\n\nDemocrats said religious beliefs are already protected in the state's Constitution, and referring to pregnancy rather than abortion reflects broader protections intended with the amendment, whether someone is seeking to terminate a pregnancy or fertility treatments such as invitro-fertilization.\n\n\"It's so broad and it disheartens me to hear people saying this is only about abortion,\" said Rep. Athena Hollins, DFL-St. Paul. \"Anybody who has had a baby knows there are tons of issues that come up when you are having a child.\"", "source": {"uri": "startribune.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Star Tribune"}, "authors": [{"uri": "briana_bierschbach@startribune.com", "name": "Briana Bierschbach", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Senate", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "United States Senate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Democratic Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abortion", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Abortion"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constitution_of_the_United_States", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Constitution of the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anti-abortion_movements", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Anti-abortion movements"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roe_v._Wade", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Roe v.

The Brit only took up MMA to pursue a rematch against fellow undisputed world champion Shields after losing on points in their historic boxing fight two years ago.\n\nShields, a two-time Olympic gold medalist, won her second MMA fight in February when she beat Kelsey DeSantis at the PFL vs Bellator Championship event in Saudi Arabia. Marshall was cageside for that fight and Shields will return the favour when she visits the Vertu Motors Arena for the Brit's fight.\n\n\"She asked me to come so I'll come,\" Shields told Mirror Fighting. \"I don't see Savannah as a threat in anything. Boxing, MMA, running, basketball. I want to fight her again and whether that's in boxing or MMA, it's very interesting. I'm the better fighter, I've proved that and I'm more experienced than her in MMA.\n\n\"I'm going to Newcastle because I was asked and I respect that she's going into a different sport like I did to go and prove her greatness. I ain't no hater so I'm not going to say that I hope she loses. The better she does, the better women's boxing does and the better is looks for us. I hope she does well.\"\n\nMarshall has been training MMA for almost a year and hasn't fought in boxing since beating Shields' good friend Franchon Crews-Dezurn last July. Despite being known for her boxing abilities, Marshall has enjoyed the grappling aspect of MMA and wants to tap out Vargas for her first win in the cage.\n\nShields advised Marshall to avoid wrestling in her cage debut by adding: \"Sprawl and brawl baby. That's my advice to her. I had millions of fans watching my first MMA fight and it was a lot of pressure. I feel like it's going to be so much pressure for Savannah so I would just tell her do what she knows how to do. It's not boxing, you can't experiment when you're in the cage.\"", "source": {"uri": "mirror.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "Mirror"}, "authors": [{"uri": "harry_davies@mirror.co.uk", "name": "Harry Davies", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Claressa_Shields", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Claressa Shields"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Savannah_Marshall", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Savannah Marshall"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mixed_martial_arts", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Mixed martial arts"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boxing", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Boxing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Professional_Fighters_League", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Professional Fighters League"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newcastle_upon_Tyne", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Newcastle upon Tyne"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Newcastle upon Tyne"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Undisputed_championship_(boxing)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Undisputed championship (boxing)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Olympic_Games", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Olympic Games"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vertu_Motors_Arena", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Vertu Motors Arena"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bellator_MMA", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Bellator MMA"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basketball", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Basketball"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Savannah,_Georgia", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Savannah, Georgia"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Savannah, Georgia"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saudi_Arabia", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Saudi Arabia"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Saudi Arabia"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Women's_boxing", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Women's boxing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grappling", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Grappling"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Submission_(combat_sports)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Submission (combat sports)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wrestling", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Wrestling"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Boxing", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Boxing", "wgt": 26}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Martial_Arts/Submission_Fighting_and_MMA", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Martial Arts/Submission Fighting and MMA", "wgt": 39}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Boxing/Fan_Pages", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Boxing/Fan Pages", "wgt": 25}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Boxing/Gyms", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Boxing/Gyms", "wgt": 23}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Boxing", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Boxing", "wgt": 23}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 73}], "image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article32951826.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_untitledpng-60.png", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9623947", "eventUri": "eng-9623947", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.05098039215686279, "wgt": 203, "relevance": 1}

She followed up the fight by beating Franchon Crews-Dezurn in a majority decision for the undisputed super middleweight crown in July.\n\n\"It was just the opportunity [from the PFL to fight in MMA] - something I hadn't considered before,\" Marshall told BoxingScene. \"I was supposed to box in March, and the PFL came to me for June 8, along with a potential matchup against Claressa Shields in the cage.

I went in there thinking it would be a piece of cake, but that has not been the case at all. It has been a total overhaul for me. I've been boxing for over 20 years, so it's new, exciting and refreshing. I've really enjoyed it.\"\n\nMarshall is 33 years old and has been boxing professionally for seven years.\n\nShe now finds herself at a career crossroads in two different fighting disciplines.\n\n\"Boxing is still my first love,\" Marshall said. \"I think we are going to have to wait and see what happens June 8. It could be, 'Wow, this is me now, and we are going to have a good go at this.' Or it will be, 'God, this isn't for me.'\n\n\"Financially, it's not a lucrative opportunity.

DAZN will air the bout live on July 27 from Little Caesars Arena in Detroit, Michigan.\n\nThe event marks a return to the same location where Shields (14-0, 2 knockouts) fought last June 5. She defeated Maricela Cornejo via decision to defend her RING and undisputed middleweight championship.\n\nIt has been a struggle to find willing takers in the interim, a development that prompted her return to MMA.

Her pro career has been just as stellar, having won titles in three weight divisions.

The 28-year-old from Saint Andr\u00e9 Avellin, Quebec, Canada beat Abril Argentina via split decision on March 7 in Montreal. The win extended her current four-fight win streak, all upon her 2023 return after a six-year absence.\n\nThe lone defeat on her record came in an August 2017 knockout defeat to Alejandra Jimenez with the same belt at stake. She traveled to Mexico that night and will fight outside of Canada for the third time in her career.\n\nThis trip will mark Lepage-Joanisse's U.S. debut, versus the sport's absolute best.\n\n\"It doesn't matter to me whether it's Claressa or someone else. My life is all about challenges,\" said Lepage-Joanisse. \"I've always faced them head-on, and I intend to keep it that way.\"\n\nLepage-Joanisse weighed 173 \u00bc pounds in her heavyweight title win. Her ability to get that light factored into also having a light heavyweight belt at stake.\n\nThe show is a continuation of the extraordinary efforts put forth by Dmitriy Salita, whose Salita Promotions has revitalized the Detroit boxing scene. His company has a regular prospect-based series on DAZN, though this show called for a major production upgrade.\n\n\"From the beginning of her career, Claressa has been on a quest to make her story a part of history,\" said Salita. \"This fight is one of Claressa's hardest challenges, moving up two weight divisions to challenge the current Heavyweight World Champion.\n\n\"It's 'Claressa vs. Vanessa' for the unified world title in Detroit, one of boxing's historic homes. There is no better venue for this epic showdown than the beautiful, world-class Little Caesars Arena.\"\n\nAdded Mark Taffet, Shields' manager: \"With every fight, Claressa Shields continues to raise the bar for women's boxing. Claressa embraces the challenge of moving up two weight classes in her quest to win a world title in her fourth weight division.

After a lengthy build-up that harkened back to their amateur days, the pair made history and broke records in their London O2 Arena headliner.\n\nBut with talks stalled over a potential ring rematch and Shields making waves during a crossover to MMA, she has felt isolated at the top of her weight division. As a result, she has signed up with the sport's fastest growing promotion and is chasing the rematch in their 'Smart Cage'.\n\nMore than two million UK viewers tuned into Sky Sports to watch the highly-anticipated boxing fight between the pair in October of 2022. Shields won by unanimous decision in order to maintain her unbeaten career start, and has since returned to the cage under the PFL banner.\n\nAnd speaking with Bloody Elbow in an exclusive chat, Marshall explained that she has made the transition in order to pursue the monumental rematch. Her journey begins against Mirela Vargas in the main event at Newcastle's Utilitia Arena on Friday night.\n\n\"For me, I was devastated I never got the rematch in the ring,\" she admitted. \"Especially seeing the likes of Katie Taylor vs Amanda Serrano or Chantelle Cameron, I am just devastated that it never happened straight away.\n\n\"This was probably a push for why I've jumped to MMA because I've got a chance to get that redemption back, that win. With our division, it's not like the lighter weights where there's three, four, five elites in that pack it's literally me and Claressa.\n\n\"I know she'd never admit it but she knows that we're good for each other in terms of rivalry... I'm just devastated that the rematch didn't happen straight away, it was still so raw in everyone's mind it should have happened straight away.\n\n\"But it didn't happen due to boxing politics which is always the case. At the minute it's sounding more than likely that it will happen in the cage over the ring. But we have to get through June 8 first, I could get punched in the head and think 'oh this isn't for me'.\"\n\nThe pair have fought multiple times in the ring, with Claressa Shields' last defeat in the sport coming during an amateur bout. Their professional meeting went the distance and was a close affair, with the American taking home the belts.\n\nBut now, both without too much experience across the other martial arts and disciplines, they add a new dimension as they put on 4oz gloves and step into the cage. \"She hasn't been wrestling all through school and she hasn't got a black belt in Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu which evens it out,\" Marshall added.\n\nIf the PFL came to me and said 'would you like to join our league?' I would have said no way, I'm 32-years-old and I've been boxing a long time, taking a lot of punishment.\n\n\"I don't really want to go to another sport and try to be the top of something. But they've come to me and said 'would you be interested in a potential fight with her and I'm like 'God yeah, she's not a million miles in front of me, she's had three or four fights and it's not like she's lighting it up.\n\n\"She can't mix it with the best of them in the league, it's just a great fight. A couple of MMA fighters have said that you get a lot of them switching to boxing but you rarely see boxers come to MMA. I can see why because Jesus, it's tough!\"\n\nMarshall has travelled to New York and Saudi Arabia for promotional appearances alongside her rival in the last year. And she expects Shields to return the favour by coming to Newcastle this weekend for her cage debut.\n\nThe pair have even developed a grudging dynamic that borders on an 'odd couple' friendship. \"I think sometimes I don't think she knows how to act around me because British humour is a lot different to American humour,\" the Brit noted.\n\n\"And I think she's a bit frosty. But there's been a couple of times now that we've been in each other's company. I think that she's starting to understand that I'm not as dry as what maybe my humour is.\n\n\"She's had three or four in this MMA now, this is my first one. I was with her in Saudi and I was asking if she was going to come to my fight. She said 'oh I don't know, I don't know' and I've told her she has to come.\n\n\"I've gone and sat ringside and ripped you for not being able to get up off your back. So she has to come to Newcastle because hopefully I'm not in the same predicament but it's going to come. She said she was, so we'll have to see if she's a woman of her word.\"\n\nAnd Marshall admits that she often finds herself giggling as Shields engages in a number of outlandish social media feuds with boxing's biggest names. \"I just couldn't be bothered,\" Marshall said of her own output online, before praising her greatest rival.\n\n\"The one thing I've found out about her is she's actually really funny without knowing it. Sometimes I see her tweets and her posts and I'd be laughing because she's actually being really serious. Look, she gets people talking about her and that's what she's after.\"", "source": {"uri": "bloodyelbow.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Bloody Elbow"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

Not in this fight specifically but I think moving forward she will do well and it'll be a good fit for her...I've been watching footage of her and some other female boxers as well. I definitely think she will feel the difference in the cage when we're grappling. It's a different ballgame and I think that's when we're going to see myself shine more than her.\"\n\nIn terms of her own career, Vargas says that she actually had hoped to sign with the PFL as she got her career going.\n\n\"PFL gives out good contracts to the athletes. A living wage. Some of the other promotions, if you are not famous, it is hard to make a living wage right off the bat. In the PFL, they are paying me a good purse for my first fight so I can actually make a living fighting.\"\n\nAnother added benefit to being a part of the PFL: the potential to fight alongside one of her inspirations in longtime Bellator featherweight champion Cris \"Cyborg\" Justino. A promoter herself, Justino put on an event last year where Vargas was part of the card. Now under the same umbrella, she admits it would be a dream come true to get to be part of an event where she fights on the same night as her legendary countrywoman.\n\n\"Oh my God. It would be a dream come true to fight on the same card as her, oh my gosh. She might not know or have any idea but she is a part of my story so that would just mean everything to me.\"", "source": {"uri": "cagesidepress.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Cageside Press"}, "authors": [{"uri": "gabriel_gonzalez@cagesidepress.com", "name": "Gabriel Gonzalez", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Professional_Fighters_League", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Professional Fighters League"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Savannah_Marshall", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Savannah Marshall"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boxing", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Boxing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Women's_boxing", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Women's boxing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UEFA", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "UEFA"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newcastle_upon_Tyne", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Newcastle upon Tyne"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Newcastle upon Tyne"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brazil", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Brazil"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Brazil"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amanda_Serrano", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Amanda Serrano"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heather_Hardy", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Heather Hardy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bellator_MMA", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Bellator MMA"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Claressa_Shields", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Claressa Shields"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mixed_martial_arts", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Mixed martial arts"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grappling", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Grappling"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Promoter_(entertainment)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Promoter (entertainment)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Featherweight", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Featherweight"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Boxing", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Boxing", "wgt": 18}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Martial_Arts/Submission_Fighting_and_MMA", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Martial Arts/Submission Fighting and MMA", "wgt": 18}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Team_Spirit/Fight_Songs", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Team Spirit/Fight Songs", "wgt": 20}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Boxing/History", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Boxing/History", "wgt": 17}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Boxing/Boxers", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Boxing/Boxers", "wgt": 19}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 73}], "image": "https://cagesidepress.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/maxresdefault-1.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9623947", "eventUri": "eng-9623947", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.607843137254902, "wgt": 144, "relevance": 1}

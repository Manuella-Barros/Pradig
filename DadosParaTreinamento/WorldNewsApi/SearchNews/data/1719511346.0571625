And welcome to Face the Nation on this Memorial Day weekend- where we honor those Americans who died in service and reflect on what they fought for. Those principles are nearly 250 years old, and are becoming increasingly challenged by political forces these days. Politics was set aside Thursday morning, at least long enough for a group of House members, all veterans, who are part of the For Country Caucus, to join the annual cleanup of the Vietnam Veterans\u2019 Memorial ahead of the holiday weekend. We asked Florida Republican Mike Waltz and New York Democrat Pat Ryan about the now-annual tradition for the caucus. MIKE WALTZ: Once I got elected, you know, and I saw the acrimony and the infighting, and I said, you know, let's- let\u2019s get a group of veterans together, people who really have skin in the game. I think it's important for the American people to see, to see us honoring our forefathers, to see us where Democrat, Republican, black, white, brown, none of that matters. It just matters that we're all Americans, we're all veterans and we're honoring those that came before us. PAT RYAN: This is the most powerful thing I've done in Congress, truly. It's very emotional. And it's -- it's positive. I mean, there's so many divisive forces and so to get together with fellow veterans, all services, all generations, and just actually do something with your hands that improves the world, that honors our veterans, that prepares this memorial for hundreds of thousands of Americans that are going to come here this weekend. It\u2019s an honor.", "summary": "CBS\u2019s Sunday affairs show Face the Nation opened its Memorial Day weekend broadcast the right way- by taking a moment to put things in perspective, and honoring our Nation\u2019s fallen, before entering into its normal routine.\u00a0\n\nWatch the show\u2019s open as aired on Sunday, May 26th, 2024:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Good morning.

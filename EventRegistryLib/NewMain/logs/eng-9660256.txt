(AP) -- Kansas legislators approved a plan Tuesday aimed at luring the Kansas City Chiefs away from Missouri by helping to finance a new stadium for the Super Bowl champions.\n\nThe bill passed by the Republican-controlled Legislature and sent to Democratic Gov. Laura Kelly would allow Kansas to issue bonds to cover up to 70% of the costs of a new stadium in the state for the Chiefs and another for Major League Baseball's Kansas City Royals.\n\nThe state would pay off its bonds over 30 years with revenues from sports betting, Kansas Lottery ticket sales and new sales and alcohol taxes collected from shopping and entertainment districts around the sites for the new stadiums.\n\nKelly has not said whether she will sign the bill. But her chief of staff told lawmakers Monday that she had seen nothing in the version that passed that would make her veto it.\n\nKansas legislators see the two teams as in play because in April, voters on the Missouri side of the Kansas City metropolitan area refused to extend a sales tax used to keep up the teams' existing stadiums, which sit side by side.\n\nThe votes came after a debate that many lawmakers said they needed to see before considering a plan to help the Super Bowl champions finance a new stadium. The measure would allow the state to issue bonds to help the Chiefs and Major League Baseball's Kansas City Royals finance new stadiums on the Kansas side of their metropolitan area, which is split by the border with Missouri.\n\nTop Republicans in the GOP-controlled Legislature had promised that the stadium proposal wouldn't be debated until the Legislature approved a plan that would cut income and property taxes by a total of $1.23 billion over the next three years. Many lawmakers argued that voters would be angry if the state helped finance new stadiums without cutting taxes.\n\n\"We definitely need to demonstrate that we're getting relief to our citizens,\" said Senate President Ty Masterson, a Wichita-area Republican who backed the stadium-financing plan.\n\nKelly called the special session to have lawmakers consider reducing taxes after she vetoed three tax-cutting plans before legislators adjourned their regular annual session May 1. The plan lawmakers approved was a compromise between her and Republican leaders.\n\nOnce legislators convened the special session, Kelly couldn't control what they considered, and that created an opening to consider the stadium-financing plan. That measure would use revenues from sports betting, the state lottery and new taxes raised from the area around each new stadium to pay off the state's bonds over 30 years.\n\nThe first version of the stadium-financing plan emerged in late April, but lawmakers didn't vote on it before adjourning. It would have allowed state bonds to finance all stadium construction costs, but the version passed by lawmakers Tuesday would cap the amount at 70% and require legislative leaders and the governor to sign off on any bonding plan.\n\nHouse Commerce Committee Chair Sean Tarwater, a Kansas City-area Republican, said the Chiefs are likely to spend between $500 million and $700 million in private funds on a new stadium.\n\n\"There are no blank checks,\" Tarwater told GOP colleagues during a briefing on the plan before the House began debating it.\n\nA new nonprofit group, Scoop and Score, formed last month to push for bringing the Chiefs to Kansas, and that group and the Royals together hired more than 30 lobbyists for the special session. But the national free-market, small-government group Americans for Prosperity and the Kansas Policy Institute, a free-market think tank, oppose the measure, and both have been influential with conservative Republicans.\n\nFree-market conservatives have long opposed state and local subsidies for specific businesses or projects. And economists who've studied pro sports teams have concluded in dozens of studies over decades that subsidizing their stadiums isn't worth the cost.\n\n\"Most of the money that gets spent on the Chiefs is money that would otherwise be spent on other entertainment projects,\" said Andrew Zimbalist, an economics professor at Smith College in central Massachusetts who has written multiple books about sports.\n\nKansas legislators consider the Chiefs and Royals in play because in April, voters on the Missouri side of the metro area refused to continue a local sales tax for the upkeep of the complex with their side-by-side stadiums. Missouri officials have said they'll do whatever it takes to keep the teams but haven't outlined any proposals.\n\nThe two teams' lease on their stadium complex runs through January 2031, but Korb Maxwell, an attorney for the Chiefs who lives on the Kansas side, said renovations on the team's Arrowhead Stadium should be planned seven or eight years in advance.\n\n\"There is an urgency to this,\" added David Frantz, the Royals' general counsel.\n\nSupporters of the stadium plan argued that economists' past research doesn't apply to the Chiefs and Royals. They said the bonds will be paid off with tax revenues that aren't being generated now and would never be without the stadiums or the development around them. Masterson said it's wrong to call the bonds a subsidy.\n\nAnd Maxwell said: \"For a town to be major league, they need major league teams.\"\n\nBut economists who've studied pro sports said similar arguments have been a staple of past debates over paying for new stadiums. Development around a new stadium lessens development elsewhere, where the tax dollars generated would go to fund services or schools, they said.\n\n\"It could still help Kansas and maybe hurt Missouri

Many lawmakers argued that voters would be angry if the state helped finance new stadiums without cutting taxes.\n\n\"We definitely need to demonstrate that we're getting relief to our citizens,\" said Senate President Ty Masterson, a Wichita-area Republican who backed the stadium-financing plan.\n\nKelly called a special session to have lawmakers consider reducing taxes after she vetoed three tax-cutting plans before legislators adjourned their regular annual session May 1. Once legislators convened the special session, Kelly couldn't control what they considered, and that created an opening to consider the stadium-financing plan.\n\nThe first version of the plan emerged in late April, but lawmakers didn't vote on it before adjourning. It would have allowed state bonds to finance all stadium construction costs, but the version passed by lawmakers Tuesday would cap the amount at 70% and require legislative leaders and the governor to sign off on any bonding plan.\n\nHouse Commerce Committee Chair Sean Tarwater, a Kansas City-area Republican, said the Chiefs are likely to spend between $500 million and $700 million in private funds on a new stadium.\n\n\"There are no blank checks,\" Tarwater told GOP colleagues during a briefing on the plan before the House began debating it.\n\nA new nonprofit group, Scoop and Score, formed last month to push for bringing the Chiefs to Kansas, and that group and the Royals together hired more than 30 lobbyists for the special session. But the national free-market, small-government group Americans for Prosperity and the Kansas Policy Institute, a free-market think tank, oppose the measure, and both have been influential with conservative Republicans.\n\nFree-market conservatives have long opposed state and local subsidies for specific businesses or projects. And economists who've studied pro sports teams have concluded in dozens of studies over decades that subsidizing their stadiums isn't worth the cost.\n\nMissouri officials have said they'll do whatever it takes to keep the teams but haven't outlined any proposals.\n\n\"The story now is that today was largely in my opinion about leverage,\" Kansas City, Mo., Mayor Quinton Lucas said. \"And the teams are in an exceptional leverage position.\"\n\nThe two teams' lease on their stadium complex runs through January 2031, but Maxwell said renovations on the team's Arrowhead Stadium should be planned seven or eight years in advance.\n\n\"There is an urgency to this,\" added David Frantz, the Royals' general counsel.\n\nSupporters of the stadium plan argued that economists' past research doesn't apply to the Chiefs and Royals. They said the bonds will be paid off with tax revenues that aren't being generated now and would never be without the stadiums or the development around them.

It would have allowed state bonds to finance all stadium construction costs, but supporters later opted for the 70% cap to pick up votes, and the plan also would require legislative leaders and the governor to sign off on any bonding plan.\n\nHouse Commerce Committee Chair Sean Tarwater, a Kansas City-area Republican, said the Chiefs are likely to spend between $500 million and $700 million in private funds on a new stadium.\n\n\"There are no blank checks,\" Tarwater told GOP colleagues during a briefing on the plan before the House began debating it.\n\nA new nonprofit group, Scoop and Score, formed last month to push for bringing the Chiefs to Kansas, and that group and the Royals together hired more than 30 lobbyists for the special session. But the national free-market, small-government group Americans for Prosperity and the Kansas Policy Institute, a free-market think tank, oppose the measure, and both have been influential with conservative Republicans.\n\nFree-market conservatives have long opposed state and local subsidies for specific businesses or projects. And economists who've studied pro sports teams have concluded in dozens of studies over decades that subsidizing their stadiums isn't worth the cost.\n\n\"Most of the money that gets spent on the Chiefs is money that would otherwise be spent on other entertainment projects,\" said Andrew Zimbalist, an economics professor at Smith College in central Massachusetts who has written multiple books about sports.\n\nMissouri officials have said they'll do whatever it takes to keep the teams but haven't outlined any proposals.\n\n\"The story now is that today was largely in my opinion about leverage,\" Lucas said. \"And the teams are in an exceptional leverage position.\"\n\nThe two teams' lease on their stadium complex runs through January 2031, but Maxwell said renovations on the team's Arrowhead Stadium should be planned seven or eight years in advance.\n\n\"There is an urgency to this,\" added David Frantz, the Royals' general counsel.\n\nSupporters of the stadium plan argued that economists' past research doesn't apply to the Chiefs and Royals. They said the bonds will be paid off with tax revenues that aren't being generated now and would never be without the stadiums or the development around them. Masterson said it's wrong to call the bonds a subsidy.\n\nAnd Maxwell said: \"For a town to be major league, they need major league teams.\"\n\nBut economists who've studied pro sports said similar arguments have been a staple of past debates over paying for new stadiums. Development around a new stadium lessens development elsewhere, where the tax dollars generated would go to fund services or schools, they said.\n\n\"It could still help Kansas and maybe hurt Missouri by the same amount,\" Zimbalist said. \"It's a zero-sum game.\"", "source": {"uri": "lasvegassun.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Las Vegas Sun"}, "authors": [{"uri":

(AP) - Kansas lawmakers hoping to lure the Kansas City Chiefs from Missouri are trying to win over skeptical colleagues by narrowing their proposal for encouraging the Super Bowl champions to build a new stadium and by linking it to a plan for broad tax cuts.\n\nThe Legislature expected to consider the stadium proposal during a special session set to convene Tuesday. The measure would allow the state to issue bonds to help the Chiefs and Major League Baseball's Kansas City Royals finance new stadiums on the Kansas side of their metropolitan area, which is split by the border with Missouri.\n\nSupporters on Monday backed away from an earlier plan to allow state bonds to cover all of the construction costs for new stadiums. Their plan would use revenues from sports betting, the state lottery and new taxes raised from the area around each new stadium.\n\nTop Republicans in the GOP-controlled Legislature also said the stadium proposal is their second priority during the special session, behind cutting income and property taxes. Democratic Gov. Laura Kelly called the special session to consider tax cuts, but she cannot limit what lawmakers consider - creating an opening for a plan to woo the Chiefs and Royals.\n\n\"We definitely need to demonstrate that we\u00b4re getting relief to our citizens,\" said Senate President Ty Masterson, a Wichita-area Republican who is backing the plan.\n\nMany lawmakers have argued that voters would be angry if the state helped finance new stadiums without cutting taxes. Kelly vetoed three tax-cutting plans before legislators adjourned their regular annual session May 1, but she and top Republican lawmakers have drafted a compromise measure to reduce taxes by $1.23 billion over the next three years.\n\nFILE - Fans cheer at Arrowhead Stadium during the first half of an NFL football game between the Kansas City Chiefs and the Detroit Lions, Sept. 7, 202, in Kansas City, Mo. The Kansas Legislature's top leaders endorsed helping the Chiefs and professional baseball's Kansas City Royals finance new stadiums in Kansas ahead of a special session set to convene Tuesday. The plan would authorize state bonds for stadium construction and pay them off with revenues from sports betting, the Kansas Lottery and new tax dollars generated in and around the new venues. (AP Photo/Reed Hoffmann. File)\n\nThe first version of the stadium-financing plan emerged in late April, but lawmakers didn't vote on it before adjourning. It would have allowed state bonds to finance all stadium construction costs, but the latest version caps the amount at 70%, and it says legislative leaders and the governor must sign off on any bonding plan.\n\nSupporters of the plan also modified it so that it only applies to professional football and Major League Baseball stadiums, instead of any professional sports stadium for at least 30,000 spectators. Bonds would be paid off over 30 years.\n\n\"We're trying to bring something grand to the state of Kansas,\" said state Rep. Sean Tarwater, a Kansas City-area Republican leading the push for a stadium plan.\n\nFree-market conservatives in Kansas have long opposed state and local subsidies for specific businesses or projects. And economists who\u00b4ve studied pro sports teams have concluded in dozens of studies over decades that subsidizing their stadiums isn\u00b4t worth the cost.\n\n\"Most of the money that gets spent on the Chiefs is money that would otherwise be spent on other entertainment projects,\" said Andrew Zimbalist, an economics professor at Smith College in central Massachusetts who has written multiple books about sports.\n\nKelly told reporters Monday that she won't \"invest a lot of energy\" in a stadium plan, letting lawmakers lead. She and Missouri Gov. Mike Parson, a Republican, signed an agreement in 2019 to end years of each state using subsidies to steal the other state's jobs in the Kansas City area, but Kelly argued that their truce doesn't apply to the Chiefs and Royals.\n\n\"We never discussed the teams,\" she said.\n\nKansas legislators consider the Chiefs and Royals in play because in April, voters on the Missouri side of the metro area refused to continue a local sales tax for the upkeep of the complex with their side-by-side stadiums. Missouri officials have said they'll do whatever it takes to keep the teams but haven't outlined any proposals.\n\nThe two teams' lease on their stadium complex runs through January 2031, but Korb Maxwell, an attorney for the Chiefs who lives on the Kansas side, said renovations on the team's Arrowhead Stadium should be planned seven or eight years in advance.\n\n\"There is an urgency to this,\" added David Frantz, the Royals\u00b4 general counsel.\n\nSupporters of the stadium plan argued that economists' past research doesn't apply to the Chiefs and Royals. They said the bonds will be paid off with tax revenues that aren't being generated now and would never be without the stadiums or the development around them.

The Kansas Legislature's top leaders endorsed helping the Chiefs and professional baseball's Kansas City Royals finance new stadiums in Kansas ahead of a [...]\n\nTOPEKA, Kan. (AP) -- Kansas lawmakers hoping to lure the Kansas City Chiefs from Missouri are trying to win over skeptical colleagues by narrowing their proposal for encouraging the Super Bowl champions to build a new stadium and by linking it to a plan for broad tax cuts.\n\nThe Legislature expected to consider the stadium proposal during a special session set to convene Tuesday. The measure would allow the state to issue bonds to help the Chiefs and Major League Baseball's Kansas City Royals finance new stadiums on the Kansas side of their metropolitan area, which is split by the border with Missouri.\n\nSupporters on Monday backed away from an earlier plan to allow state bonds to cover all of the construction costs for new stadiums. Their plan would use revenues from sports betting, the state lottery and new taxes raised from the area around each new stadium.\n\nTop Republicans in the GOP-controlled Legislature also said the stadium proposal is their second priority during the special session, behind cutting income and property taxes. Democratic Gov. Laura Kelly called the special session to consider tax cuts, but she cannot limit what lawmakers consider -- creating an opening for a plan to woo the Chiefs and Royals.\n\n\"We definitely need to demonstrate that we're getting relief to our citizens,\" said Senate President Ty Masterson, a Wichita-area Republican who is backing the plan.\n\nMany lawmakers have argued that voters would be angry if the state helped finance new stadiums without cutting taxes. Kelly vetoed three tax-cutting plans before legislators adjourned their regular annual session May 1, but she and top Republican lawmakers have drafted a compromise measure to reduce taxes by $1.23 billion over the next three years.\n\nThe first version of the stadium-financing plan emerged in late April, but lawmakers didn't vote on it before adjourning. It would have allowed state bonds to finance all stadium construction costs, but the latest version caps the amount at 70%, and it says legislative leaders and the governor must sign off on any bonding plan.\n\nSupporters of the plan also modified it so that it only applies to professional football and Major League Baseball stadiums, instead of any professional sports stadium for at least 30,000 spectators. Bonds would be paid off over 30 years.\n\n\"We're trying to bring something grand to the state of Kansas,\" said state Rep. Sean Tarwater, a Kansas City-area Republican leading the push for a stadium plan.\n\nFree-market conservatives in Kansas have long opposed state and local subsidies for specific businesses or projects. And economists who've studied pro sports teams have concluded in dozens of studies over decades that subsidizing their stadiums isn't worth the cost.\n\n\"Most of the money that gets spent on the Chiefs is money that would otherwise be spent on other entertainment projects,\" said Andrew Zimbalist, an economics professor at Smith College in central Massachusetts who has written multiple books about sports.\n\nKelly told reporters Monday that she won't \"invest a lot of energy\" in a stadium plan, letting lawmakers lead. She and Missouri Gov. Mike Parson, a Republican, signed an agreement in 2019 to end years of each state using subsidies to steal the other state's jobs in the Kansas City area, but Kelly argued that their truce doesn't apply to the Chiefs and Royals.\n\n\"We never discussed the teams,\" she said.\n\nKansas legislators consider the Chiefs and Royals in play because in April, voters on the Missouri side of the metro area refused to continue a local sales tax for the upkeep of the complex with their side-by-side stadiums. Missouri officials have said they'll do whatever it takes to keep the teams but haven't outlined any proposals.\n\nThe two teams' lease on their stadium complex runs through January 2031, but Korb Maxwell, an attorney for the Chiefs who lives on the Kansas side, said renovations on the team's Arrowhead Stadium should be planned seven or eight years in advance.\n\n\"There is an urgency to this,\" added David Frantz, the Royals' general counsel.\n\nSupporters of the stadium plan argued that economists' past research doesn't apply to the Chiefs and Royals. They said the bonds will be paid off with tax revenues that aren't being generated now and would never be without the stadiums or the development around them. Masterson said it's wrong to call the bonds a subsidy.\n\nAnd Maxwell said: \"For a town to be major league, they need major league teams.\"\n\nBut economists who've studied pro sports said similar arguments have been a staple of past debates over paying for new stadiums. Development around a new stadium lessens development elsewhere, where the tax dollars generated would go to fund services or schools, they said.\n\n\"It could still help Kansas and maybe hurt Missouri by the same amount,\" Zimbalist said. \"It's a zero-sum game.\"", "source": {"uri": "tribtown.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Tribune"}, "authors": [{"uri": "associated_press@tribtown.com",

(AP) -- Kansas legislators approved a bipartisan plan Tuesday aimed at luring the Kansas City Chiefs away from Missouri by helping to finance a new stadium for the Super Bowl champions.\n\nThe bill passed by the Republican-controlled Legislature and sent to Democratic Gov. Laura Kelly would allow Kansas to issue bonds to cover up to 70% of the costs of a new stadium in the state for the Chiefs and another for Major League Baseball's Kansas City Royals. The plan also encourages the teams to move their practice facilities to the Kansas side of the metropolitan area, which is split by the two states' border.\n\nKansas would pay off its bonds over 30 years with revenues from sports betting, Kansas Lottery ticket sales and new sales and alcohol taxes collected from shopping and entertainment districts around the sites for the new stadiums.\n\nKorb Maxell, an attorney for the Chiefs who lives on the Kansas side of the border, said the state's lawmakers were \"embracing the possibility of the Chiefs and the Royals\" and can now make a \"very compelling offer\" to the NFL team.\n\n\"We're excited about what happened here today,\" he said after the bill cleared the Legislature. \"This is incredibly real.\"\n\nThe votes were 84-38 in the House and 27-8 in the Senate. Kelly stopped short of saying she'll sign the stadium-financing bill, but in a statement, she praised the effort behind it.\n\n\"Kansas now has the opportunity to become a professional sports powerhouse,\" she said.\n\nKansas legislators see the two teams as in play because in April, voters on the Missouri side of the Kansas City metropolitan area refused to extend a sales tax used to keep up the teams' existing stadiums, which sit side by side.\n\nA spokeswoman for Missouri Gov. Mike Parson did not immediately return an email message seeking comment. But in Kansas City Missouri, Mayor Quinton Lucas promised to \"lay out a good offer\" to keep both teams from moving to Kansas.\n\nIn Kansas, top Republicans in the GOP-controlled Legislature had promised that the stadium proposal wouldn't be debated until the Legislature approved a plan that would cut income and property taxes by a total of $1.23 billion over the next three years. Many lawmakers argued that voters would be angry if the state helped finance new stadiums without cutting taxes.\n\n\"We definitely need to demonstrate that we're getting relief to our citizens,\" said Senate President Ty Masterson, a Wichita-area Republican who backed the stadium-financing plan.\n\nKelly called a special session to have lawmakers consider reducing taxes after she vetoed three tax-cutting plans before legislators adjourned their regular annual session May 1. Once legislators convened the special session, Kelly couldn't control what they considered, and that created an opening to consider the stadium-financing plan.\n\nThe first version of the plan emerged in late April, but lawmakers didn't vote on it before adjourning. It would have allowed state bonds to finance all stadium construction costs, but supporters later opted for the 70% cap to pick up votes, and the plan also would require legislative leaders and the governor to sign off on any bonding plan.\n\nHouse Commerce Committee Chair Sean Tarwater, a Kansas City-area Republican, said the Chiefs are likely to spend between $500 million and $700 million in private funds on a new stadium.\n\n\"There are no blank checks,\" Tarwater told GOP colleagues during a briefing on the plan before the House began debating it.\n\nA new nonprofit group, Scoop and Score, formed last month to push for bringing the Chiefs to Kansas, and that group and the Royals together hired more than 30 lobbyists for the special session. But the national free-market, small-government group Americans for Prosperity and the Kansas Policy Institute, a free-market think tank, oppose the measure, and both have been influential with conservative Republicans.\n\nFree-market conservatives have long opposed state and local subsidies for specific businesses or projects. And economists who've studied pro sports teams have concluded in dozens of studies over decades that subsidizing their stadiums isn't worth the cost.\n\n\"Most of the money that gets spent on the Chiefs is money that would otherwise be spent on other entertainment projects,\" said Andrew Zimbalist, an economics professor at Smith College in central Massachusetts who has written multiple books about sports.\n\nMissouri officials have said they'll do whatever it takes to keep the teams but haven't outlined any proposals.\n\n\"The story now is that today was largely in my opinion about leverage,\" Lucas said. \"And the teams are in an exceptional leverage position.\"\n\nThe two teams' lease on their stadium complex runs through January 2031, but Maxwell said renovations on the team's Arrowhead Stadium should be planned seven or eight years in advance.\n\n\"There is an urgency to this,\" added David Frantz, the Royals' general counsel.\n\nSupporters of the stadium plan argued that economists' past research doesn't apply to the Chiefs and Royals. They said the bonds will be paid off with tax revenues that aren't being generated now and would never be without the stadiums or the development around them. Masterson said it's wrong to call the bonds a subsidy.\n\nAnd Maxwell said: \"For a town to be major league, they need major league teams.\"\n\nBut economists who've studied pro sports said similar arguments have been a staple of past debates over paying for new stadiums. Development around a new stadium lessens development elsewhere, where the tax dollars generated would go to fund services or schools, they said.\n\n\"It could still help Kansas and maybe hurt Missouri by the same amount,\" Zimbalist said. \"It's a zero-sum game.\"", "source": {"uri": "santamariatimes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Santa Maria Times"}, "authors": [{"uri":

Fred Patton, R-Topeka, wears a Kansas City Chiefs pin on the lapel of his suit jacket ahead of a legislative hearing on a proposal to allow Kansas to issue bonds to help finance a new stadium for the professional football team in Kansas, Monday, June 17, 2024, at the Statehouse in Topeka, Kan. Patton represents Scoop and Score, a nonprofit backing the plan, and he is among nearly three dozen lobbyists working for it.\n\nTOPEKA, Kan. (AP) -- Kansas lawmakers hoping to lure the Kansas City Chiefs from Missouri are trying to win over skeptical colleagues by narrowing their proposal for encouraging the Super Bowl champions to build a new stadium and by linking it to a plan for broad tax cuts.\n\nThe Legislature expected to consider the stadium proposal during a special session set to convene Tuesday. The measure would allow the state to issue bonds to help the Chiefs and Major League Baseball's Kansas City Royals finance new stadiums on the Kansas side of their metropolitan area, which is split by the border with Missouri.\n\nSupporters on Monday backed away from an earlier plan to allow state bonds to cover all of the construction costs for new stadiums. Their plan would use revenues from sports betting, the state lottery and new taxes raised from the area around each new stadium.\n\nTop Republicans in the GOP-controlled Legislature also said the stadium proposal is their second priority during the special session, behind cutting income and property taxes. Democratic Gov. Laura Kelly called the special session to consider tax cuts, but she cannot limit what lawmakers consider -- creating an opening for a plan to woo the Chiefs and Royals.\n\n\"We definitely need to demonstrate that we're getting relief to our citizens,\" said Senate President Ty Masterson, a Wichita-area Republican who is backing the plan.\n\nMany lawmakers have argued that voters would be angry if the state helped finance new stadiums without cutting taxes.

It would have allowed state bonds to finance all stadium construction costs, but the latest version caps the amount at 70%, and it says legislative leaders and the governor must sign off on any bonding plan.\n\nSupporters of the plan also modified it so that it only applies to professional football and Major League Baseball stadiums, instead of any professional sports stadium for at least 30,000 spectators. Bonds would be paid off over 30 years.\n\n\"We're trying to bring something grand to the state of Kansas,\" said state Rep. Sean Tarwater, a Kansas City-area Republican leading the push for a stadium plan.\n\nFree-market conservatives in Kansas have long opposed state and local subsidies for specific businesses or projects. And economists who've studied pro sports teams have concluded in dozens of studies over decades that subsidizing their stadiums isn't worth the cost.\n\n\"Most of the money that gets spent on the Chiefs is money that would otherwise be spent on other entertainment projects,\" said Andrew Zimbalist, an economics professor at Smith College in central Massachusetts who has written multiple books about sports.\n\nKelly told reporters Monday that she won't \"invest a lot of energy\" in a stadium plan, letting lawmakers lead. She and Missouri Gov. Mike Parson, a Republican, signed an agreement in 2019 to end years of each state using subsidies to steal the other state's jobs in the Kansas City area, but Kelly argued that their truce doesn't apply to the Chiefs and Royals.\n\n\"We never discussed the teams,\" she said.\n\nKansas legislators consider the Chiefs and Royals in play because in April, voters on the Missouri side of the metro area refused to continue a local sales tax for the upkeep of the complex with their side-by-side stadiums. Missouri officials have said they'll do whatever it takes to keep the teams but haven't outlined any proposals.\n\nThe two teams' lease on their stadium complex runs through January 2031, but Korb Maxwell, an attorney for the Chiefs who lives on the Kansas side, said renovations on the team's Arrowhead Stadium should be planned seven or eight years in advance.\n\n\"There is an urgency to this,\" added David Frantz, the Royals' general counsel.\n\nSupporters of the stadium plan argued that economists' past research doesn't apply to the Chiefs and Royals.

But her chief of staff told lawmakers Monday that she had seen nothing in the version that passed that would make her veto it.\n\nKansas legislators see the two teams as in play because in April, voters on the Missouri side of the Kansas City metropolitan area refused to extend a sales tax used to keep up the teams' existing stadiums, which sit side by side.\n\nTHIS IS A BREAKING NEWS UPDATE. AP's earlier story follows below.\n\nTOPEKA, Kan. (AP) -- Kansas legislators cleared the way Tuesday for a debate on trying to lure the Kansas City Chiefs from Missouri by approving broad tax cuts that many lawmakers said they needed to see before considering a plan to help the Super Bowl champions finance a new stadium.\n\nThe Legislature took up the stadium proposal during a special session that convened Tuesday amid heavy lobbying for the plan. The measure would allow the state to issue bonds to help the Chiefs and Major League Baseball's Kansas City Royals finance new stadiums on the Kansas side of their metropolitan area, which is split by the border with Missouri.\n\nBut top Republicans in the GOP-controlled Legislature promised that the stadium proposal wouldn't be debated until the Legislature approved a plan that would cut income and property taxes by a total of $1.23 billion over the next three years. Many lawmakers argued that voters would be angry if the state helped finance new stadiums without cutting taxes.\n\n\"We definitely need to demonstrate that we're getting relief to our citizens,\" said Senate President Ty Masterson, a Wichita-area Republican who backed the stadium-financing plan.\n\nDemocratic Gov. Laura Kelly called the special session to have lawmakers consider reducing taxes after she vetoed three tax-cutting plans before legislators adjourned their regular annual session May 1. The plan lawmakers approved was a compromise between her and Republican leaders.\n\nLegislators made no changes in the plan before passing it, 34-4 in the Senate and 121-2 in the House. Kelly pledged to sign the measure into law.\n\nOnce legislators convened the special session, Kelly couldn't control what they considered, and that created an opening to consider the stadium-financing plan. That measure would use revenues from sports betting, the state lottery and new taxes raised from the area around each new stadium to pay off the state's bonds over 30 years.\n\nThe first version of the stadium-financing plan emerged in late April, but lawmakers didn't vote on it before adjourning. It would have allowed state bonds to finance all stadium construction costs, but the version to be considered by lawmakers Tuesday would cap the amount at 70% and require legislative leaders and the governor to sign off on any bonding plan.\n\nHouse Commerce Committee Chair Sean Tarwater, a Kansas City-area Republican, said the Chiefs are likely to spend between $500 million and $700 million in private funds on a new stadium.\n\n\"There are no blank checks,\" Tarwater told GOP colleagues during a briefing on the plan before the House began debating it.\n\nA new nonprofit group, Scoop and Score, formed last month to push for bringing the Chiefs to Kansas, and that group and the Royals together hired more than 30 lobbyists for the special session. But the national free-market, small-government group Americans for Prosperity and the Kansas Policy Institute, a free-market think tank, oppose the measure, and both have been influential with conservative Republicans.\n\nFree-market conservatives have long opposed state and local subsidies for specific businesses or projects. And economists who've studied pro sports teams have concluded in dozens of studies over decades that subsidizing their stadiums isn't worth the cost.\n\n\"Most of the money that gets spent on the Chiefs is money that would otherwise be spent on other entertainment projects,\" said Andrew Zimbalist, an economics professor at Smith College in central Massachusetts who has written multiple books about sports.\n\nKansas legislators consider the Chiefs and Royals in play because in April, voters on the Missouri side of the metro area refused to continue a local sales tax for the upkeep of the complex with their side-by-side stadiums. Missouri officials have said they'll do whatever it takes to keep the teams but haven't outlined any proposals.\n\nThe two teams' lease on their stadium complex runs through January 2031, but Korb Maxwell, an attorney for the Chiefs who lives on the Kansas side, said renovations on the team's Arrowhead Stadium should be planned seven or eight years in advance.\n\n\"There is an urgency to this,\" added David Frantz, the Royals' general counsel.\n\nSupporters of the stadium plan argued that economists' past research doesn't apply to the Chiefs and Royals. They said the bonds will be paid off with tax revenues that aren't being generated now and would never be without the stadiums or the development around them. Masterson said it's wrong to call the bonds a subsidy.\n\nAnd Maxwell said: \"For a town to be major league, they need major league teams.\"\n\nBut economists who've studied pro sports said similar arguments have been a staple of past debates over paying for new stadiums. Development around a new stadium lessens development elsewhere, where the tax dollars generated would go to fund services or schools, they said.\n\n\"It could still help Kansas and maybe hurt Missouri by the same amount,\" Zimbalist said. \"It's a zero-sum game.\"", "source": {"uri": "brandonsun.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Brandon Sun"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

(AP) -- Kansas lawmakers hoping to lure the Kansas City Chiefs from Missouri are trying to win over skeptical colleagues by narrowing their proposal for encouraging the Super Bowl champions to build a new stadium and by linking it to a plan for broad tax cuts.\n\nThe Legislature expected to consider the stadium proposal during a special session set to convene Tuesday. The measure would allow the state to issue bonds to help the Chiefs and Major League Baseball's Kansas City Royals finance new stadiums on the Kansas side of their metropolitan area, which is split by the border with Missouri.\n\nSupporters on Monday backed away from an earlier plan to allow state bonds to cover all of the construction costs for new stadiums. Their plan would use revenues from sports betting, the state lottery and new taxes raised from the area around each new stadium.\n\nTop Republicans in the GOP-controlled Legislature also said the stadium proposal is their second priority during the special session, behind cutting income and property taxes. Democratic Gov. Laura Kelly called the special session to consider tax cuts, but she cannot limit what lawmakers consider -- creating an opening for a plan to woo the Chiefs and Royals.\n\n\"We definitely need to demonstrate that we're getting relief to our citizens,\" said Senate President Ty Masterson, a Wichita-area Republican who is backing the plan.\n\nMany lawmakers have argued that voters would be angry if the state helped finance new stadiums without cutting taxes. Kelly vetoed three tax-cutting plans before legislators adjourned their regular annual session May 1, but she and top Republican lawmakers have drafted a compromise measure to reduce taxes by $1.23 billion over the next three years.\n\nThe first version of the stadium-financing plan emerged in late April, but lawmakers didn't vote on it before adjourning. It would have allowed state bonds to finance all stadium construction costs, but the latest version caps the amount at 70%, and it says legislative leaders and the governor must sign off on any bonding plan.\n\nSupporters of the plan also modified it so that it only applies to professional football and Major League Baseball stadiums, instead of any professional sports stadium for at least 30,000 spectators. Bonds would be paid off over 30 years.\n\n\"We're trying to bring something grand to the state of Kansas,\" said state Rep. Sean Tarwater, a Kansas City-area Republican leading the push for a stadium plan.\n\nFree-market conservatives in Kansas have long opposed state and local subsidies for specific businesses or projects. And economists who've studied pro sports teams have concluded in dozens of studies over decades that subsidizing their stadiums isn't worth the cost.\n\n\"Most of the money that gets spent on the Chiefs is money that would otherwise be spent on other entertainment projects,\" said Andrew Zimbalist, an economics professor at Smith College in central Massachusetts who has written multiple books about sports.\n\nKelly told reporters Monday that she won't \"invest a lot of energy\" in a stadium plan, letting lawmakers lead. She and Missouri Gov. Mike Parson, a Republican, signed an agreement in 2019 to end years of each state using subsidies to steal the other state's jobs in the Kansas City area, but Kelly argued that their truce doesn't apply to the Chiefs and Royals.\n\n\"We never discussed the teams,\" she said.\n\nKansas legislators consider the Chiefs and Royals in play because in April, voters on the Missouri side of the metro area refused to continue a local sales tax for the upkeep of the complex with their side-by-side stadiums. Missouri officials have said they'll do whatever it takes to keep the teams but haven't outlined any proposals.\n\nThe two teams' lease on their stadium complex runs through January 2031, but Korb Maxwell, an attorney for the Chiefs who lives on the Kansas side, said renovations on the team's Arrowhead Stadium should be planned seven or eight years in advance.\n\n\"There is an urgency to this,\" added David Frantz, the Royals' general counsel.\n\nSupporters of the stadium plan argued that economists' past research doesn't apply to the Chiefs and Royals. They said the bonds will be paid off with tax revenues that aren't being generated now and would never be without the stadiums or the development around them. Masterson said it's wrong to call the bonds a subsidy.\n\nAnd Maxwell said: \"For a town to be major league, they need major league teams.\"\n\nBut economists who've studied pro sports said similar arguments have been a staple of past debates over paying for new stadiums. Development around a new stadium lessens development elsewhere, where the tax dollars generated would go to fund services or schools, they said.\n\n\"It could still help Kansas and maybe hurt Missouri by the same amount,\" Zimbalist said. \"It's a zero-sum game.\"", "source": {"uri": "wsiltv.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "WSIL"}, "authors": [{"uri": "associated_press@wsiltv.com", "name":

(AP) -- Kansas legislators approved a bipartisan plan Tuesday aimed at luring the Kansas City Chiefs away from Missouri by helping to finance a new stadium for the Super Bowl champions.\n\nThe bill passed by the Republican-controlled Legislature and sent to Democratic Gov. Laura Kelly would allow Kansas to issue bonds to cover up to 70% of the costs of a new stadium in the state for the Chiefs and another for Major League Baseball's Kansas City Royals. The plan also encourages the teams to move their practice facilities to the Kansas side of the metropolitan area, which is split by the two states' border.\n\nKansas would pay off its bonds over 30 years with revenues from sports betting, Kansas Lottery ticket sales and new sales and alcohol taxes collected from shopping and entertainment districts around the sites for the new stadiums.\n\nKorb Maxell, an attorney for the Chiefs who lives on the Kansas side of the border, said the state's lawmakers were \"embracing the possibility of the Chiefs and the Royals\" and can now make a \"very compelling offer\" to the NFL team.\n\n\"We're excited about what happened here today,\" he said after the bill cleared the Legislature. \"This is incredibly real.\"\n\nThe votes were 84-38 in the House and 27-8 in the Senate. Kelly stopped short of saying she'll sign the stadium-financing bill, but in a statement, she praised the effort behind it.\n\n\"Kansas now has the opportunity to become a professional sports powerhouse,\" she said.\n\nKansas legislators see the two teams as in play because in April, voters on the Missouri side of the Kansas City metropolitan area refused to extend a sales tax used to keep up the teams' existing stadiums, which sit side by side.\n\nTop Republicans in the GOP-controlled Legislature had promised that the stadium proposal wouldn't be debated until the Legislature approved a plan that would cut income and property taxes by a total of $1.23 billion over the next three years. Many lawmakers argued that voters would be angry if the state helped finance new stadiums without cutting taxes.\n\n\"We definitely need to demonstrate that we're getting relief to our citizens,\" said Senate President Ty Masterson, a Wichita-area Republican who backed the stadium-financing plan.\n\nKelly called a special session to have lawmakers consider reducing taxes after she vetoed three tax-cutting plans before legislators adjourned their regular annual session May 1. Once legislators convened the special session, Kelly couldn't control what they considered, and that created an opening to consider the stadium-financing plan.\n\nThe first version of the plan emerged in late April, but lawmakers didn't vote on it before adjourning. It would have allowed state bonds to finance all stadium construction costs, but the version passed by lawmakers Tuesday would cap the amount at 70% and require legislative leaders and the governor to sign off on any bonding plan.\n\nHouse Commerce Committee Chair Sean Tarwater, a Kansas City-area Republican, said the Chiefs are likely to spend between $500 million and $700 million in private funds on a new stadium.\n\n\"There are no blank checks,\" Tarwater told GOP colleagues during a briefing on the plan before the House began debating it.\n\nA new nonprofit group, Scoop and Score, formed last month to push for bringing the Chiefs to Kansas, and that group and the Royals together hired more than 30 lobbyists for the special session. But the national free-market, small-government group Americans for Prosperity and the Kansas Policy Institute, a free-market think tank, oppose the measure, and both have been influential with conservative Republicans.\n\nFree-market conservatives have long opposed state and local subsidies for specific businesses or projects. And economists who've studied pro sports teams have concluded in dozens of studies over decades that subsidizing their stadiums isn't worth the cost.\n\n\"Most of the money that gets spent on the Chiefs is money that would otherwise be spent on other entertainment projects,\" said Andrew Zimbalist, an economics professor at Smith College in central Massachusetts who has written multiple books about sports.\n\nMissouri officials have said they'll do whatever it takes to keep the teams but haven't outlined any proposals.\n\n\"The story now is that today was largely in my opinion about leverage,\" Kansas City, Missouri, Mayor Quinton Lucas said. \"And the teams are in an exceptional leverage position.\"\n\nThe two teams' lease on their stadium complex runs through January 2031, but Maxwell said renovations on the team's Arrowhead Stadium should be planned seven or eight years in advance.\n\n\"There is an urgency to this,\" added David Frantz, the Royals' general counsel.\n\nSupporters of the stadium plan argued that economists' past research doesn't apply to the Chiefs and Royals.

Things to know about Kansas wooing the Chiefs", "body": "FILE - Fans cheer at Arrowhead Stadium during the first half of an NFL football game between the Kansas City Chiefs and the Detroit Lions, Sept. 7, 202, in Kansas City, Mo. The Kansas Legislature's top leaders endorsed helping the Chiefs and professional baseball's Kansas City Royals finance new stadiums in Kansas ahead of a [...]\n\nTOPEKA, Kan. (AP) -- A plan in Kansas for luring the Kansas City's two major league sports franchises from Missouri has prompted their hometown's mayor to declare that the move ends a 5-year-old agreement by the states not to poach each other's jobs.\n\nThe Kansas Legislature has approved a measure to allow the state to issue bonds to help the Super Bowl Champion Chiefs and Major League Baseball's Royals pay for new stadiums in Kansas. It goes next to Gov. Laura Kelly.\n\nHere are a few things to know about the two states' contest for the teams.\n\nKansas is poised to make offers\n\nWhile Kelly has not formally pledged to sign the stadium-financing bill, she issued a positive statement when it passed Tuesday, saying it could make Kansas \"a professional sports powerhouse.\" If she signs it, as many lawmakers expect, it would take effect July 1.\n\nThe state's secretary of commerce, Lt. Gov. David Toland, would negotiate with one or both teams on a plan for a new stadium. Kelly and eight top legislative leaders would have to approve each deal with a vote in a public meeting.\n\nA deal would draw the boundaries of a district around a stadium and possibly another around a separate practice facility, and new state sales and alcohol tax revenues generated by shops, restaurants, bars and hotels within that district would pay off the bonds over 30 years.\n\nThe city and county could pledge tax revenues as well but are not required to do so, and the state also could use revenues from sports betting and state lottery ticket sales to back bonds as well.\n\nThe bonds could cover up to 70% of the costs of the new stadiums, though supporters of the plan don't expect that, anticipating that two stadiums together could cost $4 billion.\n\nThere is talk of a renewed economic 'border war'\n\nThe Kansas-Missouri border splits the 2.3 million-resident Kansas City area, and there's both Kansas City, Missouri, and Kansas City, Kansas. Much of the border is the median of State Line Road, and about 60% of the area's residents live on the Missouri side.\n\nA feud between the two states has existed for generations and most recently saw each state burning through tens of millions of dollars in subsides to pull existing businesses across the border. Officials on both sides came to see the contest as expensive and wasteful, and in 2019, Kelly, a Democrat, and Missouri Gov. Mike Parson, a Republican, signed a truce.\n\nKansas City, Missouri Mayor Quinton Lucas told reporters that Kansas' bid for the Chiefs and Royals restarted that economic \"border war.\"\n\n\"I do believe long-term that we're one place and it's better when we work together,\" he said during a news conference.\n\nBut Kelly doesn't agree that the states' truce has been violated, telling reporters this week that before the agreement, \"We never discussed the teams.\"\n\nKansas lawmakers tapped fears about the future\n\nKansas lawmakers acted after voters on the Missouri side refused in April to extend a local sales tax for keeping up the complex with the teams' side-by-side stadiums. Many Kansas lawmakers worried that if they didn't act, the teams might move out of the area altogether -- mentioning Salt Lake City, San Antonio and Nashville.\n\nSeveral economists who've studied professional sports were dubious that moving would make financial sense for either team -- especially the Chiefs, who have a rabid fan base that could be hard to build quickly elsewhere. In addition, after pro football's Rams moved nearly a decade ago from St. Louis to Los Angeles, the team's owner and the National Football League paid $790 million to settle a lawsuit filed by St. Louis interests.\n\nBut Kansas lawmakers noted that the Royals' major-league predecessor, the Athletics, moved to Oakland, California, in 1968 and now plan to relocate to Las Vegas. Kansas City lost major-league professional teams to other cities in the 1970s and 1980s, and the Chiefs came to Kansas City in 1963 after starting as the Dallas Texans four years earlier.\n\n\"The state of Missouri is known for losing professional teams,\" Kansas state Rep. Sean Tarwater, a Kansas City-area Republican, who helped lead the push for the stadium bill.\n\nKansas officials expect Missouri to respond\n\nMissouri officials have pledged to do what it takes to keep the Chiefs and Royals in their state but have not outlined specific proposals. Lucas saw the April vote as a sign that area residents wanted officials to discuss options other than extending the sales tax.\n\nLike their counterparts in Kansas, Missouri lawmakers have finished their annual regular session, but they are set to meet again Sept. 11 to consider vetoes by Parson.\n\nSupporters of Kansas' bid for the teams said it could spur an aggressive response from Missouri -- and added that if the teams get offers they like and opt to stay there, at least they're still in the Kansas City area.\n\nLucas said the teams now have \"exceptional leverage.\"\n\nKansas and Missouri describe the timeline differently\n\nThe lease on the complex with the Chiefs' and Royals' existing stadiums runs through January 2031, but the teams have said they must plan renovations or new stadiums years in advance for them to be ready on time. Both suggested that even seven years out, time for a decision is short.\n\nBackers of the Kansas bid said such comments justified acting Tuesday, during a one-day special session that Kelly called to consider tax cuts after lawmakers adjourned their regular annual session May 1.

Mike Thompson, R-Shawnee, follows a Senate vote approving a bill that would cut state income and property taxes by a total of $1.2 billion over the next three years, Tuesday, June 18, 2024, at the Statehouse in Topeka, Kansas. Legislative leaders said the tax cuts must pass first before lawmakers consider a plan to help the Super Bowl champion Kansas City Chiefs build a new stadium in Kansas.\n\nTOPEKA, Kan. (AP) -- Kansas legislators cleared the way Tuesday for a debate on trying to lure the Kansas City Chiefs from Missouri by approving broad tax cuts that many lawmakers said they needed to see before considering a plan to help the Super Bowl champions finance a new stadium.\n\nThe Legislature took up the stadium proposal during a special session that convened Tuesday amid heavy lobbying for the plan. The measure would allow the state to issue bonds to help the Chiefs and Major League Baseball's Kansas City Royals finance new stadiums on the Kansas side of their metropolitan area, which is split by the border with Missouri.\n\nBut top Republicans in the GOP-controlled Legislature promised that the stadium proposal wouldn't be debated until the Legislature approved a plan that would cut income and property taxes by a total of $1.23 billion over the next three years. Many lawmakers argued that voters would be angry if the state helped finance new stadiums without cutting taxes.\n\n\"We definitely need to demonstrate that we're getting relief to our citizens,\" said Senate President Ty Masterson, a Wichita-area Republican who backed the stadium-financing plan.\n\nDemocratic Gov. Laura Kelly called the special session to have lawmakers consider reducing taxes after she vetoed three tax-cutting plans before legislators adjourned their regular annual session May 1. The plan lawmakers approved was a compromise between her and Republican leaders.\n\nLegislators made no changes in the plan before passing it, 34-4 in the Senate and 121-2 in the House. Kelly pledged to sign the measure into law.\n\nOnce legislators convened the special session, Kelly couldn't control what they considered, and that created an opening to consider the stadium-financing plan. That measure would use revenues from sports betting, the state lottery and new taxes raised from the area around each new stadium to pay off the state's bonds over 30 years.\n\nThe first version of the stadium-financing plan emerged in late April, but lawmakers didn't vote on it before adjourning. It would have allowed state bonds to finance all stadium construction costs, but the version to be considered by lawmakers Tuesday would cap the amount at 70% and require legislative leaders and the governor to sign off on any bonding plan.\n\nHouse Commerce Committee Chair Sean Tarwater, a Kansas City-area Republican, said the Chiefs are likely to spend between $500 million and $700 million in private funds on a new stadium.\n\n\"There are no blank checks,\" Tarwater told GOP colleagues during a briefing on the plan before the House began debating it.\n\nA new nonprofit group, Scoop and Score, formed last month to push for bringing the Chiefs to Kansas, and that group and the Royals together hired more than 30 lobbyists for the special session. But the national free-market, small-government group Americans for Prosperity and the Kansas Policy Institute, a free-market think tank, oppose the measure, and both have been influential with conservative Republicans.\n\nFree-market conservatives have long opposed state and local subsidies for specific businesses or projects. And economists who've studied pro sports teams have concluded in dozens of studies over decades that subsidizing their stadiums isn't worth the cost.\n\n\"Most of the money that gets spent on the Chiefs is money that would otherwise be spent on other entertainment projects,\" said Andrew Zimbalist, an economics professor at Smith College in central Massachusetts who has written multiple books about sports.\n\nKansas legislators consider the Chiefs and Royals in play because in April, voters on the Missouri side of the metro area refused to continue a local sales tax for the upkeep of the complex with their side-by-side stadiums. Missouri officials have said they'll do whatever it takes to keep the teams but haven't outlined any proposals.\n\nThe two teams' lease on their stadium complex runs through January 2031, but Korb Maxwell, an attorney for the Chiefs who lives on the Kansas side, said renovations on the team's Arrowhead Stadium should be planned seven or eight years in advance.\n\n\"There is an urgency to this,\" added David Frantz, the Royals' general counsel.\n\nSupporters of the stadium plan argued that economists' past research doesn't apply to the Chiefs and Royals. They said the bonds will be paid off with tax revenues that aren't being generated now and would never be without the stadiums or the development around them. Masterson said it's wrong to call the bonds a subsidy.\n\nAnd Maxwell said: \"For a town to be major league, they need major league teams.\"\n\nBut economists who've studied pro sports said similar arguments have been a staple of past debates over paying for new stadiums. Development around a new stadium lessens development elsewhere, where the tax dollars generated would go to fund services or schools, they said.\n\n\"It could still help Kansas and maybe hurt Missouri by the same amount,\" Zimbalist said. \"It's a zero-sum game.\"", "source": {"uri": "register-herald.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Beckley Register-Herald"}, "authors": [{"uri":

Kansas lawmakers could offer the Kansas City Chiefs and Royals millions of dollars in tax incentives to move from Missouri to Kansas. (Jamie Squire/Getty Images).\n\nRepresentatives of the Kansas City Chiefs and Royals urged Kansas lawmakers Monday to expand a tax incentive program to provide the teams millions of dollars to leave Missouri and set up shop in new stadiums across the state line.\n\n\"If we want to be major league we've got to have major league teams,\" Korb Maxwell, an attorney who represents the Chiefs, told lawmakers during an informational hearing at the Kansas Statehouse. \"This is the greatest opportunity we've had in any generation, and it's here before us right now.\"\n\nOther proponents of the plan were more blunt: If Kansas doesn't act, a group hoping to lure the teams to Kansas argued, the Kansas City region is at risk of losing its professional football and baseball teams.\n\n\"The risk that the Kansas City Chiefs and the Kansas City Royals -- our Chiefs, our Royals -- could be lured away by other states is not a risk that Kansans want to take,\" said Dan Murray, a lobbyist for Scoop and Score Inc., a nonprofit hoping to bring the Chiefs to Kansas.\n\nOn the table Monday was a plan to expand the state's tax incentive program meant to help finance tourism and entertainment destinations. Under the legislation, the teams could receive more than $750 million to help finance stadium projects.\n\nThe informational hearing came ahead of a special legislative session that starts Tuesday. Lawmakers can't take action on the bill until the formal start of the special session.\n\nThe legislation would enhance the state's existing Sales Tax and Revenue (STAR) Bond program to provide up to 75% of the project's costs by issuing bonds that would be repaid with the increased sales state tax collections at the project site. Other projects can use STAR Bonds to finance up to 50% of a project.\n\nThe bill requires a minimum $1 billion capital investment and limits the eligibility to National Football League or Major League Baseball teams currently located near Kansas. The financing mechanism could be used for both stadiums and training facilities.\n\nDebt on a stadium constructed under the expansion wouldn't have to be repaid for 30 years instead of the normal 20.\n\nThe project could also receive a boost from liquor taxes generated in the STAR Bond district and revenues from a fund Kansas created when it legalized sports betting.\n\nGov. Laura Kelly, who has championed enormous economic development projects in Kansas, didn't commit to supporting the legislation on Monday.\n\n\"I'm impressed by the full-court press that has been made to get these teams to consider moving across the river,\" she told reporters. \"It's not something I'm going to invest a lot of energy in. I think this is something for the legislature to work through.\"\n\nKelly's chief of staff, Will Lawrence, told the joint committee the governor's office had no concerns with the current version of the bill that would keep her from signing it.\n\nSTAR Bonds have been criticized by some legislators as ineffective, and an audit found that less than one-quarter of the attractions funded through the program met the state's goal of increasing tourism. There may be some cases, the audit says, where certain projects kept Kansans spending money in Kansas rather than going to Missouri.\n\n\"But we think it's more often that local visitors simply move existing economic activity from one part of Kansas to another,\" the audit says.\n\nKansas lawmakers launched an effort to lure the Chiefs or Royals -- or both -- after Jackson County, Missouri, voters in April rejected a proposed extension of a 3/8-cent sales tax to help finance a new stadium for the Royals and upgrades at Arrowhead Stadium.\n\nMaxwell said the organization had been asked why the legislation needed to be passed in special session rather than when lawmakers reconvene for their normal session in January.\n\nBecause with only a few years left in the Chiefs' lease at Arrowhead, \"time is of the essence,\" he said.\n\n\"The time is now,\" Maxwell said. \"Missouri spoke, Jackson County spoke. They had their opportunity, but now there's a moment for Kansas to step up.\"\n\nThe effort to reauthorize the sales tax in Missouri was driven primarily by the Royals, whose executives unveiled plans to move to the Crossroads Arts District in downtown Kansas City in February -- less than two months before the vote. It failed with 58% of voters rejecting the proposal.\n\nEarlier this month, Scoop and Score Inc. launched to advocate for moving Chiefs -- the reigning Super Bowl champions -- to Kansas. The organization's website implores visitors to sign a petition to \"tell legislators to keep the Chiefs in KC!\"\n\nThe organization has hired 30 lobbyists, including Murray. The Royals have eight lobbyists, and the Chiefs employ former Kansas House Speaker Ron Ryckman Jr. and his former aide, Paje Resner, as lobbyists.\n\nRyckman said Kansas City Chiefs owner Clark Hunt could be open to moving the team outside of the Kansas City region.\n\n\"We're aware of numerous cities that would love to be the home of the Chiefs or the Royals,\" Ryckman said.\n\nMurray urged lawmakers to support the legislation, arguing it has \"guardrails, guardrails guardrails\" to keep the state and local governments from being on the hook for the bonds.\n\nWhile an attorney for the Chiefs acknowledged the franchise hasn't come up with a design or plan for a stadium in Kansas, Murray urged lawmakers to move forward with creating a program. Vetting the details, he said, will be up to the Kansas Department of Commerce with final approval by the Legislative Coordinating Council, an eight-member committee of House and Senate lawmakers that can adopt legislation when the Legislature is not in session.\n\nBut a draft of the bill says any agreement between the state and a team would be confidential until after it has been executed.\n\nThe bill was panned by libertarian groups as a handout for corporations that would do little to increase economic activity in Kansas. Dave Trabert, CEO of the Kansas Policy Institute, told the committee there was no way to verify the claims that the stadiums would boost the economy.\n\n\"We asked Scoop and Score to provide their math. 'Show us how you arrived at a billion dollars of economic activity,'' Trabert said. \"Nothing was forthcoming.\"\n\nIn an interview, Trabert called the proposal \"absurd.\"", "source": {"uri":

Laura Kelly would allow Kansas to issue bonds to cover up to 70% of the costs of a new stadium in the state for the Chiefs and another for Major League Baseball's Kansas City Royals.\n\nThe state would pay off its bonds over 30 years with revenues from sports betting, Kansas Lottery ticket sales and new sales and alcohol taxes collected from shopping and entertainment districts around the sites for the new stadiums.\n\nKelly has not said whether she will sign the bill. But her chief of staff told lawmakers Monday that she had seen nothing in the version that passed that would make her veto it.\n\nKansas legislators see the two teams as in play because in April, voters on the Missouri side of the Kansas City metropolitan area refused to extend a sales tax used to keep up the teams' existing stadiums, which sit side by side.\n\nThe votes came after a debate that many lawmakers said they needed to see before considering a plan to help the Super Bowl champions finance a new stadium. The measure would allow the state to issue bonds to help the Chiefs and Major League Baseball's Kansas City Royals finance new stadiums on the Kansas side of their metropolitan area, which is split by the border with Missouri.\n\nTop Republicans in the GOP-controlled Legislature had promised that the stadium proposal wouldn't be debated until the Legislature approved a plan that would cut income and property taxes by a total of $1.23 billion over the next three years. Many lawmakers argued that voters would be angry if the state helped finance new stadiums without cutting taxes.\n\n\"We definitely need to demonstrate that we're getting relief to our citizens,\" said Senate President Ty Masterson, a Wichita-area Republican who backed the stadium-financing plan.\n\nKelly called the special session to have lawmakers consider reducing taxes after she vetoed three tax-cutting plans before legislators adjourned their regular annual session May 1. The plan lawmakers approved was a compromise between her and Republican leaders.\n\nOnce legislators convened the special session, Kelly couldn't control what they considered, and that created an opening to consider the stadium-financing plan. That measure would use revenues from sports betting, the state lottery and new taxes raised from the area around each new stadium to pay off the state's bonds over 30 years.\n\nThe first version of the stadium-financing plan emerged in late April, but lawmakers didn't vote on it before adjourning. It would have allowed state bonds to finance all stadium construction costs, but the version passed by lawmakers Tuesday would cap the amount at 70% and require legislative leaders and the governor to sign off on any bonding plan.\n\nHouse Commerce Committee Chair Sean Tarwater, a Kansas City-area Republican, said the Chiefs are likely to spend between $500 million and $700 million in private funds on a new stadium.\n\n\"There are no blank checks,\" Tarwater told GOP colleagues during a briefing on the plan before the House began debating it.\n\nA new nonprofit group, Scoop and Score, formed last month to push for bringing the Chiefs to Kansas, and that group and the Royals together hired more than 30 lobbyists for the special session. But the national free-market, small-government group Americans for Prosperity and the Kansas Policy Institute, a free-market think tank, oppose the measure, and both have been influential with conservative Republicans.\n\nFree-market conservatives have long opposed state and local subsidies for specific businesses or projects. And economists who've studied pro sports teams have concluded in dozens of studies over decades that subsidizing their stadiums isn't worth the cost.\n\n\"Most of the money that gets spent on the Chiefs is money that would otherwise be spent on other entertainment projects,\" said Andrew Zimbalist, an economics professor at Smith College in central Massachusetts who has written multiple books about sports.\n\nKansas legislators consider the Chiefs and Royals in play because in April, voters on the Missouri side of the metro area refused to continue a local sales tax for the upkeep of the complex with their side-by-side stadiums. Missouri officials have said they'll do whatever it takes to keep the teams but haven't outlined any proposals.\n\nThe two teams' lease on their stadium complex runs through January 2031, but Korb Maxwell, an attorney for the Chiefs who lives on the Kansas side, said renovations on the team's Arrowhead Stadium should be planned seven or eight years in advance.\n\n\"There is an urgency to this,\" added David Frantz, the Royals' general counsel.\n\nSupporters of the stadium plan argued that economists' past research doesn't apply to the Chiefs and Royals. They said the bonds will be paid off with tax revenues that aren't being generated now and would never be without the stadiums or the development around them. Masterson said it's wrong to call the bonds a subsidy.\n\nAnd Maxwell said: \"For a town to be major league, they need major league teams.\"\n\nBut economists who've studied pro sports said similar arguments have been a staple of past debates over paying for new stadiums. Development around a new stadium lessens development elsewhere, where the tax dollars generated would go to fund services or schools, they said.\n\n\"It could still help Kansas and maybe hurt Missouri by the same amount,\" Zimbalist said. \"It's a zero-sum game.\"", "source": {"uri": "daytondailynews.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Dayton Daily News"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

(AP) -- Kansas lawmakers hoping to lure the Kansas City Chiefs from Missouri are trying to win over skeptical colleagues by narrowing their proposal for encouraging the Super Bowl champions to build a new stadium and by linking it to a plan for broad tax cuts.\n\nThe Legislature expected to consider the stadium proposal during a special session set to convene Tuesday. The measure would allow the state to issue bonds to help the Chiefs and Major League Baseball's Kansas City Royals finance new stadiums on the Kansas side of their metropolitan area, which is split by the border with Missouri.\n\nSupporters on Monday backed away from an earlier plan to allow state bonds to cover all of the construction costs for new stadiums. Their plan would use revenues from sports betting, the state lottery and new taxes raised from the area around each new stadium.\n\nTop Republicans in the GOP-controlled Legislature also said the stadium proposal is their second priority during the special session, behind cutting income and property taxes. Democratic Gov. Laura Kelly called the special session to consider tax cuts, but she cannot limit what lawmakers consider -- creating an opening for a plan to woo the Chiefs and Royals.\n\n\"We definitely need to demonstrate that we're getting relief to our citizens,\" said Senate President Ty Masterson, a Wichita-area Republican who is backing the plan.\n\nMany lawmakers have argued that voters would be angry if the state helped finance new stadiums without cutting taxes. Kelly vetoed three tax-cutting plans before legislators adjourned their regular annual session May 1, but she and top Republican lawmakers have drafted a compromise measure to reduce taxes by $1.23 billion over the next three years.\n\nThe first version of the stadium-financing plan emerged in late April, but lawmakers didn't vote on it before adjourning. It would have allowed state bonds to finance all stadium construction costs, but the latest version caps the amount at 70%, and it says legislative leaders and the governor must sign off on any bonding plan.\n\nSupporters of the plan also modified it so that it only applies to professional football and Major League Baseball stadiums, instead of any professional sports stadium for at least 30,000 spectators. Bonds would be paid off over 30 years.\n\n\"We're trying to bring something grand to the state of Kansas,\" said state Rep. Sean Tarwater, a Kansas City-area Republican leading the push for a stadium plan.\n\nFree-market conservatives in Kansas have long opposed state and local subsidies for specific businesses or projects. And economists who've studied pro sports teams have concluded in dozens of studies over decades that subsidizing their stadiums isn't worth the cost.\n\n\"Most of the money that gets spent on the Chiefs is money that would otherwise be spent on other entertainment projects,\" said Andrew Zimbalist, an economics professor at Smith College in central Massachusetts who has written multiple books about sports.\n\nKelly told reporters Monday that she won't \"invest a lot of energy\" in a stadium plan, letting lawmakers lead. She and Missouri Gov. Mike Parson, a Republican, signed an agreement in 2019 to end years of each state using subsidies to steal the other state's jobs in the Kansas City area, but Kelly argued that their truce doesn't apply to the Chiefs and Royals.\n\n\"We never discussed the teams,\" she said.\n\nKansas legislators consider the Chiefs and Royals in play because in April, voters on the Missouri side of the metro area refused to continue a local sales tax for the upkeep of the complex with their side-by-side stadiums. Missouri officials have said they'll do whatever it takes to keep the teams but haven't outlined any proposals.\n\nThe two teams' lease on their stadium complex runs through January 2031, but Korb Maxwell, an attorney for the Chiefs who lives on the Kansas side, said renovations on the team's Arrowhead Stadium should be planned seven or eight years in advance.\n\n\"There is an urgency to this,\" added David Frantz, the Royals' general counsel.\n\nSupporters of the stadium plan argued that economists' past research doesn't apply to the Chiefs and Royals. They said the bonds will be paid off with tax revenues that aren't being generated now and would never be without the stadiums or the development around them. Masterson said it's wrong to call the bonds a subsidy.\n\nAnd Maxwell said: \"For a town to be major league, they need major league teams.\"\n\nBut economists who've studied pro sports said similar arguments have been a staple of past debates over paying for new stadiums. Development around a new stadium lessens development elsewhere, where the tax dollars generated would go to fund services or schools, they said.\n\n\"It could still help Kansas and maybe hurt Missouri by the same amount,\" Zimbalist said. \"It's a zero-sum game.\"\n\nCopyright 2024 The Associated Press.

Susan Humphries, at the far right, R-Wichita, reviews a proposed amendment to the bill aimed at luring the Kansas City Chiefs from Missouri and concludes that it is out of order, Tuesday, June 18, 2024, at the Statehouse in Topeka, Kansas. The measure would allow the state to issue bonds to help the Super Bowl champion Chiefs and Major League Baseball's Kansas City Royals finance new stadiums in Kansas.\n\nTOPEKA, Kan. (AP) -- Kansas is making a serious run at becoming the new home for the reigning Super Bowl champions with legislators approving a plan Tuesday for luring both the Chiefs and Major League Baseball's Kansas City Royals away from Missouri.\n\nBipartisan legislative supermajorities OKed the measure to authorize state bonds to help finance new stadiums and practice facilities for both teams on the Kansas side of the metropolitan area of 2.3 million residents, which is split by the border with Missouri. Three Super Bowl victories in five years -- and player Travis Kelce's romance with pop icon Taylor Swift -- have made the Chiefs perhaps the area's most celebrated civic asset.\n\nThe plan from the Republican-controlled Legislature goes next to Democratic Gov. Laura Kelly. While she stopped short of promising to sign it, she said in a statement that \"Kansas now has the opportunity to become a professional sports powerhouse.\"\n\nBoth the Chiefs and the Royals said they look forward to considering Kansas options. The lease on the Missouri complex with their side-by-side stadiums runs through January 2031, but both have said they already should have been planning for the future.\n\n\"We're excited about what happened here today,\" Korb Maxwell, an attorney for the Chiefs who lives on the Kansas side, said at the Statehouse after the bill cleared the Legislature. \"This is incredibly real.\"\n\nThe approval capped a two-month push to capitalize on the refusal in April by voters on the Missouri side to continue a local sales tax used to finance the upkeep of the teams' stadiums.\n\nBackers of the plan brushed aside decades of research by economists concluding that government subsidies for professional sports stadiums are not worth the cost. They also overcame criticism that lawmakers were moving too quickly.\n\nA spokeswoman for Missouri Gov. Mike Parson did not immediately respond to an email message seeking comment. But in Kansas City, Missouri, Mayor Quinton Lucas promised to \"lay out a good offer\" to keep both teams in town.\n\n\"Today was largely, in my opinion, about leverage,\" Lucas said. \"And the teams are in an exceptional leverage position.\"\n\nSome Kansas officials reached the same conclusion.\n\n\"I think the Chiefs and the Royals are using us,\" said state Rep. Susan Ruiz, a Kansas City-area Democrat.\n\nThe votes on the Kansas stadium-financing plan were 84-38 in the state House and 27-8 in the Senate. Lawmakers from across the state -- even western Kansas, far from any new stadium -- supported the measure.\n\nIt would allow state bonds to cover up to 70% of each new stadium, paying them off over 30 years with revenues from sports betting, state lottery ticket sales and new sales and alcohol taxes collected from shopping and entertainment districts around the new stadiums.\n\nHouse Commerce Committee Chair Sean Tarwater, a Kansas City-area Republican, said the Chiefs still are likely to spend $500 million to $700 million in private funds on a new stadium.\n\n\"There are no blank checks,\" Tarwater told GOP colleagues during a briefing.\n\nLegislators debated the plan during a one-day special session called by Kelly to have them consider reducing taxes after she vetoed three tax-cutting plans before legislators adjourned their regular annual session May 1.\n\nRepublican leaders had promised that the stadium proposal wouldn't come up until the Legislature first approved a plan to cut income and property taxes by a total of $1.23 billion over the next three years. Many lawmakers argued that voters would be angry if the state helped finance new stadiums without cutting taxes.\n\nWith the tax bill passed, the stadium plan gained support even from lawmakers who saw it as a handout for wealthy team owners. Some said failing to act risked pushing the teams to leave the Kansas City area, and a few said they had wanted the Chiefs in Kansas since childhood.\n\n\"It is amazing to me the speed with which we can solve problems when they're oriented around wealth, when they're oriented around business,\" said state Rep. Jason Probst, a Democrat from central Kansas.\n\nYet Probst voted for the bill.\n\n\"This is the system that we're stuck in, so if we choose to opt out of that system, we will lose every time,\" he said.\n\nEconomists who study pro sports teams have concluded in dozens of studies that a new stadium and shopping-and-entertainment area merely takes existing economic activity away from elsewhere in a community, resulting in little or no net gain.\n\n\"It could still help Kansas and maybe hurt Missouri by the same amount,\" said Andrew Zimbalist, an economics professor at Smith college in central Massachusetts who has written multiple books about sports. \"It's a zero-sum game.\"\n\nA skeptical state Sen. Molly Baumgardner, a Kansas City-area Republican, used a Christmas Eve metaphor to characterize supporters' excitement before she voted no.\n\n\"There are visions of sugar plums,\" Baumgardner said.",

Kelly has not said whether she will sign the bill. But her chief of staff told lawmakers Monday that she had seen nothing in the version that passed that would make her veto it.\n\nKansas legislators see the two teams as in play because in April, voters on the Missouri side of the Kansas City metropolitan area refused to extend a sales tax used to keep up the teams' existing stadiums, which sit side by side.\n\nTHIS IS A BREAKING NEWS UPDATE. AP's earlier story follows below.\n\nTOPEKA, Kan. (AP) -- Kansas legislators cleared the way Tuesday for a debate on trying to lure the Kansas City Chiefs from Missouri by approving broad tax cuts that many lawmakers said they needed to see before considering a plan to help the Super Bowl champions finance a new stadium.\n\nThe Legislature took up the stadium proposal during a special session that convened Tuesday amid heavy lobbying for the plan. The measure would allow the state to issue bonds to help the Chiefs and Major League Baseball's Kansas City Royals finance new stadiums on the Kansas side of their metropolitan area, which is split by the border with Missouri.\n\nBut top Republicans in the GOP-controlled Legislature promised that the stadium proposal wouldn't be debated until the Legislature approved a plan that would cut income and property taxes by a total of $1.23 billion over the next three years. Many lawmakers argued that voters would be angry if the state helped finance new stadiums without cutting taxes.\n\n\"We definitely need to demonstrate that we're getting relief to our citizens,\" said Senate President Ty Masterson, a Wichita-area Republican who backed the stadium-financing plan.\n\nDemocratic Gov. Laura Kelly called the special session to have lawmakers consider reducing taxes after she vetoed three tax-cutting plans before legislators adjourned their regular annual session May 1. The plan lawmakers approved was a compromise between her and Republican leaders.\n\nLegislators made no changes in the plan before passing it, 34-4 in the Senate and 121-2 in the House. Kelly pledged to sign the measure into law.\n\nOnce legislators convened the special session, Kelly couldn't control what they considered, and that created an opening to consider the stadium-financing plan. That measure would use revenues from sports betting, the state lottery and new taxes raised from the area around each new stadium to pay off the state's bonds over 30 years.\n\nThe first version of the stadium-financing plan emerged in late April, but lawmakers didn't vote on it before adjourning. It would have allowed state bonds to finance all stadium construction costs, but the version to be considered by lawmakers Tuesday would cap the amount at 70% and require legislative leaders and the governor to sign off on any bonding plan.\n\nHouse Commerce Committee Chair Sean Tarwater, a Kansas City-area Republican, said the Chiefs are likely to spend between $500 million and $700 million in private funds on a new stadium.\n\n\"There are no blank checks,\" Tarwater told GOP colleagues during a briefing on the plan before the House began debating it.\n\nA new nonprofit group, Scoop and Score, formed last month to push for bringing the Chiefs to Kansas, and that group and the Royals together hired more than 30 lobbyists for the special session. But the national free-market, small-government group Americans for Prosperity and the Kansas Policy Institute, a free-market think tank, oppose the measure, and both have been influential with conservative Republicans.\n\nFree-market conservatives have long opposed state and local subsidies for specific businesses or projects. And economists who've studied pro sports teams have concluded in dozens of studies over decades that subsidizing their stadiums isn't worth the cost.\n\n\"Most of the money that gets spent on the Chiefs is money that would otherwise be spent on other entertainment projects,\" said Andrew Zimbalist, an economics professor at Smith College in central Massachusetts who has written multiple books about sports.\n\nKansas legislators consider the Chiefs and Royals in play because in April, voters on the Missouri side of the metro area refused to continue a local sales tax for the upkeep of the complex with their side-by-side stadiums. Missouri officials have said they'll do whatever it takes to keep the teams but haven't outlined any proposals.\n\nThe two teams' lease on their stadium complex runs through January 2031, but Korb Maxwell, an attorney for the Chiefs who lives on the Kansas side, said renovations on the team's Arrowhead Stadium should be planned seven or eight years in advance.\n\n\"There is an urgency to this,\" added David Frantz, the Royals' general counsel.\n\nSupporters of the stadium plan argued that economists' past research doesn't apply to the Chiefs and Royals. They said the bonds will be paid off with tax revenues that aren't being generated now and would never be without the stadiums or the development around them. Masterson said it's wrong to call the bonds a subsidy.\n\nAnd Maxwell said: \"For a town to be major league, they need major league teams.\"\n\nBut economists who've studied pro sports said similar arguments have been a staple of past debates over paying for new stadiums. Development around a new stadium lessens development elsewhere, where the tax dollars generated would go to fund services or schools, they said.\n\n\"It could still help Kansas and maybe hurt Missouri by the same amount,\" Zimbalist said. \"It's a zero-sum game.\"", "source": {"uri": "lethbridgenewsnow.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Lethbridge News Now"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

(AP) - A plan in Kansas for luring the Kansas City's two major league sports franchises from Missouri has prompted their hometown's mayor to declare that the move ends a 5-year-old agreement by the states not to poach each other's jobs.\n\nThe Kansas Legislature has approved a measure to allow the state to issue bonds to help the Super Bowl Champion Chiefs and Major League Baseball's Royals pay for new stadiums in Kansas. It goes next to Gov. Laura Kelly.\n\nHere are a few things to know about the two states' contest for the teams.\n\nWhile Kelly has not formally pledged to sign the stadium-financing bill, she issued a positive statement when it passed Tuesday, saying it could make Kansas \"a professional sports powerhouse.\" If she signs it, as many lawmakers expect, it would take effect July 1.\n\nThe state\u00b4s secretary of commerce, Lt. Gov. David Toland, would negotiate with one or both teams on a plan for a new stadium. Kelly and eight top legislative leaders would have to approve each deal with a vote in a public meeting.\n\nA deal would draw the boundaries of a district around a stadium and possibly another around a separate practice facility, and new state sales and alcohol tax revenues generated by shops, restaurants, bars and hotels within that district would pay off the bonds over 30 years.\n\nFILE - Fans cheer at Arrowhead Stadium during the first half of an NFL football game between the Kansas City Chiefs and the Detroit Lions, Sept. 7, 202, in Kansas City, Mo. The Kansas Legislature's top leaders endorsed helping the Chiefs and professional baseball's Kansas City Royals finance new stadiums in Kansas ahead of a special session set to convene Tuesday. The plan would authorize state bonds for stadium construction and pay them off with revenues from sports betting, the Kansas Lottery and new tax dollars generated in and around the new venues. (AP Photo/Reed Hoffmann. File)\n\nThe city and county could pledge tax revenues as well but are not required to do so, and the state also could use revenues from sports betting and state lottery ticket sales to back bonds as well.\n\nThe bonds could cover up to 70% of the costs of the new stadiums, though supporters of the plan don't expect that, anticipating that two stadiums together could cost $4 billion.\n\nThe Kansas-Missouri border splits the 2.3 million-resident Kansas City area, and there's both Kansas City, Missouri, and Kansas City, Kansas. Much of the border is the median of State Line Road, and about 60% of the area's residents live on the Missouri side.\n\nA feud between the two states has existed for generations and most recently saw each state burning through tens of millions of dollars in subsides to pull existing businesses across the border. Officials on both sides came to see the contest as expensive and wasteful, and in 2019, Kelly, a Democrat, and Missouri Gov. Mike Parson, a Republican, signed a truce.\n\nKansas City, Missouri Mayor Quinton Lucas told reporters that Kansas\u00b4 bid for the Chiefs and Royals restarted that economic \"border war.\"\n\n\"I do believe long-term that we\u00b4re one place and it\u00b4s better when we work together,\" he said during a news conference.\n\nBut Kelly doesn't agree that the states' truce has been violated, telling reporters this week that before the agreement, \"We never discussed the teams.\"\n\nKansas lawmakers acted after voters on the Missouri side refused in April to extend a local sales tax for keeping up the complex with the teams' side-by-side stadiums. Many Kansas lawmakers worried that if they didn't act, the teams might move out of the area altogether - mentioning Salt Lake City, San Antonio and Nashville.\n\nSeveral economists who've studied professional sports were dubious that moving would make financial sense for either team - especially the Chiefs, who have a rabid fan base that could be hard to build quickly elsewhere. In addition, after pro football's Rams moved nearly a decade ago from St. Louis to Los Angeles, the team's owner and the National Football League paid $790 million to settle a lawsuit filed by St. Louis interests.\n\nBut Kansas lawmakers noted that the Royals' major-league predecessor, the Athletics, moved to Oakland, California, in 1968 and now plan to relocate to Las Vegas. Kansas City lost major-league professional teams to other cities in the 1970s and 1980s, and the Chiefs came to Kansas City in 1963 after starting as the Dallas Texans four years earlier.\n\n\"The state of Missouri is known for losing professional teams,\" Kansas state Rep. Sean Tarwater, a Kansas City-area Republican, who helped lead the push for the stadium bill.\n\nMissouri officials have pledged to do what it takes to keep the Chiefs and Royals in their state but have not outlined specific proposals. Lucas saw the April vote as a sign that area residents wanted officials to discuss options other than extending the sales tax.\n\nLike their counterparts in Kansas, Missouri lawmakers have finished their annual regular session, but they are set to meet again Sept. 11 to consider vetoes by Parson.\n\nSupporters of Kansas\u00b4 bid for the teams said it could spur an aggressive response from Missouri - and added that if the teams get offers they like and opt to stay there, at least they\u00b4re still in the Kansas City area.\n\nLucas said the teams now have \"exceptional leverage.\"\n\nThe lease on the complex with the Chiefs' and Royals' existing stadiums runs through January 2031, but the teams have said they must plan renovations or new stadiums years in advance for them to be ready on time. Both suggested that even seven years out, time for a decision is short.\n\nBackers of the Kansas bid said such comments justified acting Tuesday, during a one-day special session that Kelly called to consider tax cuts after lawmakers adjourned their regular annual session May 1. Some critics argued that legislators should have waited until their regular 2025 session starts in January so a plan could be properly vetted.\n\nBut Parson and Lucas have said the contest for the teams is only in its \"first quarter,\" using a football metaphor.\n\nAssociated Press writers Summer Ballentine, in Columbia, Missouri, and Jim Salter, in O'Fallon, Missouri, also contributed to this story.\n\nFormer Kansas state Rep.

The plan would allow the state to issue bonds to help pay for a new stadium for the Chiefs and professional baseball's Kansas City Royals.\n\nTOPEKA, Kan. (AP) -- Kansas legislators cleared the way Tuesday for a debate on trying to lure the Kansas City Chiefs from Missouri by approving broad tax cuts that many lawmakers said they needed to see before considering a plan to help the Super Bowl champions finance a new stadium.\n\nThe Legislature took up the stadium proposal during a special session that convened Tuesday amid heavy lobbying for the plan. The measure would allow the state to issue bonds to help the Chiefs and Major League Baseball's Kansas City Royals finance new stadiums on the Kansas side of their metropolitan area, which is split by the border with Missouri.\n\nBut top Republicans in the GOP-controlled Legislature promised that the stadium proposal wouldn't be debated until the Legislature approved a plan that would cut income and property taxes by a total of $1.23 billion over the next three years. Many lawmakers argued that voters would be angry if the state helped finance new stadiums without cutting taxes.\n\n\"We definitely need to demonstrate that we're getting relief to our citizens,\" said Senate President Ty Masterson, a Wichita-area Republican who backed the stadium-financing plan.\n\nDemocratic Gov. Laura Kelly called the special session to have lawmakers consider reducing taxes after she vetoed three tax-cutting plans before legislators adjourned their regular annual session May 1. The plan lawmakers approved was a compromise between her and Republican leaders.\n\nLegislators made no changes in the plan before passing it, 34-4 in the Senate and 121-2 in the House. Kelly pledged to sign the measure into law.\n\nOnce legislators convened the special session, Kelly couldn't control what they considered, and that created an opening to consider the stadium-financing plan. That measure would use revenues from sports betting, the state lottery and new taxes raised from the area around each new stadium to pay off the state's bonds over 30 years.\n\nThe first version of the stadium-financing plan emerged in late April, but lawmakers didn't vote on it before adjourning. It would have allowed state bonds to finance all stadium construction costs, but the version to be considered by lawmakers Tuesday would cap the amount at 70% and require legislative leaders and the governor to sign off on any bonding plan.\n\nHouse Commerce Committee Chair Sean Tarwater, a Kansas City-area Republican, said the Chiefs are likely to spend between $500 million and $700 million in private funds on a new stadium.\n\n\"There are no blank checks,\" Tarwater told GOP colleagues during a briefing on the plan before the House began debating it.\n\nFeatured Local Savings\n\nA new nonprofit group, Scoop and Score, formed last month to push for bringing the Chiefs to Kansas, and that group and the Royals together hired more than 30 lobbyists for the special session. But the national free-market, small-government group Americans for Prosperity and the Kansas Policy Institute, a free-market think tank, oppose the measure, and both have been influential with conservative Republicans.\n\nFree-market conservatives have long opposed state and local subsidies for specific businesses or projects. And economists who've studied pro sports teams have concluded in dozens of studies over decades that subsidizing their stadiums isn't worth the cost.\n\n\"Most of the money that gets spent on the Chiefs is money that would otherwise be spent on other entertainment projects,\" said Andrew Zimbalist, an economics professor at Smith College in central Massachusetts who has written multiple books about sports.\n\nKansas legislators consider the Chiefs and Royals in play because in April, voters on the Missouri side of the metro area refused to continue a local sales tax for the upkeep of the complex with their side-by-side stadiums. Missouri officials have said they'll do whatever it takes to keep the teams but haven't outlined any proposals.\n\nThe two teams' lease on their stadium complex runs through January 2031, but Korb Maxwell, an attorney for the Chiefs who lives on the Kansas side, said renovations on the team's Arrowhead Stadium should be planned seven or eight years in advance.\n\n\"There is an urgency to this,\" added David Frantz, the Royals' general counsel.\n\nSupporters of the stadium plan argued that economists' past research doesn't apply to the Chiefs and Royals. They said the bonds will be paid off with tax revenues that aren't being generated now and would never be without the stadiums or the development around them. Masterson said it's wrong to call the bonds a subsidy.\n\nAnd Maxwell said: \"For a town to be major league, they need major league teams.\"\n\nBut economists who've studied pro sports said similar arguments have been a staple of past debates over paying for new stadiums. Development around a new stadium lessens development elsewhere, where the tax dollars generated would go to fund services or schools, they said.\n\n\"It could still help Kansas and maybe hurt Missouri by the same amount,\" Zimbalist said. \"It's a zero-sum game.\"", "source": {"uri": "gazette.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Colorado Springs Gazette"}, "authors": [{"uri":

Things to know about Kansas wooing the Chiefs", "body": "Kansas Gov. Laura Kelly participates in a Juneteenth holiday celebration, Monday, June 17, 2024, at the Statehouse in Topeka, Kansas. Kelly says she does not believe a plan approved by Kansas legislators to lure the Kansas City Chiefs and Royals to her state will restart a contest by each state to steal each other's jobs in the Kansas City area that ended with an agreement between the states in 2019.\n\nTOPEKA, Kan. (AP) -- A plan in Kansas for luring the Kansas City's two major league sports franchises from Missouri has prompted their hometown's mayor to declare that the move ends a 5-year-old agreement by the states not to poach each other's jobs.\n\nThe Kansas Legislature has approved a measure to allow the state to issue bonds to help the Super Bowl Champion Chiefs and Major League Baseball's Royals pay for new stadiums in Kansas. It goes next to Gov. Laura Kelly.\n\nHere are a few things to know about the two states' contest for the teams.\n\nKansas is poised to make offers\n\nWhile Kelly has not formally pledged to sign the stadium-financing bill, she issued a positive statement when it passed Tuesday, saying it could make Kansas \"a professional sports powerhouse.\" If she signs it, as many lawmakers expect, it would take effect July 1.\n\nThe state's secretary of commerce, Lt. Gov. David Toland, would negotiate with one or both teams on a plan for a new stadium. Kelly and eight top legislative leaders would have to approve each deal with a vote in a public meeting.\n\nA deal would draw the boundaries of a district around a stadium and possibly another around a separate practice facility, and new state sales and alcohol tax revenues generated by shops, restaurants, bars and hotels within that district would pay off the bonds over 30 years.\n\nThe city and county could pledge tax revenues as well but are not required to do so, and the state also could use revenues from sports betting and state lottery ticket sales to back bonds as well.\n\nThe bonds could cover up to 70% of the costs of the new stadiums, though supporters of the plan don't expect that, anticipating that two stadiums together could cost $4 billion.\n\nThere is talk of a renewed economic 'border war'\n\nThe Kansas-Missouri border splits the 2.3 million-resident Kansas City area, and there's both Kansas City, Missouri, and Kansas City, Kansas. Much of the border is the median of State Line Road, and about 60% of the area's residents live on the Missouri side.\n\nA feud between the two states has existed for generations and most recently saw each state burning through tens of millions of dollars in subsides to pull existing businesses across the border. Officials on both sides came to see the contest as expensive and wasteful, and in 2019, Kelly, a Democrat, and Missouri Gov. Mike Parson, a Republican, signed a truce.\n\nKansas City, Missouri Mayor Quinton Lucas told reporters that Kansas' bid for the Chiefs and Royals restarted that economic \"border war.\"\n\n\"I do believe long-term that we're one place and it's better when we work together,\" he said during a news conference.\n\nBut Kelly doesn't agree that the states' truce has been violated, telling reporters this week that before the agreement, \"We never discussed the teams.\"\n\nKansas lawmakers tapped fears about the future\n\nKansas lawmakers acted after voters on the Missouri side refused in April to extend a local sales tax for keeping up the complex with the teams' side-by-side stadiums. Many Kansas lawmakers worried that if they didn't act, the teams might move out of the area altogether -- mentioning Salt Lake City, San Antonio and Nashville.\n\nSeveral economists who've studied professional sports were dubious that moving would make financial sense for either team -- especially the Chiefs, who have a rabid fan base that could be hard to build quickly elsewhere. In addition, after pro football's Rams moved nearly a decade ago from St. Louis to Los Angeles, the team's owner and the National Football League paid $790 million to settle a lawsuit filed by St. Louis interests.\n\nBut Kansas lawmakers noted that the Royals' major-league predecessor, the Athletics, moved to Oakland, California, in 1968 and now plan to relocate to Las Vegas. Kansas City lost major-league professional teams to other cities in the 1970s and 1980s, and the Chiefs came to Kansas City in 1963 after starting as the Dallas Texans four years earlier.\n\n\"The state of Missouri is known for losing professional teams,\" Kansas state Rep. Sean Tarwater, a Kansas City-area Republican, who helped lead the push for the stadium bill.\n\nKansas officials expect Missouri to respond\n\nMissouri officials have pledged to do what it takes to keep the Chiefs and Royals in their state but have not outlined specific proposals. Lucas saw the April vote as a sign that area residents wanted officials to discuss options other than extending the sales tax.\n\nLike their counterparts in Kansas, Missouri lawmakers have finished their annual regular session, but they are set to meet again Sept. 11 to consider vetoes by Parson.\n\nSupporters of Kansas' bid for the teams said it could spur an aggressive response from Missouri -- and added that if the teams get offers they like and opt to stay there, at least they're still in the Kansas City area.\n\nLucas said the teams now have \"exceptional leverage.\"\n\nKansas and Missouri describe the timeline differently\n\nThe lease on the complex with the Chiefs' and Royals' existing stadiums runs through January 2031, but the teams have said they must plan renovations or new stadiums years in advance for them to be ready on time. Both suggested that even seven years out, time for a decision is short.\n\nBackers of the Kansas bid said such comments justified acting Tuesday, during a one-day special session that Kelly called to consider tax cuts after lawmakers adjourned their regular annual session May 1. Some critics argued that legislators should have waited until their regular 2025 session starts in January so a plan could be properly vetted.\n\nBut Parson and Lucas have said the contest for the teams is only in its \"first quarter,\" using a football metaphor.\n\nAssociated Press writers Summer Ballentine, in Columbia, Missouri, and Jim Salter, in O'Fallon, Missouri, also contributed to this

Susan Ruiz, a Kansas City-area Democrat.The votes on the Kansas stadium-financing plan were 84-38 in the state House and 27-8 in the Senate. Lawmakers from across the state -- even western Kansas, far from any new stadium -- supported the measure.It would allow state bonds to cover up to 70% of each new stadium, paying them off over 30 years with revenues from sports betting, state lottery ticket sales and new sales and alcohol taxes collected from shopping and entertainment districts around the new stadiums.House Commerce Committee Chair Sean Tarwater, a Kansas City-area Republican, said the Chiefs still are likely to spend $500 million to $700 million in private funds on a new stadium.\"There are no blank checks,\" Tarwater told GOP colleagues during a briefing.Legislators debated the plan during a one-day special session called by Kelly to have them consider reducing taxes after she vetoed three tax-cutting plans before legislators adjourned their regular annual session May 1.Republican leaders had promised that the stadium proposal wouldn't come up until the Legislature first approved a plan to cut income and property taxes by a total of $1.23 billion over the next three years. Many lawmakers argued that voters would be angry if the state helped finance new stadiums without cutting taxes.With the tax bill passed, the stadium plan gained support even from lawmakers who saw it as a handout for wealthy team owners. Some said failing to act risked pushing the teams to leave the Kansas City area, and a few said they had wanted the Chiefs in Kansas since childhood.\"It is amazing to me the speed with which we can solve problems when they're oriented around wealth, when they're oriented around business,\" said state Rep. Jason Probst, a Democrat from central Kansas.Yet Probst voted for the bill.\"This is the system that we're stuck in, so if we choose to opt out of that system, we will lose every time,\" he said.Economists who study pro sports teams have concluded in dozens of studies that a new stadium and shopping-and-entertainment area merely takes existing economic activity away from elsewhere in a community, resulting in little or no net gain.\"It could still help Kansas and maybe hurt Missouri by the same amount,\" said Andrew Zimbalist, an economics professor at Smith college in central Massachusetts who has written multiple books about sports. \"It's a zero-sum game.\"A skeptical state Sen.

Some said failing to act risked pushing the teams to leave the Kansas City area, and a few said they had wanted the Chiefs in Kansas since childhood.\n\n\"It is amazing to me the speed with which we can solve problems when they're oriented around wealth, when they're oriented around business,\" said state Rep. Jason Probst, a Democrat from central Kansas.\n\nYet Probst voted for the bill.\n\n\"This is the system that we're stuck in, so if we choose to opt out of that system, we will lose every time,\" he said.\n\nEconomists who study pro sports teams have concluded in dozens of studies that a new stadium and shopping-and-entertainment area merely takes existing economic activity away from elsewhere in a community, resulting in little or no net gain.\n\n\"It could still help Kansas and maybe hurt Missouri by the same amount,\" said Andrew Zimbalist, an economics professor at Smith college in central Massachusetts who has written multiple books about sports. \"It's a zero-sum game.\"\n\nA skeptical state Sen. Molly Baumgardner, a Kansas City-area Republican, used a Christmas Eve metaphor to characterize supporters' excitement before she voted no.\n\n\"There are visions of sugar plums,\" Baumgardner said.",

Things to know about Kansas wooing the Chiefs", "body": "TOPEKA, Kan. (AP) -- A plan in Kansas for luring the Kansas City's two major league sports franchises from Missouri has prompted their hometown's mayor to declare that the move ends a 5-year-old agreement by the states not to poach each other's jobs.\n\nThe Kansas Legislature has approved a measure to allow the state to issue bonds to help the Super Bowl Champion Chiefs and Major League Baseball's Royals pay for new stadiums in Kansas. It goes next to Gov. Laura Kelly.\n\nHere are a few things to know about the two states' contest for the teams.\n\nKansas is poised to make offers\n\nWhile Kelly has not formally pledged to sign the stadium-financing bill, she issued a positive statement when it passed Tuesday, saying it could make Kansas \"a professional sports powerhouse.\" If she signs it, as many lawmakers expect, it would take effect July 1.\n\nThe state's secretary of commerce, Lt. Gov. David Toland, would negotiate with one or both teams on a plan for a new stadium. Kelly and eight top legislative leaders would have to approve each deal with a vote in a public meeting.\n\nA deal would draw the boundaries of a district around a stadium and possibly another around a separate practice facility, and new state sales and alcohol tax revenues generated by shops, restaurants, bars and hotels within that district would pay off the bonds over 30 years.\n\nThe city and county could pledge tax revenues as well but are not required to do so, and the state also could use revenues from sports betting and state lottery ticket sales to back bonds as well.\n\nThe bonds could cover up to 70% of the costs of the new stadiums, though supporters of the plan don't expect that, anticipating that two stadiums together could cost $4 billion.\n\nThere is talk of a renewed economic 'border war'\n\nThe Kansas-Missouri border splits the 2.3 million-resident Kansas City area, and there's both Kansas City, Missouri, and Kansas City, Kansas. Much of the border is the median of State Line Road, and about 60% of the area's residents live on the Missouri side.\n\nA feud between the two states has existed for generations and most recently saw each state burning through tens of millions of dollars in subsides to pull existing businesses across the border. Officials on both sides came to see the contest as expensive and wasteful, and in 2019, Kelly, a Democrat, and Missouri Gov. Mike Parson, a Republican, signed a truce.\n\nKansas City, Missouri Mayor Quinton Lucas told reporters that Kansas' bid for the Chiefs and Royals restarted that economic \"border war.\"\n\n\"I do believe long-term that we're one place and it's better when we work together,\" he said during a news conference.\n\nBut Kelly doesn't agree that the states' truce has been violated, telling reporters this week that before the agreement, \"We never discussed the teams.\"\n\nKansas lawmakers tapped fears about the future\n\nKansas lawmakers acted after voters on the Missouri side refused in April to extend a local sales tax for keeping up the complex with the teams' side-by-side stadiums. Many Kansas lawmakers worried that if they didn't act, the teams might move out of the area altogether -- mentioning Salt Lake City, San Antonio and Nashville.\n\nSeveral economists who've studied professional sports were dubious that moving would make financial sense for either team -- especially the Chiefs, who have a rabid fan base that could be hard to build quickly elsewhere. In addition, after pro football's Rams moved nearly a decade ago from St. Louis to Los Angeles, the team's owner and the National Football League paid $790 million to settle a lawsuit filed by St. Louis interests.\n\nBut Kansas lawmakers noted that the Royals' major-league predecessor, the Athletics, moved to Oakland, California, in 1968 and now plan to relocate to Las Vegas. Kansas City lost major-league professional teams to other cities in the 1970s and 1980s, and the Chiefs came to Kansas City in 1963 after starting as the Dallas Texans four years earlier.\n\n\"The state of Missouri is known for losing professional teams,\" Kansas state Rep. Sean Tarwater, a Kansas City-area Republican, who helped lead the push for the stadium bill.\n\nKansas officials expect Missouri to respond\n\nMissouri officials have pledged to do what it takes to keep the Chiefs and Royals in their state but have not outlined specific proposals. Lucas saw the April vote as a sign that area residents wanted officials to discuss options other than extending the sales tax.\n\nLike their counterparts in Kansas, Missouri lawmakers have finished their annual regular session, but they are set to meet again Sept. 11 to consider vetoes by Parson.\n\nSupporters of Kansas' bid for the teams said it could spur an aggressive response from Missouri -- and added that if the teams get offers they like and opt to stay there, at least they're still in the Kansas City area.\n\nLucas said the teams now have \"exceptional leverage.\"\n\nKansas and Missouri describe the timeline differently\n\nThe lease on the complex with the Chiefs' and Royals' existing stadiums runs through January 2031, but the teams have said they must plan renovations or new stadiums years in advance for them to be ready on time. Both suggested that even seven years out, time for a decision is short.\n\nBackers of the Kansas bid said such comments justified acting Tuesday, during a one-day special session that Kelly called to consider tax cuts after lawmakers adjourned their regular annual session May 1. Some critics argued that legislators should have waited until their regular 2025 session starts in January so a plan could be properly vetted.\n\nBut Parson and Lucas have said the contest for the teams is only in its \"first quarter,\" using a football metaphor.\n\n___\n\nAssociated Press writers Summer Ballentine, in Columbia, Missouri, and Jim Salter, in O'Fallon, Missouri, also contributed

(AP) -- Kansas is making a serious run at becoming the new home for the reigning Super Bowl champions with legislators approving a plan Tuesday for luring both the Chiefs and Major League Baseball's Kansas City Royals away from Missouri.\n\nBipartisan legislative supermajorities OKed the measure to authorize state bonds to help finance new stadiums and practice facilities for both teams on the Kansas side of the metropolitan area of 2.3 million residents, which is split by the border with Missouri. Three Super Bowl victories in five years -- and player Travis Kelce's romance with pop icon Taylor Swift -- have made the Chiefs perhaps the area's most celebrated civic asset.\n\nThe plan from the Republican-controlled Legislature goes next to Democratic Gov. Laura Kelly. While she stopped short of promising to sign it, she said in a statement that \"Kansas now has the opportunity to become a professional sports powerhouse.\"\n\nBoth the Chiefs and the Royals said they look forward to considering Kansas options.

Things to know about Kansas wooing the Chiefs", "body": "The mayor of Kansas City, Missouri, says an economic 'border war' between his state and Kansas has restarted\n\nTOPEKA, Kan. -- A plan in Kansas for luring the Kansas City's two major league sports franchises from Missouri has prompted their hometown's mayor to declare that the move ends a 5-year-old agreement by the states not to poach each other's jobs.\n\nThe Kansas Legislature has approved a measure to allow the state to issue bonds to help the Super Bowl Champion Chiefs and Major League Baseball's Royals pay for new stadiums in Kansas. It goes next to Gov. Laura Kelly.\n\nHere are a few things to know about the two states' contest for the teams.\n\nWhile Kelly has not formally pledged to sign the stadium-financing bill, she issued a positive statement when it passed Tuesday, saying it could make Kansas \"a professional sports powerhouse.\" If she signs it, as many lawmakers expect, it would take effect July 1.\n\nThe state's secretary of commerce, Lt. Gov. David Toland, would negotiate with one or both teams on a plan for a new stadium. Kelly and eight top legislative leaders would have to approve each deal with a vote in a public meeting.\n\nA deal would draw the boundaries of a district around a stadium and possibly another around a separate practice facility, and new state sales and alcohol tax revenues generated by shops, restaurants, bars and hotels within that district would pay off the bonds over 30 years.\n\nThe city and county could pledge tax revenues as well but are not required to do so, and the state also could use revenues from sports betting and state lottery ticket sales to back bonds as well.\n\nThe bonds could cover up to 70% of the costs of the new stadiums, though supporters of the plan don't expect that, anticipating that two stadiums together could cost $4 billion.\n\nThe Kansas-Missouri border splits the 2.3 million-resident Kansas City area, and there's both Kansas City, Missouri, and Kansas City, Kansas. Much of the border is the median of State Line Road, and about 60% of the area's residents live on the Missouri side.\n\nA feud between the two states has existed for generations and most recently saw each state burning through tens of millions of dollars in subsides to pull existing businesses across the border. Officials on both sides came to see the contest as expensive and wasteful, and in 2019, Kelly, a Democrat, and Missouri Gov. Mike Parson, a Republican, signed a truce.\n\nKansas City, Missouri Mayor Quinton Lucas told reporters that Kansas' bid for the Chiefs and Royals restarted that economic \"border war.\"\n\n\"I do believe long-term that we're one place and it's better when we work together,\" he said during a news conference.\n\nBut Kelly doesn't agree that the states' truce has been violated, telling reporters this week that before the agreement, \"We never discussed the teams.\"\n\nKansas lawmakers acted after voters on the Missouri side refused in April to extend a local sales tax for keeping up the complex with the teams' side-by-side stadiums. Many Kansas lawmakers worried that if they didn't act, the teams might move out of the area altogether -- mentioning Salt Lake City, San Antonio and Nashville.\n\nSeveral economists who've studied professional sports were dubious that moving would make financial sense for either team -- especially the Chiefs, who have a rabid fan base that could be hard to build quickly elsewhere. In addition, after pro football's Rams moved nearly a decade ago from St. Louis to Los Angeles, the team's owner and the National Football League paid $790 million to settle a lawsuit filed by St. Louis interests.\n\nBut Kansas lawmakers noted that the Royals' major-league predecessor, the Athletics, moved to Oakland, California, in 1968 and now plan to relocate to Las Vegas. Kansas City lost major-league professional teams to other cities in the 1970s and 1980s, and the Chiefs came to Kansas City in 1963 after starting as the Dallas Texans four years earlier.\n\n\"The state of Missouri is known for losing professional teams,\" Kansas state Rep. Sean Tarwater, a Kansas City-area Republican, who helped lead the push for the stadium bill.\n\nMissouri officials have pledged to do what it takes to keep the Chiefs and Royals in their state but have not outlined specific proposals. Lucas saw the April vote as a sign that area residents wanted officials to discuss options other than extending the sales tax.\n\nLike their counterparts in Kansas, Missouri lawmakers have finished their annual regular session, but they are set to meet again Sept. 11 to consider vetoes by Parson.\n\nSupporters of Kansas' bid for the teams said it could spur an aggressive response from Missouri -- and added that if the teams get offers they like and opt to stay there, at least they're still in the Kansas City area.\n\nLucas said the teams now have \"exceptional leverage.\"\n\nThe lease on the complex with the Chiefs' and Royals' existing stadiums runs through January 2031, but the teams have said they must plan renovations or new stadiums years in advance for them to be ready on time. Both suggested that even seven years out, time for a decision is short.\n\nBackers of the Kansas bid said such comments justified acting Tuesday, during a one-day special session that Kelly called to consider tax cuts after lawmakers adjourned their regular annual session May 1. Some critics argued that legislators should have waited until their regular 2025 session starts in January so a plan could be properly vetted.\n\nBut Parson and Lucas have said the contest for the teams is only in its \"first quarter,\" using a football metaphor.\n\n___\n\nAssociated Press writers Summer Ballentine, in Columbia, Missouri, and Jim Salter, in O'Fallon, Missouri, also contributed

Under the legislation, the teams could receive more than $750 million to help finance stadium projects.\n\nThe informational hearing came ahead of a special legislative session that starts Tuesday. Lawmakers can't take action on the bill until the formal start of the special session.\n\nThe legislation would enhance the state's existing Sales Tax and Revenue (STAR) Bond program to provide up to 75% of the project's costs by issuing bonds that would be repaid with the increased sales state tax collections at the project site. Other projects can use STAR Bonds to finance up to 50% of a project.\n\nThe bill requires a minimum $1 billion capital investment and limits the eligibility to National Football League or Major League Baseball teams currently located near Kansas. The financing mechanism could be used for both stadiums and training facilities.\n\nDebt on a stadium constructed under the expansion wouldn't have to be repaid for 30 years instead of the normal 20.\n\nThe project could also receive a boost from liquor taxes generated in the STAR Bond district and revenues from a fund Kansas created when it legalized sports betting.\n\nGov. Laura Kelly, who has championed enormous economic development projects in Kansas, didn't commit to supporting the legislation on Monday.\n\n\"I'm impressed by the full-court press that has been made to get these teams to consider moving across the river,\" she told reporters. \"It's not something I'm going to invest a lot of energy in. I think this is something for the legislature to work through.\"\n\nKelly's chief of staff, Will Lawrence, told the joint committee the governor's office had no concerns with the current version of the bill that would keep her from signing it.\n\nSTAR Bonds have been criticized by some legislators as ineffective, and an audit found that less than one-quarter of the attractions funded through the program met the state's goal of increasing tourism. There may be some cases, the audit says, where certain projects kept Kansans spending money in Kansas rather than going to Missouri.\n\n\"But we think it's more often that local visitors simply move existing economic activity from one part of Kansas to another,\" the audit says.\n\nKansas lawmakers launched an effort to lure the Chiefs or Royals -- or both -- after Jackson County, Missouri, voters in April rejected a proposed extension of a 3/8-cent sales tax to help finance a new stadium for the Royals and upgrades at Arrowhead Stadium.\n\nMaxwell said the organization had been asked why the legislation needed to be passed in special session rather than when lawmakers reconvene for their normal session in January.\n\nBecause with only a few years left in the Chiefs' lease at Arrowhead, \"time is of the essence,\" he said.\n\n\"The time is now,\" Maxwell said. \"Missouri spoke, Jackson County spoke. They had their opportunity, but now there's a moment for Kansas to step up.\"\n\nThe effort to reauthorize the sales tax in Missouri was driven primarily by the Royals, whose executives unveiled plans to move to the Crossroads Arts District in downtown Kansas City in February -- less than two months before the vote. It failed with 58% of voters rejecting the proposal.\n\nEarlier this month, Scoop and Score Inc. launched to advocate for moving Chiefs -- the reigning Super Bowl champions -- to Kansas. The organization's website implores visitors to sign a petition to \"tell legislators to keep the Chiefs in KC!\"\n\nThe organization has hired 30 lobbyists, including Murray. The Royals have eight lobbyists, and the Chiefs employ former Kansas House Speaker Ron Ryckman Jr. and his former aide, Paje Resner, as lobbyists.\n\nRyckman said Kansas City Chiefs owner Clark Hunt could be open to moving the team outside of the Kansas City region.\n\n\"We're aware of numerous cities that would love to be the home of the Chiefs or the Royals,\" Ryckman said.\n\nMurray urged lawmakers to support the legislation, arguing it has \"guardrails, guardrails guardrails\" to keep the state and local governments from being on the hook for the bonds.\n\nWhile an attorney for the Chiefs acknowledged the franchise hasn't come up with a design or plan for a stadium in Kansas, Murray urged lawmakers to move forward with creating a program. Vetting the details, he said, will be up to the Kansas Department of Commerce with final approval by the Legislative Coordinating Council, an eight-member committee of House and Senate lawmakers that can adopt legislation when the Legislature is not in session.\n\nBut a draft of the bill says any agreement between the state and a team would be confidential until after it has been executed.\n\nThe bill was panned by libertarian groups as a handout for corporations that would do little to increase economic activity in Kansas. Dave Trabert, CEO of the Kansas Policy Institute, told the committee there was no way to verify the claims that the stadiums would boost the economy.\n\n\"We asked Scoop and Score to provide their math. 'Show us how you arrived at a billion dollars of economic activity,'' Trabert said. \"Nothing was forthcoming.\"\n\nIn an interview, Trabert called the proposal \"absurd.\"", "source": {"uri":

Laura Kelly, who has championed enormous economic development projects in Kansas, didn't commit to supporting the legislation on Monday.\n\n\"I'm impressed by the full-court press that has been made to get these teams to consider moving across the river,\" she told reporters. \"It's not something I'm going to invest a lot of energy in. I think this is something for the legislature to work through.\"\n\nKelly's chief of staff, Will Lawrence, told the joint committee the governor's office had no concerns with the current version of the bill that would keep her from signing it.\n\nSTAR Bonds have been criticized by some legislators as ineffective, and an audit found that less than one-quarter of the attractions funded through the program met the state's goal of increasing tourism. There may be some cases, the audit says, where certain projects kept Kansans spending money in Kansas rather than going to Missouri.\n\n\"But we think it's more often that local visitors simply move existing economic activity from one part of Kansas to another,\" the audit says.\n\nKansas lawmakers launched an effort to lure the Chiefs or Royals -- or both -- after Jackson County, Missouri, voters in April rejected a proposed extension of a 3/8-cent sales tax to help finance a new stadium for the Royals and upgrades at Arrowhead Stadium.\n\nMaxwell said the organization had been asked why the legislation needed to be passed in special session rather than when lawmakers reconvene for their normal session in January.\n\nBecause with only a few years left in the Chiefs' lease at Arrowhead, \"time is of the essence,\" he said.\n\n\"The time is now,\" Maxwell said. \"Missouri spoke, Jackson County spoke. They had their opportunity, but now there's a moment for Kansas to step up.\"\n\nThe effort to reauthorize the sales tax in Missouri was driven primarily by the Royals, whose executives unveiled plans to move to the Crossroads Arts District in downtown Kansas City in February -- less than two months before the vote. It failed with 58% of voters rejecting the proposal.\n\nEarlier this month, Scoop and Score Inc. launched to advocate for moving Chiefs -- the reigning Super Bowl champions -- to Kansas. The organization's website implores visitors to sign a petition to \"tell legislators to keep the Chiefs in KC!\"\n\nThe organization has hired 30 lobbyists, including Murray. The Royals have eight lobbyists, and the Chiefs employ former Kansas House Speaker Ron Ryckman Jr. and his former aide, Paje Resner, as lobbyists.\n\nRyckman said Kansas City Chiefs owner Clark Hunt could be open to moving the team outside of the Kansas City region.\n\n\"We're aware of numerous cities that would love to be the home of the Chiefs or the Royals,\" Ryckman said.\n\nMurray urged lawmakers to support the legislation, arguing it has \"guardrails, guardrails guardrails\" to keep the state and local governments from being on the hook for the bonds.\n\nWhile an attorney for the Chiefs acknowledged the franchise hasn't come up with a design or plan for a stadium in Kansas, Murray urged lawmakers to move forward with creating a program. Vetting the details, he said, will be up to the Kansas Department of Commerce with final approval by the Legislative Coordinating Council, an eight-member committee of House and Senate lawmakers that can adopt legislation when the Legislature is not in session.\n\nBut a draft of the bill says any agreement between the state and a team would be confidential until after it has been executed.\n\nThe bill was panned by libertarian groups as a handout for corporations that would do little to increase economic activity in Kansas. Dave Trabert, CEO of the Kansas Policy Institute, told the committee there was no way to verify the claims that the stadiums would boost the economy.\n\n\"We asked Scoop and Score to provide their math. 'Show us how you arrived at a billion dollars of economic activity,'' Trabert said. \"Nothing was forthcoming.\"\n\nIn an interview, Trabert called the proposal \"absurd.\"\n\n\"This isn't about economic development,\" he said. \"It's about politics. It's so people can say, 'Look what I did. Vote for me.'\"", "source": {"uri": "kcur.org", "dataType": "news", "title": "KCUR 89.3 - NPR in Kansas City.

AP's earlier story follows below.\n\nTOPEKA, Kan. (AP) -- Kansas legislators cleared the way Tuesday for a debate on trying to lure the Kansas City Chiefs from Missouri by approving broad tax cuts that many lawmakers said they needed to see before considering a plan to help the Super Bowl champions finance a new stadium.\n\nThe Legislature took up the stadium proposal during a special session that convened Tuesday amid heavy lobbying for the plan. The measure would allow the state to issue bonds to help the Chiefs and Major League Baseball's Kansas City Royals finance new stadiums on the Kansas side of their metropolitan area, which is split by the border with Missouri.\n\nBut top Republicans in the GOP-controlled Legislature promised that the stadium proposal wouldn't be debated until the Legislature approved a plan that would cut income and property taxes by a total of $1.23 billion over the next three years. Many lawmakers argued that voters would be angry if the state helped finance new stadiums without cutting taxes.\n\n\"We definitely need to demonstrate that we're getting relief to our citizens,\" said Senate President Ty Masterson, a Wichita-area Republican who backed the stadium-financing plan.\n\nDemocratic Gov. Laura Kelly called the special session to have lawmakers consider reducing taxes after she vetoed three tax-cutting plans before legislators adjourned their regular annual session May 1. The plan lawmakers approved was a compromise between her and Republican leaders.\n\nLegislators made no changes in the plan before passing it, 34-4 in the Senate and 121-2 in the House. Kelly pledged to sign the measure into law.\n\nOnce legislators convened the special session, Kelly couldn't control what they considered, and that created an opening to consider the stadium-financing plan. That measure would use revenues from sports betting, the state lottery and new taxes raised from the area around each new stadium to pay off the state's bonds over 30 years.\n\nThe first version of the stadium-financing plan emerged in late April, but lawmakers didn't vote on it before adjourning. It would have allowed state bonds to finance all stadium construction costs, but the version to be considered by lawmakers Tuesday would cap the amount at 70% and require legislative leaders and the governor to sign off on any bonding plan.\n\nARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW ARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW\n\nHouse Commerce Committee Chair Sean Tarwater, a Kansas City-area Republican, said the Chiefs are likely to spend between $500 million and $700 million in private funds on a new stadium.\n\n\"There are no blank checks,\" Tarwater told GOP colleagues during a briefing on the plan before the House began debating it.\n\nA new nonprofit group, Scoop and Score, formed last month to push for bringing the Chiefs to Kansas, and that group and the Royals together hired more than 30 lobbyists for the special session. But the national free-market, small-government group Americans for Prosperity and the Kansas Policy Institute, a free-market think tank, oppose the measure, and both have been influential with conservative Republicans.\n\nFree-market conservatives have long opposed state and local subsidies for specific businesses or projects. And economists who've studied pro sports teams have concluded in dozens of studies over decades that subsidizing their stadiums isn't worth the cost.\n\n\"Most of the money that gets spent on the Chiefs is money that would otherwise be spent on other entertainment projects,\" said Andrew Zimbalist, an economics professor at Smith College in central Massachusetts who has written multiple books about sports.\n\nARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW ARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW\n\nKansas legislators consider the Chiefs and Royals in play because in April, voters on the Missouri side of the metro area refused to continue a local sales tax for the upkeep of the complex with their side-by-side stadiums. Missouri officials have said they'll do whatever it takes to keep the teams but haven't outlined any proposals.\n\nThe two teams' lease on their stadium complex runs through January 2031, but Korb Maxwell, an attorney for the Chiefs who lives on the Kansas side, said renovations on the team's Arrowhead Stadium should be planned seven or eight years in advance.\n\n\"There is an urgency to this,\" added David Frantz, the Royals' general counsel.\n\nSupporters of the stadium plan argued that economists' past research doesn't apply to the Chiefs and Royals. They said the bonds will be paid off with tax revenues that aren't being generated now and would never be without the stadiums or the development around them. Masterson said it's wrong to call the bonds a subsidy.\n\nAnd Maxwell said: \"For a town to be major league, they need major league teams.\"\n\nARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW ARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW\n\nBut economists who've studied pro sports said similar arguments have been a staple of past debates over paying for new stadiums. Development around a new stadium lessens development elsewhere, where the tax dollars generated would go to fund services or schools, they said.\n\n\"It could still help Kansas and maybe hurt Missouri by the same amount,\" Zimbalist said. \"It's a zero-sum game.\"", "source": {"uri": "thestar.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Star"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

Things to know about Kansas wooing the Chiefs", "body": "A plan in Kansas for luring the Kansas City's two major league sports franchises from Missouri has prompted their hometown's mayor to declare that the move ends a 5-year-old agreement by the states not to poach each other's jobs.The Kansas Legislature has approved a measure to allow the state to issue bonds to help the Super Bowl Champion Chiefs and Major League Baseball's Royals pay for new stadiums in Kansas. It goes next to Gov. Laura Kelly.Here are a few things to know about the two states' contest for the teams.Kansas is poised to make offersWhile Kelly has not formally pledged to sign the stadium-financing bill, she issued a positive statement when it passed Tuesday, saying it could make Kansas \"a professional sports powerhouse.\" If she signs it, as many lawmakers expect, it would take effect July 1.The state's secretary of commerce, Lt. Gov. David Toland, would negotiate with one or both teams on a plan for a new stadium. Kelly and eight top legislative leaders would have to approve each deal with a vote in a public meeting.A deal would draw the boundaries of a district around a stadium and possibly another around a separate practice facility, and new state sales and alcohol tax revenues generated by shops, restaurants, bars and hotels within that district would pay off the bonds over 30 years.The city and county could pledge tax revenues as well but are not required to do so, and the state also could use revenues from sports betting and state lottery ticket sales to back bonds as well.The bonds could cover up to 70% of the costs of the new stadiums, though supporters of the plan don't expect that, anticipating that two stadiums together could cost $4 billion.There is talk of a renewed economic 'border war'The Kansas-Missouri border splits the 2.3 million-resident Kansas City area, and there's both Kansas City, Missouri, and Kansas City, Kansas. Much of the border is the median of State Line Road, and about 60% of the area's residents live on the Missouri side.A feud between the two states has existed for generations and most recently saw each state burning through tens of millions of dollars in subsides to pull existing businesses across the border. Officials on both sides came to see the contest as expensive and wasteful, and in 2019, Kelly, a Democrat, and Missouri Gov. Mike Parson, a Republican, signed a truce.Kansas City, Missouri Mayor Quinton Lucas told reporters that Kansas' bid for the Chiefs and Royals restarted that economic \"border war.\"\"I do believe long-term that we're one place and it's better when we work together,\" he said during a news conference.But Kelly doesn't agree that the states' truce has been violated, telling reporters this week that before the agreement, \"We never discussed the teams.\"Kansas lawmakers tapped fears about the futureKansas lawmakers acted after voters on the Missouri side refused in April to extend a local sales tax for keeping up the complex with the teams' side-by-side stadiums. Many Kansas lawmakers worried that if they didn't act, the teams might move out of the area altogether -- mentioning Salt Lake City, San Antonio and Nashville.Several economists who've studied professional sports were dubious that moving would make financial sense for either team -- especially the Chiefs, who have a rabid fan base that could be hard to build quickly elsewhere. In addition, after pro football's Rams moved nearly a decade ago from St. Louis to Los Angeles, the team's owner and the National Football League paid $790 million to settle a lawsuit filed by St. Louis interests.But Kansas lawmakers noted that the Royals' major-league predecessor, the Athletics, moved to Oakland, California, in 1968 and now plan to relocate to Las Vegas.

Some critics argued that legislators should have waited until their regular 2025 session starts in January so a plan could be properly vetted.But Parson and Lucas have said the contest for the teams is only in its \"first quarter,\" using a football metaphor.\n\nA plan in Kansas for luring the Kansas City's two major league sports franchises from Missouri has prompted their hometown's mayor to declare that the move ends a 5-year-old agreement by the states not to poach each other's jobs.\n\nThe Kansas Legislature has approved a measure to allow the state to issue bonds to help the Super Bowl Champion Chiefs and Major League Baseball's Royals pay for new stadiums in Kansas. It goes next to Gov. Laura Kelly.\n\nHere are a few things to know about the two states' contest for the teams.\n\nKansas is poised to make offers\n\nWhile Kelly has not formally pledged to sign the stadium-financing bill, she issued a positive statement when it passed Tuesday, saying it could make Kansas \"a professional sports powerhouse.\" If she signs it, as many lawmakers expect, it would take effect July 1.\n\nThe state's secretary of commerce, Lt. Gov. David Toland, would negotiate with one or both teams on a plan for a new stadium. Kelly and eight top legislative leaders would have to approve each deal with a vote in a public meeting.\n\nA deal would draw the boundaries of a district around a stadium and possibly another around a separate practice facility, and new state sales and alcohol tax revenues generated by shops, restaurants, bars and hotels within that district would pay off the bonds over 30 years.\n\nThe city and county could pledge tax revenues as well but are not required to do so, and the state also could use revenues from sports betting and state lottery ticket sales to back bonds as well.\n\nThe bonds could cover up to 70% of the costs of the new stadiums, though supporters of the plan don't expect that, anticipating that two stadiums together could cost $4 billion.\n\nThere is talk of a renewed economic 'border war'\n\nThe Kansas-Missouri border splits the 2.3 million-resident Kansas City area, and there's both Kansas City, Missouri, and Kansas City, Kansas. Much of the border is the median of State Line Road, and about 60% of the area's residents live on the Missouri side.\n\nA feud between the two states has existed for generations and most recently saw each state burning through tens of millions of dollars in subsides to pull existing businesses across the border. Officials on both sides came to see the contest as expensive and wasteful, and in 2019, Kelly, a Democrat, and Missouri Gov. Mike Parson, a Republican, signed a truce.\n\nKansas City, Missouri Mayor Quinton Lucas told reporters that Kansas' bid for the Chiefs and Royals restarted that economic \"border war.\"\n\n\"I do believe long-term that we're one place and it's better when we work together,\" he said during a news conference.\n\nBut Kelly doesn't agree that the states' truce has been violated, telling reporters this week that before the agreement, \"We never discussed the teams.\"\n\nKansas lawmakers tapped fears about the future\n\nKansas lawmakers acted after voters on the Missouri side refused in April to extend a local sales tax for keeping up the complex with the teams' side-by-side stadiums. Many Kansas lawmakers worried that if they didn't act, the teams might move out of the area altogether -- mentioning Salt Lake City, San Antonio and Nashville.\n\nSeveral economists who've studied professional sports were dubious that moving would make financial sense for either team -- especially the Chiefs, who have a rabid fan base that could be hard to build quickly elsewhere. In addition, after pro football's Rams moved nearly a decade ago from St. Louis to Los Angeles, the team's owner and the National Football League paid $790 million to settle a lawsuit filed by St. Louis interests.\n\nBut Kansas lawmakers noted that the Royals' major-league predecessor, the Athletics, moved to Oakland, California, in 1968 and now plan to relocate to Las Vegas. Kansas City lost major-league professional teams to other cities in the 1970s and 1980s, and the Chiefs came to Kansas City in 1963 after starting as the Dallas Texans four years earlier.\n\n\"The state of Missouri is known for losing professional teams,\" Kansas state Rep.

Bipartisan legislative supermajorities OKed the measure to authorize state bonds to help finance new stadiums and practice facilities for both teams on the Kansas side of the metropolitan area of 2.3 million residents, which is split by the border with Missouri. Three Super Bowl victories in five years -- and player Travis Kelce's romance with pop icon Taylor Swift -- have made the Chiefs perhaps the area's most celebrated civic asset.The plan from the Republican-controlled Legislature goes next to Democratic Gov. Laura Kelly.

Backers of the plan brushed aside decades of research by economists concluding that government subsidies for professional sports stadiums are not worth the cost. They also overcame criticism that lawmakers were moving too quickly.A spokeswoman for Missouri Gov. Mike Parson did not immediately respond to an email message seeking comment. But in Kansas City, Missouri, Mayor Quinton Lucas promised to \"lay out a good offer\" to keep both teams in town.\"Today was largely, in my opinion, about leverage,\" Lucas said. \"And the teams are in an exceptional leverage position.\" Some Kansas officials reached the same conclusion.\"I think the Chiefs and the Royals are using us,\" said state Rep. Susan Ruiz, a Kansas City-area Democrat. The votes on the Kansas stadium-financing plan were 84-38 in the state House and 27-8 in the Senate. Lawmakers from across the state -- even western Kansas, far from any new stadium -- supported the measure. It would allow state bonds to cover up to 70% of each new stadium, paying them off over 30 years with revenues from sports betting, state lottery ticket sales and new sales and alcohol taxes collected from shopping and entertainment districts around the new stadiums.House Commerce Committee Chair Sean Tarwater, a Kansas City-area Republican, said the Chiefs still are likely to spend $500 million to $700 million in private funds on a new stadium.\"There are no blank checks,\" Tarwater told GOP colleagues during a briefing. Legislators debated the plan during a one-day special session called by Kelly to have them consider reducing taxes after she vetoed three tax-cutting plans before legislators adjourned their regular annual session May 1. Republican leaders had promised that the stadium proposal wouldn't come up until the Legislature first approved a plan to cut income and property taxes by a total of $1.23 billion over the next three years. Many lawmakers argued that voters would be angry if the state helped finance new stadiums without cutting taxes. With the tax bill passed, the stadium plan gained support even from lawmakers who saw it as a handout for wealthy team owners. Some said failing to act risked pushing the teams to leave the Kansas City area, and a few said they had wanted the Chiefs in Kansas since childhood.\"It is amazing to me the speed with which we can solve problems when they're oriented around wealth, when they're oriented around business,\" said state Rep. Jason Probst, a Democrat from central Kansas.Yet Probst voted for the bill. \"This is the system that we're stuck in, so if we choose to opt out of that system, we will lose every time,\" he said. Economists who study pro sports teams have concluded in dozens of studies that a new stadium and shopping-and-entertainment area merely takes existing economic activity away from elsewhere in a community, resulting in little or no net gain. \"It could still help Kansas and maybe hurt Missouri by the same amount,\" said Andrew Zimbalist, an economics professor at Smith college in central Massachusetts who has written multiple books about sports. \"It's a zero-sum game.\" A skeptical state Sen.

Things to know about Kansas wooing the Chiefs", "body": "TOPEKA, Kan. (AP) -- A plan in Kansas for luring the Kansas City's two major league sports franchises from Missouri has prompted their hometown's mayor to declare that the move ends a 5-year-old agreement by the states not to poach each other's jobs.\n\nThe Kansas Legislature has approved a measure to allow the state to issue bonds to help the Super Bowl Champion Chiefs and Major League Baseball's Royals pay for new stadiums in Kansas. It goes next to Gov. Laura Kelly.\n\nHere are a few things to know about the two states' contest for the teams.\n\nKansas is poised to make offers\n\nWhile Kelly has not formally pledged to sign the stadium-financing bill, she issued a positive statement when it passed Tuesday, saying it could make Kansas \"a professional sports powerhouse.\" If she signs it, as many lawmakers expect, it would take effect July 1.\n\nThe state's secretary of commerce, Lt. Gov. David Toland, would negotiate with one or both teams on a plan for a new stadium. Kelly and eight top legislative leaders would have to approve each deal with a vote in a public meeting.\n\nA deal would draw the boundaries of a district around a stadium and possibly another around a separate practice facility, and new state sales and alcohol tax revenues generated by shops, restaurants, bars and hotels within that district would pay off the bonds over 30 years.\n\nThe city and county could pledge tax revenues as well but are not required to do so, and the state also could use revenues from sports betting and state lottery ticket sales to back bonds as well.\n\nThe bonds could cover up to 70% of the costs of the new stadiums, though supporters of the plan don't expect that, anticipating that two stadiums together could cost $4 billion.\n\nThere is talk of a renewed economic 'border war'\n\nThe Kansas-Missouri border splits the 2.3 million-resident Kansas City area, and there's both Kansas City, Missouri, and Kansas City, Kansas. Much of the border is the median of State Line Road, and about 60% of the area's residents live on the Missouri side.\n\nA feud between the two states has existed for generations and most recently saw each state burning through tens of millions of dollars in subsides to pull existing businesses across the border. Officials on both sides came to see the contest as expensive and wasteful, and in 2019, Kelly, a Democrat, and Missouri Gov. Mike Parson, a Republican, signed a truce.\n\nKansas City, Missouri Mayor Quinton Lucas told reporters that Kansas' bid for the Chiefs and Royals restarted that economic \"border war.\"\n\n\"I do believe long-term that we're one place and it's better when we work together,\" he said during a news conference.\n\nBut Kelly doesn't agree that the states' truce has been violated, telling reporters this week that before the agreement, \"We never discussed the teams.\"\n\nKansas lawmakers tapped fears about the future\n\nKansas lawmakers acted after voters on the Missouri side refused in April to extend a local sales tax for keeping up the complex with the teams' side-by-side stadiums. Many Kansas lawmakers worried that if they didn't act, the teams might move out of the area altogether -- mentioning Salt Lake City, San Antonio and Nashville.\n\nSeveral economists who've studied professional sports were dubious that moving would make financial sense for either team -- especially the Chiefs, who have a rabid fan base that could be hard to build quickly elsewhere. In addition, after pro football's Rams moved nearly a decade ago from St. Louis to Los Angeles, the team's owner and the National Football League paid $790 million to settle a lawsuit filed by St. Louis interests.\n\nBut Kansas lawmakers noted that the Royals' major-league predecessor, the Athletics, moved to Oakland, California, in 1968 and now plan to relocate to Las Vegas. Kansas City lost major-league professional teams to other cities in the 1970s and 1980s, and the Chiefs came to Kansas City in 1963 after starting as the Dallas Texans four years earlier.\n\n\"The state of Missouri is known for losing professional teams,\" Kansas state Rep. Sean Tarwater, a Kansas City-area Republican, who helped lead the push for the stadium bill.\n\nKansas officials expect Missouri to respond\n\nMissouri officials have pledged to do what it takes to keep the Chiefs and Royals in their state but have not outlined specific proposals. Lucas saw the April vote as a sign that area residents wanted officials to discuss options other than extending the sales tax.\n\nLike their counterparts in Kansas, Missouri lawmakers have finished their annual regular session, but they are set to meet again Sept. 11 to consider vetoes by Parson.\n\nSupporters of Kansas' bid for the teams said it could spur an aggressive response from Missouri -- and added that if the teams get offers they like and opt to stay there, at least they're still in the Kansas City area.\n\nLucas said the teams now have \"exceptional leverage.\"\n\nKansas and Missouri describe the timeline differently\n\nThe lease on the complex with the Chiefs' and Royals' existing stadiums runs through January 2031, but the teams have said they must plan renovations or new stadiums years in advance for them to be ready on time. Both suggested that even seven years out, time for a decision is short.\n\nBackers of the Kansas bid said such comments justified acting Tuesday, during a one-day special session that Kelly called to consider tax cuts after lawmakers adjourned their regular annual session May 1. Some critics argued that legislators should have waited until their regular 2025 session starts in January so a plan could be properly vetted.\n\nBut Parson and Lucas have said the contest for the teams is only in its \"first quarter,\" using a football metaphor.\n\n___\n\nAssociated Press writers Summer Ballentine, in Columbia, Missouri, and Jim Salter, in O'Fallon, Missouri, also contributed

(AP) -- Kansas is making a serious run at becoming the new home for the reigning Super Bowl champions with legislators approving a plan Tuesday for luring both the Chiefs and Major League Baseball's Kansas City Royals away from Missouri.\n\nBipartisan legislative supermajorities OKed the measure to authorize state bonds to help finance new stadiums and practice facilities for both teams on the Kansas side of the metropolitan area of 2.3 million residents, which is split by the border with Missouri. Three Super Bowl victories in five years -- and player Travis Kelce's romance with pop icon Taylor Swift -- have made the Chiefs perhaps the area's most celebrated civic asset.\n\nThe plan from the Republican-controlled Legislature goes next to Democratic Gov. Laura Kelly. While she stopped short of promising to sign it, she said in a statement that \"Kansas now has the opportunity to become a professional sports powerhouse.\"\n\nBoth the Chiefs and the Royals said they look forward to considering Kansas options. The lease on the Missouri complex with their side-by-side stadiums runs through January 2031, but both have said they already should have been planning for the future.\n\n\"We're excited about what happened here today,\" Korb Maxwell, an attorney for the Chiefs who lives on the Kansas side, said at the Statehouse after the bill cleared the Legislature. \"This is incredibly real.\"\n\nThe approval capped a two-month push to capitalize on the refusal in April by voters on the Missouri side to continue a local sales tax used to finance the upkeep of the teams' stadiums.\n\nBackers of the plan brushed aside decades of research by economists concluding that government subsidies for professional sports stadiums are not worth the cost. They also overcame criticism that lawmakers were moving too quickly.\n\nA spokeswoman for Missouri Gov. Mike Parson did not immediately respond to an email message seeking comment. But in Kansas City, Missouri, Mayor Quinton Lucas promised to \"lay out a good offer\" to keep both teams in town.\n\n\"Today was largely, in my opinion, about leverage,\" Lucas said. \"And the teams are in an exceptional leverage position.\"\n\nSome Kansas officials reached the same conclusion.\n\n\"I think the Chiefs and the Royals are using us,\" said state Rep. Susan Ruiz, a Kansas City-area Democrat.\n\nThe votes on the Kansas stadium-financing plan were 84-38 in the state House and 27-8 in the Senate. Lawmakers from across the state -- even western Kansas, far from any new stadium -- supported the measure.\n\nIt would allow state bonds to cover up to 70% of each new stadium, paying them off over 30 years with revenues from sports betting, state lottery ticket sales and new sales and alcohol taxes collected from shopping and entertainment districts around the new stadiums.\n\nHouse Commerce Committee Chair Sean Tarwater, a Kansas City-area Republican, said the Chiefs still are likely to spend $500 million to $700 million in private funds on a new stadium.\n\n\"There are no blank checks,\" Tarwater told GOP colleagues during a briefing.\n\nLegislators debated the plan during a one-day special session called by Kelly to have them consider reducing taxes after she vetoed three tax-cutting plans before legislators adjourned their regular annual session May 1.\n\nRepublican leaders had promised that the stadium proposal wouldn't come up until the Legislature first approved a plan to cut income and property taxes by a total of $1.23 billion over the next three years. Many lawmakers argued that voters would be angry if the state helped finance new stadiums without cutting taxes.\n\nWith the tax bill passed, the stadium plan gained support even from lawmakers who saw it as a handout for wealthy team owners. Some said failing to act risked pushing the teams to leave the Kansas City area, and a few said they had wanted the Chiefs in Kansas since childhood.\n\n\"It is amazing to me the speed with which we can solve problems when they're oriented around wealth, when they're oriented around business,\" said state Rep. Jason Probst, a Democrat from central Kansas.\n\nYet Probst voted for the bill.\n\n\"This is the system that we're stuck in, so if we choose to opt out of that system, we will lose every time,\" he said.\n\nEconomists who study pro sports teams have concluded in dozens of studies that a new stadium and shopping-and-entertainment area merely takes existing economic activity away from elsewhere in a community, resulting in little or no net gain.\n\n\"It could still help Kansas and maybe hurt Missouri by the same amount,\" said Andrew Zimbalist, an economics professor at Smith college in central Massachusetts who has written multiple books about sports. \"It's a zero-sum game.\"\n\nA skeptical state Sen. Molly Baumgardner, a Kansas City-area Republican, used a Christmas Eve metaphor to characterize supporters' excitement before she voted no.\n\n\"There are visions of sugar plums,\" Baumgardner said.\n\nMore from this section\n\nLatinx Festival on L.

Kansas plans to cover 70% of the new stadium's costs, aiming to attract major professional sports teams. The Chiefs and Royals are set to relocate to Kansas after Missouri residents reject funding proposals.\n\nLawmakers in the state of Kansas ruled in favor of a plan to fund a new stadium for the Kansas City Chiefs, thereby luring them away from Missouri.\n\nThe decision to sanction state bonds was authorized as bipartisan legislative supermajorities gave their consent. The bill, which was passed on Tuesday, was sent to Governor Laura Kelly.\n\nAccording to AP News, Kelly hasn't committed to signing it yet, but she didn't fail to appreciate the work put into the stadium-financing bill:\n\nKansas now has the opportunity to become a professional sports powerhouse. We're excited about what happened here today; this is incredibly real. In my opinion, today was largely about leverage. The teams are in an exceptional leverage position, but it's important to remember that there are no blank checks.\n\nThe bill would mean that Kansas would cover as much as 70% of a new stadium to house the Chiefs and Major League Baseball side, the Kansas City Royals. This percentage is far greater than what Las Vegas offered the Raiders under similar circumstances.\n\nThe Kansas lawmakers anticipate revenue from sports betting, state lottery ticket sales, and new sales and alcohol taxes collected from shopping and entertainment districts around the new stadiums.\n\nRelated NFL Trade Rumors: Kansas City Chiefs Trade Targets and Candidates\n\nThe reigning Super Bowl champions could have some additional offseason moves in store.\n\nChiefs Always Wanted in Kansas The Chiefs coming to Kansas is the dream of many\n\nArrowhead and Kauffman stadiums, belonging to the Chiefs and Royals respectively, have been the major stadiums in Kansas City, Missouri for quite some time, with Arrowhead debuting in 1972 and Kauffman opening up for business a year later, in 1973.\n\nHowever, the decision reached by the Kansas legislators is about to bring both teams to the Kansas side of the metropolitan area. Unsurprisingly, the Chiefs and the Royals seem like they're embracing the decision. Korb Maxwell, an attorney for the Chiefs, expressed his excitement when the bill passed:\n\nWe're excited about what happened here today. This is incredibly real.\n\nDespite the large contributions proposed to cover the new stadium's finances, the Chiefs are still likely to commit up to $700 million in private funds to the project. This was made clear by House Commerce Committee chair Sean Tarwater, a Kansas City-area Republican.\n\nThe push to pass the bill was fueled by Missouri side residents' refusal to continue funding the stadium of professional teams.\n\nThe people of Jackson County, Missouri, decisively rejected a sales tax proposal to finance a new downtown ballpark and extensive upgrades to Arrowhead Stadium. They deemed government subsidies for professional sports an unworthy endeavor.\n\nFollowing the clearing of the bill, the mayor of Kansas, Missouri, Quinton Lucas, didn't have much to say, only promising to \"lay out a good offer\" to keep the pro teams in Missouri. Many lawmakers embraced the decision to finance a new stadium for the Chiefs in Kansas. This was reflected in the vote margin, as the votes were 84-38 in the State House and 27-8 in the Senate.\n\nSurprisingly, even lawmakers from Western Kansas were in support of the Kansas stadium-financing plan. For many, it is a smart business idea that will favor wealthy team owners. State Rep. Jason Probst, a Democrat from Central Kansas, having voted for the bill, said:\n\nIt is amazing to me the speed with which we can solve problems when they're oriented around wealth, when they're oriented around business. This is the system that we're stuck in, so if we choose to opt out of that system, we will lose every time.\n\nThe Chiefs are one of the most promising franchises in the sport with a growing fanbase -- extra thanks to Travis Kelce's relationship with Taylor Swift. However, economists specializing in pro sports don't expect the passed bill to create much economic net change.\n\nAndrew Zimbalist, an economics professor at Smith College, called it a \"zero-sum game\".

(AP) -- Kansas is making a serious run at becoming the new home for the reigning Super Bowl champions with legislators approving a plan Tuesday for luring both the Chiefs and Major League Baseball's Kansas City Royals away from Missouri.\n\nBipartisan legislative supermajorities OKed the measure to authorize state bonds to help finance new stadiums and practice facilities for both teams on the Kansas side of the metropolitan area of 2.3 million residents, which is split by the border with Missouri. Three Super Bowl victories in five years -- and player Travis Kelce's romance with pop icon Taylor Swift -- have made the Chiefs perhaps the area's most celebrated civic asset.\n\nThe plan from the Republican-controlled Legislature goes next to Democratic Gov. Laura Kelly. While she stopped short of promising to sign it, she said in a statement that \"Kansas now has the opportunity to become a professional sports powerhouse.\"\n\nBoth the Chiefs and the Royals said they look forward to considering Kansas options. The lease on the Missouri complex with their side-by-side stadiums runs through January 2031, but both have said they already should have been planning for the future.\n\n\"We're excited about what happened here today,\" Korb Maxwell, an attorney for the Chiefs who lives on the Kansas side, said at the Statehouse after the bill cleared the Legislature. \"This is incredibly real.\"\n\nThe approval capped a two-month push to capitalize on the refusal in April by voters on the Missouri side to continue a local sales tax used to finance the upkeep of the teams' stadiums.\n\nBackers of the plan brushed aside decades of research by economists concluding that government subsidies for professional sports stadiums are not worth the cost. They also overcame criticism that lawmakers were moving too quickly.\n\nA spokeswoman for Missouri Gov. Mike Parson did not immediately respond to an email message seeking comment. But in Kansas City, Missouri, Mayor Quinton Lucas promised to \"lay out a good offer\" to keep both teams in town.\n\n\"Today was largely, in my opinion, about leverage,\" Lucas said. \"And the teams are in an exceptional leverage position.\"\n\nSome Kansas officials reached the same conclusion.\n\n\"I think the Chiefs and the Royals are using us,\" said state Rep. Susan Ruiz, a Kansas City-area Democrat.\n\nThe votes on the Kansas stadium-financing plan were 84-38 in the state House and 27-8 in the Senate. Lawmakers from across the state -- even western Kansas, far from any new stadium -- supported the measure.\n\nIt would allow state bonds to cover up to 70% of each new stadium, paying them off over 30 years with revenues from sports betting, state lottery ticket sales and new sales and alcohol taxes collected from shopping and entertainment districts around the new stadiums.\n\nHouse Commerce Committee Chair Sean Tarwater, a Kansas City-area Republican, said the Chiefs still are likely to spend $500 million to $700 million in private funds on a new stadium.\n\n\"There are no blank checks,\" Tarwater told GOP colleagues during a briefing.\n\nLegislators debated the plan during a one-day special session called by Kelly to have them consider reducing taxes after she vetoed three tax-cutting plans before legislators adjourned their regular annual session May 1.\n\nRepublican leaders had promised that the stadium proposal wouldn't come up until the Legislature first approved a plan to cut income and property taxes by a total of $1.23 billion over the next three years. Many lawmakers argued that voters would be angry if the state helped finance new stadiums without cutting taxes.\n\nWith the tax bill passed, the stadium plan gained support even from lawmakers who saw it as a handout for wealthy team owners. Some said failing to act risked pushing the teams to leave the Kansas City area, and a few said they had wanted the Chiefs in Kansas since childhood.\n\n\"It is amazing to me the speed with which we can solve problems when they're oriented around wealth, when they're oriented around business,\" said state Rep. Jason Probst, a Democrat from central Kansas.\n\nYet Probst voted for the bill.\n\n\"This is the system that we're stuck in, so if we choose to opt out of that system, we will lose every time,\" he said.\n\nEconomists who study pro sports teams have concluded in dozens of studies that a new stadium and shopping-and-entertainment area merely takes existing economic activity away from elsewhere in a community, resulting in little or no net gain.\n\n\"It could still help Kansas and maybe hurt Missouri by the same amount,\" said Andrew Zimbalist, an economics professor at Smith college in central Massachusetts who has written multiple books about sports. \"It's a zero-sum game.\"\n\nA skeptical state Sen. Molly Baumgardner, a Kansas City-area Republican, used a Christmas Eve metaphor to characterize supporters' excitement before she voted no.\n\n\"There are visions of sugar plums,\" Baumgardner said.",

It goes next to Gov. Laura Kelly.\n\nHere are a few things to know about the two states' contest for the teams.\n\nKansas is poised to make offers\n\nWhile Kelly has not formally pledged to sign the stadium-financing bill, she issued a positive statement when it passed Tuesday, saying it could make Kansas \"a professional sports powerhouse.\" If she signs it, as many lawmakers expect, it would take effect July 1.\n\nThe state's secretary of commerce, Lt. Gov. David Toland, would negotiate with one or both teams on a plan for a new stadium. Kelly and eight top legislative leaders would have to approve each deal with a vote in a public meeting.\n\nA deal would draw the boundaries of a district around a stadium and possibly another around a separate practice facility, and new state sales and alcohol tax revenues generated by shops, restaurants, bars and hotels within that district would pay off the bonds over 30 years.\n\nThe city and county could pledge tax revenues as well but are not required to do so, and the state also could use revenues from sports betting and state lottery ticket sales to back bonds as well.\n\nThe bonds could cover up to 70% of the costs of the new stadiums, though supporters of the plan don't expect that, anticipating that two stadiums together could cost $4 billion.\n\nThere is talk of a renewed economic 'border war'\n\nThe Kansas-Missouri border splits the 2.3 million-resident Kansas City area, and there's both Kansas City, Missouri, and Kansas City, Kansas. Much of the border is the median of State Line Road, and about 60% of the area's residents live on the Missouri side.\n\nA feud between the two states has existed for generations and most recently saw each state burning through tens of millions of dollars in subsides to pull existing businesses across the border. Officials on both sides came to see the contest as expensive and wasteful, and in 2019, Kelly, a Democrat, and Missouri Gov. Mike Parson, a Republican, signed a truce.\n\nKansas City, Missouri Mayor Quinton Lucas told reporters that Kansas' bid for the Chiefs and Royals restarted that economic \"border war.\"\n\n\"I do believe long-term that we're one place and it's better when we work together,\" he said during a news conference.\n\nBut Kelly doesn't agree that the states' truce has been violated, telling reporters this week that before the agreement, \"We never discussed the teams.\"\n\nKansas lawmakers tapped fears about the future\n\nKansas lawmakers acted after voters on the Missouri side refused in April to extend a local sales tax for keeping up the complex with the teams' side-by-side stadiums. Many Kansas lawmakers worried that if they didn't act, the teams might move out of the area altogether -- mentioning Salt Lake City, San Antonio and Nashville.\n\nSeveral economists who've studied professional sports were dubious that moving would make financial sense for either team -- especially the Chiefs, who have a rabid fan base that could be hard to build quickly elsewhere. In addition, after pro football's Rams moved nearly a decade ago from St. Louis to Los Angeles, the team's owner and the National Football League paid $790 million to settle a lawsuit filed by St. Louis interests.\n\nBut Kansas lawmakers noted that the Royals' major-league predecessor, the Athletics, moved to Oakland, California, in 1968 and now plan to relocate to Las Vegas. Kansas City lost major-league professional teams to other cities in the 1970s and 1980s, and the Chiefs came to Kansas City in 1963 after starting as the Dallas Texans four years earlier.\n\n\"The state of Missouri is known for losing professional teams,\" Kansas state Rep. Sean Tarwater, a Kansas City-area Republican, who helped lead the push for the stadium bill.\n\nKansas officials expect Missouri to respond\n\nMissouri officials have pledged to do what it takes to keep the Chiefs and Royals in their state but have not outlined specific proposals. Lucas saw the April vote as a sign that area residents wanted officials to discuss options other than extending the sales tax.\n\nLike their counterparts in Kansas, Missouri lawmakers have finished their annual regular session, but they are set to meet again Sept. 11 to consider vetoes by Parson.\n\nSupporters of Kansas' bid for the teams said it could spur an aggressive response from Missouri -- and added that if the teams get offers they like and opt to stay there, at least they're still in the Kansas City area.\n\nLucas said the teams now have \"exceptional leverage.\"\n\nKansas and Missouri describe the timeline differently\n\nBackers of the Kansas bid said such comments justified acting Tuesday, during a one-day special session that Kelly called to consider tax cuts after lawmakers adjourned their regular annual session May 1. Some critics argued that legislators should have waited until their regular 2025 session starts in January so a plan could be properly vetted.\n\nBut Parson and Lucas have said the contest for the teams is only in its \"first quarter,\" using a football metaphor.\n\n___\n\nAssociated Press writers Summer Ballentine, in Columbia, Missouri, and Jim Salter, in O'Fallon, Missouri, also contributed

Under the legislation, the teams could receive more than $750 million to help finance stadium projects.\n\nThe informational hearing came ahead of a special legislative session that starts Tuesday. Lawmakers can't take action on the bill until the formal start of the special session.\n\nThe legislation would enhance the state's existing Sales Tax and Revenue (STAR) Bond program to provide up to 75% of the project's costs by issuing bonds that would be repaid with the increased sales state tax collections at the project site. Other projects can use STAR Bonds to finance up to 50% of a project.\n\nThe bill requires a minimum $1 billion capital investment and limits the eligibility to National Football League or Major League Baseball teams currently located near Kansas. The financing mechanism could be used for both stadiums and training facilities.\n\nDebt on a stadium constructed under the expansion wouldn't have to be repaid for 30 years instead of the normal 20.\n\nThe project could also receive a boost from liquor taxes generated in the STAR Bond district and revenues from a fund Kansas created when it legalized sports betting.\n\nGov. Laura Kelly, who has championed enormous economic development projects in Kansas, didn't commit to supporting the legislation on Monday.\n\n\"I'm impressed by the full-court press that has been made to get these teams to consider moving across the river,\" she told reporters. \"It's not something I'm going to invest a lot of energy in. I think this is something for the legislature to work through.\"\n\nKelly's chief of staff, Will Lawrence, told the joint committee the governor's office had no concerns with the current version of the bill that would keep her from signing it.\n\nSTAR Bonds have been criticized by some legislators as ineffective, and an audit found that less than one-quarter of the attractions funded through the program met the state's goal of increasing tourism. There may be some cases, the audit says, where certain projects kept Kansans spending money in Kansas rather than going to Missouri.\n\n\"But we think it's more often that local visitors simply move existing economic activity from one part of Kansas to another,\" the audit says.\n\nKansas lawmakers launched an effort to lure the Chiefs or Royals -- or both -- after Jackson County, Missouri, voters in April rejected a proposed extension of a 3/8-cent sales tax to help finance a new stadium for the Royals and upgrades at Arrowhead Stadium.\n\nMaxwell said the organization had been asked why the legislation needed to be passed in special session rather than when lawmakers reconvene for their normal session in January.\n\nBecause with only a few years left in the Chiefs' lease at Arrowhead, \"time is of the essence,\" he said.\n\n\"The time is now,\" Maxwell said. \"Missouri spoke, Jackson County spoke. They had their opportunity, but now there's a moment for Kansas to step up.\"\n\nThe effort to reauthorize the sales tax in Missouri was driven primarily by the Royals, whose executives unveiled plans to move to the Crossroads Arts District in downtown Kansas City in February -- less than two months before the vote. It failed with 58% of voters rejecting the proposal.\n\nEarlier this month, Scoop and Score Inc. launched to advocate for moving Chiefs -- the reigning Super Bowl champions -- to Kansas. The organization's website implores visitors to sign a petition to \"tell legislators to keep the Chiefs in KC!\"\n\nThe organization has hired 30 lobbyists, including Murray. The Royals have eight lobbyists, and the Chiefs employ former Kansas House Speaker Ron Ryckman Jr. and his former aide, Paje Resner, as lobbyists.\n\nRyckman said Kansas City Chiefs owner Clark Hunt could be open to moving the team outside of the Kansas City region.\n\n\"We're aware of numerous cities that would love to be the home of the Chiefs or the Royals,\" Ryckman said.\n\nMurray urged lawmakers to support the legislation, arguing it has \"guardrails, guardrails guardrails\" to keep the state and local governments from being on the hook for the bonds.\n\nWhile an attorney for the Chiefs acknowledged the franchise hasn't come up with a design or plan for a stadium in Kansas, Murray urged lawmakers to move forward with creating a program. Vetting the details, he said, will be up to the Kansas Department of Commerce with final approval by the Legislative Coordinating Council, an eight-member committee of House and Senate lawmakers that can adopt legislation when the Legislature is not in session.\n\nBut a draft of the bill says any agreement between the state and a team would be confidential until after it has been executed.\n\nThe bill was panned by libertarian groups as a handout for corporations that would do little to increase economic activity in Kansas. Dave Trabert, CEO of the Kansas Policy Institute, told the committee there was no way to verify the claims that the stadiums would boost the economy.\n\n\"We asked Scoop and Score to provide their math. 'Show us how you arrived at a billion dollars of economic activity,'' Trabert said. \"Nothing was forthcoming.\"\n\nIn an interview, Trabert called the proposal \"absurd.\"\n\n\"This isn't about economic development,\" he said. \"It's about politics. It's so people can say, 'Look what I did. Vote for me.'\u2009\"", "source": {"uri": "ksal.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "NewsRadio 1150 KSAL"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special_session", "type":

(AP) -- Kansas legislators cleared the way Tuesday for a debate on trying to lure the Kansas City Chiefs from Missouri by approving broad tax cuts that many lawmakers said they needed to see before considering a plan to help the Super Bowl champions finance a new stadium.\n\nThe Legislature took up the stadium proposal during a special session that convened Tuesday amid heavy lobbying for the plan. The measure would allow the state to issue bonds to help the Chiefs and Major League Baseball's Kansas City Royals finance new stadiums on the Kansas side of their metropolitan area, which is split by the border with Missouri.\n\nBut top Republicans in the GOP-controlled Legislature promised that the stadium proposal wouldn't be debated until the Legislature approved a plan that would cut income and property taxes by a total of $1.23 billion over the next three years. Many lawmakers argued that voters would be angry if the state helped finance new stadiums without cutting taxes.\n\n\"We definitely need to demonstrate that we're getting relief to our citizens,\" said Senate President Ty Masterson, a Wichita-area Republican who backed the stadium-financing plan.\n\nDemocratic Gov. Laura Kelly called the special session to have lawmakers consider reducing taxes after she vetoed three tax-cutting plans before legislators adjourned their regular annual session May 1. The plan lawmakers approved was a compromise between her and Republican leaders.\n\nLegislators made no changes in the plan before passing it, 34-4 in the Senate and 121-2 in the House. Kelly pledged to sign the measure into law.\n\nOnce legislators convened the special session, Kelly couldn't control what they considered, and that created an opening to consider the stadium-financing plan. That measure would use revenues from sports betting, the state lottery and new taxes raised from the area around each new stadium to pay off the state's bonds over 30 years.\n\nThe first version of the stadium-financing plan emerged in late April, but lawmakers didn't vote on it before adjourning. It would have allowed state bonds to finance all stadium construction costs, but the version to be considered by lawmakers Tuesday would cap the amount at 70% and require legislative leaders and the governor to sign off on any bonding plan.\n\nHouse Commerce Committee Chair Sean Tarwater, a Kansas City-area Republican, said the Chiefs are likely to spend between $500 million and $700 million in private funds on a new stadium.\n\n\"There are no blank checks,\" Tarwater told GOP colleagues during a briefing on the plan before the House began debating it.\n\nA new nonprofit group, Scoop and Score, formed last month to push for bringing the Chiefs to Kansas, and that group and the Royals together hired more than 30 lobbyists for the special session. But the national free-market, small-government group Americans for Prosperity and the Kansas Policy Institute, a free-market think tank, oppose the measure, and both have been influential with conservative Republicans.\n\nFree-market conservatives have long opposed state and local subsidies for specific businesses or projects. And economists who've studied pro sports teams have concluded in dozens of studies over decades that subsidizing their stadiums isn't worth the cost.\n\n\"Most of the money that gets spent on the Chiefs is money that would otherwise be spent on other entertainment projects,\" said Andrew Zimbalist, an economics professor at Smith College in central Massachusetts who has written multiple books about sports.\n\nKansas legislators consider the Chiefs and Royals in play because in April, voters on the Missouri side of the metro area refused to continue a local sales tax for the upkeep of the complex with their side-by-side stadiums. Missouri officials have said they'll do whatever it takes to keep the teams but haven't outlined any proposals.\n\nThe two teams' lease on their stadium complex runs through January 2031, but Korb Maxwell, an attorney for the Chiefs who lives on the Kansas side, said renovations on the team's Arrowhead Stadium should be planned seven or eight years in advance.\n\n\"There is an urgency to this,\" added David Frantz, the Royals' general counsel.\n\nSupporters of the stadium plan argued that economists' past research doesn't apply to the Chiefs and Royals. They said the bonds will be paid off with tax revenues that aren't being generated now and would never be without the stadiums or the development around them. Masterson said it's wrong to call the bonds a subsidy.\n\nAnd Maxwell said: \"For a town to be major league, they need major league teams.\"\n\nBut economists who've studied pro sports said similar arguments have been a staple of past debates over paying for new stadiums. Development around a new stadium lessens development elsewhere, where the tax dollars generated would go to fund services or schools, they said.\n\n\"It could still help Kansas and maybe hurt Missouri by the same amount,\" Zimbalist said. \"It's a zero-sum game.\"", "source": {"uri": "hosted.ap.org", "dataType": "news", "title": "Associated Press"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

Things to know about Kansas wooing the Chiefs", "body": "The Kansas Legislature has approved a measure to allow the state to issue bonds to help the Super Bowl Champion Chiefs and Major League Baseball's Royals pay for new stadiums in Kansas. It goes next to Gov. Laura Kelly.\n\nHere are a few things to know about the two states' contest for the teams.\n\nWhile Kelly has not formally pledged to sign the stadium-financing bill, she issued a positive statement when it passed Tuesday, saying it could make Kansas \"a professional sports powerhouse.\" If she signs it, as many lawmakers expect, it would take effect July 1.\n\nThe state's secretary of commerce, Lt. Gov. David Toland, would negotiate with one or both teams on a plan for a new stadium. Kelly and eight top legislative leaders would have to approve each deal with a vote in a public meeting.\n\nA deal would draw the boundaries of a district around a stadium and possibly another around a separate practice facility, and new state sales and alcohol tax revenues generated by shops, restaurants, bars and hotels within that district would pay off the bonds over 30 years.\n\nThe city and county could pledge tax revenues as well but are not required to do so, and the state also could use revenues from sports betting and state lottery ticket sales to back bonds as well.\n\nThe bonds could cover up to 70% of the costs of the new stadiums, though supporters of the plan don't expect that, anticipating that two stadiums together could cost $4 billion.\n\nThe Kansas-Missouri border splits the 2.3 million-resident Kansas City area, and there's both Kansas City, Missouri, and Kansas City, Kansas. Much of the border is the median of State Line Road, and about 60% of the area's residents live on the Missouri side.\n\nA feud between the two states has existed for generations and most recently saw each state burning through tens of millions of dollars in subsides to pull existing businesses across the border. Officials on both sides came to see the contest as expensive and wasteful, and in 2019, Kelly, a Democrat, and Missouri Gov. Mike Parson, a Republican, signed a truce.\n\nKansas City, Missouri Mayor Quinton Lucas told reporters that Kansas' bid for the Chiefs and Royals restarted that economic \"border war.\"\n\n\"I do believe long-term that we're one place and it's better when we work together,\" he said during a news conference.\n\nBut Kelly doesn't agree that the states' truce has been violated, telling reporters this week that before the agreement, \"We never discussed the teams.\"\n\nKansas lawmakers acted after voters on the Missouri side refused in April to extend a local sales tax for keeping up the complex with the teams' side-by-side stadiums. Many Kansas lawmakers worried that if they didn't act, the teams might move out of the area altogether -- mentioning Salt Lake City, San Antonio and Nashville.\n\nSeveral economists who've studied professional sports were dubious that moving would make financial sense for either team -- especially the Chiefs, who have a rabid fan base that could be hard to build quickly elsewhere. In addition, after pro football's Rams moved nearly a decade ago from St. Louis to Los Angeles, the team's owner and the National Football League paid $790 million to settle a lawsuit filed by St. Louis interests.\n\nBut Kansas lawmakers noted that the Royals' major-league predecessor, the Athletics, moved to Oakland, California, in 1968 and now plan to relocate to Las Vegas. Kansas City lost major-league professional teams to other cities in the 1970s and 1980s, and the Chiefs came to Kansas City in 1963 after starting as the Dallas Texans four years earlier.\n\n\"The state of Missouri is known for losing professional teams,\" Kansas state Rep. Sean Tarwater, a Kansas City-area Republican, who helped lead the push for the stadium bill.\n\nMissouri officials have pledged to do what it takes to keep the Chiefs and Royals in their state but have not outlined specific proposals. Lucas saw the April vote as a sign that area residents wanted officials to discuss options other than extending the sales tax.\n\nLike their counterparts in Kansas, Missouri lawmakers have finished their annual regular session, but they are set to meet again Sept. 11 to consider vetoes by Parson.\n\nSupporters of Kansas' bid for the teams said it could spur an aggressive response from Missouri -- and added that if the teams get offers they like and opt to stay there, at least they're still in the Kansas City area.\n\nLucas said the teams now have \"exceptional leverage.\"\n\nThe lease on the complex with the Chiefs' and Royals' existing stadiums runs through January 2031, but the teams have said they must plan renovations or new stadiums years in advance for them to be ready on time. Both suggested that even seven years out, time for a decision is short.\n\nBackers of the Kansas bid said such comments justified acting Tuesday, during a one-day special session that Kelly called to consider tax cuts after lawmakers adjourned their regular annual session May 1. Some critics argued that legislators should have waited until their regular 2025 session starts in January so a plan could be properly vetted.\n\nBut Parson and Lucas have said the contest for the teams is only in its \"first quarter,\" using a football metaphor.\n\n___\n\nAssociated Press writers Summer Ballentine, in Columbia, Missouri, and Jim Salter, in O'Fallon, Missouri, also contributed

Kansas lawmakers passed legislation that would offer incentives if the Kansas City Chiefs relocate from Arrowhead to Kansas and build a new stadium (David Eulitt/Getty Images).\n\nState and local officials from Missouri denounced Kansas legislators' attempt to lure the Kansas City Chiefs and Royals across the state line, saying they would take steps to keep both teams.\n\nKansas City Mayor Quinton Lucas, in a statement on Tuesday, said the city and state would continue negotiations with the teams that Missouri and Kansas City have \"welcomed, funded and supported ... since the 1960s.\"\n\n\"We remain in the first quarter of the Kansas City stadium discussion,\" Lucas said.\n\nKansas lawmakers on Tuesday passed legislation meant to help finance new stadiums for the Kansas City Chiefs and Royals in an attempt to relocate one or both teams from Missouri. The legislation, an expansion of the state's existing Sales Tax and Revenue (STAR) Bond program, could yield hundreds of millions of dollars for each stadium.\n\nIt comes after Jackson County, Missouri, voters in April rejected the extension of a sales tax to help finance a new downtown Kansas City baseball stadium for the Royals and upgrades to the Chiefs' Arrowhead Stadium.\n\nKansas lawmakers who supported the STAR Bond legislation said it was necessary to keep the teams in the Kansas City area.\n\n\"We're in jeopardy of Kansas City losing those franchises,\" Kansas Sen. Jeff Pittman, a Leavenworth Democrat, said during debate on the bill Tuesday. \"Missouri has dropped the ball. We now have an opportunity to make an offer.\"\n\nAfter Kansas lawmakers' vote, Missouri legislators said they hoped and expected to see the state put forward a plan.\n\n\"It's a wakeup call to Missouri that there are other states that are willing to do whatever it takes to get the teams,\" Missouri House Majority Leader Jonathan Patterson, a Lee's Summit Republican, said in an interview Thursday.\n\nPatterson, who is in line to become speaker of the House next year, said he expected to see Missouri put together a plan after this summer's primary elections and before the Missouri General Assembly returns for its legislative session in January. He said it was possible legislators would be called back to Jefferson City for a special session but didn't think it was necessary.\n\nThe Kansas legislation would help finance up to 70% of a stadium project -- with a minimum $1 billion price tag and 30,000 seats -- by issuing bonds to be repaid with the state sales tax collected in the STAR Bond district. Liquor taxes from the district and funds from the state's legalization of sports betting also could be used to repay the bonds.\n\nThe offer remains in place for a year and is limited to National Football League or Major League Baseball teams in states adjacent to Kansas.\n\nKansas' attempt to poach the teams was seen by several Missouri lawmakers as a violation of a truce the two states reached five years ago to stop offering incentives to move businesses back and forth the state line in the Kansas City area.\n\nBut Kansas Gov. Laura Kelly, a Democrat, didn't see it that way.\n\n\"The border war was really focused on businesses like AMC Theatres, which went back and forth, back and forth,\" Kelly said. \"We never discussed teams.\"\n\nFor years, the two states engaged in an economic development \"border war,\" offering incentives to companies that jumped the state line, spending taxpayer funds while largely not creating any new jobs.\n\n\"Today's vote regrettably restarts the Missouri-Kansas incentive border war, creating leverage for the teams, but injecting even greater uncertainty into the regional stadium conversation,\" Lucas said Tuesday.\n\nIn a statement Tuesday, Jackson County, Missouri, Executive Frank White Jr. urged state and local governments to abide by the border war truce \"and refrain from engaging in a counterproductive stadium bidding war.\"\n\n\"We must focus on common sense over politics,\" White said. \"Our resources should be used wisely to improve the lives of our residents, not wasted on bidding wars that only serve to drain public funds and divide our region.\"\n\nWhite said in order to agree to subsidies for a stadium he expects \"a complete and transparent plan that offers tangible benefits to our taxpayers.\"\n\n\"My office remains open to conversations with the Royals, Chiefs, lawmakers, and other stakeholders, but any proposal must meet this standard and make sense for our community,\" he said.\n\nMissouri Sen. Denny Hoskins, a Warrensburg Republican, said the border war \"didn't benefit anyone\" and saw Kansas' push to relocate the teams as a violation.\n\nHe said he wanted to see the Missouri Department of Economic Development make an offer to keep the teams, but he didn't support the idea of lawmakers being called back to Jefferson City for a special session and didn't want a package that could put taxpayers on the hook.\n\n\"We want to keep the Kansas City Chiefs and KC Royals in the state of Missouri, but we can't saddle taxpayers with billions of dollars in debt to help finance stadiums,\" he said.\n\nHoskins, who is running in the GOP primary for secretary of state, said he thought the Kansas plan was based on lofty revenue expectations and that the stadiums wouldn't generate enough activity to pay off the bonds without additional assistance from Kansas taxpayers. He didn't want to see Missouri put forward a similar plan.\n\n\"Missouri taxpayers shouldn't be on the hook for financing stadiums for billion-dollar corporations and multimillion-dollar athletes,\" he said. \"It's hard enough being a Missourian right now just trying to keep your own money in your pocket, let alone financing stadiums for a billion-dollar industry.\"\n\nPatterson called the border war talk \"somewhat irrelevant.\"", "source": {"uri": "yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arrowhead_Stadium", "type":

Laura Kelly would allow Kansas to issue bonds to cover up to 70% of the costs of a new stadium in the state for the NFL team and another for Major League Baseball's Kansas City Royals.\n\nThe state would pay off its bonds over 30 years with revenues from sports betting, Kansas Lottery ticket sales and new sales and alcohol taxes collected from shopping and entertainment districts around the sites for the new stadiums.\n\nKelly has not said whether she will sign the bill. But her chief of staff told lawmakers Monday that she had seen nothing in the version that passed that would make her veto it.\n\nKansas legislators see the two teams as in play because in April, voters on the Missouri side of the Kansas City metropolitan area refused to extend a sales tax used to keep up the teams' existing stadiums, which sit side by side.\n\nTop Republicans in the GOP-controlled Legislature had promised that the stadium proposal wouldn't be debated until the Legislature approved a plan that would cut income and property taxes by a total of $1.23 billion US over the next three years. Many lawmakers argued that voters would be angry if the state helped finance new stadiums without cutting taxes.\n\n\"We definitely need to demonstrate that we're getting relief to our citizens,\" said Senate President Ty Masterson, a Wichita-area Republican who backed the stadium-financing plan.\n\nKelly called the special session to have lawmakers consider reducing taxes after she vetoed three tax-cutting plans before legislators adjourned their regular annual session May 1. The plan lawmakers approved was a compromise between her and Republican leaders.\n\nOnce legislators convened the special session, Kelly couldn't control what they considered, and that created an opening to consider the stadium-financing plan. That measure would use revenues from sports betting, the state lottery and new taxes raised from the area around each new stadium to pay off the state's bonds over 30 years.\n\nThe first version of the stadium-financing plan emerged in late April, but lawmakers didn't vote on it before adjourning. It would have allowed state bonds to finance all stadium construction costs, but the version passed by lawmakers Tuesday would cap the amount at 70% and require legislative leaders and the governor to sign off on any bonding plan.\n\nHouse Commerce Committee Chair Sean Tarwater, a Kansas City-area Republican, said the NFL team is likely to spend between $500 million and $700 million in private funds on a new stadium.\n\n\"There are no blank checks,\" Tarwater told GOP colleagues during a briefing on the plan before the House began debating it.\n\nA new nonprofit group, Scoop and Score, formed last month to push for bringing the NFL team to Kansas, and that group and the Royals together hired more than 30 lobbyists for the special session. But the national free-market, small-government group Americans for Prosperity and the Kansas Policy Institute, a free-market think tank, oppose the measure, and both have been influential with conservative Republicans.\n\nFree-market conservatives have long opposed state and local subsidies for specific businesses or projects. And economists who've studied pro sports teams have concluded in dozens of studies over decades that subsidizing their stadiums isn't worth the cost.\n\n\"Most of the money that gets spent on the NFL team is money that would otherwise be spent on other entertainment projects,\" said Andrew Zimbalist, an economics professor at Smith College in central Massachusetts who has written multiple books about sports.\n\nKansas legislators consider the NFL team and Royals in play because in April, voters on the Missouri side of the metro area refused to continue a local sales tax for the upkeep of the complex with their side-by-side stadiums. Missouri officials have said they'll do whatever it takes to keep the teams but haven't outlined any proposals.\n\nThe two teams' lease on their stadium complex runs through January 2031, but Korb Maxwell, an attorney for the NFL team who lives on the Kansas side, said renovations on the team's Arrowhead Stadium should be planned seven or eight years in advance.\n\n\"There is an urgency to this,\" added David Frantz, the Royals' general counsel.\n\nSupporters of the stadium plan argued that economists' past research doesn't apply to the NFL team and Royals. They said the bonds will be paid off with tax revenues that aren't being generated now and would never be without the stadiums or the development around them. Masterson said it's wrong to call the bonds a subsidy.\n\nAnd Maxwell said: \"For a town to be major league, they need major league teams.\"\n\nBut economists who've studied pro sports said similar arguments have been a staple of past debates over paying for new stadiums. Development around a new stadium lessens development elsewhere, where the tax dollars generated would go to fund services or schools, they said.\n\n\"It could still help Kansas and maybe hurt Missouri by the same amount,\" Zimbalist said. \"It's a zero-sum game.\"", "source": {"uri": "cbc.ca", "dataType": "news", "title": "CBC News"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

Laura Kelly, a Democrat, who said in a statement following the Senate vote that the effort to bring the teams to Kansas \"shows we're all-in on keeping our beloved teams in the Kansas City metro.\"\n\n\"Kansas now has the opportunity to become a professional sports powerhouse with the Chiefs and Royals potentially joining Sporting KC as major league attractions, all with robust, revenue-generating entertainment districts surrounding them providing new jobs, new visitors and new revenues that boost the Kansas economy,\" Kelly said.\n\nNeither team has promised to move to Kansas, though both actively lobbied for the legislation's passage. The Chiefs said in a statement that the team appreciated Kansas leaders reaching out for input on the legislation.\n\n\"We look forward to exploring the options this legislation may provide,\" the statement said.\n\nThe Royals said the team was grateful to the legislature for its vote.\n\n\"The Kansas City Royals look forward to additional conversations as we evaluate where we will play baseball in the future,\" the team said. \"We will always prioritize the best interests of our fans, associates and taxpayers in this process.\"\n\nState Rep. Sean Tarwater, a Republican from Stilwell, said during debate in the House that Missouri had a history of losing professional sports teams and implored fellow House members to pass the legislation.\n\n\"I ask you today, do you really want to put that type of an economic generation in the hands of the state of Missouri?\" Tarwater said just before the vote.\n\nPassage of the bill represents a monumental step in Kansas lawmakers' attempts to court the teams. Both teams have signaled a willingness to move from their current stadiums at the Truman Sports Complex in Kansas City, Missouri.\n\nWhile neither team has announced a proposed site for a Kansas stadium, legislators speculated it could land in Wyandotte County near the Sporting KC soccer stadium, NASCAR track and outlet shops.\n\n\"We have the history of building amazing projects that have brought in retail commerce, restaurants, hotels and have improved an area that was largely just a field and turned it into a tax-generating machine for our state,\" said Sen. J.R. Claeys, a Salina Republican.\n\nThe legislation, he said, would put Kansas in a \"very good position to keep the Kansas City Chiefs and the Kansas City Royals in the Kansas City metro area.\"\n\nThe bill, which was not voted on by any legislative committee, would expand the state's Sales Tax and Revenue (STAR) Bond program, which is meant to help finance tourism and entertainment districts to help pay for a professional football or baseball stadium of at least $1 billion.\n\nA developer building a stadium under the program would be eligible to finance up to 70% of the project cost by issuing bonds and repaying them with the increased sales tax collections from the stadium site. The expansion would have initially allowed up to 75% of project costs but was tweaked before introduction. Debt on a stadium constructed under the expansion wouldn't have to be repaid for 30 years instead of the normal 20.\n\nThe project could also receive a boost from liquor taxes generated in the STAR Bond district and revenues from a fund Kansas created when it legalized sports betting.\n\nDuring House debate, Rep. Paul Waggoner, a Hutchinson Republican, argued subsidized stadiums never generate the economic activity that they promise. He was alarmed by what he called \"minimal transparency\" in the deal-making process laid out in the legislation.\n\nThe bill says any agreement between the state and a team would be confidential until after it has been executed.\n\nWaggoner called the legislation \"bad public policy.\"\n\n\"This is not your mother's STAR Bonds,\" Waggoner said. \"This is a jacked up super-sized version of STAR Bonds.\"\n\nThe bill limits the eligibility to National Football League or Major League Baseball teams currently near Kansas. The financing mechanism could be used for both stadiums and training facilities.\n\nBoth teams have pressed lawmakers in recent weeks to pass the bill with representatives from the Royals hosting dinner for Democratic lawmakers at a steakhouse Monday night and the Chiefs throwing a lunchtime block party Tuesday steps from the Capitol.\n\nEarlier this month, a nonprofit called Scoop and Score Inc. launched to advocate for a Kansas stadium deal. The organization, which does not have to disclose its donors, hired 30 lobbyists to advocate for the STAR Bond expansion legislation.\n\nIn a statement, former Kansas House Speaker Ron Ryckman Jr., a lobbyist for Scoop and Score and the Chiefs, said the Legislature \"stepped up in a big way, paving the path to make sure the Chiefs stay right where they belong -- in Kansas City with their loyal fans.\"\n\n\"The votes show overwhelming bipartisan support because Kansas lawmakers know what the Chiefs mean to us and how big of an economic opportunity this is for Kansas,\" Ryckman said.\n\nSeveral lawmakers expressed skepticism about STAR Bonds or the deal in front of them but voted for it anyway.\n\nRep. Jason Probst, a Democrat from Hutchinson, said the idea disgusts him and lamented that the legislature does not move as swiftly to pass bills on issues including homelessness, hunger or childhood poverty. But he still voted for the bill.\n\n\"So I'm going to hold my nose and probably support this,\" he said, \"but not without protesting the fact that we get sent here to do things for people, and we never move with this sort of urgency or with this sort of passion or the energy that we have around this.\"\n\nIn a meeting of House Democrats before the vote, Probst said he thought the Chiefs were using Kansas to \"get Missouri worked up\" so the state would \"sweeten the pot\" and offer the team more incentives to stay put.\n\nProbst said he was bothered that the Chiefs were making an emotional appeal, invoking sports heroes, while being thin on details. Still, he said, it would be \"catastrophic\" if the Chiefs left the Kansas City metro area.\n\n\"I do not like this. It feels gross,\" Probst said. \"This whole show that's going on feels disgusting to me. And it's still the right thing to do. That's how I see it.\"\n\nRep. Stephanie Sawyer Clayton, an Overland Park Democrat, said during that meeting that she was struggling with the proposal \"because I don't like misogynistic dude bro culture,\" because the family that owns the Chiefs supported the anti-abortion constitutional amendment that Kansas voters rejected in 2022. She said she also doesn't like Ryckman, who is leading the lobbying efforts on behalf of the Chiefs.\n\nBut, she said, her decision to support the bill was cemented when she saw testimony from the governor's office that suggested the governor planned to sign the bill if passed.\n\nSawyer Clayton said it would \"warm the cockles of my cold, dead feminist heart\" to see Kelly get credit for moving the teams from Missouri \"and not the dude bros who have been working on this.\"\n\n\"That is why I'm a 'yes,'\" Sawyer Clayton said. \"I want a woman getting credit for sports things. So I'm doing it out of spite, frankly.\"\n\nAcross the rotunda, Sen. Molly Baumgardner, a Republican from Louisburg, argued STAR Bonds had generally not created anything new but rather subsidized development that likely would have occurred anyway.\n\n\"I understand the excitement behind the prospect,\" she said. \"It is like it's Christmas Eve and there's visions of sugar plums, only its royal blue and crimson and gold in this case.\"\n\nKansas Reflector's Sherman

(AP) -- Kansas legislators approved a bipartisan plan Tuesday aimed at luring the Kansas City Chiefs away from Missouri by helping to finance a new stadium for the Super Bowl champions.\n\nThe bill passed by the Republican-controlled Legislature and sent to Democratic Gov. Laura Kelly would allow Kansas to issue bonds to cover up to 70% of the costs of a new stadium in the state for the Chiefs and another for Major League Baseball's Kansas City Royals. The plan also encourages the teams to move their practice facilities to the Kansas side of the metropolitan area, which is split by the two states' border.\n\nKansas would pay off its bonds over 30 years with revenues from sports betting, Kansas Lottery ticket sales and new sales and alcohol taxes collected from shopping and entertainment districts around the sites for the new stadiums.\n\nInvestigator tracked Kim Gardner to health clinic as St. Louis prosecutor's office crashed New Channel 32?

St. Louis to pay homeless to clean streets and pick up trash Aveda to close its Galleria store in Richmond Heights\n\nKorb Maxell, an attorney for the Chiefs who lives on the Kansas side of the border, said the state's lawmakers were \"embracing the possibility of the Chiefs and the Royals\" and can now make a \"very compelling offer\" to the NFL team.\n\n\"We're excited about what happened here today,\" he said after the bill cleared the Legislature. \"This is incredibly real.\"\n\nThe votes were 84-38 in the House and 27-8 in the Senate. Kelly stopped short of saying she'll sign the stadium-financing bill, but in a statement, she praised the effort behind it.\n\n\"Kansas now has the opportunity to become a professional sports powerhouse,\" she said.\n\nKansas legislators see the two teams as in play because in April, voters on the Missouri side of the Kansas City metropolitan area refused to extend a sales tax used to keep up the teams' existing stadiums, which sit side by side.\n\nA spokeswoman for Missouri Gov. Mike Parson did not immediately return an email message seeking comment. But in Kansas City Missouri, Mayor Quinton Lucas promised to \"lay out a good offer\" to keep both teams from moving to Kansas.\n\nIn Kansas, top Republicans in the GOP-controlled Legislature had promised that the stadium proposal wouldn't be debated until the Legislature approved a plan that would cut income and property taxes by a total of $1.23 billion over the next three years. Many lawmakers argued that voters would be angry if the state helped finance new stadiums without cutting taxes.\n\n\"We definitely need to demonstrate that we're getting relief to our citizens,\" said Senate President Ty Masterson, a Wichita-area Republican who backed the stadium-financing plan.\n\nKelly called a special session to have lawmakers consider reducing taxes after she vetoed three tax-cutting plans before legislators adjourned their regular annual session May 1. Once legislators convened the special session, Kelly couldn't control what they considered, and that created an opening to consider the stadium-financing plan.\n\nThe first version of the plan emerged in late April, but lawmakers didn't vote on it before adjourning. It would have allowed state bonds to finance all stadium construction costs, but supporters later opted for the 70% cap to pick up votes, and the plan also would require legislative leaders and the governor to sign off on any bonding plan.\n\nHouse Commerce Committee Chair Sean Tarwater, a Kansas City-area Republican, said the Chiefs are likely to spend between $500 million and $700 million in private funds on a new stadium.\n\n\"There are no blank checks,\" Tarwater told GOP colleagues during a briefing on the plan before the House began debating it.\n\nA new nonprofit group, Scoop and Score, formed last month to push for bringing the Chiefs to Kansas, and that group and the Royals together hired more than 30 lobbyists for the special session. But the national free-market, small-government group Americans for Prosperity and the Kansas Policy Institute, a free-market think tank, oppose the measure, and both have been influential with conservative Republicans.\n\nFree-market conservatives have long opposed state and local subsidies for specific businesses or projects. And economists who've studied pro sports teams have concluded in dozens of studies over decades that subsidizing their stadiums isn't worth the cost.\n\n\"Most of the money that gets spent on the Chiefs is money that would otherwise be spent on other entertainment projects,\" said Andrew Zimbalist, an economics professor at Smith College in central Massachusetts who has written multiple books about sports.\n\nMissouri officials have said they'll do whatever it takes to keep the teams but haven't outlined any proposals.\n\n\"The story now is that today was largely in my opinion about leverage,\" Lucas said. \"And the teams are in an exceptional leverage position.\"\n\nThe two teams' lease on their stadium complex runs through January 2031, but Maxwell said renovations on the team's Arrowhead Stadium should be planned seven or eight years in advance.\n\n\"There is an urgency to this,\" added David Frantz, the Royals' general counsel.\n\nSupporters of the stadium plan argued that economists' past research doesn't apply to the Chiefs and Royals. They said the bonds will be paid off with tax revenues that aren't being generated now and would never be without the stadiums or the development around them. Masterson said it's wrong to call the bonds a subsidy.\n\nAnd Maxwell said: \"For a town to be major league, they need major league teams.\"\n\nBut economists who've studied pro sports said similar arguments have been a staple of past debates over paying for new stadiums. Development around a new stadium lessens development elsewhere, where the tax dollars generated would go to fund services or schools, they said.\n\n\"It could still help Kansas and maybe hurt Missouri by the same amount,\" Zimbalist said. \"It's a zero-sum game.\"\n\nCopyright 2024 The Associated Press.

This substantial amount, potentially totaling billions in bonds, underscores the state's determination to entice these Missouri-based teams.\n\nAs both teams currently hold leases at the Truman Sports Complex until the decade's end, ongoing deliberations persist on the future of sports facilities, notably with a special session of the Kansas Legislature underway and discussions unfolding on the Missouri side.\n\nLawmakers are set to deliberate on the plan during a special session commencing on Tuesday, with a hearing scheduled for Monday.\n\nAlthough subject to potential amendments, a draft of the proposed bill was already circulating within the Kansas Capitol on Monday, hinting at the intricate process underway.\n\nWill the Kansas City Chiefs and Royals stay in Missouri?\n\nThe question of whether the Royals and Chiefs will remain in Missouri or make a move to Kansas lingers, prompting speculation about various scenarios such as one team staying while the other relocates or both exploring options beyond the immediate metro area.\n\nDespite these uncertainties, officials on both sides of the state line share a common goal: ensuring that both teams stay within the greater metro area.\n\nMissouri boasts a rich sports landscape, serving as the home for the Chiefs and Royals in addition to Major League Baseball's St. Louis Cardinals, the National Hockey League's St. Louis Blues, and two minor-league baseball teams.\n\nMissouri with the income tax increase from professional athletes\n\nIn the current budget year starting from July 1, Missouri has recorded a notable increase in income taxes from professional athletes, reaching nearly $34 million, marking a 9% rise from the previous year's collection of $31 million, as reported by the state.\n\nNotably, during this budget year, which coincided with the Chiefs' third Super Bowl win in five years, taxes from football players surged by 39%, soaring from around $14 million to $19 million according to John Hanna of Associated Press.\n\nProfessional athletes and touring entertainers are subject to income taxes not only in their home states but also in other states where they perform, provided those states levy income taxes.\n\nIn Kansas, for instance, athletes are taxed a percentage of their income based on the number of games they play within the state.\n\nThe exact amount of revenue that Kansas could gain from Missouri's sports teams, such as the Chiefs, the Royals, or both, remains unclear. If Kansas lawmakers successfully attract these teams, the revenue impact on Kansas would depend on various factors such as attendance, ticket sales, merchandise purchases, and other economic activities associated with these teams' presence in the state.\n\nThe case for relocating to Kansas\n\nDemocratic Gov. Laura Kelly, who holds the authority to sign or veto any bill related to the teams' potential move, expressed her admiration for the comprehensive efforts aimed at persuading the teams to contemplate relocation.\n\nAccording to the plan, Kansas would utilize Sales Tax and Revenue (STAR) bonds to finance up to 75% of the project costs, exceeding the current legal limit of 50% for STAR bonds projects.\n\nProponents of the proposal highlight the success of previous STAR bonds projects such as the Kansas Speedway and Children's Mercy Park. The Kansas Speedway, in particular, played a pivotal role in catalyzing development in western Wyandotte County, transforming the vicinity near I-70 and I-435 into a thriving hub of commerce.\n\nAlthough much of the conversation regarding Kansas has revolved around the Chiefs, the Royals are now stepping into the spotlight for the Sunflower State, signaling their interest in investigating potential options. State records reveal that both the Royals and Chiefs have enlisted the services of lobbyists to advocate for their interests in 2024.", "source": {"uri": "clutchpoints.com", "dataType": "news",

The legislation, an expansion of the state's existing Sales Tax and Revenue (STAR) Bond program, could yield hundreds of millions of dollars for each stadium.\n\nIt comes after Jackson County, Missouri, voters in April rejected the extension of a sales tax to help finance a new downtown Kansas City baseball stadium for the Royals and upgrades to the Chiefs' Arrowhead Stadium.\n\nKansas lawmakers who supported the STAR Bond legislation said it was necessary to keep the teams in the Kansas City area.\n\n\"We're in jeopardy of Kansas City losing those franchises,\" Kansas Sen. Jeff Pittman, a Leavenworth Democrat, said during debate on the bill Tuesday. \"Missouri has dropped the ball. We now have an opportunity to make an offer.\"\n\nAfter Kansas lawmakers' vote, Missouri legislators said they hoped and expected to see the state put forward a plan.\n\n\"It's a wakeup call to Missouri that there are other states that are willing to do whatever it takes to get the teams,\" Missouri House Majority Leader Jonathan Patterson, a Lee's Summit Republican, said in an interview Thursday.\n\nPatterson, who is in line to become speaker of the House next year, said he expected to see Missouri put together a plan after this summer's primary elections and before the Missouri General Assembly returns for its legislative session in January. He said it was possible legislators would be called back to Jefferson City for a special session but didn't think it was necessary.\n\nThe Kansas legislation would help finance up to 70% of a stadium project -- with a minimum $1 billion price tag and 30,000 seats -- by issuing bonds to be repaid with the state sales tax collected in the STAR Bond district. Liquor taxes from the district and funds from the state's legalization of sports betting also could be used to repay the bonds.\n\nThe offer remains in place for a year and is limited to National Football League or Major League Baseball teams in states adjacent to Kansas.\n\nKansas' attempt to poach the teams was seen by several Missouri lawmakers as a violation of a truce the two states reached five years ago to stop offering incentives to move businesses back and forth the state line in the Kansas City area.\n\nBut Kansas Gov. Laura Kelly, a Democrat, didn't see it that way.\n\n\"The border war was really focused on businesses like AMC Theatres, which went back and forth, back and forth,\" Kelly said. \"We never discussed teams.\"\n\nFor years, the two states engaged in an economic development \"border war,\" offering incentives to companies that jumped the state line, spending taxpayer funds while largely not creating any new jobs.\n\n\"Today's vote regrettably restarts the Missouri-Kansas incentive border war, creating leverage for the teams, but injecting even greater uncertainty into the regional stadium conversation,\" Lucas said Tuesday.\n\nIn a statement Tuesday, Jackson County, Missouri, Executive Frank White Jr. urged state and local governments to abide by the border war truce \"and refrain from engaging in a counterproductive stadium bidding war.\"\n\n\"We must focus on common sense over politics,\" White said. \"Our resources should be used wisely to improve the lives of our residents, not wasted on bidding wars that only serve to drain public funds and divide our region.\"\n\nWhite said in order to agree to subsidies for a stadium he expects \"a complete and transparent plan that offers tangible benefits to our taxpayers.\"\n\n\"My office remains open to conversations with the Royals, Chiefs, lawmakers, and other stakeholders, but any proposal must meet this standard and make sense for our community,\" he said.\n\nMissouri Sen. Denny Hoskins, a Warrensburg Republican, said the border war \"didn't benefit anyone\" and saw Kansas' push to relocate the teams as a violation.\n\nHe said he wanted to see the Missouri Department of Economic Development make an offer to keep the teams, but he didn't support the idea of lawmakers being called back to Jefferson City for a special session and didn't want a package that could put taxpayers on the hook.\n\n\"We want to keep the Kansas City Chiefs and KC Royals in the state of Missouri, but we can't saddle taxpayers with billions of dollars in debt to help finance stadiums,\" he said.\n\nHoskins, who is running in the GOP primary for secretary of state, said he thought the Kansas plan was based on lofty revenue expectations and that the stadiums wouldn't generate enough activity to pay off the bonds without additional assistance from Kansas taxpayers. He didn't want to see Missouri put forward a similar plan.\n\n\"Missouri taxpayers shouldn't be on the hook for financing stadiums for billion-dollar corporations and multimillion-dollar athletes,\" he said. \"It's hard enough being a Missourian right now just trying to keep your own money in your pocket, let alone financing stadiums for a billion-dollar industry.\"\n\nPatterson called the border war talk \"somewhat irrelevant.\"\n\n\"It's obvious that Kansas is going to act,\" he said, \"and I think we should focus on acting ourselves and not crying about some sort of truce that may or may not have been agreed to regarding the teams.\"", "source": {"uri": "kcur.org", "dataType": "news", "title": "KCUR 89.3 - NPR in Kansas City.

Laura Kelly signals veto unlikely", "body": "Kansas Gov. Laura Kelly doesn't intend to veto a sweeping plan to draw the Kansas City Chiefs and Royals away from Missouri with more than a billion dollars in bonds, a top aide to the governor said Monday as lawmakers prepare to debate the proposal.\n\nThe Democratic governor's chief of staff, Will Lawrence, said in a letter and at a hearing in Topeka that while Kelly remains neutral on the legislation, \"at this time\" nothing in the bill would cause her to reject it. He noted the bill could still be changed by lawmakers, a caveat that leaves the door open to a veto if the measure is altered significantly.\n\n\"If this bill were to land on the governor's desk as it is, we don't have concerns over the bill, nothing that would warrant a veto,\" Lawrence said.\n\nKelly told reporters earlier in the day that the measure was \"not something I'm going to invest a lot of energy in. I think this is something for the Legislature to work through.\"\n\nThe announcement came as supporters and opponents of the plan mounted an all-out effort to persuade lawmakers before the start of a special session on Tuesday. While the session was called to pass a tax cuts package, much of the attention of lobbyists and lawmakers has been turned to the prospect of luring the Chiefs and the Royals.\n\nAn attorney representing the Chiefs stopped well short of promising that the team would relocate to Kansas if the plan passed, but cast the legislation as the state's moment to seize the initiative after Jackson County voters in April rejected a stadiums sales tax that would have guaranteed the team remains in Kansas City.\n\n\"Missouri spoke, Jackson County spoke. They had their opportunity,\" the attorney, Korb Maxwell, said at a joint hearing of the House and Senate commerce committees. \"But now there's a moment for Kansas to step up and an option for us all here.\"\n\nAn attorney for the Royals, David Frantze, said the expiration of the Royals' lease at Kauffman Stadium following the 2030 baseball season lends urgency to the team's need to secure a new home.\n\n\"This STAR bonds legislation you're considering offers a very good opportunity for us to explore an option in the state of Kansas,\" Frantze said.\n\nThe latest proposal would allow Kansas - or a city or county - to issue bonds to finance up to 70% of the cost of stadiums for one or both teams. An earlier draft that had been shared among lawmakers over the weekend placed the percentage at 75%, but by Monday afternoon it had dropped.\n\nA Chiefs stadium alone could cost at least $2 billion. A Royals stadium could be another $1.5 billion, if not more. To finance the projects, Kansas would issue Sales Tax and Revenue, or STAR, bonds that are backed by future anticipated tax revenues from the stadiums and surrounding development.\n\nUnder the plan, Kansas would also use sports betting and some Lottery revenues to repay the bonds, which would have a 30-year term. Economists who have studied sports stadiums question the financial viability of the bonding plan.\n\nPast academic reviews have found that nearly all empirical studies found \"little to no tangible impacts of sports teams and facilities on local economic activity\" and that the level of subsidies typically provided for stadiums \"far exceeds any observed economic benefits.\" Any identified economic effects typically occurred in the area immediately surrounding a stadium, but those impacts weren't always present and \"can not be generally applied to all stadium projects.\"\n\n\"If I'm the Chiefs, this is a blank check,\" Geoffrey Propheter, a professor at the University of Colorado-Denver who has studied sports and urban affairs, said in an interview.\n\nThe measure pledges revenue from a fund aimed at attracting professional sports teams toward repaying the bonds. That fund, created in 2022 when lawmakers legalized sports betting, contains most of the sports betting revenue coming into the state.\n\nThe Legislature this spring also placed a provision in the state budget directing excess Lottery revenue above $71.5 million a year into the fund. The proposal before lawmakers would make that change permanent, potentially adding roughly $10 million a year or more into the fund. Proponents estimate the fund could eventually draw in $25 million a year.\n\nIf a project encountered difficulty making bond payments on time, lawmakers would likely face pressure to increase the amount of Lottery revenue sent into the fund, which would reduce the amount of Lottery revenue available to fund the state government.\n\nSome lawmakers on Monday questioned whether the Chiefs or the Royals would be able to secure STAR bond financing and then layer on additional economic development incentives. One program mentioned multiple times was PEAK, which allows some out-of-state businesses that relocate into Kansas to retain 95% of payroll withholding taxes for new jobs created.\n\nMaxwell didn't rule out the Chiefs seeking other economic development incentives. He said incentives could be negotiated if the team moves forward on a specific property and works with a locality. He said any discussions would have to answer whether restrictions placed on such incentives to end the so-called \"border war\" between Kansas and Missouri would apply.\n\n\"We understand this has to have a positive impact and return on investment for the taxpayers out there,\" Maxwell said.\n\nRep. Kristey Williams, an Augusta Republican who asked about PEAK, said after the hearing that she wished lawmakers knew the total package.\n\n\"We just know one piece of the puzzle,\" Williams said.\n\nOpponents at Monday's hearing pointed to shortcomings in the STAR bonds program and argued that a stadium project would be shifting economic activity from other parts of the state into the STAR bond district. They raised concerns about whether Kansas' credit rating would be at risk in the event of a default.\n\n\"There's also a cost to taxpayers because when that money shifts - if we're spending money at businesses now, dining retail and so forth - that money is generating sales tax that goes into the general fund. If that money is being spent in a STAR bond district, it's going to pay off debt,\" said Dave Trabert, CEO of the Kansas Policy Institute.\n\nThe proposal doesn't say where a Chiefs or Royals stadium would be located, but most discussion has centered on Wyandotte County, home to the Kansas Speedway, generally considered the most successful STAR bond project. If a stadium STAR bond district overlaps with an existing STAR bond district, the older bond must get priority in repayment under the bill.\n\nCities and the counties would have the option to pledge local tax revenue from inside the STAR bond district toward repaying bonds, but wouldn't have to. But any local government that decides against pledging revenue would likely lose leverage during negotiations over the terms of a STAR bond agreement with one or both teams.\n\nThe bill authorizes the Kansas secretary of commerce, currently Lt. Gov. David Toland, to negotiate a STAR bond agreement. Any deal would have to be approved by the Legislative Coordinating Council, which includes top House and Senate leaders from both parties. Republicans hold a 6-2 majority on the council.\n\nWhile the LCC's vote on an agreement would be public, it could deliberate privately. The proposal keeps revenue reports filed on a STAR bond district confidential.\n\nSupporters of the measure cast it in generational terms, appealing to the emotional bond many lawmakers - and Kansas residents - feel with the teams. They also raised fears that one or both teams could leave the region.\n\n\"The legislation before you today seizes a once in a lifetime opportunity to protect a midwest tradition and recruit a major franchise to Kansas,\" said Dan Murray, a lobbyist for Scoop and Score, an organization formed in recent weeks to promote the STAR bonds effort.\n\nThe House and Senate commerce committees didn't debate the STAR bonds bill or take any vote on Monday. Lawmakers are hopeful they can limit the special session to a single day - a belief that assumes smooth passage of the tax proposal.\n\nThe Kansas Constitution forbids lawmakers from passing bills on the same day they are introduced, unless an emergency is declared by two-thirds of lawmakers present. Clearing that procedural hurdle may offer a test vote on where lawmakers stand on the plan - and whether it will advance quickly.", "source": {"uri": "kansas.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The

Lawmakers expect to consider a plan to authorize state bonds to help the Chiefs and professional baseball's Kansas City Royals finance new stadiums on the Kansas side of their metropolitan area, which is split by the border with Missouri.\n\nProfessional athletes and touring entertainers pay income taxes not only in their home states but also other states where they perform, if those states impose income taxes. For athletes, Kansas taxes a percentage of their income based on how many games they play in the state -- so that if a visiting minor-league infielder has 12 of his team's 120 games each season in Wichita, 10% of their income is taxed.\n\nEconomists who've studied pro sports teams for decades have concluded that subsidizing their stadiums isn't worth the cost for their communities. But supporters of bringing the Chiefs and Royals to Kansas believe that skepticism doesn't properly consider taxes from the large incomes of the best professional players.\n\n\"The amount of dollars that come in from the income tax side offset a good portion of some of the things that we're doing here,\" said Kansas state Sen. J.R. Claeys, a Republican from central Kansas who is working on the stadium plan.\n\nKansas already collects some income taxes from professional athletes, though the state Department of Revenue does not have figures. The state is home to NASCAR's Kansas Speedway, professional soccer's Sporting KC and several minor league baseball and hockey teams.\n\nMissouri is home for the Chiefs, the Royals, Major League Baseball's St. Louis Cardinals and the National Hockey League's St. Louis Blues, plus two minor-league baseball teams.\n\nMissouri has collected nearly $34 million in income taxes from professional athletes during the current budget year that began July 1, up 9% from the $31 million collected the previous year, according to the state. However, during the current budget year, when the Chiefs won their third Super Bowl in five years, taxes from football players jumped 39% from about $14 million to $19 million.\n\nIt's not clear how much of Missouri's revenue would come to Kansas if its lawmakers succeed in attracting the Chiefs, the Royals or both.\n\nGeoffrey Propheter, an associate professor of public affairs at the University of Colorado Denver who regularly publishes papers on sports economics, predicted that the figure for the Chiefs would be \"trivial,\" only a few million dollars, even if they also moved practice facilities to Kansas.\n\nHe also said lawmakers should consider additional issues that come with a new stadium, such as traffic congestion, light pollution and how rising property values make housing less affordable to local residents.\n\n\"On the Kansas side of the river, they get access to the team without paying the cost,\" he said. \"That's a fantastic situation to be in.\"\n\nOthers' figures for potential new income tax revenues are millions of dollars higher.\n\nOne potential issue is whether Kansas' rule could withstand a court challenge. Edward Zelinsky, a professor at Yeshiva University's Cardozo School of Law in New York City, said such rules unfairly over-tax athletes.\n\nA tax law specialist, Zelinsky is familiar with how states tax visiting athletes. In the 1990s, he challenged a New York rule like Kansas' because New York taxed all of his income even though he works mostly from home in Connecticut. He lost, but in 2015, the Ohio Supreme Court ruled that visiting athletes must be taxed based on how many total work days they spend in the state -- in that case, two out of 157 -- instead of the games played there, a larger percentage.\n\nZelinsky said stadium advocates can argue that being able to tax athletes' incomes is an advantage, but it doesn't drive the economics surrounding a venue.\n\n\"It'll be a nice chunk of change, but I wouldn't use this to control the debate,\" Zelinsky said.\n\nFILE - A woman and her dog walk past Kauffman Stadium, home of the Kansas City Royals baseball team, March 24, 2020, in Kansas City, Mo. The Kansas Legislature's top leaders endorsed helping the Kansas City Chiefs and the Kansas City Royals finance new stadiums in Kansas ahead of a special session set to convene Tuesday, June 18. The plan would authorize state bonds for stadium construction and pay them off with revenues from sports betting, the Kansas Lottery and new tax dollars generated in and around the new venues.

The Chiefs said in a statement that the team appreciated Kansas leaders reaching out for input on the legislation.\n\n\"We look forward to exploring the options this legislation may provide,\" the statement said.\n\nThe Royals said the team was grateful to the legislature for its vote.\n\n\"The Kansas City Royals look forward to additional conversations as we evaluate where we will play baseball in the future,\" the team said. \"We will always prioritize the best interests of our fans, associates and taxpayers in this process.\"\n\nState Rep.

Both teams have signaled a willingness to move from their current stadiums at the Truman Sports Complex in Kansas City, Missouri.\n\nWhile neither team has announced a proposed site for a Kansas stadium, legislators speculated it could land in Wyandotte County near the Sporting KC soccer stadium, NASCAR track and outlet shops.\n\n\"We have the history of building amazing projects that have brought in retail commerce, restaurants, hotels and have improved an area that was largely just a field and turned it into a tax-generating machine for our state,\" said Sen. J.R. Claeys, a Salina Republican.\n\nThe legislation, he said, would put Kansas in a \"very good position to keep the Kansas City Chiefs and the Kansas City Royals in the Kansas City metro area.\"\n\nThe bill, which was not voted on by any legislative committee, would expand the state's Sales Tax and Revenue (STAR) Bond program, which is meant to help finance tourism and entertainment districts to help pay for a professional football or baseball stadium of at least $1 billion.\n\nA developer building a stadium under the program would be eligible to finance up to 70% of the project cost by issuing bonds and repaying them with the increased sales tax collections from the stadium site. The expansion would have initially allowed up to 75% of project costs but was tweaked before introduction. Debt on a stadium constructed under the expansion wouldn't have to be repaid for 30 years instead of the normal 20.\n\nThe project could also receive a boost from liquor taxes generated in the STAR Bond district and revenues from a fund Kansas created when it legalized sports betting.\n\nDuring House debate, Rep. Paul Waggoner, a Hutchinson Republican, argued subsidized stadiums never generate the economic activity that they promise. He was alarmed by what he called \"minimal transparency\" in the deal-making process laid out in the legislation.\n\nThe bill says any agreement between the state and a team would be confidential until after it has been executed.\n\nWaggoner called the legislation \"bad public policy.\"\n\n\"This is not your mother's STAR Bonds,\" Waggoner said. \"This is a jacked up super-sized version of STAR Bonds.\"\n\nThe bill limits the eligibility to National Football League or Major League Baseball teams currently near Kansas. The financing mechanism could be used for both stadiums and training facilities.\n\nBoth teams have pressed lawmakers in recent weeks to pass the bill with representatives from the Royals hosting dinner for Democratic lawmakers at a steakhouse Monday night and the Chiefs throwing a lunchtime block party Tuesday steps from the Capitol.\n\nEarlier this month, a nonprofit called Scoop and Score Inc. launched to advocate for a Kansas stadium deal. The organization, which does not have to disclose its donors, hired 30 lobbyists to advocate for the STAR Bond expansion legislation.\n\nIn a statement, former Kansas House Speaker Ron Ryckman Jr., a lobbyist for Scoop and Score and the Chiefs, said the Legislature \"stepped up in a big way, paving the path to make sure the Chiefs stay right where they belong -- in Kansas City with their loyal fans.\"\n\n\"The votes show overwhelming bipartisan support because Kansas lawmakers know what the Chiefs mean to us and how big of an economic opportunity this is for Kansas,\" Ryckman said.\n\nSeveral lawmakers expressed skepticism about STAR Bonds or the deal in front of them but voted for it anyway.\n\nRep. Jason Probst, a Democrat from Hutchinson, said the idea disgusts him and lamented that the legislature does not move as swiftly to pass bills on issues including homelessness, hunger or childhood poverty. But he still voted for the bill.\n\n\"So I'm going to hold my nose and probably support this,\" he said, \"but not without protesting the fact that we get sent here to do things for people, and we never move with this sort of urgency or with this sort of passion or the energy that we have around this.\"\n\nIn a meeting of House Democrats before the vote, Probst said he thought the Chiefs were using Kansas to \"get Missouri worked up\" so the state would \"sweeten the pot\" and offer the team more incentives to stay put.\n\nProbst said he was bothered that the Chiefs were making an emotional appeal, invoking sports heroes, while being thin on details. Still, he said, it would be \"catastrophic\" if the Chiefs left the Kansas City metro area.\n\n\"I do not like this. It feels gross,\" Probst said. \"This whole show that's going on feels disgusting to me. And it's still the right thing to do. That's how I see it.\"\n\nRep. Stephanie Sawyer Clayton, an Overland Park Democrat, said during that meeting that she was struggling with the proposal \"because I don't like misogynistic dude bro culture,\" because the family that owns the Chiefs supported the anti-abortion constitutional amendment that Kansas voters rejected in 2022. She said she also doesn't like Ryckman, who is leading the lobbying efforts on behalf of the Chiefs.\n\nBut, she said, her decision to support the bill was cemented when she saw testimony from the governor's office that suggested the governor planned to sign the bill if passed.\n\nSawyer Clayton said it would \"warm the cockles of my cold, dead feminist heart\" to see Kelly get credit for moving the teams from Missouri \"and not the dude bros who have been working on this.\"\n\n\"That is why I'm a 'yes,'\" Sawyer Clayton said. \"I want a woman getting credit for sports things. So I'm doing it out of spite, frankly.\"\n\nAcross the rotunda, Sen. Molly Baumgardner, a Republican from Louisburg, argued STAR Bonds had generally not created anything new but rather subsidized development that likely would have occurred anyway.\n\n\"I understand the excitement behind the prospect,\" she said. \"It is like it's Christmas Eve and there's visions of sugar plums, only its royal blue and crimson and gold in this case.\"", "source": {"uri":

The NFL team wants Kansas to approve a tax incentive that would fund a brand-new stadium in the state. Proponents argue that if Missouri or Kansas doesn't act, the team could leave the region altogether.\n\nThe Kansas City Chiefs may be on the move.\n\nKansas lawmakers are gathering this week for a special legislative session and could vote on a bill that would give millions in tax incentives to expand the state's tourism and entertainment industries.\n\nAll eyes are on now the bill which, if passed, could help the reigning Super Bowl champions (as well as MLB team the Kansas City Royals) move from the Missouri side of the city to the Kansas side of the city.\n\nAt a hearing on Monday ahead of the formal start of the session, representatives for the Kansas City Chiefs and the Royals asked Kansas lawmakers to pass the bill, according to the Missouri Independent.\n\nThat legislation would give the teams hundreds of millions of dollars to help fund building new stadiums in Kansas.\n\n\"If we want to be major league, we've got to have major league teams,\" Korb Maxwell, an attorney who represents the Chiefs, told lawmakers on Monday, according to the Independent. \"This is the greatest opportunity we've had in any generation, and it's here before us right now.\"\n\nThe proposed legislation would strengthen the state's Sales Tax and Revenue (STAR) Bond program, and let Kansas provide bonds that would pay for up to 70% of the cost of building brand-new stadiums for one or both of the sports teams, The Kansas City Star reported.\n\nUnder the bill, the teams would be required to spend at least $1 billion on the new stadiums and training facilities, the Missouri Independent reported.\n\nThe state would pay off the bond given to the teams over 30 years using sports gambling and lottery money, according to the Kansas City Star.\n\nMeanwhile, Missouri legislators are fighting to keep the Chiefs for themselves. Officials in Jackson County, Missouri on Monday proposed a resolution for a countywide sales tax, local Kansas City outlet KSHB reported. Depending on how much the tax is -- the current options are each just a fraction of a cent -- it would either pay for capital improvements to the Chiefs' existing stadium or building a brand-new stadium in Missouri, according to the outlet.\n\nThe Chiefs' current home at the 50-year-old Arrowhead Stadium is in need of some improvement since it was last renovated in 2010.\n\nTeam President Mark Donovan said last summer the team is looking into three options: renovating the existing stadium, building a new one on-site, or moving to a new location entirely, Sports Illustrated reported.\n\nAnd back in 2022, Donovan even floated the idea of moving from Missouri to Kansas, according to the outlet.\n\nProponents of the move argue that if something isn't done to keep the Chiefs and the Royals local to Kansas City, the teams could choose to leave the Kansas-Missouri region altogether -- a development that could devastate local Taylor Swift fans.\n\nRepresentatives for the Kansas City Chiefs and Royals did not immediately respond to a request for comment from Business Insider.\n\nRead the original article on Business Insider", "source": {"uri": "businessinsider.nl",

Lawmakers expect to consider a plan to authorize state bonds to help the Chiefs and professional baseball's Kansas City Royals finance new stadiums on the Kansas side of their metropolitan area, which is split by the border with Missouri.Professional athletes and touring entertainers pay income taxes not only in their home states but also other states where they perform, if those states impose income taxes. For athletes, Kansas taxes a percentage of their income based on how many games they play in the state -- so that if a visiting minor-league infielder has 12 of his team's 120 games each season in Wichita, 10% of their income is taxed.Economists who've studied pro sports teams for decades have concluded that subsidizing their stadiums isn't worth the cost for their communities. But supporters of bringing the Chiefs and Royals to Kansas believe that skepticism doesn't properly consider taxes from the large incomes of the best professional players.\"The 53 players are making approximately $250 million, and that continues to go up, and that doesn't include any of the executives, the coaching staff or rest of the team out there,\" Korb Maxell, a Chiefs attorney, told legislators during an informational hearing Monday at the Statehouse. \"You have all of the other visiting teams that are coming and always paying in those taxes as well.\"Kansas already collects some income taxes from professional athletes, though the state Department of Revenue does not have figures. The state is home to NASCAR's Kansas Speedway, professional soccer's Sporting KC and several minor league baseball and hockey teams.Missouri is home for the Chiefs, the Royals, Major League Baseball's St. Louis Cardinals and the National Hockey League's St. Louis Blues, plus two minor-league baseball teams.Missouri has collected nearly $34 million in income taxes from professional athletes during the current budget year that began July 1, up 9% from the $31 million collected the previous year, according to the state. However, during the current budget year, when the Chiefs won their third Super Bowl in five years, taxes from football players jumped 39% from about $14 million to $19 million.It's not clear how much of Missouri's revenue would come to Kansas if its lawmakers succeed in attracting the Chiefs, the Royals or both.Geoffrey Propheter, an associate professor of public affairs at the University of Colorado Denver who regularly publishes papers on sports economics, predicted that the figure for the Chiefs would be \"trivial,\" only a few million dollars, even if they also moved practice facilities to Kansas.He also said lawmakers should consider additional issues that come with a new stadium, such as traffic congestion, light pollution and how rising property values make housing less affordable to local residents.\"On the Kansas side of the river, they get access to the team without paying the cost,\" he said. \"That's a fantastic situation to be in.\"Others' figures for potential new income tax revenues are millions of dollars higher.One potential issue is whether Kansas' rule could withstand a court challenge. Edward Zelinsky, a professor at Yeshiva University's Cardozo School of Law in New York City, said such rules unfairly over-tax athletes.A tax law specialist, he's familiar with how states tax visiting athletes. In the 1990s, Zelinsky challenged a New York rule like Kansas' because New York taxed all of his income even though he works mostly from home in Connecticut. He lost, but in 2015, the Ohio Supreme Court ruled that visiting athletes must be taxed based on how many total work days they spend in the state -- in that case, two out of 157 -- instead of the games played there, a larger percentage.Zelinsky said stadium advocates can argue that being able to tax athletes' incomes is an advantage, but it doesn't drive the economics surrounding a venue.\"It'll be a nice chunk of change, but I wouldn't use this to control the debate,\" Zelinsky said.\n\nKansas legislators trying to lure the Kansas City Chiefs to their state argue that helping the Super Bowl champions build a new stadium could bring Kansas millions of dollars in income taxes from players and coaches, which are currently going to Missouri.\n\nSome economists are dubious that new revenues from \"jock taxes\" would be significant for Kansas, and a debate over the question emerged ahead of a special session of the Kansas Legislature set to convene Tuesday.

But supporters of bringing the Chiefs and Royals to Kansas believe that skepticism doesn't properly consider taxes from the large incomes of the best professional players.\n\n\"The 53 players are making approximately $250 million, and that continues to go up, and that doesn't include any of the executives, the coaching staff or rest of the team out there,\" Korb Maxell, a Chiefs attorney, told legislators during an informational hearing Monday at the Statehouse. \"You have all of the other visiting teams that are coming and always paying in those taxes as well.\"\n\nKansas already collects some income taxes from professional athletes, though the state Department of Revenue does not have figures. The state is home to NASCAR's Kansas Speedway, professional soccer's Sporting KC and several minor league baseball and hockey teams.\n\nMissouri is home for the Chiefs, the Royals, Major League Baseball's St. Louis Cardinals and the National Hockey League's St. Louis Blues, plus two minor-league baseball teams.\n\nMissouri has collected nearly $34 million in income taxes from professional athletes during the current budget year that began July 1, up 9% from the $31 million collected the previous year, according to the state. However, during the current budget year, when the Chiefs won their third Super Bowl in five years, taxes from football players jumped 39% from about $14 million to $19 million.\n\nIt's not clear how much of Missouri's revenue would come to Kansas if its lawmakers succeed in attracting the Chiefs, the Royals or both.\n\nGeoffrey Propheter, an associate professor of public affairs at the University of Colorado Denver who regularly publishes papers on sports economics, predicted that the figure for the Chiefs would be \"trivial,\" only a few million dollars, even if they also moved practice facilities to Kansas.\n\nHe also said lawmakers should consider additional issues that come with a new stadium, such as traffic congestion, light pollution and how rising property values make housing less affordable to local residents.\n\n\"On the Kansas side of the river, they get access to the team without paying the cost,\" he said. \"That's a fantastic situation to be in.\"\n\nOthers' figures for potential new income tax revenues are millions of dollars higher.\n\nOne potential issue is whether Kansas' rule could withstand a court challenge. Edward Zelinsky, a professor at Yeshiva University's Cardozo School of Law in New York City, said such rules unfairly over-tax athletes.\n\nA tax law specialist, he's familiar with how states tax visiting athletes. In the 1990s, Zelinsky challenged a New York rule like Kansas' because New York taxed all of his income even though he works mostly from home in Connecticut. He lost, but in 2015, the Ohio Supreme Court ruled that visiting athletes must be taxed based on how many total work days they spend in the state -- in that case, two out of 157 -- instead of the games played there, a larger percentage.\n\nZelinsky said stadium advocates can argue that being able to tax athletes' incomes is an advantage, but it doesn't drive the economics surrounding a venue.\n\n\"It'll be a nice chunk of change, but I wouldn't use this to control the debate,\" Zelinsky said.", "source": {"uri": "kmbc.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "KMBC 9"}, "authors": [{"uri": "associated_press@kmbc.com", "name": "Associated Press", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/U.S._Bank_Stadium", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "U.S. Bank Stadium"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kansas_City_Chiefs", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Kansas City Chiefs"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kansas_City_Royals", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Kansas City Royals"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Income_tax", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Income tax"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Super_Bowl", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Super Bowl"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minor_League_Baseball", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Minor League Baseball"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kansas", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Kansas"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Kansas"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kansas_Legislature", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Kansas Legislature"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bond_(finance)", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Bond (finance)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_City", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "New York City"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "New York City"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Missouri", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Missouri"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Missouri"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kansas_Speedway", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Kansas Speedway"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sporting_Kansas_City", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Sporting Kansas City"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/St._Louis_Blues", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "St. Louis Blues"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infielder", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Infielder"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/St._Louis_Cardinals", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "St. Louis Cardinals"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Hockey_League", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "National Hockey League"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NASCAR", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "NASCAR"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metropolitan_area", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Metropolitan area"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lawyer", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Lawyer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baseball", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Baseball"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Major_League_Baseball", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Major League Baseball"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economics", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Economics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wichita,_Kansas", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Wichita, Kansas"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Wichita, Kansas"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edward_Zelinsky", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Edward Zelinsky"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yeshiva_University", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Yeshiva University"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Benjamin_N._Cardozo_School_of_Law", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Benjamin N.

What does this mean for Kansas residents? Let's get a better understanding of the situation here.\n\nThe ongoing future of where the Kansas City Chiefs and the Kansas City Royals will call home took another turn on Tuesday. The state of Kansas has hopes of bringing professional teams into their state. Yesterday, Kansas Legislature passed a proposal, that includes the eventual process of building new stadiums for the Chiefs and Royals.\n\nAccording to Jonathan Shorman and Jenna Barackman of the Kansas City Star, the state could issue bonds to help secure the new stadiums. In addition, Shorman and Barackman add that Kansas Governor Laura Kelly is expected to sign the proposal or allow it to pass without her signature.\n\nFor years, both teams have called the area at Truman Sports Complex home. Kauffman Stadium opened in 1973. Meanwhile, Arrowhead Stadium opened in 1972. Both the Royals and the Chiefs have resided there for over 50 years now. Over time, each site has seen its fair share of renovations, and while each fanbase gets the stadiums rocking when the teams are rolling, both places are honestly dinosaurs in each of their leagues, given the newer stadiums that have been built.\n\nWhat Kansas Proposal Means In Immediate Future\n\nWhen looking at how the Kansas Legislature came to this conclusion, let's analyze the results of the bond proposal. As mentioned by Matt Evans of KMBC 9, the proposal passed 27-8 in the Kansas Senate. The aforementioned Star article mentioned that Sales Tax and Revenue bonds, or STAR bonds, may be used to pay up to 70 percent of the stadium's cost.\n\nThe teams are set to have their leases expire at Truman Sports Complex in 2031. So obviously, the teams may not migrate to Kansas for a good while yet, if they do at all. But there are already positive steps indicating a potential move. On Tuesday evening, both franchises -- the Royals and the Chiefs -- released statements about the Kansas STAR bond proposal. \"We look forward to exploring the options this legislation may provide,\" was included in the Chiefs' statement.\n\nThe teams still appeared to work with the state of Missouri to find a suitable future to remain on that side of the state line. But with the initial momentum and statements from the teams, Kansas has to feel pretty ecstatic about this initial proposal. And while a potential move to Kansas would not be immediate, the state could increase revenue and potentially add more jobs by bringing the Royals and the Chiefs across state lines.\n\nWhere a new Chiefs stadium could be located\n\nIn any potential stadium move to Kansas, speculation is that the Chiefs and/or Royals could end up in the Village West area of Kansas City, Kansas. This is also known as the Legends Outlets area. In this development, you have the Legends Outlets Kansas City shopping mall. Children's Mercy Park, home to Sporting KC of Major League Soccer, and Kansas Speedway are located within five minutes of this location as well.\n\nFinding the exact spot, if it is indeed in this area, will be fascinating. But a key thing for the Chiefs, as mentioned by Korb Maxwell, a representative for the team, is that several acres would need to be ensured just for parking spaces. The parking spaces are viewed as a key factor in maintaining the tailgate experience that Chiefs fans have created, as hinted at by Maxwell.\n\nIf the Chiefs were to end up near Children's Mercy Park, Kansas Speedway, or Legends Outlets, it would be a move roughly 30 minutes west across state lines. In this region, the current development area is located just north of I-70 and just west of I-435. Assuming the Chiefs would have a new stadium around this location, it would still make for easy access for fans traveling to games.\n\nHow Kansas residents likely view relocation\n\nThe idea of money and taxes being included to pay for a new stadium may be difficult for Kansas residents to swallow. But if the Chiefs and the Royals were to come to the state of Kansas, most of the state's residents would likely be excited.\n\nAs a Kansas resident, I cannot help but be thrilled about the Chiefs potentially moving across state lines. For starters, it would be much closer and easier to attend games. Not that the move is multiple hours, like the Raiders' decision to relocate from Oakland to Las Vegas. But by being that much closer, access to games would be simpler.\n\nOther events outside of Chiefs games would also happen nearby. And with potential increased revenue for the state, residents could have fresh opportunities. I would have to think Kansas residents would have a renewed sense of pride if the Chiefs and the Royals had a shiny new stadium entrenched in their immediate backyard.", "source": {"uri":

The legislation, which received bipartisan support, expands a state incentive program to entice the Royals, along with the Kansas City Chiefs, to potentially move their stadiums to the Kansas side of the border.\n\n\"We're grateful to the Kansas Legislature for today's bipartisan action that gives the state a pragmatic tool in which to achieve its economic development goals,\" the Royals said in a statement following the vote. \"The Kansas City Royals look forward to additional conversations as we evaluate where we will play baseball in the future. We will always prioritize the best interests of our fans, associates, and taxpayers in this process.\"\n\nThe legislation followed a decision by Jackson County voters in Missouri to reject a stadium sales tax in April. The tax would have relocated the Royals to downtown Kansas City while keeping them within the county. With the decision, Kansas has emerged as a serious contender for the teams' future home.\n\nBoth the Royals and Chiefs had expressed their intention to explore all options following the failed stadium tax vote. Now, with the passage of this bill, they can begin exploring potential locations as they determine their next steps. However, Missouri leaders have indicated that they hope to continue negotiations with the teams to keep them in the state.\n\n\"Kansas City and the State of Missouri will continue their ongoing negotiations with team leaders to keep the teams in the city and state that have welcomed, funded, and supported the success of both teams since the 1960s,\" Kansas City Mayor Quinton Lucas said. \"Today's vote regrettably restarts the Missouri-Kansas incentive border war, creating leverage for the teams but injecting even greater uncertainty into the regional stadium conversation.\"\n\nThe legislation allows Kansas to potentially issue Sales Tax and Revenue (STAR) bonds to cover up to 70% of the cost for stadiums for either or both teams, an increase from the current 50% limit. Estimates indicate that a new Chiefs stadium might cost at least $2 billion, while a new Royals stadium could surpass $1.5 billion.\n\nCritics of the plan argue that stadiums often fail to generate enough revenue to justify the public funds they receive. However, proponents, including Rep. Sean Tarwater, a Stilwell Republican, see the move as a necessary investment in the future of Kansas City.\n\n\"Are you going to step up today and take a leap of faith and make this happen - keep them in the metroplex and bring money to Kansas?\" Tarwater told lawmakers.\n\nThe teams' leases at the Truman Sports Complex, where Kauffman Stadium and Arrowhead Stadium currently reside, do not expire until 2031, meaning they will continue playing there for several more years.\n\nGovernor Laura Kelly, a Democrat, is expected to sign the legislation into law, setting the stage for a potential showdown between Kansas and Missouri over the future of their beloved sports teams.", "source": {"uri": "si.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Sports Illustrated"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kansas_Legislature", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Kansas Legislature"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kansas_City_Royals", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Kansas City Royals"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kansas_City_Chiefs", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Kansas City Chiefs"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Missouri", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Missouri"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Missouri"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kansas", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Kansas"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Kansas"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/U.S._Bank_Stadium", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "U.S. Bank Stadium"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sales_tax", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Sales tax"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baseball", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Baseball"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mayor_of_Kansas_City,_Missouri", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Mayor of Kansas City, Missouri"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Downtown_Kansas_City", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Downtown Kansas City"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/County_(United_States)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "County (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kansas_City,_Missouri", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Kansas City, Missouri"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Kansas City, Missouri"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jackson_County,_Missouri", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Jackson County, Missouri"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Jackson County, Missouri"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sean_Tarwater", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Sean Tarwater"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quinton_Lucas", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Quinton Lucas"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Truman_Sports_Complex", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Truman Sports Complex"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arrowhead_Stadium", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Arrowhead Stadium"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kauffman_Stadium", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Kauffman Stadium"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Democratic Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republican_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Republican Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laura_Kelly", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Laura Kelly"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Paintball/Teams", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Paintball/Teams", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Robotics/Competitions", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Robotics/Competitions", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Major_League", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Major League", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/Stadiums", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/Stadiums", "wgt": 37}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Genealogy/Royalty", "label": "dmoz/Society/Genealogy/Royalty", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 79}], "image": "https://images2.minutemediacdn.com/image/upload/c_crop,w_4565,h_2567,x_0,y_5/c_fill,w_1440,ar_16:9,f_auto,q_auto,g_auto/images/voltaxMediaLibrary/mmsport/inside_the_royals/01j0rxb72e1nhm40gwch.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9660256", "eventUri": "eng-9660256", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1450980392156862, "wgt": 196, "relevance": 1}

(AP) -- Kansas lawmakers hoping to lure the Kansas City Chiefs from Missouri are trying to win over skeptical colleagues by narrowing their proposal for encouraging the Super Bowl champions to build a new stadium and by linking it to a plan for broad tax cuts.\n\nThe Legislature expected to consider the stadium proposal during a special session set to convene Tuesday. The measure would allow the state to issue bonds to help the Chiefs and Major League Baseball's Kansas City Royals finance new stadiums on the Kansas side of their metropolitan area, which is split by the border with Missouri.\n\nSupporters on Monday backed away from an earlier plan to allow state bonds to cover all of the construction costs for new stadiums. Their plan would use revenues from sports betting, the state lottery and new taxes raised from the area around each new stadium.\n\nInvestigator tracked Kim Gardner to health clinic as St. Louis prosecutor's office crashed New Channel 32?

Democratic Gov. Laura Kelly called the special session to consider tax cuts, but she cannot limit what lawmakers consider -- creating an opening for a plan to woo the Chiefs and Royals.\n\n\"We definitely need to demonstrate that we're getting relief to our citizens,\" said Senate President Ty Masterson, a Wichita-area Republican who is backing the plan.\n\nMany lawmakers have argued that voters would be angry if the state helped finance new stadiums without cutting taxes. Kelly vetoed three tax-cutting plans before legislators adjourned their regular annual session May 1, but she and top Republican lawmakers have drafted a compromise measure to reduce taxes by $1.23 billion over the next three years.\n\nThe first version of the stadium-financing plan emerged in late April, but lawmakers didn't vote on it before adjourning. It would have allowed state bonds to finance all stadium construction costs, but the latest version caps the amount at 70%, and it says legislative leaders and the governor must sign off on any bonding plan.\n\nSupporters of the plan also modified it so that it only applies to professional football and Major League Baseball stadiums, instead of any professional sports stadium for at least 30,000 spectators. Bonds would be paid off over 30 years.\n\n\"We're trying to bring something grand to the state of Kansas,\" said state Rep. Sean Tarwater, a Kansas City-area Republican leading the push for a stadium plan.\n\nFree-market conservatives in Kansas have long opposed state and local subsidies for specific businesses or projects. And economists who've studied pro sports teams have concluded in dozens of studies over decades that subsidizing their stadiums isn't worth the cost.\n\n\"Most of the money that gets spent on the Chiefs is money that would otherwise be spent on other entertainment projects,\" said Andrew Zimbalist, an economics professor at Smith College in central Massachusetts who has written multiple books about sports.\n\nKelly told reporters Monday that she won't \"invest a lot of energy\" in a stadium plan, letting lawmakers lead. She and Missouri Gov. Mike Parson, a Republican, signed an agreement in 2019 to end years of each state using subsidies to steal the other state's jobs in the Kansas City area, but Kelly argued that their truce doesn't apply to the Chiefs and Royals.\n\n\"We never discussed the teams,\" she said.\n\nKansas legislators consider the Chiefs and Royals in play because in April, voters on the Missouri side of the metro area refused to continue a local sales tax for the upkeep of the complex with their side-by-side stadiums. Missouri officials have said they'll do whatever it takes to keep the teams but haven't outlined any proposals.\n\nThe two teams' lease on their stadium complex runs through January 2031, but Korb Maxwell, an attorney for the Chiefs who lives on the Kansas side, said renovations on the team's Arrowhead Stadium should be planned seven or eight years in advance.\n\n\"There is an urgency to this,\" added David Frantz, the Royals' general counsel.\n\nSupporters of the stadium plan argued that economists' past research doesn't apply to the Chiefs and Royals. They said the bonds will be paid off with tax revenues that aren't being generated now and would never be without the stadiums or the development around them. Masterson said it's wrong to call the bonds a subsidy.\n\nAnd Maxwell said: \"For a town to be major league, they need major league teams.\"\n\nBut economists who've studied pro sports said similar arguments have been a staple of past debates over paying for new stadiums. Development around a new stadium lessens development elsewhere, where the tax dollars generated would go to fund services or schools, they said.\n\n\"It could still help Kansas and maybe hurt Missouri by the same amount,\" Zimbalist said. \"It's a zero-sum game.\"\n\nCopyright 2024 The Associated Press.

Sean Tarwater, a Republican from Stilwell, said Missouri had a history of losing professional sports teams and implored fellow House members to pass the legislation.\n\n\"I ask you today, do you really want to put that type of an economic generation in the hands of the state of Missouri?\" Tarwater said just before the vote.\n\nPassage of the bill would represent a monumental step in Kansas lawmakers' attempts to court the two teams, both of which support the proposal. Both teams have signaled a willingness to move from their current stadiums at the Truman Sports Complex in Kansas City.\n\nThe bill was not voted on by any legislative committee. It would expand the state's Sales Tax and Revenue (STAR) Bond program, which is meant to help finance tourism and entertainment districts, to help pay for a professional football or baseball stadium of at least $1 billion.\n\nA developer building a stadium under the program would be eligible to finance up to 70% of the project cost by issuing bonds and repaying them with the increased sales tax collections from the stadium site. The expansion would have initially allowed up to 75% of project costs but was tweaked before introduction. Debt on a stadium constructed under the expansion wouldn't have to be repaid for 30 years instead of the normal 20.\n\nThe project could also receive a boost from liquor taxes generated in the STAR Bond district and revenues from a fund Kansas created when it legalized sports betting.\n\nThe bill limits the eligibility to National Football League or Major League Baseball teams currently near Kansas. The financing mechanism could be used for both stadiums and training facilities.\n\nBoth teams have pressed lawmakers in recent weeks to pass the bill with representatives from the Royals hosting dinner for Democratic lawmakers at a steakhouse Monday night and the Chiefs throwing a lunchtime block party Tuesday steps from the Capitol.\n\nEarlier this month, a nonprofit called \"Scoop and Score Inc.\" launched to advocate for a Kansas stadium deal. The organization, which does not have to disclose its donors, hired 30 lobbyists to advocate for the STAR Bond expansion legislation.\n\nThis story will be updated.\n\nThe post Kansas House passes

(AP) -- Kansas is making a serious run at becoming the new home for the reigning Super Bowl champions with legislators approving a plan Tuesday for luring both the Chiefs and Major League Baseball's Kansas City Royals away from Missouri.\n\nBipartisan legislative supermajorities OKed the measure to authorize state bonds to help finance new stadiums and practice facilities for both teams on the Kansas side of the metropolitan area of 2.3 million residents, which is split by the border with Missouri. Three Super Bowl victories in five years -- and player Travis Kelce's romance with pop icon Taylor Swift -- have made the Chiefs perhaps the area's most celebrated civic asset.\n\nThe plan from the Republican-controlled Legislature goes next to Democratic Gov. Laura Kelly. While she stopped short of promising to sign it, she said in a statement that \"Kansas now has the opportunity to become a professional sports powerhouse.\"\n\nInvestigator tracked Kim Gardner to health clinic as St. Louis prosecutor's office crashed Here are 13 must-visit restaurants in the St. Louis area from Ian Froeb's newsletter New Channel 32?

The lease on the Missouri complex with their side-by-side stadiums runs through January 2031, but both have said they already should have been planning for the future.\n\n\"We're excited about what happened here today,\" Korb Maxwell, an attorney for the Chiefs who lives on the Kansas side, said at the Statehouse after the bill cleared the Legislature. \"This is incredibly real.\"\n\nThe approval capped a two-month push to capitalize on the refusal in April by voters on the Missouri side to continue a local sales tax used to finance the upkeep of the teams' stadiums.\n\nBackers of the plan brushed aside decades of research by economists concluding that government subsidies for professional sports stadiums are not worth the cost. They also overcame criticism that lawmakers were moving too quickly.\n\nA spokeswoman for Missouri Gov. Mike Parson did not immediately respond to an email message seeking comment. But in Kansas City, Missouri, Mayor Quinton Lucas promised to \"lay out a good offer\" to keep both teams in town.\n\n\"Today was largely, in my opinion, about leverage,\" Lucas said. \"And the teams are in an exceptional leverage position.\"\n\nSome Kansas officials reached the same conclusion.\n\n\"I think the Chiefs and the Royals are using us,\" said state Rep. Susan Ruiz, a Kansas City-area Democrat.\n\nThe votes on the Kansas stadium-financing plan were 84-38 in the state House and 27-8 in the Senate. Lawmakers from across the state -- even western Kansas, far from any new stadium -- supported the measure.\n\nIt would allow state bonds to cover up to 70% of each new stadium, paying them off over 30 years with revenues from sports betting, state lottery ticket sales and new sales and alcohol taxes collected from shopping and entertainment districts around the new stadiums.\n\nHouse Commerce Committee Chair Sean Tarwater, a Kansas City-area Republican, said the Chiefs still are likely to spend $500 million to $700 million in private funds on a new stadium.\n\n\"There are no blank checks,\" Tarwater told GOP colleagues during a briefing.\n\nLegislators debated the plan during a one-day special session called by Kelly to have them consider reducing taxes after she vetoed three tax-cutting plans before legislators adjourned their regular annual session May 1.\n\nRepublican leaders had promised that the stadium proposal wouldn't come up until the Legislature first approved a plan to cut income and property taxes by a total of $1.23 billion over the next three years. Many lawmakers argued that voters would be angry if the state helped finance new stadiums without cutting taxes.\n\nWith the tax bill passed, the stadium plan gained support even from lawmakers who saw it as a handout for wealthy team owners. Some said failing to act risked pushing the teams to leave the Kansas City area, and a few said they had wanted the Chiefs in Kansas since childhood.\n\n\"It is amazing to me the speed with which we can solve problems when they're oriented around wealth, when they're oriented around business,\" said state Rep. Jason Probst, a Democrat from central Kansas.\n\nYet Probst voted for the bill.\n\n\"This is the system that we're stuck in, so if we choose to opt out of that system, we will lose every time,\" he said.\n\nEconomists who study pro sports teams have concluded in dozens of studies that a new stadium and shopping-and-entertainment area merely takes existing economic activity away from elsewhere in a community, resulting in little or no net gain.\n\n\"It could still help Kansas and maybe hurt Missouri by the same amount,\" said Andrew Zimbalist, an economics professor at Smith college in central Massachusetts who has written multiple books about sports. \"It's a zero-sum game.\"\n\nA skeptical state Sen. Molly Baumgardner, a Kansas City-area Republican, used a Christmas Eve metaphor to characterize supporters' excitement before she voted no.\n\n\"There are visions of sugar plums,\" Baumgardner said.\n\nCopyright 2024 The Associated Press.

Laura Kelly, a Democrat, who said in a statement following the Senate vote that the effort to bring the teams to Kansas \"shows we're all-in on keeping our beloved teams in the Kansas City metro.\"\n\n\"Kansas now has the opportunity to become a professional sports powerhouse with the Chiefs and Royals potentially joining Sporting KC as major league attractions, all with robust, revenue-generating entertainment districts surrounding them providing new jobs, new visitors and new revenues that boost the Kansas economy,\" Kelly said.\n\nNeither team has promised to move to Kansas, though both actively lobbied for the legislation's passage. The Chiefs said in a statement that the team appreciated Kansas leaders reaching out for input on the legislation.\n\n\"We look forward to exploring the options this legislation may provide,\" the statement said.\n\nThe Royals said the team was grateful to the legislature for its vote.\n\n\"The Kansas City Royals look forward to additional conversations as we evaluate where we will play baseball in the future,\" the team said. \"We will always prioritize the best interests of our fans, associates and taxpayers in this process.\"\n\nState Rep. Sean Tarwater, a Republican from Stilwell, said during debate in the House that Missouri had a history of losing professional sports teams and implored fellow House members to pass the legislation.\n\n\"I ask you today, do you really want to put that type of an economic generation in the hands of the state of Missouri?\" Tarwater said just before the vote.\n\nWhile neither team has announced a proposed site for a Kansas stadium, legislators speculated it could land in Wyandotte County near the Sporting KC soccer stadium, NASCAR track and outlet shops.\n\n\"We have the history of building amazing projects that have brought in retail commerce, restaurants, hotels and have improved an area that was largely just a field and turned it into a tax-generating machine for our state,\" said Sen. J.R. Claeys, a Salina Republican.\n\nThe legislation, he said, would put Kansas in a \"very good position to keep the Kansas City Chiefs and the Kansas City Royals in the Kansas City metro area.\"\n\nThe bill, which was not voted on by any legislative committee, would expand the state's Sales Tax and Revenue (STAR) Bond program, which is meant to help finance tourism and entertainment districts to help pay for a professional football or baseball stadium of at least $1 billion.\n\nA developer building a stadium under the program would be eligible to finance up to 70% of the project cost by issuing bonds and repaying them with the increased sales tax collections from the stadium site. The expansion would have initially allowed up to 75% of project costs but was tweaked before introduction. Debt on a stadium constructed under the expansion wouldn't have to be repaid for 30 years instead of the normal 20.\n\nThe project could also receive a boost from liquor taxes generated in the STAR Bond district and revenues from a fund Kansas created when it legalized sports betting.\n\nDuring House debate, Rep. Paul Waggoner, a Hutchinson Republican, argued subsidized stadiums never generate the economic activity that they promise. He was alarmed by what he called \"minimal transparency\" in the deal-making process laid out in the legislation.\n\nThe bill says any agreement between the state and a team would be confidential until after it has been executed.\n\nWaggoner called the legislation \"bad public policy.\"\n\n\"This is not your mother's STAR Bonds,\" Waggoner said. \"This is a jacked up super-sized version of STAR Bonds.\"\n\nThe bill limits the eligibility to National Football League or Major League Baseball teams currently near Kansas. The financing mechanism could be used for both stadiums and training facilities.\n\nBoth teams have pressed lawmakers in recent weeks to pass the bill with representatives from the Royals hosting dinner for Democratic lawmakers at a steakhouse Monday night and the Chiefs throwing a lunchtime block party Tuesday steps from the Capitol.\n\nEarlier this month, a nonprofit called Scoop and Score Inc. launched to advocate for a Kansas stadium deal. The organization, which does not have to disclose its donors, hired 30 lobbyists to advocate for the STAR Bond expansion legislation.\n\nIn a statement, former Kansas House Speaker Ron Ryckman Jr., a lobbyist for Scoop and Score and the Chiefs, said the Legislature \"stepped up in a big way, paving the path to make sure the Chiefs stay right where they belong -- in Kansas City with their loyal fans.\"\n\n\"The votes show overwhelming bipartisan support because Kansas lawmakers know what the Chiefs mean to us and how big of an economic opportunity this is for Kansas,\" Ryckman said.\n\nSeveral lawmakers expressed skepticism about STAR Bonds or the deal in front of them but voted for it anyway.\n\nRep. Jason Probst, a Democrat from Hutchinson, said the idea disgusts him and lamented that the legislature does not move as swiftly to pass bills on issues including homelessness, hunger or childhood poverty. But he still voted for the bill.\n\n\"So I'm going to hold my nose and probably support this,\" he said, \"but not without protesting the fact that we get sent here to do things for people, and we never move with this sort of urgency or with this sort of passion or the energy that we have around this.\"\n\nIn a meeting of House Democrats before the vote, Probst said he thought the Chiefs were using Kansas to \"get Missouri worked up\" so the state would \"sweeten the pot\" and offer the team more incentives to stay put.\n\nProbst said he was bothered that the Chiefs were making an emotional appeal, invoking sports heroes, while being thin on details. Still, he said, it would be \"catastrophic\" if the Chiefs left the Kansas City metro area.\n\n\"I do not like this. It feels gross,\" Probst said. \"This whole show that's going on feels disgusting to me. And it's still the right thing to do. That's how I see it.\"\n\nBut, she said, her decision to support the bill was cemented when she saw testimony from the governor's office that suggested the governor planned to sign the bill if passed.\n\nSawyer Clayton said it would \"warm the cockles of my cold, dead feminist heart\" to see Kelly get credit for moving the teams from Missouri \"and not the dude bros who have been working on this.\"\n\n\"That is why I'm a 'yes,'\" Sawyer Clayton said. \"I want a woman getting credit for sports things. So I'm doing it out of spite, frankly.\"\n\nAcross the rotunda, Sen. Molly Baumgardner, a Republican from Louisburg, argued STAR Bonds had generally not created anything new but rather subsidized development that likely would have occurred anyway.\n\n\"I understand the excitement behind the prospect,\" she said. \"It is like it's Christmas Eve and there's visions of sugar plums, only its royal blue and crimson and gold in this case.\"", "source": {"uri": "ksal.com",

Final development costs have not been determined, but a combined bill for two facilities could easily surpass $3.5 billion. The bonds would be repaid through a mix of sales tax, sports betting, and lottery revenue.\n\nThe measure now goes before Kansas Gov. Laura Kelly, who signaled a willingness to support it.\n\n\"Kansas now has the opportunity to become a professional sports powerhouse,\" she said.\n\nNeither the Chiefs nor the Royals have formally pledged to move to Kansas with the passage of stadium legislation, and both teams released statements saying they are looking forward to further exploration and consideration of the potential opportunity across the border. The teams' stadium leases at the Truman Sports Complex expire in 2031. But less officially, it's clear there is a receptive audience with these moves, particularly in the wake of what happened back in Missouri.\n\n\"Missouri spoke. Jackson County spoke. They had their opportunity,\" said Korb Maxwell, an attorney representing the Chiefs at a hearing before the Kansas legislature to review the bond measure. \"But now, there's a moment for Kansas to step up and an option for us all here.\"\n\nManica Architecture, which is already working with the Chiefs, also released a new set of conceptual renderings (above) for a Royals facility located right at the state line in Kansas -- though the team says it had no involvement in those images.\n\nBack in Missouri, both city and county officials called on Kansas to honor the terms of a 2019 truce between the two states to not poach businesses from each other.\n\n\"[The] vote regrettably restarts the Missouri-Kansas incentive border war, creating leverage for the teams but injecting even greater uncertainty into the regional stadium conversation,\" said Kansas City Mayor Quinton Lucas.\n\nAt the same time, though, Lucas threw some shade at his neighbor, saying the Kansas legislation \"provides only a speculative ability to sell bonds untethered to private funding plans, costs, locations, or discussion of the unknown consequences for taxpayers and existing businesses.\"",

(AP) -- Kansas legislators cleared the way Tuesday for a debate on trying to lure the Kansas City Chiefs from Missouri by approving broad tax cuts that many lawmakers said they needed to see before considering a plan to help the Super Bowl champions finance a new stadium.\n\nThe Legislature took up the stadium proposal during a special session that convened Tuesday amid heavy lobbying for the plan. The measure would allow the state to issue bonds to help the Chiefs and Major League Baseball's Kansas City Royals finance new stadiums on the Kansas side of their metropolitan area, which is split by the border with Missouri.\n\nBut top Republicans in the GOP-controlled Legislature promised that the stadium proposal wouldn't be debated until the Legislature approved a plan that would cut income and property taxes by a total of $1.23 billion over the next three years. Many lawmakers argued that voters would be angry if the state helped finance new stadiums without cutting taxes.\n\nInvestigator tracked Kim Gardner to health clinic as St. Louis prosecutor's office crashed New Channel 32?

Laura Kelly called the special session to have lawmakers consider reducing taxes after she vetoed three tax-cutting plans before legislators adjourned their regular annual session May 1. The plan lawmakers approved was a compromise between her and Republican leaders.\n\nLegislators made no changes in the plan before passing it, 34-4 in the Senate and 121-2 in the House. Kelly pledged to sign the measure into law.\n\nOnce legislators convened the special session, Kelly couldn't control what they considered, and that created an opening to consider the stadium-financing plan. That measure would use revenues from sports betting, the state lottery and new taxes raised from the area around each new stadium to pay off the state's bonds over 30 years.\n\nThe first version of the stadium-financing plan emerged in late April, but lawmakers didn't vote on it before adjourning. It would have allowed state bonds to finance all stadium construction costs, but the version to be considered by lawmakers Tuesday would cap the amount at 70% and require legislative leaders and the governor to sign off on any bonding plan.\n\nHouse Commerce Committee Chair Sean Tarwater, a Kansas City-area Republican, said the Chiefs are likely to spend between $500 million and $700 million in private funds on a new stadium.\n\n\"There are no blank checks,\" Tarwater told GOP colleagues during a briefing on the plan before the House began debating it.\n\nA new nonprofit group, Scoop and Score, formed last month to push for bringing the Chiefs to Kansas, and that group and the Royals together hired more than 30 lobbyists for the special session. But the national free-market, small-government group Americans for Prosperity and the Kansas Policy Institute, a free-market think tank, oppose the measure, and both have been influential with conservative Republicans.\n\nFree-market conservatives have long opposed state and local subsidies for specific businesses or projects. And economists who've studied pro sports teams have concluded in dozens of studies over decades that subsidizing their stadiums isn't worth the cost.\n\n\"Most of the money that gets spent on the Chiefs is money that would otherwise be spent on other entertainment projects,\" said Andrew Zimbalist, an economics professor at Smith College in central Massachusetts who has written multiple books about sports.\n\nKansas legislators consider the Chiefs and Royals in play because in April, voters on the Missouri side of the metro area refused to continue a local sales tax for the upkeep of the complex with their side-by-side stadiums. Missouri officials have said they'll do whatever it takes to keep the teams but haven't outlined any proposals.\n\nThe two teams' lease on their stadium complex runs through January 2031, but Korb Maxwell, an attorney for the Chiefs who lives on the Kansas side, said renovations on the team's Arrowhead Stadium should be planned seven or eight years in advance.\n\n\"There is an urgency to this,\" added David Frantz, the Royals' general counsel.\n\nSupporters of the stadium plan argued that economists' past research doesn't apply to the Chiefs and Royals. They said the bonds will be paid off with tax revenues that aren't being generated now and would never be without the stadiums or the development around them. Masterson said it's wrong to call the bonds a subsidy.\n\nAnd Maxwell said: \"For a town to be major league, they need major league teams.\"\n\nBut economists who've studied pro sports said similar arguments have been a staple of past debates over paying for new stadiums. Development around a new stadium lessens development elsewhere, where the tax dollars generated would go to fund services or schools, they said.\n\n\"It could still help Kansas and maybe hurt Missouri by the same amount,\" Zimbalist said. \"It's a zero-sum game.\"\n\nCopyright 2024 The Associated Press.

And Kansas, Missouri residents are in the dark", "body": "So, it has happened. Kansas has made a major play for Kansas City's teams.\n\nWe expected it. We all heard about the STAR bonds plan and knew that it would make its way into the special legislative session called when Kansas couldn't agree on a way to lower taxes.\n\nA lot of us figured it might pass, but maybe not overwhelmingly. The House passed the proposal 84-38, and the Senate with 27-8.\n\nIs it time to be scared yet?\n\nKansas City Mayor Quinton Lucas told The Star Editorial Board a few weeks ago that he wasn't \"freaking out\" over it and that negotiations were happening behind the scenes -- but of course, this was before the vote.\n\nThe day of Kansas' announcement, he doubled down on what he said:\n\n\"Kansas City and the State of Missouri will continue their ongoing negotiations with team leaders to keep the teams in the city and state that have welcomed, funded, and supported the success of both teams since the 1960s. Today's vote regrettably restarts the Missouri-Kansas incentive border war, creating leverage for the teams, but injecting even greater uncertainty into the regional stadium conversation. The vote provides only a speculative ability to sell bonds untethered to private funding plans, costs, locations, or discussion of the unknown consequences for taxpayers and existing businesses. We remain in the first quarter of the Kansas City stadium discussion.\"\n\n\"The first quarter.\" With the buzz surrounding the Kansas Legislature's offer, it feels more like the third quarter and Missouri is down by 14.\n\nI want to see the teams stay in Missouri. Sure, like many of us I have a personal connection, but even though I live in Missouri, and I used to live on the East Side within biking distance of the stadiums, I have a nonemotional reason: The teams are good for the state and good for Kansas City.\n\nI agree with Lucas: We're the city and state that has supported the teams for a long time, and I know we'll continue to support them into the future.\n\nOK, but you might ask, why didn't you support the tax bill? True, The Star Editorial Board didn't endorse Question 1 earlier this year, a proposed 3/8-cent sales tax for stadium construction and improvements. But I'd like to remind you of what the board said:\n\n\"We take this position firmly, but with some regret. Like most people in the Kansas City region, we are fans of the Kansas City Chiefs and Kansas City Royals. We want to see them succeed. We understand and agree that the two professional sports franchises are essential to the Kansas City area. ... Still, we are urging a no vote for this reason: They have not earned a yes.\"\n\nIt was such a specific plan, the move into an area of small businesses in the city center, unlike the Kansas proposal. The editorial talked about the lack of transparency, changing tactics at the last minute and just the general enigma of the overall plan. We didn't have enough information to make an informed decision, and we encouraged the teams to come back to the table.\n\nPerhaps that is happening, as Lucas hints. We don't know. Nobody's talking. And it brings up the same issues in the Kansas plan: Who's making the decisions? Not the people.\n\nWhat Kansas offers, in addition to a potentially faster plan, is one of advantage. In Kansas, the teams aren't beholden to voters - always an unknown. If we in Missouri were concerned about lack of transparency in Question 1, Kansas voters should be doubly concerned.\n\nAnd what about Kansas Gov. Laura Kelly's previous promise to avoid border wars? She claimed neutrality all the way up to the vote, but after, her excitement was evident: \"Kansas now has the opportunity to become a professional sports powerhouse with the Chiefs and Royals potentially joining Sporting KC as major league attractions, all with robust, revenue-generating entertainment districts surrounding them providing new jobs, new visitors, and new revenues that boost the Kansas economy.\"\n\nApparently, Missouri isn't calling a special session, and I'm not expecting any big moves until after the August primary. But you know, anything can happen.\n\nIt's a full-on border war, folks.

And at times, it's led to heated debate. While both teams have a lease at the Truman Sports Complex until the end of the decade, the topic remains at the forefront as a special session of the Kansas Legislature begins and discussion continues on the Missouri side. Will the Royals and Chiefs stay in Missouri? Will they go to Kansas? Will one stay and one go? Will both explore options outside of the immediate metro area? Officials on both sides of the state line seem to have one goal in common: Keeping both teams in the greater metro area. Here's a look back at how we got to this point, with many events happening a few decades before Patrick Mahomes, Travis Kelce, Salvador Perez, and John Sherman became household names in Kansas City. Western Wyandotte County, Kansas develops If either team moves across state lines, Wyandotte County figures to be a favorite on the Kansas side. That wasn't always the case. Spring 1993: The Kansas Legislature approves a new funding mechanism for major projects in the state: STAR Bonds. STAR bonds allow local governments to use bond proceeds to bolster tourist attractions. The repayment of those bonds is facilitated through a portion of the state and local sales tax revenue generated within the district, which is established between state and local authorities. December 1996: In an article published by The Kansas City Star, the International Speedway Corporation confirms they are considering the Kansas City metro area for a new racecar track. Spring 1997: The Kansas Legislature amends the STAR Bonds law, allowing Wyandotte County to use the tool to land the Kansas Speedway. November 1997: Voters in Wyandotte County decide to consolidate the city and county governments, forming the Unified Government of Wyandotte County. Carol Marinovich becomes the first Unified Government Mayor/CEO of Wyandotte County and Kansas. The move is credited by proponents with spurring development in the county. February 1998: Former Kansas Gov. Bill Graves signs a bill providing tax breaks to help build the Speedway in Western Wyandotte County. May 25, 1999: A groundbreaking ceremony is held at the site of the Speedway. June 2, 2001: Kansas Speedway hosts its first-ever race, an ARCA Series race. September 30, 2001: Kansas Speedway hosted the first-ever NASCAR Cup Series race, which star driver Jeff Gordon won. As Kansas Speedway hosts more and more events, STAR bonds have also helped develop a shopping center known as The Legends at Village West. Later in the decade, Sporting Kansas City (then known as the Kansas City Wizards) moved to the area and built Children's Mercy Park. Again, STAR Bonds are an important tool in making that happen. Children's Mercy Park hosted its first game on June 9, 2011. The move occurred after the initial goal was to build the stadium at the old Bannister Mall location. In March 2024, Wyandotte Economic Development Council President Greg Kindle told KMBC that Village West in Western Wyandotte County drew over 10 million visits. Royals look to downtown Kansas City, Chiefs publicly comment on Kansas possibility During the 1990s and early 2000s, Major League Baseball saw a number of its teams build new downtown stadiums. The Baltimore Orioles began the trend in 1992. San Diego, Detroit, Minnesota, Cincinnati, and Pittsburg were among other markets to see downtown stadiums. The debate gained traction in Kansas City, particularly on sports talk radio. Kansas City hosted the 2012 American League All-Star game and jumped into the spotlight with back-to-back pennants in 2014 and 2015. Two years later, things took another step. October 5, 2017: KMBC's Michael Mahoney reported Kansas City was studying four separate locations for a downtown stadium for the Royals. City officials acknowledged they spent $40,00 on the project. November 26, 2019: Kansas City businessman John Sherman is introduced as the new owner of the Kansas City Royals, increasing speculation about how long the Royals would remain at Kauffman Stadium. March 2020: The coronavirus pandemic delays the Major League Baseball season by several months. Major League Baseball does not allow fans in the stands during the regular season. Like most projects, the discussion of downtown baseball is put on the back burner during the pandemic. September 14, 2021: For the first time since taking over ownership of the team, Sherman tells reporters in Kansas City that it's time to start thinking about a new stadium in the next five to 10 years. He said he worked with the Chiefs and leaders in Jackson County, Missouri during the process. September 20, 2021: In perhaps a preview of the April 2024 elections, a new poll indicates that just barely one in three respondents say they would support a downtown baseball stadium - even if the Royals paid for all of it. March 29, 2022: In an interview with The Ringer's Kevin Clark, Chiefs president Mark Donovan said the Chiefs have considered options in the State of Kansas. March 31, 2022: Kansas Gov. Laura Kelly, at a public appearance in Johnson County, Kansas, said she would be \"all for it\" if the Chiefs moved to Kansas and that a Border War truce did not include the Chiefs. November 15, 2022: In an open letter to Royals fans, Sherman announces that the team is considering multiple locations for a new $2 billion ballpark village. \"We are excited to now share that we have several leading locations under close consideration, both in downtown Kansas City and close to it,\" Sherman said in the letter.December 14, 2022: The Royals kick off a series of public forums concerning a new stadium. Sherman says the Royals are looking at 14 different locations in downtown Kansas City or near downtown.Lead-up to Question 1 in Jackson CountyJanuary 31, 2023: The Royals announce at a meeting that they've narrowed their search to five locations. Sherman told KMBC later that week the team would request Jackson County taxpayers to continue the county's current 3/8th-cent sales tax. Among the locations considered were the East Village and the spot for the old Kansas City Star building. May 19, 2023: Two members of the Clay County Commission, along with the Mayor of North Kansas City, released a letter encouraging the Royals to move to Clay County, Missouri. The letter says developers envision a \"Wrigleyville\" type ballpark environment. June 15, 2023: The Kansas City Royals narrow their stadium locations to the East Village in Kansas City and North Kansas City. August 22, 2023: The Royals release renderings of stadiums for both the East Village and Clay County. Pictures and videos are released. September 5, 2023: An advertisement campaign is launched to encourage the Kansas City Royals to move to Clay County. September 20, 2023: The Kansas City Royals announced that they would delay announcing the location, saying the team was working with negotiators in Jackson and Clay County. October 26-27, 2023: The Kansas City Star reported that a new downtown stadium for the Royals would cost Jackson County taxpayers $4.4 billion to $6.4 billion. The Star said it obtained a confidential financial analysis of the proposed new stadium conducted by the staff of Jackson County Executive Frank White. The Royals denied the report, calling the numbers \"erroneous, misleading, and inconsistent.\" November 1, 2023: Kansas City Chiefs owner and CEO Clark Hunt said the franchise's priority is to \"figure out a way to renovate Arrowhead Stadium and extend its life.\" Hunt said the team communicated with the Royals, saying it was waiting for them to decide between Jackson County and Clay County. January 5, 2024: In a joint announcement, the Chiefs and Royals say they would remain in Jackson County if voters approved a 3/8-cent sales tax extension on the April ballot. The agreement features a new downtown stadium for the Royals and renovations for Arrowhead Stadium. January 7, 2024: KMBC's Kris Ketz reports the Royals were focusing on the old Kansas City Star building as its possible future homeJanuary 18, 2024: Jackson County Frank White vetoed a proposed stadium sales tax extension, saying it was not a good deal for Jackson County taxpayers. \"This proposed sales tax would generate over $2 billion from our residents, yet there is no clear understanding or assurance regarding the teams' commitments and contributions to the county,\" White said. \"It's not a good deal for taxpayers, and I cannot support an agreement that is not in their best interest.\" January 22, 2024: Days later, the Jackson County legislature overturned White's veto, meaning Jackson County residents would vote on the matter. February 13, 2024: Just hours after the Chiefs defended their Super Bowl championship in Las Vegas, the Royals announced that the Crossroads would be the site for a new stadium. The news received mixed reviews from business owners and patrons in the area. \"The arts, the music, the food and drink,\" Sherman said. \"I believe in my gut that the timing is right. I believe the timing is right the Royals to become residents of the Crossroads district. We are thrilled to announce our plans to contribute to community dynamics and long-term growth for the Crossroads.\"The stadium would be just blocks from the T-Mobile Center and Power & Light District. February 21-22: Dueling political committees form, one opposing the stadium plans and the other supporting them. The Committee to Keep the Chiefs and Royals in Jackson County would receive nearly $6 million in contributions from the two teams and included various business groups and political unions. The Committee Against New Royals Stadium Taxes, chaired by former Kansas City, Missouri councilwoman Becky Nace, formed in opposition. February 28, 2024: The Chiefs announce their plans to renovate Arrowhead Stadium to the tune of $800 million. Hunt said the family would invest $300 million toward the final tab.However, it would be unclear where the remaining $500 million would come from. The plan included a turf-covered space with a stage for game day and year-round events. The plans also included new upper concourse connections to create a 360-wrap around concourse on the upper level. The project also includes new suites, clubs, concessions, retail spaces, and restrooms. The Chiefs said they considered larger plans, but said it was no feasible int he area where the stadium stood. March 20, 2024: The Chiefs and Royals announce a $270 million community benefits proposal with Jackson County, Missouri. The Chiefs' agreement amounts to $126 million, while the Royals' CBA comes to approximately $140 million. Both teams' CBAs included funding for various community support initiatives, including affordable housing, childcare support, healthcare programs such as anti-violence and mental health awareness, diversity programs supporting minority and women-owned businesses, workforce assistance, education initiatives, environmental sustainability efforts, and public transportation benefits. March 27, 2024: Both the Chiefs and the Royals sign new leases, pending voter approval in Jackson County. The Chiefs' lease would last 25 years, while the Royals' lease terms would last 40 years. On the same day, the Royals announced changes to the Crossroads plan. March 30, 2024: Kansas City Mayor Quinton Lucas throws his support behind Question 1. April 2, 2024: On Election Day, the Royals and Crossroads Community Association, the organization of businesses and groups in the Crossroads, announced an agreement to help businesses impacted by the proposed stadium. April 2, 2024: By a 58-42 percent vote, voters in Jackson County rejected Question 1. \"We respect the voters of Jackson County and the results of the election today,\" Royals Chairman and CEO John Sherman said in a statement. \"We will take some time to reflect on and process the outcome and find a path forward that works out for the Royals and our fans.\"Lucas said voters \"rejected plans and processes they found inadequate.\" Meanwhile, Jackson County Executive Frank White said it was an opportunity for the teams and the county to restart the negotiations. Following Question 1's failure, Kansas makes it move for the Chiefs and RoyalsApril 4, 2024: In social media posts, the wife of Royals owner John Sherman said both the Chiefs and Royals are done negotiating with Jackson County. Marny Sherman's comments came on Facebook following the defeat of Question 1. \"Unfortunately neither team will work with Jackson County again,\" she said in a comment on a public Facebook post. \"They had been working behind the scenes for two years attempting to get a location approved. Which was I think Frank White's plan all along. In any case most unfortunate for sports fans in KC. The lack of leadership has lost the city two treasured assets. I mean if you don't support the Chiefs after 3 Super Bowl wins why would they stay? We will be lucky if both teams wind up in Kansas. At least still in the area!\"The Royals and Chiefs did not comment. April 5, 2024: Kansas City Mayor Quinton Lucas said he was in discussion with Sherman following Question 1's defeat. He added that he expected both teams to remain in Kansas City, Missouri, in the future. \"I think the voters said very simply they want a better plan, better communication, and a better deal long-term. What the voters did not say on Tuesday is that they want the Chiefs or the Royals to leave Jackson County or leave Kansas City, Missouri,\" Lucas told KMBC. April 30, 2024: After weeks -- and possibly years of speculation -- the State of Kansas makes its move. The Kansas Conference Committee on Senate and House Commerce met Monday and is taking up a bill to create a \"major professional sports STAR Bond district.\"Legislators, however, did not vote on any package since it was proposed hours before the session was up. April 30, 2024: What would a Chiefs stadium look like in Kansas City, Kansas? One idea of a domed-stadium was floated out there by Manica Architecture. The firm released a video and renderings of a proposed stadium in Western Wyandotte County. \"The design offers Kansas City the potential for an incredible new home for the Chiefs - and a modern stadium that brings Kansas City new opportunities to host a Super Bowl, NCAA Final Fours Championships, and a wider variety of concerts and family shows than ever before,\" David Manica, president and founder of Manica Architecture, said in a statement. May 16, 2024: Kansas Gov. Laura Kelly vetoes a tax cut bill, ensuring the Kansas Legislature would return for a special session. Expectations grew of a STAR Bonds package being proposed at the special session. June 4, 2024: Kansas Senate President Ty Masterson and House Speaker Dan Hawkins confirm they sent a joint letter to Chiefs owner Clark Hunt about the possibility of moving to Kansas. \"The Kansas Legislature is poised to present the Chiefs with a compelling opportunity to do just that with the Professional Sports Franchise STAR Bond Project set to be considered during the impending Special Legislative Session. We invite you to weigh in on the bill before us,\" the letter said in part. June 10, 2024: While most of the discussion about Kansas centered around the Chiefs, the Royals enter the picture for the Sunflower State, confirming their interest in exploring options. State records show both the Royals and Chiefs have hired lobbyists to represent them in 2024.\n\nThe future of the Kansas City Royals and Kansas City Chiefs in the metro area has been a hot topic.\n\nAnd at times, it's led to heated debate.\n\nWhile both teams have a lease at the Truman Sports Complex until the end of the decade, the topic remains at the forefront as a special session of the Kansas Legislature begins and discussion continues on the Missouri side.\n\nWill the Royals and Chiefs stay in Missouri?

Marny Sherman's comments came on Facebook following the defeat of Question 1.\n\n\"Unfortunately neither team will work with Jackson County again,\" she said in a comment on a public Facebook post. \"They had been working behind the scenes for two years attempting to get a location approved. Which was I think Frank White's plan all along. In any case most unfortunate for sports fans in KC. The lack of leadership has lost the city two treasured assets. I mean if you don't support the Chiefs after 3 Super Bowl wins why would they stay? We will be lucky if both teams wind up in Kansas. At least still in the area!\"\n\nThe Royals and Chiefs did not comment.\n\nApril 5, 2024: Kansas City Mayor Quinton Lucas said he was in discussion with Sherman following Question 1's defeat. He added that he expected both teams to remain in Kansas City, Missouri, in the future.\n\n\"I think the voters said very simply they want a better plan, better communication, and a better deal long-term. What the voters did not say on Tuesday is that they want the Chiefs or the Royals to leave Jackson County or leave Kansas City, Missouri,\" Lucas told KMBC.\n\nApril 30, 2024: After weeks -- and possibly years of speculation -- the State of Kansas makes its move. The Kansas Conference Committee on Senate and House Commerce met Monday and is taking up a bill to create a \"major professional sports STAR Bond district.\"\n\nOne idea of a domed-stadium was floated out there by Manica Architecture. The firm released a video and renderings of a proposed stadium in Western Wyandotte County.\n\n\"The design offers Kansas City the potential for an incredible new home for the Chiefs - and a modern stadium that brings Kansas City new opportunities to host a Super Bowl, NCAA Final Fours Championships, and a wider variety of concerts and family shows than ever before,\" David Manica, president and founder of Manica Architecture, said in a statement.\n\nMay 16, 2024: Kansas Gov. Laura Kelly vetoes a tax cut bill, ensuring the Kansas Legislature would return for a special session. Expectations grew of a STAR Bonds package being proposed at the special session.\n\nJune 4, 2024: Kansas Senate President Ty Masterson and House Speaker Dan Hawkins confirm they sent a joint letter to Chiefs owner Clark Hunt about the possibility of moving to Kansas.\n\n\"The Kansas Legislature is poised to present the Chiefs with a compelling opportunity to do just that with the Professional Sports Franchise STAR Bond Project set to be considered during the impending Special Legislative Session. We invite you to weigh in on the bill before us,\" the letter said in part.\n\nJune 10, 2024: While most of the discussion about Kansas centered around the Chiefs, the Royals enter the picture for the Sunflower State, confirming their interest in exploring options. State records show both the Royals and Chiefs have hired lobbyists to represent them in 2024.", "source": {"uri": "kmbc.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "KMBC 9"}, "authors": [{"uri":

Kelly and eight top legislative leaders would have to approve each deal with a vote in a public meeting.\n\nA deal would draw the boundaries of a district around a stadium and possibly another around a separate practice facility, and new state sales and alcohol tax revenues generated by shops, restaurants, bars and hotels within that district would pay off the bonds over 30 years.\n\nThe city and county could pledge tax revenues as well but are not required to do so, and the state also could use revenues from sports betting and state lottery ticket sales to back bonds as well.\n\nThe bonds could cover up to 70% of the costs of the new stadiums, though supporters of the plan don't expect that, anticipating that two stadiums together could cost $4 billion.\n\nThere is talk of a renewed economic 'border war'\n\nThe Kansas-Missouri border splits the 2.3 million-resident Kansas City area, and there's both Kansas City, Missouri, and Kansas City, Kansas. Much of the border is the median of State Line Road, and about 60% of the area's residents live on the Missouri side.\n\nA feud between the two states has existed for generations and most recently saw each state burning through tens of millions of dollars in subsides to pull existing businesses across the border. Officials on both sides came to see the contest as expensive and wasteful, and in 2019, Kelly, a Democrat, and Missouri Gov. Mike Parson, a Republican, signed a truce.\n\nKansas City, Missouri Mayor Quinton Lucas told reporters that Kansas' bid for the Chiefs and Royals restarted that economic \"border war.\"\n\n\"I do believe long-term that we're one place and it's better when we work together,\" he said during a news conference.\n\nBut Kelly doesn't agree that the states' truce has been violated, telling reporters this week that before the agreement, \"We never discussed the teams.\"\n\nKansas lawmakers tapped fears about the future\n\nKansas lawmakers acted after voters on the Missouri side refused in April to extend a local sales tax for keeping up the complex with the teams' side-by-side stadiums. Many Kansas lawmakers worried that if they didn't act, the teams might move out of the area altogether -- mentioning Salt Lake City, San Antonio and Nashville.\n\nSeveral economists who've studied professional sports were dubious that moving would make financial sense for either team -- especially the Chiefs, who have a rabid fan base that could be hard to build quickly elsewhere. In addition, after pro football's Rams moved nearly a decade ago from St. Louis to Los Angeles, the team's owner and the National Football League paid $790 million to settle a lawsuit filed by St. Louis interests.\n\nBut Kansas lawmakers noted that the Royals' major-league predecessor, the Athletics, moved to Oakland, California, in 1968 and now plan to relocate to Las Vegas. Kansas City lost major-league professional teams to other cities in the 1970s and 1980s, and the Chiefs came to Kansas City in 1963 after starting as the Dallas Texans four years earlier.\n\n\"The state of Missouri is known for losing professional teams,\" Kansas state Rep. Sean Tarwater, a Kansas City-area Republican, who helped lead the push for the stadium bill.\n\nKansas officials expect Missouri to respond\n\nMissouri officials have pledged to do what it takes to keep the Chiefs and Royals in their state but have not outlined specific proposals. Lucas saw the April vote as a sign that area residents wanted officials to discuss options other than extending the sales tax.\n\nLike their counterparts in Kansas, Missouri lawmakers have finished their annual regular session, but they are set to meet again Sept. 11 to consider vetoes by Parson.\n\nSupporters of Kansas' bid for the teams said it could spur an aggressive response from Missouri -- and added that if the teams get offers they like and opt to stay there, at least they're still in the Kansas City area.\n\nLucas said the teams now have \"exceptional leverage.\"\n\nKansas and Missouri describe the timeline differently\n\nThe lease on the complex with the Chiefs' and Royals' existing stadiums runs through January 2031, but the teams have said they must plan renovations or new stadiums years in advance for them to be ready on time. Both suggested that even seven years out, time for a decision is short.\n\nBackers of the Kansas bid said such comments justified acting Tuesday, during a one-day special session that Kelly called to consider tax cuts after lawmakers adjourned their regular annual session May 1. Some critics argued that legislators should have waited until their regular 2025 session starts in January so a plan could be properly vetted.\n\nBut Parson and Lucas have said the contest for the teams is only in its \"first quarter,\" using a football metaphor.\n\nAssociated Press writers Summer Ballentine, in Columbia, Missouri, and Jim Salter, in O'Fallon, Missouri, also contributed to this story.\n\nCopyright 2024 The Associated Press.

A new development has made the Chiefs' future a little clearer -- and it looks very much like it will not be in Jackson County.\n\nKansas state lawmakers on Tuesday voted in favor of a proposal to authorize state bonds that would help finance new facilities -- including new stadiums -- for Kansas City's Chiefs and Royals, who currently play right next door to Arrowhead at Kauffman Stadium. The teams' leases in Missouri expire on Jan. 1, 2031, and they could simply move 10 minutes across the border into Kansas, to facilities covered mostly by those state bonds.\n\nThe move would not cover a great distance but it would still be a seismic shift, ending decades of play for both franchises in Kansas City. Though any stadium move for the city's NFL and MLB teams is still a few years away, the state of Kansas is positioning itself to be ready for them -- Democratic governor Laura Kelly has indicated she would sign legislation to bring the Chiefs and Royals across state lines.\n\nHowever, some legislators remain wary that the Chiefs are using nearby Kansas as leverage to extract what they want out of Missouri state lawmakers and local leaders. The local economy in Kansas City (Missouri) would suffer if the Chiefs especially were to move -- given the team's success in recent years with Patrick Mahomes, Travis Kelce, and Andy Reid in town -- and that would result in a \"zero-sum game\" for the two Midwest states.\n\nThere remains a chance that Chiefs ownership works out a deal to renovate Arrowhead -- but they will have to do it without the level of public involvement they sought earlier this year.", "source": {"uri": "marca.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "MARCA"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kansas_City_Chiefs", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Kansas City Chiefs"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kansas_City,_Missouri", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Kansas City, Missouri"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Kansas City, Missouri"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jackson_County,_Missouri", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Jackson County, Missouri"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Jackson County, Missouri"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kansas", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Kansas"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Kansas"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arrowhead_Stadium", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Arrowhead Stadium"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sales_tax", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Sales tax"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Super_Bowl", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Super Bowl"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/County_(United_States)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "County (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bond_(finance)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Bond (finance)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Referendum", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Referendum"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kauffman_Stadium", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Kauffman Stadium"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kansas_City_Royals", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Kansas City Royals"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Missouri", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Missouri"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Missouri"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patrick_Mahomes", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Patrick Mahomes"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zero-sum_game", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Zero-sum game"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Travis_Kelce", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Travis Kelce"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andy_Reid", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Andy Reid"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Democratic Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Governor", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Governor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Major_League_Baseball", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Major League Baseball"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Midwestern_United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Midwestern United States"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laura_Kelly", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Laura Kelly"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Business/Transportation_and_Logistics/Moving_Services", "label": "dmoz/Business/Transportation and Logistics/Moving Services", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/Stadiums", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/Stadiums", "wgt": 18}, {"uri": "dmoz/Home/Moving_and_Relocating", "label": "dmoz/Home/Moving and Relocating", "wgt": 20}, {"uri": "dmoz/Home/Moving_and_Relocating/Moving", "label": "dmoz/Home/Moving and Relocating/Moving", "wgt": 20}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Roads_and_Highways/Photography", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Roads and Highways/Photography", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 72}], "image": "https://phantom-marca.unidadeditorial.es/70aa086d86749526950d7927c1c4b120/crop/0x0/1978x1318/resize/1200/f/webp/assets/multimedia/imagenes/2024/06/19/17188268097191.png", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9660256", "eventUri": "eng-9660256", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.411764705882353, "wgt": 186, "relevance": 1}

Officials in Jackson County, Missouri on Monday proposed a resolution for a countywide sales tax, local Kansas City outlet KSHB reported. Depending on how much the tax is -- the current options are each just a fraction of a cent -- it would either pay for capital improvements to the Chiefs' existing stadium or building a brand-new stadium in Missouri, according to the outlet.\n\nThe Chiefs' current home at the 50-year-old Arrowhead Stadium is in need of some improvement since it was last renovated in 2010.\n\nTeam President Mark Donovan said last summer the team is looking into three options: renovating the existing stadium, building a new one on-site, or moving to a new location entirely, Sports Illustrated reported.\n\nAnd back in 2022, Donovan even floated the idea of moving from Missouri to Kansas, according to the outlet.\n\nProponents of the move argue that if something isn't done to keep the Chiefs and the Royals local to Kansas City, the teams could choose to leave the Kansas-Missouri region altogether -- a development that could devastate local Taylor Swift fans.\n\nRepresentatives for the Kansas City Chiefs and Royals did not immediately respond to a request for comment from Business Insider.", "source": {"uri": "businessinsider.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Business Insider"}, "authors": [{"uri": "grace_eliza_goodwin@businessinsider.com", "name": "Grace Eliza Goodwin", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Independent_politician", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Independent politician"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kansas_City_Chiefs", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Kansas City Chiefs"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Missouri", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Missouri"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Missouri"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kansas", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Kansas"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Kansas"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Major_League_Baseball", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Major League Baseball"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Kansas_City_Star", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "The Kansas City Star"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sales_tax", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Sales tax"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Business_Insider", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Business Insider"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kansas_City_Royals", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Kansas City Royals"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sports_betting", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Sports betting"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bond_(finance)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Bond (finance)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/KSHB-TV", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "KSHB-TV"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arrowhead_Stadium", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Arrowhead Stadium"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Landon_Donovan", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Landon Donovan"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taylor_Swift", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Taylor Swift"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sports_Illustrated", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Sports Illustrated"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kansas_City,_Missouri", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Kansas City, Missouri"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Kansas City, Missouri"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jackson_County,_Missouri", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Jackson County, Missouri"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Jackson County, Missouri"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Paintball/Teams", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Paintball/Teams", "wgt": 16}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Robotics/Competitions", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Robotics/Competitions", "wgt": 18}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Major_League", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Major League", "wgt": 16}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/Stadiums", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/Stadiums", "wgt": 27}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Education_and_Training/Team_Building", "label": "dmoz/Business/Education and Training/Team Building", "wgt": 19}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 89}], "image": "https://i.insider.com/6671b3e3087acd2be9b497e8?width=1200&format=jpeg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9660256", "eventUri": "eng-9660256", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1843137254901961, "wgt": 186, "relevance": 1}

Laura Kelly is expected to sign or allow to become law without her signature, sets up a confrontation between Kansas and Missouri over the future of the teams. Benefiting are the teams, who can now ask Kansas to finance the bulk of the cost of building stadiums.\n\nThe vote represents a major bet by Kansas that both teams and their sports will remain popular, economically viable enterprises into the second half of the 21st century and comes despite extensive research that shows stadiums don't often generate enough revenues to pay back the public benefits they receive. It followed an intense lobbying blitz in favor of the plan, with both the Chiefs and Royals working to instill a sense of urgency among lawmakers.\n\n\"Are you going to step up today and take a leap of faith and make this happen - keep them in the metroplex and bring money to Kansas?\" Rep. Sean Tarwater, a Stilwell Republican who has championed the proposal, told lawmakers.\n\nThe House passed the bill 84-38. The Senate followed in a 27-8 vote. The votes scrambled typical partisan divides, with a mix of Republicans and Democrats providing the support necessary for passage.\n\nLawmakers passed the plan in a special session initially called for tax cuts. The legislation came after Jackson County voters in April rejected a stadiums sales tax that would have guaranteed the teams remain in Kansas City.\n\nThe broad support for the plan reflected a clear desire to ensure the Chiefs and the Royals don't leave the Kansas City region, as well as the lure of a major league sports team calling Kansas home. Still, a sizeable minority of lawmakers objected, warning that the Legislature was rushing into a process without adequate consideration.\n\nThe legislation authorizes Kansas to potentially issue Sales Tax and Revenue, or STAR bonds to pay for up to 70% of the cost of stadiums for one or both teams - up from the 50% in current law. A Chiefs stadium alone could cost at least $2 billion. A Royals stadium could be another $1.5 billion, if not more.\n\nThe debt would be repaid over 30 years by a combination of tax revenue from the stadiums and surrounding development, sports gambling revenue and Lottery revenue. As part of the bill, annual Lottery revenues above $71.5 million each year will now be redirected into a fund to help pay off the bonds, a change likely worth about $10 million a year.\n\n\"I understand the excitement behind the prospect, it is like this Christmas Eve and there's visions of sugar plums only it's royal blue and crimson and gold in this case,\" said Sen. Molly Baumgardner, a Louisburg Republican. \"But we haven't seen tremendously successful STAR bond projects that haven't brought us anything other than what would have naturally developed in that area.\"\n\nThe Chiefs and Royals have not promised to come to Kansas if the bill becomes law. But they have made positive comments about the legislation, describing it as an \"option\" as they evaluate where to head after their leases at the Truman Sports Complex expire in 2031.\n\n\"We're here talking about the Kansas City Chiefs coming to Kansas. How unbelievable is that?\" Korb Maxwell, an attorney representing the Chiefs, told lawmakers this week. \"It's just a pinch ourselves moment.\"\n\nSTAR bonds have been a controversial program used over the past two decades to build projects large and small across the state. It financed the Kansas Speedway, arguably the most successful use of the program, but also financed Prairiefire in Overland Park, which defaulted last year.\n\nA Chiefs or Royals stadium - or both - would mark the largest STAR bond project ever.\n\nThe bill passed in a lightning-fast single day. The House began debating the plan just hours after it was introduced. A single hearing - using unofficial bill text - was held on Monday.\n\n\"It is amazing to me the speed with which we can solve problems when they're oriented around wealth, when they're oriented around business,\" Rep. Jason Probst, a Hutchinson Democrat, said.\n\nKelly has not been outspoken about the proposal. On Monday the governor told reporters the plan was \"not something I'm going to invest a lot of energy in.\" Her chief of staff, Will Lawrence, later said the governor had no concerns \"that would warrant a veto.\"\n\nSen. J.R. Claeys, a Salina Republican, said a sense of urgency exists around securing the future of the Chiefs. He emphasized that the bill contains guardrails and that while the bill authorized 70% STAR bond financing, it doesn't require it.\n\n\"This is probably the least risky STAR bond project in the history of STAR bond projects in line with the Speedway,\" Claeys said.\n\nAcademic studies consistently show stadiums are not major drivers of economic growth. A 2022 review found that nearly all empirical studies found \"little to no tangible impacts of sports teams and facilities on local economic activity\" and that the level of subsidies typically provided for stadiums \"far exceeds any observed economic benefits.\"\n\nAny identified economic effects typically occurred in the area immediately surrounding a stadium, but those impacts weren't always present and \"can not be generally applied to all stadium projects.\"\n\nSome lawmakers voiced deep reservations with the proposal and the long-term consequences to the state. Rep. Bob Lewis, a Garden City Republican, said studies uniformly show stadium projects almost never yield the benefits promised. Taxpayers end up footing the bill, he said.\n\nThe legislation will allow the cannibalization of current sales tax revenue, Lewis argued. He also questioned claims that bondholders are the only individuals on the hook if a stadium project fails and said a default could place the state's credit rating at risk.\n\n\"Can you imagine the political pressure that would occur ... if the bondholders are not being paid?\" Lewis said.\n\nSome lawmakers have also questioned whether the Chiefs or the Royals would be able to secure STAR bond financing and then layer on additional economic development incentives. One program mentioned multiple times was PEAK, which allows some out-of-state businesses that relocate into Kansas to retain 95% of payroll withholding taxes for new jobs created.\n\n\"We don't have all the details of this,\" said Rep. Henry Helgerson, a Wichita Democrat.\n\nHelgerson said on the House floor that Kelly had used interest from federal pandemic dollars to aid the renovation of football practice facilities at Washburn University. He suggested the facility could be used for Chiefs training.\n\nTarwater responded that the new practice facility \"also could be used at some point to relocate the Chiefs training camp from St. Joseph, Missouri. That was just a byproduct of it.\"\n\nA spokesperson for Kelly didn't immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\nThe location of practice and training camp facilities is key because the bill allows STAR bond districts to be drawn around any team facility, not just the stadium itself. If the Chiefs move their training facility to Washburn, it could result in a STAR bond district in areas of central Topeka.\n\nTop lawmakers have final say\n\nCities and the counties would have the option to pledge local tax revenue from inside the STAR bond district toward repaying bonds, but wouldn't have to. But any local government that decides against pledging revenue would likely lose leverage during negotiations over the terms of a STAR bond agreement with one or both teams.\n\nThe bill authorizes the Kansas secretary of commerce, currently Lt. Gov. David Toland, to negotiate a STAR bond agreement. Any deal would have to be approved by the Legislative Coordinating Council, which includes top House and Senate leaders from both parties. Republicans hold a 6-2 majority on the council.\n\nWhile the LCC's vote on an agreement would be public, it could deliberate privately. The proposal keeps revenue reports filed on a STAR bond district confidential.\n\nSupporters of the plan spoke about it in glowing terms, offering a generational, even \"once in a lifetime\" opportunity.\n\nRep. Pam Curtis, a Kansas City, Kansas, Democrat, said Wyandotte County residents over the past few weeks have gone from opposition to excitement. She urged lawmakers to acknowledge that they won't have many details right now - such as an exact location and deal - but are setting up a framework for future negotiations.\n\nCurtis said many Wyandotte County residents are excited about the prospect of one or both of the teams coming to the area.\n\n\"They are excited about this opportunity and definitely Wyandotte County would welcome these discussions and the opportunity to bring a professional sports team to Kansas,\" Curtis said.\n\nSen. Rob Olson, an Olathe Republican, predicted that a new stadium would host a Super Bowl within a few years. Discussing the potential revenue the event would bring in, he called the proposal a \"gold mine for Kansas.\"\n\n\"We owe it to the Kansas City Chiefs if they want to come to Kansas,\" Olson said.",

The bill will go to Democratic Gov. Laura Kelly's desk.\n\nWhile the governor previously said she wasn't trying to recruit the Chiefs, she praised the plan in a statement, calling it a bipartisan initiative to drive economic growth.\n\n\"Kansas now has the opportunity to become a professional sports powerhouse with the Chiefs and Royals potentially joining Sporting KC as major league attractions,\" Kelly said.\n\nKelly will now need to sign the bill or let it become law without her signature to finalize the changes.\n\nIt's the latest in a months-long debate over the future home of the Super Bowl champion Chiefs. Jackson County, Missouri, voters rejected a sales tax to fund stadium renovations, which kicked off the interest of Kansas lawmakers to attract the Chiefs and the Royals.\n\nThe debate over the proposed tax incentives, called STAR Bonds, defied normal partisan divides.\n\nCritics on both sides of the aisle called the effort rushed and opaque. Despite ultimately supporting the bill, Democratic Rep. Jason Probst said corporate tax incentives shouldn't be the priority.\n\n\"When we have discussions about homelessness, or hunger, or childhood poverty, or any of these issues that are real concerns to people in the state, we do not see this kind of collective effort,\" Probst said.\n\nRepublican Sen. Virgil Peck said the one-day special session did not provide enough time to fully weigh the benefits and risks of the plan.\n\n\"I'm not voting no to the Kansas City Chiefs. I'm voting no to the rapidity of the process that we went through today,\" he said.\n\nOthers united in bipartisan support of the bill, with many citing memories of growing up rooting for the Chiefs and Royals and excitement at the prospect of bringing the teams to Kansas.\n\nThe bill modifies an existing tool known as STAR Bonds. If sports franchises, state economic officials and lawmakers reach a deal, investors would purchase bonds, which are essentially long-term loans. Developers would use that money to help build up to two stadiums and one practice facility in Kansas.\n\nThe bonds would be paid back by diverting sales tax revenue generated in the district to repay the loans. Also, any revenue from liquor sales would go towards paying the bonds.\n\nThe development would need to cost more than $1 billion and up to 70% of the projects could be funded with the bonds, as opposed to the normal 50% restriction on other STAR Bond sites.\n\nIn addition to the financing, the bill also gives the state more power to keep negotiations secret by bypassing the Kansas Open Meetings Act and Kansas Open Records Act. It gives the chairperson of the Legislature Coordinating Council the authority to close meetings on the topic, although votes on an agreement would be made in public.\n\nAny documents related to the deal would be exempt from open records law until an agreement is finalized and executed.\n\nRepresentative Sean Tarwater, who fielded questions throughout the session on the specifics of the bill, said keeping negotiations secret would help prevent other states from outbidding Kansas.\n\nLawmakers originally convened in a special session to pass a tax relief package after Kelly vetoed several previous proposals and called them back to work more on the issue. But the STAR Bonds bill overshadowed tax cuts in the weeks leading up to the session.\n\nBefore the voting was even done in the Kansas Statehouse, a Missouri official was lamenting the competition. Jackson County, Missouri, Executive Frank White said in a statement that the effort violates a 2019 agreement to end the \"economic border war\" as the states competed with development resources to attract projects across the state line.\n\n\"Our resources should be used wisely to improve the lives of our residents, not wasted on bidding wars that only serve to drain public funds and divide our region,\" White said.\n\nIn a statement following the Kansas Senate vote, Kansas City, Missouri, Mayor Quinton Lucas voiced his dismay.\n\n\"Today's vote regrettably restarts the Missouri-Kansas incentive border war,\" he said.\n\nZane Irwin reports on politics, campaigns and elections for the Kansas News Service.

Prior to Arrowhead, the team played at nearby Municipal Stadium from 1963 to 1971 after being relocated to Kansas City by owner Lamar Hunt.\n\nAccording to the new plan, state bonds would cover up to 70 percent of each new stadium, paying them off over 30 years with revenues from sports betting, state lottery ticket sales and new sales and alcohol taxes collected from shopping and entertainment districts around the new stadiums.\n\nIn addition to the Chiefs, the plan would also erect a new stadium for Major League Baseball's Kansas City Royals, who have played in Kauffman Stadium, which shares a massive parking lot with Arrowhead, since 1973.\n\nThe Chiefs' current deal with Arrowhead Stadium runs through 2031, so if the move happens, star tight end Travis Kelce might not be involved. Kelce, 34, is currently signed through the end of the 2027 NFL season, but he hasn't yet indicated whether he'll keep playing after that.\n\nMeanwhile, quarterback Patrick Mahomes signed a 10-year contract extension with the Chiefs in 2020.\n\n\"Kansas now has the opportunity to become a professional sports powerhouse with the Chiefs and Royals potentially joining Sporting KC as major league attractions,\" Kansas Governor Laura Kelly said in a statement after the vote, \"all with robust, revenue-generating entertainment districts surrounding them providing new jobs, new visitors and new revenues that boost the Kansas economy.\"\n\nWhile the Chiefs have made no promises on leaving Missouri for Kansas, the franchise released a statement of their own after the vote. \"We look forward to exploring the options this legislation may provide,\" the Chiefs said.\n\nKansas Representative Stephanie Sawyer Clayton admitted she wasn't thrilled about the prospect of the Chiefs coming across state lines because \"I don't like misogynistic dude bro culture,\" pointing to the Hunt family's support of an anti-abortion constitutional amendment in 2022.\n\nHowever, Clayton still voted \"yes\" as a way to support the efforts of Governor Kelly.\n\n\"I want a woman getting credit for sports things. So I'm doing it out of spite, frankly,\" she admitted.\n\nOf course, things weren't so joyous on the Missouri side of the state line, with Mayor Quinton Lucas promising to \"lay out a good offer\" to keep both teams where they are.\n\n\"Today was largely, in my opinion, about leverage,\" Lucas said. \"And the teams are in an exceptional leverage position.\"\n\nEssentially, Lucas argued, the Chiefs

On the first day of a special legislative session, the Kansas House passed a bill that would finance new homes for the Chiefs and the Royals.\n\nIn a Kansas City Star article that describes the burgeoning border battle between Missouri and Kansas as a \"confrontation\" between the two states for the two teams, Kansas Senator Rob Olsen predicts that a new Chiefs stadium in Kansas \"would host a Super Bowl within a few years.\"\n\nThat's the curveball that could have a major impact on the outcome of the effort to keep the Chiefs in the region. Improvements to Arrowhead Stadium wouldn't bring the Super Bowl to town, unless the upgrades include a roof. A new stadium in Kansas would be a dome, which could lead to the usual cold-weather city quid pro quo -- as the NFL has done in Minneapolis (twice), Indianapolis, and Detroit (twice).\n\nIn discussing the situation during Wednesday's #PFTPM, I did some thinking out loud on the question of why the Chiefs didn't more specifically float Kansas as an alternative to Missouri before the failed vote in April?\n\nIt could have been phrased as a matter of state pride. If you don't extend the sales tax, Kansas will take your teams.\n\nThe question is whether that truly would have moved the needle. If, in the end, the \"or else\" was that the Chiefs (and Royals) would just be playing in a neighboring community, maybe Jackson County residents would have been more determined to not approve the measure. If the Chiefs are still playing in short driving distance, who cares whether the stadium is in Missouri or Kansas?\n\nRegardless, the battle is now joined. The Star separately points out that Missouri will now try to finagle the financing not through the ballot box (which is a virtually guaranteed failure in any jurisdiction) but through the usual (and far more effective) backroom political maneuverings.\n\nThe Chiefs have yet to tip their hand. Which is smart. They should sit back and wait for Kansas and Missouri to pressure each other to do better and better and better and then make their move.\n\nHowever it plays out, the Chiefs will play at Arrowhead through 2030.

(WDAF) -- For the first time, Kansas lawmakers heard a bill to lure the Kansas City Royals or Chiefs across the state line.\n\nLawmakers discussed the 40-page bill to lure the Chiefs or the Royals to Kansas during a committee informational meeting Monday afternoon.\n\nThis is ahead of the special legislative session called by Governor Laura Kelly, which formally opens Tuesday. During that special session, Kansas lawmakers will be focused on tax cuts, but they're also expected to consider the stadium STAR bond bill.\n\nThe legislation would allow STAR bonds to cover 70% of stadium projects.\n\nThe current STAR bond law in the Sunflower state covers only 50% of the cost of development projects.\n\n\"The bondholders themselves are the ones that are liable for the STAR bonds. The taxpayer is not liable for the STAR bonds,\" Ron Ryckman with Scoop and Score said.\n\nSales tax revenue from businesses in the proposed sports stadium development districts would be set aside to cover the bond debt.\n\nThe proposed legislation would also allow up to 100% of liquor sales tax revenue inside the stadium entertainment district to be used to pay off these bonds.\n\nGroups for and against the stadium bill were at the capitol Monday to testify during the committee meeting.\n\n\"We're talking about a very exciting opportunity, probably the largest economic development deal to come to Kansas, and we're talking about STAR bonds and what they are,\" Ryckman said.\n\n\"Educate folks on how they work. Talk about who's ultimately responsible for the payment, the bonds, and who's liable. Talk about some of the excitement, the economic excitement that happens when you bring in the Chiefs or the Royals, and you talk about the Super Bowl. Think about having a domed stadium, the extra concerts, and other things that could come to the overall region.\"\n\nDeputy State Director For Americans for Prosperity, Jon Leuth, says they'd like to see the special session stay focused on tax cuts for Kansans.\n\n\"Our biggest focus for a special session is that it was called for tax relief for Kansans, and that's where the focus should be,\" Leuth explained. \"Not on getting distracted with a number of other issues.

Their plan would use revenues from sports betting, the state lottery and new taxes raised from the area around each new stadium.\n\nTop Republicans in the GOP-controlled Legislature also said the stadium proposal is their second priority during the special session, behind cutting income and property taxes. Democratic Gov. Laura Kelly called the special session to consider tax cuts, but she cannot limit what lawmakers consider -- creating an opening for a plan to woo the Chiefs and Royals.\n\n\"We definitely need to demonstrate that we're getting relief to our citizens,\" said Senate President Ty Masterson, a Wichita-area Republican who is backing the plan.\n\nMany lawmakers have argued that voters would be angry if the state helped finance new stadiums without cutting taxes. Kelly vetoed three tax-cutting plans before legislators adjourned their regular annual session May 1, but she and top Republican lawmakers have drafted a compromise measure to reduce taxes by $1.23 billion over the next three years.\n\nThe first version of the stadium-financing plan emerged in late April, but lawmakers didn't vote on it before adjourning. It would have allowed state bonds to finance all stadium construction costs, but the latest version caps the amount at 70%, and it says legislative leaders and the governor must sign off on any bonding plan.\n\nSupporters of the plan also modified it so that it only applies to professional football and Major League Baseball stadiums, instead of any professional sports stadium for at least 30,000 spectators. Bonds would be paid off over 30 years.\n\n\"We're trying to bring something grand to the state of Kansas,\" said state Rep. Sean Tarwater, a Kansas City-area Republican leading the push for a stadium plan.\n\nFree-market conservatives in Kansas have long opposed state and local subsidies for specific businesses or projects. And economists who've studied pro sports teams have concluded in dozens of studies over decades that subsidizing their stadiums isn't worth the cost.\n\n\"Most of the money that gets spent on the Chiefs is money that would otherwise be spent on other entertainment projects,\" said Andrew Zimbalist, an economics professor at Smith College in central Massachusetts who has written multiple books about sports.\n\nKelly told reporters Monday that she won't \"invest a lot of energy\" in a stadium plan, letting lawmakers lead. She and Missouri Gov. Mike Parson, a Republican, signed an agreement in 2019 to end years of each state using subsidies to steal the other state's jobs in the Kansas City area, but Kelly argued that their truce doesn't apply to the Chiefs and Royals.\n\n\"We never discussed the teams,\" she said.\n\nKansas legislators consider the Chiefs and Royals in play because in April, voters on the Missouri side of the metro area refused to continue a local sales tax for the upkeep of the complex with their side-by-side stadiums. Missouri officials have said they'll do whatever it takes to keep the teams but haven't outlined any proposals.\n\nThe two teams' lease on their stadium complex runs through January 2031, but Korb Maxwell, an attorney for the Chiefs who lives on the Kansas side, said renovations on the team's Arrowhead Stadium should be planned seven or eight years in advance.\n\n\"There is an urgency to this,\" added David Frantz, the Royals' general counsel.\n\nSupporters of the stadium plan argued that economists' past research doesn't apply to the Chiefs and Royals. They said the bonds will be paid off with tax revenues that aren't being generated now and would never be without the stadiums or the development around them. Masterson said it's wrong to call the bonds a subsidy.\n\nAnd Maxwell said: \"For a town to be major league, they need major league teams.\"\n\nBut economists who've studied pro sports said similar arguments have been a staple of past debates over paying for new stadiums. Development around a new stadium lessens development elsewhere, where the tax dollars generated would go to fund services or schools, they said.\n\n\"It could still help Kansas and maybe hurt Missouri by the same amount,\" Zimbalist said. \"It's a zero-sum game.\"", "source": {"uri": "daytondailynews.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Dayton Daily News"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

Then the Kansas Senate voted 27-8 to pass the measure.\n\n\"Are you going to step up today and take a leap of faith and make this happen - keep them in the metroplex and bring money to Kansas?\" Rep. Sean Tarwater of Stilwell asked lawmakers during the House debate, per the Kansas City Star.\n\nKansas Governor Laura Kelly is expected to sign the bill.\n\nWhen the original proposal was made earlier in the spring, lawmakers said it was intended to attract either the Chiefs or the Kansas City Royals (if not both) across the state line. This became possible after Jackson County voted down an extension of a 3/8 cent sales tax that would have kept the team in Arrowhead Stadium for at least 25 years.\n\nStill, the Kansas legislation had been written so that it could have been used to build facilities for teams in other professional sports leagues. But now, the Major Professional Sports Franchise (MPSF) bill is limited to NFL and MLB teams -- and says teams must currently be \"adjacent\" to Kansas. This effectively limits the teams eligible to take advantage of the new law to the Chiefs and Royals.\n\nOn Monday, lawyers representing both teams spoke at legislative hearings, marking the first time that either team has publicly engaged with Kansas lawmakers over the proposal.\n\n\"Missouri spoke [and] Jackson County spoke. They had their opportunity,\" noted the Chiefs' representative Korb Maxwell. \"But now there's a moment for Kansas to step up and [provide] an option for us all here.\"\n\n\"This STAR bonds legislation you're considering offers a very good opportunity for us to explore an option in the state of Kansas,\" said Royals envoy David Frantze, via the Kansas City Star.\n\nThere's a good reason both teams believe this could be a good option for them. They would have to provide just 30% of their project's total construction cost, which is expected to be between $2 billion and $3 billion. (Typically, a STAR bonds project requires the developer to carry 50% of the cost). That means each team will be on the hook for just $600 million to $900 million of the total costs.\n\nThe money would be raised by selling STAR bonds to private investors. They will assume all risk; at this time, local, county and state governments will not guarantee these bonds. Investors will be repaid by sales tax revenue from the STAR bond district over 30 years. (Normally, STAR bonds have a 20-year life).\n\nThe MPSF district's state alcohol taxes (in excess of current revenues) and money from the state's Attracting Professional Sports to Kansas Fund (a portion of the state's yearly lottery revenue) could also be pledged toward repayment of the bonds. At their discretion, the district's local and county governments may also pledge their sales taxes from the district toward these repayments.\n\nWhile STAR bonds were successfully used to finance Wyandotte County's Kansas Speedway and Children's Mercy Park, critics of the bill are concerned there won't be enough revenue.\n\n\"When the project fails to generate enough sales tax revenue to cover its debt, future lawmakers will have to decide to bail out the project with additional taxpayer dollars or have the state's creditworthiness take a hit,\" said University of Colorado-Denver professor Geoffrey Propheter in a social media post. He said such an event \"may increase the state's future borrowing costs -- and residents' cost for debt-financed goods and services.\"\n\nLegislators might also issue bonds repaid directly from the state's sports gambling and lottery revenues. Supporters say these other revenue streams could support bonds generating as much as $1 billion.\n\nBut even though these plans were presented as a way to build the stadiums without taxpayer money -- Rep. Tarwater called it a \"destination tax\" to finance the stadiums -- there was plenty of opposition among both Democrats and Republicans in the statehouse. A significant number of Kansans have also been opposed.\n\n\"This is the first time in my legislative career that I have ever seen district opinion, constituent opinion, at a dead heat,\" according to veteran Overland Park Rep. Stephanie Sawyer Clayton, telling the Kansas City Star her vote \"will be a difficult decision.\"\n\nClayton ultimately voted for the bill.\n\nOnce the governor signs the bill, it becomes law on July 1. If no team has taken advantage of its provisions, it expires July 1, 2025. So the Chiefs and Royals have one year to decide if they want to move to new facilities across the state line -- or find a way to remain in Missouri.\n\nJackson County legislator Manny Abarca has already fired the first return shot in the newest Missouri-Kansas border war. On Monday, he submitted a resolution to create a countywide 3/16-cent capital improvement sales tax that would be voted upon during the November general election. Its purpose is \"retaining the Kansas City Chiefs sports team in Jackson County.\"\n\nWhen voters defeated the 3/8-cent sales tax extension in April, the money would have been split between the Chiefs and Royals. Abarba's proposal for a sales tax that is half of the tax voted down in April will effectively separate the two teams at the ballot box.\n\nAbarca also intends to introduce alternative resolutions with the same goal. To be placed on the November ballot, the county legislature must work out and approve a final version by August 27.\n\nBy then, Missouri lawmakers might also be involved.\n\nIn a recent interview with the Star, Missouri House majority leader Jonathan Patterson of Lee's Summit sounded like his associates weren't in a hurry to respond.\n\n\"I think after the primary [election], we will be able to look at possibly having a special session to address this issue,\" he said. \"Before the primary, there would be a lot of politics involved in this -- and I think once that's out of the way, it'll make it easier for us to come up with a plan.\"\n\nNow that the Kansas bill is a reality, will the Missouri legislature make it a bigger priority? We're about to find out.", "source": {"uri": "arrowheadpride.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Arrowhead Pride"}, "authors": [{"uri": "john_dixon@arrowheadpride.com", "name": "John Dixon", "type":

Sean Tarwater, a Republican from Stilwell, said Missouri had a history of losing professional sports teams and implored fellow House members to pass the legislation.\n\n\"I ask you today, do you really want to put that type of an economic generation in the hands of the state of Missouri?\" Tarwater said just before the vote.\n\nPassage of the bill would represent a monumental step in Kansas lawmakers' attempts to court the two teams, both of which support the proposal. Both teams have signaled a willingness to move from their current stadiums at the Truman Sports Complex in Kansas City, Missouri.\n\nThe bill was not voted on by any legislative committee. It would expand the state's Sales Tax and Revenue (STAR) Bond program, which is meant to help finance tourism and entertainment districts, to help pay for a professional football or baseball stadium of at least $1 billion.\n\nA developer building a stadium under the program would be eligible to finance up to 70% of the project cost by issuing bonds and repaying them with the increased sales tax collections from the stadium site. The expansion would have initially allowed up to 75% of project costs but was tweaked before introduction. Debt on a stadium constructed under the expansion wouldn't have to be repaid for 30 years instead of the normal 20.\n\nThe project could also receive a boost from liquor taxes generated in the STAR Bond district and revenues from a fund Kansas created when it legalized sports betting.\n\nThe bill limits the eligibility to National Football League or Major League Baseball teams currently near Kansas. The financing mechanism could be used for both stadiums and training facilities.\n\nBoth teams have pressed lawmakers in recent weeks to pass the bill with representatives from the Royals hosting dinner for Democratic lawmakers at a steakhouse Monday night and the Chiefs throwing a lunchtime block party Tuesday steps from the Capitol.\n\nEarlier this month, a nonprofit called \"Scoop and Score Inc.\" launched to advocate for a Kansas stadium deal. The organization, which does not have to disclose its donors, hired 30 lobbyists to advocate for the STAR Bond expansion legislation.", "source": {"uri": "yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title":

Scoop and Score started a campaign in early June to pressure lawmakers to attract the Chiefs to the state through emails and a petition they say surpassed 11,000 signatures.\n\nThe proposed bill would allow the state to issue up to 70% of a project's cost to Sales Tax and Revenue Bonds for a professional team in the National Football League or Major League Baseball from an adjacent state.\n\nThe legislation is expected to be considered during Tuesday's special session after lawmakers pass a tax cut plan.\n\nSTAR Bonds use sales taxes from a project and the surrounding business district and redirect them to pay off the interest on a bond. Proponents have painted the bonds as the perfect tool to attract the Chiefs because they are funded by people who choose to go to the games rather than a blanket sales tax on a county-level.\n\nThe tailor-made STAR Bonds could only go to projects that seat more than 30,000 people.\n\n\"STAR Bonds are the right financing tool for building sports stadiums in Kansas,\" said Dan Murray, a lobbyist representing Scoop and Score. \"STAR Bonds were designed to develop large scale commercial, economic and tourism projects. For nearly two decades STAR Bonds have given Kansas a leg up in attracting major investments: the Kansas Speedway, Children's Mercy Park, Village West.\"\n\nAnother detail shared about the facility include a planned 20,000 parking spots to retain the tailgating tradition in Kansas City. With the seating and parking, as well as a potential practice facility, the footprint isn't likely to greatly exceed Arrowhead's, which is 180 acres with both stadiums.\n\nThe Chiefs lawyer through Korb Maxwell said there's not a specific buyer or location in mind, but representatives from Wyandotte County also spoke in favor of moving the Chiefs across state lines. The Village West area is considered among the top contenders for a stadium, and the bill explicitly allows the overlap of STAR Bond business zones like the several existing ones in Village West.\n\nSTAR Bonds would make up the bulk of the funding, but the bill also allows the state to use funds from the Attracting a Professional Sports Team fund, which gets its revenue from sports betting. The total funding for a stadium is expected to be between $2-3 billion.\n\nBut opponents say the use of STAR Bonds doesn't create economic incentives, it just shifts it around the state, redirects funding that would normally go to local governments and that as written there's little transparency for the process.\n\n\"If the free market was deciding, we wouldn't be having this conversation right now,\" said Michael Austin, policy director for Americans for Prosperity Kansas, a conservative advocacy group.\n\nWill Lawrence, chief of staff for Gov. Laura Kelly, gave neutral neutral testimony on the bill, and said if it came across the governor's desk today without any concerning changes during the legislative process that she'd sign it.",

Now, many are wondering: What is Missouri's plans?\n\nIn 2019, Democratic Kansas Gov. Laura Kelly and Republican Missouri Gov. Mike Parson signed a truce to stop pulling existing businesses across the border. Now, some officials in the Kansas City area are saying this battle over the Chiefs and Royals has restarted the \"border war\" but Missouri lawmakers say they are unlikely to respond at the moment.\n\n\"I don't think it's an immediate concern,\" House Majority Leader Jon Patterson, R-Lee's Summit, said. \"I think it's something we have to keep an eye on, but the chances of them moving in the next six months, I don't think, is really a possibility.\"\n\nKansas lawmakers hope to entice the Kansas City Chiefs and Royals to the Sunflower State by offering bonds to help pay for new stadiums.\n\n\"I think with what Kansas has done, I think it will have to be something near that size and scope to keep these professional sports teams here,\" Patterson said. \"I know many people that work at the stadiums; there are many people that benefit, the state and the municipalities benefit from the tax revenue. I think we're seeing another state come in and show enthusiasm for taking the sports teams away that we should match that.\"\n\nTuesday evening, the Kansas General Assembly sent the Sales Tax and Revenue, or STAR bond, legislation to the governor's desk. The bill comes after Jackson County voters rejected a stadium sales tax back in April, which at that time got Missouri lawmakers talking.\n\n\"The people spoke and if you listen to the voters, you hear the voters of Jackson County, they will tell you this is not something against the Chiefs and the Royals,\" Sen. Barbara Washington, D-Kansas City, said following the vote.\n\nAfter the election, some pushed back against the idea of Missouri using public money to keep the teams in the state.\n\n\"I know of no path in the Missouri Senate where we're going to any public funding of sports stadiums,\" Sen. Bill Eigel, R-Weldon Spring, said. \"I think that would be resisted vociferously and extensively.\"\n\nKansas' legislation would allow bonds to pay for up to 70% of the stadium costs for both teams, paid back by sports betting and lottery revenue.\n\nPatterson, who is expected to be the next House Speaker, said he spoke with Parson's team about a future plan. While no team has promised to move over the state line, it's something Missouri is watching closely.\n\n\"You'll see an element of state involvement, whether that's bonding or tax incentives,\" Patterson said. \"I don't think it's even possible for us to even have a special session right now, but I do think in six months and before the next session starts, we really ought to have a plan in place and work in the next session to execute that plan.\"\n\nParson told reporters last week that he will work at both the state and local level, along with the teams' leadership, but does not see a need at the moment for a special session. He went on to say he will spend his final months in office putting a deal together to make sure Missouri remains competitive.", "source": {"uri": "ozarksfirst.com", "dataType": "news", "title":

With the stroke of the pen from Gov. Laura Kelly, that offer will be on the table.\n\nDecision-makers in Wyandotte County insist they're not reigniting a business-based border war between Kansas and Missouri. State and local leaders seem invigorated by the legislature's bold move. STAR bonds have proven to provide hundreds of millions of dollars to fund large projects in Kansas.\n\nIndependence workers targeted in series of attacks\n\nKCK Mayor Tyrone Garner, like others in Wyandotte County, says his top priority is preventing the Chiefs and Royals from relocating outside the Kansas City metro. Mayor Garner adds this isn't a power play, since Jackson County, Missouri voters rejected a plan to build a downtown Kansas City baseball home for the Royals in April.\n\n\"I think it's just how do we all work -- whether it's in the great state of Missouri or the great state of Kansas -- to find incentives and options we can project forward and hopefully, those organizations will see value to keep them here in the Kansas City metropolitan area,\" Mayor Garner said.\n\nKansas Sen. David Haley has voiced his interest in a downtown baseball stadium in Kansas City, Kansas. Others at the legislative level believe the Legends has space to accommodate a new indoor football stadium for the Chiefs. Johnson County is also being mentioned as a possible home for a new practice facility for the Chiefs.\n\nDaniel Silva, who leads the KCK Chamber, and his associates sent written testimony in support of STAR bonds this week.\n\n\"If there was an announcement around a sports complex, I think that would bring other development. I think local businesses would be excited about the possibilities to do business within or around the sports complex,\" Silva said.\n\nMayor Quinton Lucas welcomes second child to Kansas City\n\nLocal leaders in Kansas City, Missouri, and those at the state level are likely to react to the action from Topeka soon. Meanwhile, the next move in the process might belong to lawmakers in Kansas, who will be expected to present an aggressive package to the Chiefs and Royals.\n\nCopyright 2024 Nexstar Media, Inc.

The proposal also included a plan to build a new stadium for the Kansas City Royals. This has prompted the state of Kansas to get involved, as they'd love the opportunity to welcome the increased revenue stream that would come with the Chiefs and Royals moving across the border.\n\nOn Tuesday, the Kansas House of Representatives overwhelmingly passed legislation to support moving the Chiefs and Royals to their state, with an 84-38 vote tally.\n\nHowever, while this is a big step in the future of the Chiefs and Royals, it means nothing yet. The next step will be for the bill to head to the Senate, where it will be voted upon once again, though not on a local stage that benefits the state of Kansas.\n\nNo matter what happens at the Senate, the Chiefs still have a lease to continue playing football in Missouri through 2030, so even if Kansas wins again, we'd still be a long way toward any real movement from taking place.\n\nThe Chiefs can still strike a deal to extend their lease, or find a new agreement at any point to prevent any further movement toward heading from Missouri to Kansas.

Now, many are wondering: What is Missouri's plans?\n\nIn 2019, Democratic Kansas Gov. Laura Kelly and Republican Missouri Gov. Mike Parson signed a truce to stop pulling existing businesses across the border. Now, some officials in the Kansas City area are saying this battle over the Chiefs and Royals has restarted the \"border war\" but Missouri lawmakers say they are unlikely to respond at the moment.\n\n\"I don't think it's an immediate concern,\" House Majority Leader Jon Patterson, R-Lee's Summit, said. \"I think it's something we have to keep an eye on, but the chances of them moving in the next six months, I don't think, is really a possibility.\"\n\nKansas lawmakers hope to entice the Kansas City Chiefs and Royals to the Sunflower State by offering bonds to help pay for new stadiums.\n\n\"I think with what Kansas has done, I think it will have to be something near that size and scope to keep these professional sports teams here,\" Patterson said. \"I know many people that work at the stadiums; there are many people that benefit, the state and the municipalities benefit from the tax revenue. I think we're seeing another state come in and show enthusiasm for taking the sports teams away that we should match that.\"\n\nTuesday evening, the Kansas General Assembly sent the Sales Tax and Revenue, or STAR bond, legislation to the governor's desk. The bill comes after Jackson County voters rejected a stadium sales tax back in April, which at that time got Missouri lawmakers talking.\n\n\"The people spoke and if you listen to the voters, you hear the voters of Jackson County, they will tell you this is not something against the Chiefs and the Royals,\" Sen. Barbara Washington, D-Kansas City, said following the vote.\n\n'Big Boy,' the 1.1 million pound train, passing through Missouri\n\nAfter the election, some pushed back against the idea of Missouri using public money to keep the teams in the state.\n\n\"I know of no path in the Missouri Senate where we're going to any public funding of sports stadiums,\" Sen. Bill Eigel, R-Weldon Spring, said. \"I think that would be resisted vociferously and extensively.\"\n\nKansas' legislation would allow bonds to pay for up to 70% of the stadium costs for both teams, paid back by sports betting and lottery revenue.\n\nPatterson, who is expected to be the next House Speaker, said he spoke with Parson's team about a future plan. While no team has promised to move over the state line, it's something Missouri is watching closely.\n\n\"You'll see an element of state involvement, whether that's bonding or tax incentives,\" Patterson said. \"I don't think it's even possible for us to even have a special session right now, but I do think in six months and before the next session starts, we really ought to have a plan in place and work in the next session to execute that plan.\"\n\nParson told reporters last week that he will work at both the state and local level, along with the teams' leadership, but does not see a need at the moment for a special session. He went on to say he will spend his final months in office putting a deal together to make sure Missouri remains competitive.\n\nCopyright 2024 Nexstar Media, Inc. All rights reserved.

Laura Kelly would allow Kansas to issue bonds to cover up to 70% of the costs of a new stadium in the state for the Chiefs and another for Major League Baseball's Kansas City Royals.\n\nThe state would pay off its bonds over 30 years with revenues from sports betting, Kansas Lottery ticket sales and new sales and alcohol taxes collected from shopping and entertainment districts around the sites for the new stadiums.\n\nKelly has not said whether she will sign the bill. But her chief of staff told lawmakers Monday that she had seen nothing in the version that passed that would make her veto it.\n\nKansas legislators see the two teams as in play because in April, voters on the Missouri side of the Kansas City metropolitan area refused to extend a sales tax used to keep up the teams' existing stadiums, which sit side by side.\n\nThe votes came after a debate that many lawmakers said they needed to see before considering a plan to help the Super Bowl champions finance a new stadium. The measure would allow the state to issue bonds to help the Chiefs and Major League Baseball's Kansas City Royals finance new stadiums on the Kansas side of their metropolitan area, which is split by the border with Missouri.\n\nTop Republicans in the GOP-controlled Legislature had promised that the stadium proposal wouldn't be debated until the Legislature approved a plan that would cut income and property taxes by a total of $1.23 billion over the next three years. Many lawmakers argued that voters would be angry if the state helped finance new stadiums without cutting taxes.\n\n\"We definitely need to demonstrate that we're getting relief to our citizens,\" said Senate President Ty Masterson, a Wichita-area Republican who backed the stadium-financing plan.\n\nKelly called the special session to have lawmakers consider reducing taxes after she vetoed three tax-cutting plans before legislators adjourned their regular annual session May 1. The plan lawmakers approved was a compromise between her and Republican leaders.\n\n'Sunday Ticket'\n\nThe federal judge presiding over the class-action lawsuit filed by \"Sunday Ticket\" subscribers against the NFL voiced frustrations with the way the plaintiffs' attorneys have handled their side of the case.\n\nBefore Dallas Cowboys owner Jerry Jones took the stand Tuesday for a second day of testimony, U.S. District Judge Philip Gutierrez said the premise of the case was simple and that it had gone in direction that it shouldn't.\n\nThe class-action covers 2.4 million residential subscribers and 48,000 businesses who paid for the package from the 2011 through 2022 seasons.\n\nThe lawsuit claims the league broke antitrust laws by selling its package of Sunday games aired on CBS and Fox at an inflated price.\n\nBRIEFLY\n\nBEARS: Chicago signed veteran receiver and return specialist DeAndre Carter to a one-year contract. The 31-year-old Carter has 108 receptions for 1,259 yards and six touchdowns over six seasons with Philadelphia, Houston, Chicago, Washington, the Los Angeles Chargers and Las Vegas Raiders. He has averaged 9.8 yards on punt returns, and 22.4 yards with one touchdown on kickoff returns.\n\nLIONS: Detroit signed all-United Football League kicker Jake Bates, who made three field goals from at least 60 yards for the Michigan Panthers this past season.

The bill will go to Democratic Gov. Laura Kelly's desk.\n\nThe governor seems unlikely to strike down the bill with a veto. While she previously said she wasn't trying to recruit the Chiefs, she praised it in a statement following the vote as a bipartisan initiative to drive economic growth.\n\nIt's the latest in a months-long debate over the future home of the Super Bowl champion Chiefs. Jackson County, Missouri, voters rejected a sales tax to fund stadium renovations, which kicked off the interest of Kansas lawmakers to attract the Chiefs and the Royals.\n\nThe debate over the proposed tax incentives, called STAR Bonds, defied normal partisan divides.\n\nCritics on both sides of the aisle called the effort rushed and opaque. Despite ultimately supporting the bill, Democratic Rep. Jason Probst said corporate tax incentives shouldn't be the priority.\n\n\"When we have discussions about homelessness, or hunger, or childhood poverty, or any of these issues that are real concerns to people in the state, we do not see this kind of collective effort,\" Probst said.\n\nRepublican Sen. Virgil Peck said the one-day special session did not provide enough time to fully weigh the benefits and risks of the plan.\n\n\"I'm not voting no to the Kansas City Chiefs. I'm voting no to the rapidity of the process that we went through today,\" he said.\n\nOthers united in bipartisan support of the bill, with many citing memories of growing up rooting for the Chiefs and Royals and excitement at the prospect of bringing the teams to Kansas.\n\nThe bill modifies an existing tool known as STAR Bonds. If sports franchises, state economic officials and lawmakers reach a deal, investors would purchase bonds, which are essentially long-term loans. Developers would use that money to help build up to two stadiums and one practice facility in Kansas.\n\nThe bonds would be paid back by diverting sales tax revenue generated in the district to repay the loans. Also, any revenue from liquor sales would go towards paying the bonds.\n\nThe development would need to cost more than $1 billion and up to 70% of the projects could be funded with the bonds, as opposed to the normal 50% restriction on other STAR Bond sites.\n\nIn addition to the financing, the bill also gives the state more power to keep negotiations secret by amending the Kansas Open Meetings Act and Kansas Open Records Act. It gives the chairperson of the Legislature Coordinating Council the authority to close meetings on the topic, although votes on an agreement would be made in public.\n\nAny documents related to the deal would be exempt from open records law until an agreement is finalized and executed. Representative Sean Tarwater, who fielded questions throughout the session on the specifics of the bill, said keeping negotiations secret would help prevent other states from outbidding them.\n\nLawmakers originally convened in a special session to pass a tax relief package after Kelly vetoed several previous proposals and called them back to work more on the issue. But the STAR Bonds bill overshadowed tax cuts in the weeks leading up to the session.\n\nBefore the voting was even done in the Kansas Statehouse, a Missouri official was lamenting the competition. Jackson County, Missouri, Executive Frank White said in a statement that the effort violates a 2019 agreement to end the \"economic border war\" as the states competed with development resources to attract projects across the state line.\n\n\"Our resources should be used wisely to improve the lives of our residents, not wasted on bidding wars that only serve to drain public funds and divide our region,\" White said.\n\nThe action in Kansas comes just two months after voters in Jackson County, Missouri, rejected a sales tax to pay for stadium renovations.\n\nIn a statement following the Kansas Senate vote, Kansas City, Mo. Mayor Quinton Lucas voiced his dismay.\n\n\"Today's vote regrettably restarts the Missouri-Kansas incentive border war,\" he said.", "source": {"uri": "kcur.org", "dataType": "news", "title": "KCUR 89.3 - NPR in Kansas City.

(WDAF) -- The Kansas legislature's approval of STAR bonds to build new sports stadiums is being lauded as an aggressive power play.\n\nCommunity leaders across Wyandotte County are feeling a ripple effect after Tuesday's decision to use Sales Tax and Revenue (STAR) bonds as a means of paying for potential new stadiums, a mechanism meant to attract the Kansas City Chiefs and Royals, who have both expressed interest in finding new places to call home. With the stroke of the pen from Gov. Laura Kelly, that offer will be on the table.\n\nDecision-makers in Wyandotte County insist they're not reigniting a business-based border war between Kansas and Missouri. State and local leaders seem invigorated by the legislature's bold move. STAR bonds have proven to provide hundreds of millions of dollars to fund large projects in Kansas.\n\nKCK Mayor Tyrone Garner, like others in Wyandotte County, says his top priority is preventing the Chiefs and Royals from relocating outside the Kansas City metro. Mayor Garner adds this isn't a power play since Jackson County, Missouri, voters rejected a plan to build a downtown Kansas City baseball home for the Royals in April.\n\n\"I think it's just how do we all work -- whether it's in the great state of Missouri or the great state of Kansas -- to find incentives and options we can project forward, and hopefully, those organizations will see value to keep them here in the Kansas City metropolitan area,\" Mayor Garner said.\n\nKansas Sen. David Haley has voiced his interest in a downtown baseball stadium in Kansas City, Kansas. Others at the legislative level believe the Legends has space to accommodate a new indoor football stadium for the Chiefs. Johnson County is also being mentioned as a possible home for a new practice facility for the Chiefs.\n\nDaniel Silva, who leads the KCK Chamber, and his associates sent written testimony in support of STAR bonds this week.\n\n\"If there was an announcement around a sports complex, I think that would bring other development.

A Chiefs stadium would cost at least $2 billion while a Royals stadium would be another $1.5 billion or more.\n\nThe Missouri General Assembly ended its annual legislative session last month and lawmakers won't meet again to pass legislation until January unless Republican Gov. Mike Parson calls a special session. The Missouri Constitution also allows lawmakers to call their own special session by petition if three-fourths of the General Assembly sign off.\n\nA spokesperson for Parson, an ardent Chiefs fan, did not immediately respond to a request for comment on Tuesday. But his office has previously vowed to fight to keep the teams in Missouri.\n\nPatterson didn't have specifics about what kind of proposal Missouri lawmakers would be open to (bonding or tax incentives) and acknowledged that Missouri does not have the authority to issue STAR bonds like Kansas. But he was clear that \"we aren't going to do nothing.\"\n\n\"We'll just have to gather and get together and see what we can do,\" he said. \"We'll get together and come up with a plan to keep the Chiefs and Royals in Missouri.\"\n\n'Politics out of the way'\n\nThe hesitancy to rush into a special session before the August primaries comes after a legislative session that was embroiled in infighting among Republicans in the state Senate. Lawmakers ended the session after passing just 28 non-budget bills, a modern record-low.\n\nPolitical observers on both sides of the aisle have argued that the upcoming elections played a major role in the dysfunction, with lawmakers able to use floor time to boost their campaigns.\n\nPatterson alluded to this, saying \"we have to get the politics out of the way first.\" Senate Majority Leader Cindy O'Laughlin, a Shelbina Republican, also referenced concerns about a special session held during an election season, saying earlier this month that it \"could result more in grandstanding than in serious work.\"\n\nLawmakers running for higher office may also be less willing to take votes on any economic incentives out of fear of being attacked by their opponents before the primary election.\n\nAny Missouri proposal that uses state funds to keep either team is almost certain to run into resistance from a group of hard-right senators in the state Senate. One of the leaders of that group, Republican Sen. Bill Eigel from Weldon Spring, is running for governor in the August primaries.\n\nIn April, Eigel pushed back on the suggestion of Missouri using public money to keep either team in the state.\n\n\"I know of no path in the Missouri Senate where we're going to do any public funding of sports stadiums,\" said Eigel, a Weldon Spring Republican who is running for governor. \"I think that would be resisted vociferously and extensively.\"\n\nThe Kansas plan\n\nWhile Missouri lawmakers attempt to navigate the state's political landscape, Kansas lawmakers argue they want to seize what they view as a major opportunity.\n\nThe Kansas House passed the proposal during a special session on Tuesday, sending the legislation to the Senate.\n\nDuring a hearing over the plan on Monday, an attorney representing the Chiefs did not promise that the team would relocate if the plan passed but framed the legislation as an opportunity for Kansas after Jackson County voters rejected a stadium sales tax in April.\n\n\"Missouri spoke, Jackson County spoke. They had their opportunity,\" the attorney, Korb Maxwell, said at the hearing. \"But now there's a moment for Kansas to step up and an option for us all here.\"\n\nUnder the plan, Kansas would also use sports betting and some Lottery revenues to repay the bonds, which would have a 30-year term.\n\nJackson County Executive Frank White Jr. on Tuesday lamented Kansas' effort to lure the teams, pointing to the 2019 border war \"truce\" between the two states to end the use of tax incentives to lure companies across state lines without creating new jobs for the region.\n\n\"This competition does not serve our residents or our communities. Instead of working together to grow all our neighborhoods, we risk hurting the very people we are supposed to serve,\" he said. \"In order to subsidize the renovation or construction of any stadium for privately owned sports teams, my stance remains clear: there must be a complete and transparent plan that offers tangible benefits to our taxpayers.\"\n\nWhite said that his office is open with conversations with the teams, lawmakers and other stakeholders but cautioned that any proposal must be responsible and \"make sense for our community.\"\n\nEconomists who have studied sports stadiums have been skeptical of the financial viability of the bonding plan, according to previous reporting.\n\nPrevious academic reviews have found that nearly all empirical studies found \"little to no tangible impacts of sports teams and facilities on local economic activity\" and that the level of subsidies typically provided for stadiums \"far exceeds any observed economic benefits.\"", "source":

Shortly after the game, he flipped it back, asking if the atmosphere reflected the one in Kansas.\n\nI couldn't help but clarify that, ahem, the Chiefs don't play in Kansas -- they're in Missouri.\n\nThe Kansas Legislature this week passed a plan designed to attract the Chiefs and Royals, with a STAR-bonds-on-steroids proposal as the bait.\n\nIf you want a clue as to how serious to take this, look at the quick response from Kansas City Mayor Quinton Lucas, who told reporters it is a \"regrettable\" violation of a border war truce.\n\nIf there wasn't already an importance in pointing out the difference in the Chiefs and Royals' home state from its neighbor down the highway, well, we are on the verge of a distinct line in the sand now.\n\nAlbeit one very early-stage proposal is going to attempt to blur that line and bring the two together in Kansas City's West Bottoms -- emphasis, for now, on attempt. Much more on that in a bit.\n\nIt's still to be determined which state provides the next addresses for these teams, and that phrase is even applicable to the teams themselves, but we'd be fools not to consider it a potential game-changer. The Chiefs are privately telling those involved a move to Kansas will get real consideration, multiple sources have told me.\n\nWith its latest bill, Kansas has provided an avenue for an extremely, even overly, team-friendly financial option that its Missouri counterparts have expressed not only a reluctance to match but outright doubt.\n\nSo even as it's not yet clear whether the Royals and Chiefs have found their new home, it's quite evident they have something:\n\nLeverage.\n\nThat was the (predictable) uniqueness in this discussion -- after the two teams' initial stadium proposals were rejected by voters, and by a wide margin, they actually gained leverage in their future requests. How often is that the case?\n\nBut we all knew Kansas was coming, though I'll admit some surprise they passed the bill with such flying colors. The House passed it 84-38, and the Senate with a 27-8 margin, which will authorize the state to use STAR bonds to fund up to 70% of the cost for stadiums for the Chiefs and/or Royals.\n\nHow will Missouri respond? That's the biggest mystery in the aftermath, even among politicos operating there, because key members of its state legislature there have been vocal in opposition to using tax dollars on two stadiums; and Jackson County executive Frank White, who also referenced the border truce, remains steadfast that the last deal, rejected by voters, would need to be improved.\n\nIt should be on the teams to navigate the path for their futures -- if they deem their current stadiums a problem, it ought to be on them to find the solution. But as Kansas is very publicly absolving them of that responsibility, in Missouri, it apparently would still require threading a few needles.\n\nWhich brings me back to the leverage.\n\nIt's the reason, Lucas points out, for the existence of the so-called border war truce -- to prevent businesses from using an offer from one state to improve an offer from their neighbors, increasing the cost for taxpayers while the benefit to the region remains the same.\n\nIt's in place because people tend to respond, in other words.\n\nIn that vein, the Kansas Legislature passing the STAR bonds proposal will not eliminate other proposals. Instead, it will draw them out of the woodwork. We've already seen Jackson County legislator Manny Abarca put language for a Chiefs-only sales tax in front of the legislature.\n\nLet's talk about another proposal at a much deeper level.\n\nDeveloper Robb Heineman and sports stadium architecture company MANICA are offering a vision for a Royals stadium in Kansas City's West Bottoms, and here's its particular distinction:\n\nI'll underscore that Heineman is yet to bring this proposal to the Royals, nor has he yet sought the support of politicos key to its viability -- though that's coming soon. So it's early. Consider this in that obvious context. And, yes, I understand that's part of what the release of these renderings in The Star will provide: a gauge of potential interest.\n\nBut in a week in which the Chiefs and Royals increased their potential options -- or at least one option came into clearer focus, with some tinkering of the fine-adjustment knob still needed -- that's what this is.\n\nYet one more option. One more proposal.\n\nBut a different one than those we've seen in the past.\n\nThe proposal actually positions the majority of the ballpark in Kansas, just east of the Kansas River and just south of I-670, with the right field bleachers in Missouri or perhaps just tucked inside the border and overlooking downtown Kansas City.\n\nThe pitch, if you will, does have a certain pizzazz: A player could launch a baseball from Kansas and deposit it into another state entirely.\n\n\"It's an area of downtown Kansas City that's probably underutilized at this point and has some pretty rich history to it,\" Heineman said. \"But I think the fact the stadium would be on the state line would be about the most unique thing in sports.\"\n\nHeineman said he is in the process of getting the land under contract -- the majority likely needed for the big-scale project is currently owned by the Haw family and the Privitera family (owners of the former Kansas City press pavilion at the epicenter of the Royals' Crossroads proposal that Jackson County voters rejected).\n\nIt is enough land, he said, for not only the stadium but to provide the ancillary development that the Royals considered crucial to their last proposal -- restaurants, office space, apartments, a hotel and the like.\n\nIt also is a close neighbor to downtown Kansas City, the team's publicly-stated preferred destination. That was the start of this conversation, if you remember -- the Royals wanted to move downtown. Wanted to move closer to the action.\n\nYes, there are complications to this site, as with most sites, that would require some deft maneuvering. Most evidently, it's been hard enough to generate consensus support from the parties involved, and this would probably need some level of support from state and/or county governments in two states.\n\nThe STAR bonds, Heineman says, would represent the starting point for a financial ask, with the ballpark primarily in Kansas.\n\nThe ingress and egress would also need to be solved.\n\nThis isn't intended to ignore the hurdles. It is intended to point out a Royals stadium option that will be pointed out to them.\n\nA team that has publicly stated it is evaluating its next move will soon have one more thing to evaluate.",

The measure would allow the state to issue bonds to help the Chiefs and Major League Baseball's Kansas City Royals finance new stadiums on the Kansas side of their metropolitan area, which is split by the border with Missouri.\n\nBut top Republicans in the GOP-controlled Legislature promised that the stadium proposal wouldn't be debated until the Legislature approved a plan that would cut income and property taxes by a total of $1.23 billion over the next three years. Many lawmakers argued that voters would be angry if the state helped finance new stadiums without cutting taxes.\n\n\"We definitely need to demonstrate that we're getting relief to our citizens,\" said Senate President Ty Masterson, a Wichita-area Republican who backed the stadium-financing plan.\n\nDemocratic Gov. Laura Kelly called the special session to have lawmakers consider reducing taxes after she vetoed three tax-cutting plans before legislators adjourned their regular annual session May 1. The plan lawmakers approved was a compromise between her and Republican leaders.\n\nLegislators made no changes in the plan before passing it, 34-4 in the Senate and 121-2 in the House. Kelly pledged to sign the measure into law.\n\nOnce legislators convened the special session, Kelly couldn't control what they considered, and that created an opening to consider the stadium-financing plan. That measure would use revenues from sports betting, the state lottery and new taxes raised from the area around each new stadium to pay off the state's bonds over 30 years.\n\nThe first version of the stadium-financing plan emerged in late April, but lawmakers didn't vote on it before adjourning. It would have allowed state bonds to finance all stadium construction costs, but the version to be considered by lawmakers Tuesday would cap the amount at 70% and require legislative leaders and the governor to sign off on any bonding plan.\n\nHouse Commerce Committee Chair Sean Tarwater, a Kansas City-area Republican, said the Chiefs are likely to spend between $500 million and $700 million in private funds on a new stadium.\n\nBRIEFLY\n\nLIONS: Detroit signed all-United Football League kicker Jake Bates, who made three field goals from at least 60 yards for the Michigan Panthers this past season. Detroit added depth at a position with veteran Michael Badgley.\n\nBEARS: Chicago signed veteran receiver and return specialist DeAndre Carter to a one-year contract. The 31-year-old Carter has 108 receptions for 1,259 yards and six touchdowns over six seasons with Philadelphia, Houston, Chicago, Washington, the Los Angeles Chargers and Las Vegas Raiders.",

Three Super Bowl victories in five years -- and player Travis Kelce's romance with pop icon Taylor Swift -- have made the Chiefs perhaps the area's most celebrated civic asset.", "source": {"uri": "goskagit.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "goSkagit"}, "authors": [{"uri": "associated_press@goskagit.com", "name": "Associated Press", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}, {"uri": "john_hanna@goskagit.com", "name": "John Hanna", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kansas", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Kansas"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Kansas"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kansas_City_Chiefs", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Kansas City Chiefs"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_House_Committee_on_Rules", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States House Committee on Rules"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kansas_City_Royals", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Kansas City Royals"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Super_Bowl", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Super Bowl"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Major_League_Baseball", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Major League Baseball"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Missouri", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Missouri"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Missouri"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Topeka,_Kansas", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Topeka, Kansas"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Topeka, Kansas"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kansas_Supreme_Court", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Kansas Supreme Court"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Associated_Press", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Associated Press"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bond_(finance)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Bond (finance)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Travis_Kelce", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Travis Kelce"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taylor_Swift", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Taylor Swift"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metropolitan_area", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Metropolitan area"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supermajority", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Supermajority"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling", "wgt": 19}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Ten-Pin", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Ten-Pin", "wgt": 19}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/Stadiums", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/Stadiums", "wgt": 18}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Negro_Leagues", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Negro Leagues", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Candlepin_Bowling", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Candlepin Bowling", "wgt": 17}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 77}], "image": "https://bloximages.chicago2.vip.townnews.com/goskagit.com/content/tncms/assets/v3/editorial/3/70/3700f7ca-36cd-5ee6-98f9-6e45c2df8f4c/666d2b960637d.image.jpg?crop=1763%2C926%2C0%2C124&resize=438%2C230&order=crop%2Cresize", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9660256", "eventUri": "eng-9660256", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "date": "2018-06-", "textStart": 245, "textEnd": 252}], "sentiment": 0.5058823529411764, "wgt": 172, "relevance": 1}

While she stopped short of promising to sign it, she said in a statement that \"Kansas now has the opportunity to become a professional sports powerhouse.\n\nIt's hard to imagine the Royals leaving the Kansas City, Missouri area, considering they have played there since their founding in 1969. However, in the last several years we've seen franchises like the Montreal Expos, St. Louis Rams, and Oakland Raiders all leave established areas in favor of new places (Washington, D.C., Los Angeles and Las Vegas). The NHL's Arizona Coyotes are also bolting for Utah and the Seattle SuperSonics (NBA) moved to Oklahoma City within the last 20 years.\n\nFurthermore, if the Royals were to leave Missouri, they'd have the advantage of not needing to change names or branding. There is a Kansas City in Kansas and it shares a metropolitan area with Kansas City, Missouri, so in essence, they'd still be attracting the same fans. This could be similar to win the Golden State Warriors moved from Oakland to San Francisco but still kept the same name.\n\nAs is usually the case, this could be a leverage play but the Royals have

The football (NFL) moves to Kansas.\"\n\nWhile the Chiefs playing in a different state could still be years away, Kerkhoff joked that it's already easy to envision a huge Taylor Swift concert unveiling the sparkling new stadium that would house the reigning Super Bowl champs.\n\n\"I wouldn't be surprised if things worked out and she would open the place,\" he said.\n\nThe Chiefs and Royals both currently call Kansas City, Missouri home and their aging but revered stadiums are located within walking distance of each other.\n\nThe city of Kansas City is spread between the states of Missouri and Kansas.\n\nIn April, residents of Jackson County, Missouri voted against a sales tax measure that would have helped fund a new downtown ballpark for the Royals and contributed to major renovations of Arrowhead Stadium.\n\nThat has reignited a sometimes bitter state vs state rivalry that traces back 170 years, as Kansas attempts to pry the Chiefs' dynasty away from Missouri.\n\nAndy Reid, Mahomes and Kelce theoretically could drive to play in a new stadium that would echo billion-dollar venues such as the Los Angeles Rams/Chargers' SoFi Stadium and the Las Vegas Raiders' Allegiant Stadium, which just hosted the Chiefs' thrilling overtime win in Super Bowl LVIII,\n\nBut it would be a massive change overall for fiercely loyal Chiefs fans.\n\nArrowhead Stadium opened in 1972 and is one of the few remaining old-school iconic stadiums remaining in the NFL.\n\n\"It is a serious situation,\" Kerkhoff said. \"The lease for the Chiefs and the Royals in their current stadiums expires after the 2030 season for baseball and for football. And so they either have to renew or come up with some sort of deal to stay where they are or they're going to leave.\"\n\nIt's almost unthinkable for a Premier League team to change cities.\n\nIn the NFL, the Rams, Chargers and Raiders all left their old home cities behind, as the franchises \"Kept Up With The Joneses\" to remaine relevant in the financial marketplace.\n\nThe Dallas Cowboys' AT&T Stadium, which will host the Mike Tyson vs Jake Paul boxing match and be streamed live on Netflix, and the New York Giants/Jets' MetLife Stadium are more in line with what the Chiefs could receive in nearby Kansas.\n\nKansas City is a relatively small sports market compared to major American cities such as New York, Los Angeles and Chicago.\n\nThe Chiefs aren't threatening to move to Manhattan or La La Land.\n\nBut it appears that they will switch states and stadiums if Arrowhead isn't renovated again.\n\n\"It is a bit of an emotional issue,\" Kerkhoff said. \"You've lived in the same house for almost 55 years and now you've decided not to make the needed repairs in your current house and you want to buy new.\n\n\"It's going to be more expensive. However, if this happens, if a new stadium is built, not only do the Chiefs get a new home on par with the best of the stadiums that have been built in the NFL ... but now the Chiefs would have the opportunity to land other events, assuming they put a roof on this.\n\n\"Maybe an NCAA Final Four comes to Kansas City. Maybe concerts in the winter can come to Kansas City.\"\n\nChiefs president Mark Donovan previously threatened that the team could leave Kansas City if the April tax vote failed.\n\n\"We were ready to extend the longstanding partnership that the teams have enjoyed with this county,\" Donovan said. \"This is important. We will do and look to do what is in the best interest of our fans and our organization as we move forward.\"\n\nChiefs defender Charles Omenihu tweeted \"SMH\" after the bill failed.\n\nFans hit back, saying that the Chiefs -- who are valued at $4.3 billion, according to Forbes -- should fund their own new stadium during challenging economic times.\n\n\"Tell (Chiefs Chairman and CEO) Clark (Hunt) to make some actual useful renovations, not upgrades to the suites for his rich friends,\" a fan tweeted.\n\nArrowhead Stadium has given Mahomes, Kelce and Reid one of the best homefield advantages in the NFL for years.\n\nIf the Chiefs move across state lines and switch their allegiance to Kansas while leaving their old Missouri home behind, much will change for football's newest dynasty.\n\n\"I know the team likes to think of Arrowhead as being an iconic stadium,\" Kerkhoff said. \"To me, maybe not in the in the realm of Lambeau (Field) or Soldier Field. But it's been around since 1972. They've had great success in that stadium the last few years.\n\n\"It has developed a reputation of being the loudest of the stadiums and it's a wonderful atmosphere. You leave that behind to build a new house on the other side of the state line, so there would be a sense of loss.\"", "source": {"uri": "talksport.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "talkSPORT"}, "authors": [{"uri": "brian_t_smith@talksport.com", "name": "Brian T.

Designed To Lure Chiefs And Royals Across State Lines", "body": "The Chiefs and the Royals are currently engaged in a bit of a standoff with Kansas City as they attempt to secure public funds linked to their stadiums, and the state of Kansas has entered the fray after its legislature passed a bill in the hopes of getting them to ditch Missouri.\n\nIf you're like me, you spent far too many years on this planet operating under the assumption the Kansas City Chiefs and the Kansas City Royals were located in the state that lends its name to the metropolis they've respectively called home since 1963 and 1969.\n\nHowever, Arrowhead Stadium and Kauffman Stadium are firmly located in Missouri, and the two franchises have spent over 50 years giving a boost to the local economy of the Kansas City that's located to the east of the Missouri River (not to be confused with the smaller one of the same name that is located in the real, actual Kansas).\n\nBoth of those teams spent close to two decades reaping the benefits of a 3/8-cent sales tax that was initially introduced in 2006 to give the Chiefs money they could use to renovate Arrowhead and allow the Royals to amass a fund they could use to construct a new stadium.\n\nHowever, they each suffered a bit of a setback in April when voters declined to approve a ballot measure that would have extended it for 40 years (and raised an estimated $2 billion in the process) after representatives for both teams firmly implied they'd consider relocating if it didn't pass.\n\nIt's unclear what the future holds for the Chiefs and the Royals after that possible bluff was called, but according to ESPN, lawmakers across the border in Kansas have made it clear they'd be willing to welcome them with open arms after passing a bill approving the sale of government bonds the teams could harness to build new stadiums and practice facilities while covering up to 70% of the cost.\n\nIt's unclear if Kansas Governer Laura Kelly plans to sign the bill when it lands on her desk, but as the outlet notes, she seemed to tease the possibility by saying the state \"now has the opportunity to become a professional sports powerhouse\" after it made it through the legislature.\n\nThe lease on the property that's home to the stadiums where the Chiefs and Royals currently play is set to expire in 2031, so both franchises have a fair amount of time to weigh their options before making a decision concerning their future.", "source": {"uri": "brobible.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "BroBible"}, "authors": [{"uri":

But \"there is an opportunity,\" to get both teams across the state line, she said.\n\nThat opportunity comes with a high price: It could cost up to $3 billion to build two stadiums.\n\nLawmakers acknowledge an incentive package will include STAR bonds. Those bonds rely on increased sales tax revenue to pay off bondholders. STAR bonds were used to build the Kansas Speedway, and the project was so successful the bonds were paid off early. The bonds were also used to build the Prairiefire retail development at 135th and Nall Avenue in Overland Park. Those bonds are in default.\n\nHawkins and Senate President Ty Masterson have both said any stadium development will generate enough extra sales tax to pay off a STAR bond.\n\nSen. Jeff Pittman, a Democrat who represents western Wyandotte County, said lawmakers need to be sure the state and county see a return on their investment.\n\n\"We have got to have a plan to make sure it isn't a burden of the county in which it was located,\" Pittman said.\n\nWhile the Chiefs have gotten most of the attention -- there is even a rendering of a Wyandotte County stadium -- Sykes said she is more interested in the Royals.\n\n\"I do think baseball makes more sense,\" she told KCUR. \"The Royals are interested in a district with shops, restaurants, and a hotel, which makes it more likely to generate a lot of additional sales tax to pay off the STAR bonds.\"\n\nUnified Government Mayor Tyrone Garner said he would like to see a Royals ballpark in downtown Kansas City, Kansas, with the Kansas River and the Kansas City, Missouri skyline beyond as a backdrop.\n\n\"Land is cheap. It's ripe for development. It sits centrally located in the Kansas City metropolitan area,\" Garner told KCUR's Up To Date.\n\nThe West Bottoms also has land available for a Royals stadium. The Chiefs would most likely be interested in land farther west. The old Schlitterbahn Waterpark is a possibility.\n\nAs lawmakers gear up for the special session, Garner also said he wants a deal to include an earnings tax for people who work in Wyandotte County but live somewhere else. That could be up to 70% of the workforce, according to Pittman. An earnings tax has failed in the past.\n\nWhile there is bipartisan support to lure the teams, the effort is not without political obstacles. Perhaps the thorniest is opposition to any stadium subsidy by Americans for Prosperity, the Koch-funded conservative organization that carries a lot of weight in the Kansas Legislature. Masterson and Hawkins would have to round up GOP votes from members who could withstand AFP opposition.\n\nThe Chiefs may also be concerned about a 2021 settlement between the Rams and St. Louis for $790 million. St. Louis sued the Rams after the NFL team decamped for Los Angeles in 2016. The city alleged the league violated its own relocation guidelines, and the league and team enriched themselves at the expense of St. Louis and St. Louis County.\n\nWhile not completely analogous to the Chiefs moving a few miles across the state line, it is a consideration especially given the fact Chiefs owner Clark Hunt and three other NFL owners were sanctioned by a judge for failing to abide by a discovery request in the lawsuit.\n\nAlso, while talk so far has been about Wyandotte County, there will be nothing in the legislation that requires the teams to move to a specific location. That likely puts nearby Johnson and Leavenworth counties in the mix.\n\nSykes said in the last two weeks she has spoken to lobbyists and representatives from both teams.\n\nMissouri Gov. Mike Parson said the state should be watching proceedings in Topeka closely.\n\n\"There is no question that we have to be concerned about it,\" Parson said on KCUR's Up To Date. \"From a Kansas perspective, I don't blame them one bit trying to get those teams over there on their side of the state because they have a huge economic impact.\"\n\nStill, Parson said he will not call a special session to counter any offer from Kansas. But Missouri will fight.\n\n\"If anybody thinks that we're just going to roll over and not be competitive with this, (they're) sadly mistaken,\" Parson said.\n\nOther Missouri officials agree.\n\n\"They're sources of great pride,\" said Missouri state Rep. John Patterson, a Lee's Summit Republican, who's expected to be the next state Missouri House speaker.\n\nCloser to home, an ordinance will be filed Monday in the Jackson County Legislature for a November ballot question to approve a 3/16th-cent sales tax, \"for the purpose of retaining the Kansas City Chiefs sports team in Jackson County, Missouri,\" according to agenda documents.\n\nA 3/8th-cent sales tax to support both the Chiefs and the Royals was soundly defeated in April.\n\nKansas City Mayor Quinton Lucas acknowledged that talk about the teams moving has renewed the economic border tensions between Missouri and Kansas. Otherwise, he seems unfazed by the prospect of losing one or both teams.\n\n\"My view is, everybody needs to calm down,\" Lucas told KSHB-TV. \"I think everyone should calm down.\"\n\nGarner has said the overwhelming defeat of the sales tax plan in Jackson County opened the door to the move.\n\n\"We sat on the sidelines, and we waited and we did not interfere,\" Garner said.", "source": {"uri":

Mandatory Credit: Kirby Lee-USA TODAY Sports / Kirby Lee-USA TODAY Sports\n\nThe Kansas City Chiefs could be moving from Kansas City, Missouri to Kansas City, Kansas in the coming years. If you're not local to the KC area(s), you may have had to re-read that sentence multiple times for it to even begin to make sense. If you're a Kansas Citian, you may believe that the sky is falling or that it's raining manna from heaven, depending on which side of the state line you prefer. Currently, I'm not sure if you should care at all.\n\nOn Tuesday, the Kansas Legislature passed a plan to bring the Chiefs and/or Kansas City Royals from their current homes at the Truman Sports Complex in Kansas City, Missouri -- specifically and notably in Jackson County -- to somewhere in the state of Kansas. Where, exactly? Not sure. At what cost? TBD. To what impact? Hard to judge that without knowing the financials or locations.\n\nThere are still endless unknowns and there will be months and months of ongoing negotiations and evaluations before real decisions are made. So, now what? Briefly indulge my geographical life story. It'll make sense in a bit.\n\nI was born in Wichita, Kansas and was raised there until my family moved to Shawnee, Kansas -- about a half-hour drive away from Arrowhead Stadium. Then, I went to college and later lived in Olathe, Kansas -- also about a half-hour from Arrowhead. I lived and worked in Overland Park, Kansas -- more like 20 minutes from Arrowhead -- before moving to Kansas City, Missouri in 2020 -- a nifty 15 minutes from the home of the Chiefs. I've spent my whole life living and working on both sides of the state line, and I have true midwestern love for both states. Why do my bi-state allegiances matter to you?\n\nIf the Chiefs were to move from Arrowhead to a site near Legends in KCK, they'd be moving approximately 30 minutes to the west. All of this strife and political posturing over a 30-minute \"relocation.\" I've thought about it for months, and I can finally declare it confidently: I just do not care which side of the border the teams play on.\n\nMany of the surrounding factors of the future homes of the Chiefs and Royals certainly do concern me. I'd like for both teams to play in quality facilities that create the best experiences for their fans and players, placed at locations that benefit the city (or cities) in short-term and long-term ways, ideally at minimal cost to taxpayers and state budgets. I'm not at all arguing for total stadium apathy. I'm making the case that the dotted line on the map is one of the least important parts of this whole discussion for most people who care about the teams.\n\nHere's the question I keep circling back to: If you're a fan who attends games, wouldn't you want the best two stadiums, locations, and situations regardless of what state they're in, as long as they're within a reasonable distance and remain \"Kansas City?\" If the Chiefs get a massive spaceship of a stadium on the Kansas side and the Royals take another swing at a downtown ballpark district in KCMO, is that not the best thing for you and the teams? It seems a lot better to me than the Chiefs' remarkably underwhelming proposed Arrowhead renovations or the Royals' ever-changing attempt to find a permanent parking spot downtown.\n\nWhat the Chiefs are exploring is also extremely commonplace in the NFL. Just to name a few examples among teams with relatively new, modern stadiums: The Las Vegas Raiders play in Paradise, Nevada. The Dallas Cowboys play in Arlington, Texas. The Los Angeles Rams and Chargers play in Inglewood, California. The San Francisco 49ers play in Santa Clara, California. The New York Jets and Giants play in East Rutherford, New Jersey! Maybe that's a bad thing, maybe it doesn't matter, but it's already happened throughout much of the NFL.\n\nInstead of asking Jackson County to foot the bill for both teams, the potential two-state split should theoretically allow for each team to secure more resources while planning alone. The Chiefs weren't planning to add a roof or, frankly, any upgrades of significance to most fans with their plan ahead of the April vote. With Kansas politicians going all-out in pursuit of the Chiefs, a brand-new stadium could certainly be domed as the Chiefs play the leverage game between states. If KCK hosts Super Bowls (and Final Fours and other similar traveling indoor events) and the Royals return to the drawing board for a more cohesive plan to find their way into downtown KCMO, that seems like the closest thing to a win-win that fans could ask for.\n\nAgain, the details will matter and both states will have to grapple with the fact that publicly funded sports stadiums rarely bring back the returns they promise. I care about how both teams thread that needle on behalf of the well-being of the only two states I have called home and the people who live there. But it doesn't make sense for fans to allow themselves to be swept up into a battle between states while politicians in Topeka, Kansas and Jefferson City, Missouri want you to believe that, either positively or negatively, a team's 30-minute move is going to change your life. In reality, as long as they settle on either side of the state line, they'll be the Kansas City Chiefs and Royals either way. They just won't share a parking lot.", "source": {"uri": "si.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Sports Illustrated"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

Laura Kelly would allow Kansas to issue bonds to cover up to 70% of the costs of a new stadium in the state for the Chiefs and another for Major League Baseball's Kansas City Royals.\n\nThe state would pay off its bonds over 30 years with revenues from sports betting, Kansas Lottery ticket sales and new sales and alcohol taxes collected from shopping and entertainment districts around the sites for the new stadiums.\n\nKelly has not said whether she will sign the bill. But her chief of staff told lawmakers Monday that she had seen nothing in the version that passed that would make her veto it.\n\nPeople are also reading...\n\nFormer Sioux City hotel under renovation, to become high-rise senior housing this year Lost and found: How Arnolds Park got a miniature train back after more than 50 years Jefferson, S.D. dad shares secret to fatherhood on Father's Day celebration Perley to step down as Thompson CEO; Beaulieu to take over Man charged with stabbing at Sioux City hotel Sioux City Marina operator countersues city over lease dispute Omaha ballpark seeks to ban two Texas A&M fans who were kicked out of College World Series game Le Mars man arrested after standoff for breaking woman's nose Athlete of the Week: Miller's motor leading the way for West Monona Tyson Foods heir suspended as CFO after second alcohol-related arrest Our Opinion: WITCC settlement in human trafficking case raises more questions Marriage licenses for Woodbury County for June 17, 2024 Chainsaw sculptures among latest upgrades to Sioux City's historic Hubbard Park Inclusive Sioux City Advisory Committee has lost members since Ghebrekidan suspension, termination Elk Creek Road construction project begins next week\n\nKansas legislators see the two teams as in play because in April, voters on the Missouri side of the Kansas City metropolitan area refused to extend a sales tax used to keep up the teams' existing stadiums, which sit side by side.\n\nThe votes came after a debate that many lawmakers said they needed to see before considering a plan to help the Super Bowl champions finance a new stadium. The measure would allow the state to issue bonds to help the Chiefs and Major League Baseball's Kansas City Royals finance new stadiums on the Kansas side of their metropolitan area, which is split by the border with Missouri.\n\nTop Republicans in the GOP-controlled Legislature had promised that the stadium proposal wouldn't be debated until the Legislature approved a plan that would cut income and property taxes by a total of $1.23 billion over the next three years. Many lawmakers argued that voters would be angry if the state helped finance new stadiums without cutting taxes.\n\n\"We definitely need to demonstrate that we're getting relief to our citizens,\" said Senate President Ty Masterson, a Wichita-area Republican who backed the stadium-financing plan.\n\nKelly called the special session to have lawmakers consider reducing taxes after she vetoed three tax-cutting plans before legislators adjourned their regular annual session May 1. The plan lawmakers approved was a compromise between her and Republican leaders.\n\n'Sunday Ticket'\n\nThe federal judge presiding over the class-action lawsuit filed by \"Sunday Ticket\" subscribers against the NFL voiced frustrations with the way the plaintiffs' attorneys have handled their side of the case.\n\nBefore Dallas Cowboys owner Jerry Jones took the stand Tuesday for a second day of testimony, U.S. District Judge Philip Gutierrez said the premise of the case was simple and that it had gone in direction that it shouldn't.\n\nThe class-action covers 2.4 million residential subscribers and 48,000 businesses who paid for the package from the 2011 through 2022 seasons.\n\nThe lawsuit claims the league broke antitrust laws by selling its package of Sunday games aired on CBS and Fox at an inflated price.\n\nBRIEFLY\n\nBEARS: Chicago signed veteran receiver and return specialist DeAndre Carter to a one-year contract.

Marci Francisco, a Lawrence Democrat. \"Most of the discussions in the legislature go on behind closed doors.\"\n\nThe meal came the night before lawmakers were expected to vote on whether to expand a state tax incentive program to help finance a new stadium for the Royals or the Kansas City Chiefs to lure the teams from Missouri.\n\nThe bill, which was discussed in an informational hearing Monday, would enhance the state's existing Sales Tax and Revenue (STAR) Bond program to provide up to 75% of the project's cost for a professional football or baseball stadium project with a minimum $1 billion investment. STAR Bonds are issued to pay for the construction and repaid by the increased state sales tax revenue at the project site.\n\nNormally, STAR Bonds, which are intended to help pay for tourism and entertainment destinations, are only authorized to finance up to 50% of a project. Debt on a stadium constructed under the expansion wouldn't have to be repaid for 30 years instead of the normal 20.\n\nThe project could also receive a boost from liquor taxes generated in the STAR Bond district and revenues from a fund Kansas created when it legalized sports betting.\n\nThe Chiefs shut down a city block near the Capitol in Topeka for a rally at the Celtic Fox restaurant at lunchtime Tuesday.\n\nOn her way into the restaurant, Francisco said she wasn't supporting the current bill but would be interested to know whether the Royals would support a standalone deal. She wasn't sure what level of impact dinners with lobbyists have on lawmakers' overall support.\n\nFrancisco said she was uncomfortable that revenue information from the project would not be released and that there was not enough public testimony on the legislation.\n\nRep. Jerry Stogsdill, a Democrat from Prairie Village, said it was \"par for the course\" for lawmakers to get lobbied at evening events. He said he has discussed issues with lobbyists and asked for information but that in his eight years in the Legislature he has never been influenced to change his vote on an issue.\n\n\"I don't think there's going to be a single person in there tonight that is going to be persuaded to vote against their conscience and against their constituents,\" he said.\n\nStogsdill said he imagined he'd vote for the legislation and thought a stadium would be an economic boon to the community around it.\n\nSen. Ethan Corson, a fellow Prairie Village Democrat, said didn't see Kansas' efforts to help finance one or both stadiums as competing with Missouri. He'd be fine if the teams stayed in Kansas City, Missouri, but he said the Missouri Legislature is \"beyond dysfunctional.\"\n\n\"I worry about their ability to do anything, really,\" Corson said, \"so I think this is a chance to put something on the table so, that way, we can say we made a reasonable effort to keep the teams in the metro.\"\n\nRep. Linda Featherston, an Overland Park Democrat, said Monday she declined to attend the lobbying event.\n\n\"I don't want there to be any questions about undue influence,\" she said.\n\nRep. Cindy Neighbor, a Shawnee Democrat, attended Monday's dinner and recounted the sales pitch in a meeting of House Democrats Tuesday morning.\n\nShe said the Royals are looking at three potential sites in Wyandotte County where they could build a 34,500-seat stadium. The team, she said, believes its current home, Kauffman Stadium, is crumbling and that repairs would cost at least $800 million. It also doesn't have enough office space or room for medical personnel.\n\nRoyals executives told attendees that most ticket buyers are from Johnson County, Neighbor said, and that the team is not interested in having conversations about staying where they are.\n\n\"The Royals do not feel welcome in Kansas City, Missouri, right now,\" Neighbor said.\n\nThe Royals declined to comment.", "source": {"uri": "kcur.org", "dataType": "news", "title": "KCUR 89.3 - NPR in Kansas City.

Marci Francisco, a Lawrence Democrat. \"Most of the discussions in the legislature go on behind closed doors.\"\n\nThe meal came the night before lawmakers were expected to vote on whether to expand a state tax incentive program to help finance a new stadium for the Royals or the Kansas City Chiefs to lure the teams from Missouri.\n\nThe bill, which was discussed in an informational hearing Monday, would enhance the state's existing Sales Tax and Revenue (STAR) Bond program to provide up to 75% of the project's cost for a professional football or baseball stadium project with a minimum $1 billion investment. STAR Bonds are issued to pay for the construction and repaid by the increased state sales tax revenue at the project site.\n\nNormally, STAR Bonds, which are intended to help pay for tourism and entertainment destinations, are only authorized to finance up to 50% of a project. Debt on a stadium constructed under the expansion wouldn't have to be repaid for 30 years instead of the normal 20.\n\nThe project could also receive a boost from liquor taxes generated in the STAR Bond district and revenues from a fund Kansas created when it legalized sports betting.\n\nThe Chiefs shut down a city block near the Capitol in Topeka for a rally at the Celtic Fox restaurant at lunchtime Tuesday.\n\nOn her way into the restaurant, Francisco said she wasn't supporting the current bill but would be interested to know whether the Royals would support a standalone deal. She wasn't sure what level of impact dinners with lobbyists have on lawmakers' overall support.\n\nFrancisco said she was uncomfortable that revenue information from the project would not be released and that there was not enough public testimony on the legislation.\n\nRep. Jerry Stogsdill, a Democrat from Prairie Village, said it was \"par for the course\" for lawmakers to get lobbied at evening events. He said he has discussed issues with lobbyists and asked for information but that in his eight years in the Legislature he has never been influenced to change his vote on an issue.\n\n\"I don't think there's going to be a single person in there tonight that is going to be persuaded to vote against their conscience and against their constituents,\" he said.\n\nStogsdill said he imagined he'd vote for the legislation and thought a stadium would be an economic boon to the community around it.\n\nSen. Ethan Corson, a fellow Prairie Village Democrat, said didn't see Kansas' efforts to help finance one or both stadiums as competing with Missouri. He'd be fine if the teams stayed in Kansas City, Missouri, but he said the Missouri Legislature is \"beyond dysfunctional.\"\n\n\"I worry about their ability to do anything, really,\" Corson said, \"so I think this is a chance to put something on the table so, that way, we can say we made a reasonable effort to keep the teams in the metro.\"\n\nRep. Linda Featherston, an Overland Park Democrat, said Monday she declined to attend the lobbying event.\n\n\"I don't want there to be any questions about undue influence,\" she said.\n\nRep. Cindy Neighbor, a Shawnee Democrat, attended Monday's dinner and recounted the sales pitch in a meeting of House Democrats Tuesday morning.\n\nShe said the Royals are looking at three potential sites in Wyandotte County where they could build a 34,500-seat stadium. The team, she said, believes its current home, Kauffman Stadium, is crumbling and that repairs would cost at least $800 million. It also doesn't have enough office space or room for medical personnel.\n\nRoyals executives told attendees that most ticket buyers are from Johnson County, Neighbor said, and that the team is not interested in having conversations about staying where they are.\n\n\"The Royals do not feel welcome in Kansas City, Missouri, right now,\" Neighbor said.", "source": {"uri": "yahoo.com", "dataType":

Laura Kelly would allow Kansas to issue bonds to cover up to 70% of the costs of a new stadium in the state for the Chiefs and another for Major League Baseball's Kansas City Royals.\n\nThe state would pay off its bonds over 30 years with revenues from sports betting, Kansas Lottery ticket sales and new sales and alcohol taxes collected from shopping and entertainment districts around the sites for the new stadiums.\n\nKelly has not said whether she will sign the bill. But her chief of staff told lawmakers Monday that she had seen nothing in the version that passed that would make her veto it.\n\nPeople are also reading...

The measure would allow the state to issue bonds to help the Chiefs and Major League Baseball's Kansas City Royals finance new stadiums on the Kansas side of their metropolitan area, which is split by the border with Missouri.\n\nTop Republicans in the GOP-controlled Legislature had promised that the stadium proposal wouldn't be debated until the Legislature approved a plan that would cut income and property taxes by a total of $1.23 billion over the next three years. Many lawmakers argued that voters would be angry if the state helped finance new stadiums without cutting taxes.\n\n\"We definitely need to demonstrate that we're getting relief to our citizens,\" said Senate President Ty Masterson, a Wichita-area Republican who backed the stadium-financing plan.\n\nKelly called the special session to have lawmakers consider reducing taxes after she vetoed three tax-cutting plans before legislators adjourned their regular annual session May 1. The plan lawmakers approved was a compromise between her and Republican leaders.\n\n'Sunday Ticket'\n\nThe federal judge presiding over the class-action lawsuit filed by \"Sunday Ticket\" subscribers against the NFL voiced frustrations with the way the plaintiffs' attorneys have handled their side of the case.\n\nBefore Dallas Cowboys owner Jerry Jones took the stand Tuesday for a second day of testimony, U.S. District Judge Philip Gutierrez said the premise of the case was simple and that it had gone in direction that it shouldn't.\n\nThe class-action covers 2.4 million residential subscribers and 48,000 businesses who paid for the package from the 2011 through 2022 seasons.\n\nThe lawsuit claims the league broke antitrust laws by selling its package of Sunday games aired on CBS and Fox at an inflated price.\n\nBRIEFLY\n\nBEARS: Chicago signed veteran receiver and return specialist DeAndre Carter to a one-year contract.

Laura Kelly would allow Kansas to issue bonds to cover up to 70% of the costs of a new stadium in the state for the Chiefs and another for Major League Baseball's Kansas City Royals.\n\nThe state would pay off its bonds over 30 years with revenues from sports betting, Kansas Lottery ticket sales and new sales and alcohol taxes collected from shopping and entertainment districts around the sites for the new stadiums.\n\nKelly has not said whether she will sign the bill. But her chief of staff told lawmakers Monday that she had seen nothing in the version that passed that would make her veto it.\n\nPeople are also reading...

The measure would allow the state to issue bonds to help the Chiefs and Major League Baseball's Kansas City Royals finance new stadiums on the Kansas side of their metropolitan area, which is split by the border with Missouri.\n\nTop Republicans in the GOP-controlled Legislature had promised that the stadium proposal wouldn't be debated until the Legislature approved a plan that would cut income and property taxes by a total of $1.23 billion over the next three years. Many lawmakers argued that voters would be angry if the state helped finance new stadiums without cutting taxes.\n\n\"We definitely need to demonstrate that we're getting relief to our citizens,\" said Senate President Ty Masterson, a Wichita-area Republican who backed the stadium-financing plan.\n\nKelly called the special session to have lawmakers consider reducing taxes after she vetoed three tax-cutting plans before legislators adjourned their regular annual session May 1. The plan lawmakers approved was a compromise between her and Republican leaders.\n\n'Sunday Ticket'\n\nThe federal judge presiding over the class-action lawsuit filed by \"Sunday Ticket\" subscribers against the NFL voiced frustrations with the way the plaintiffs' attorneys have handled their side of the case.\n\nBefore Dallas Cowboys owner Jerry Jones took the stand Tuesday for a second day of testimony, U.S. District Judge Philip Gutierrez said the premise of the case was simple and that it had gone in direction that it shouldn't.\n\nThe class-action covers 2.4 million residential subscribers and 48,000 businesses who paid for the package from the 2011 through 2022 seasons.\n\nThe lawsuit claims the league broke antitrust laws by selling its package of Sunday games aired on CBS and Fox at an inflated price.\n\nBRIEFLY\n\nBEARS: Chicago signed veteran receiver and return specialist DeAndre Carter to a one-year contract. The 31-year-old Carter has 108 receptions for 1,259 yards and six touchdowns over six seasons with Philadelphia, Houston, Chicago, Washington, the Los Angeles Chargers and Las Vegas Raiders. He has averaged 9.8 yards on punt returns, and 22.4 yards with one touchdown on kickoff returns.\n\nLIONS: Detroit signed all-United Football League kicker Jake Bates, who made three field goals from at least 60 yards for the Michigan Panthers this past season. The Lions added depth at a position with veteran Michael Badgley. Undrafted rookie James Turner was released. Turner kicked for Michigan's national championship team last season after transferring from Louisville.\n\nBe the first to know\n\nGet local news delivered to your inbox!\n\nSign up! * I understand

Please try again later{{ /verifyErrors }}\n\nKansas legislators trying to lure the Kansas City Chiefs to their state argue that helping the Super Bowl champions build a new stadium could bring Kansas millions of dollars in income taxes from players and coaches, which are currently going to Missouri.\n\nSome economists are dubious that new revenues from \"jock taxes\" would be significant for Kansas, and a debate over the question emerged ahead of a special session of the Kansas Legislature set to convene Tuesday. Lawmakers expect to consider a plan to authorize state bonds to help the Chiefs and professional baseball's Kansas City Royals finance new stadiums on the Kansas side of their metropolitan area, which is split by the border with Missouri.\n\nProfessional athletes and touring entertainers pay income taxes not only in their home states but also other states where they perform, if those states impose income taxes. For athletes, Kansas taxes a percentage of their income based on how many games they play in the state -- so that if a visiting minor-league infielder has 12 of his team's 120 games each season in Wichita, 10% of their income is taxed.\n\nEconomists who've studied pro sports teams for decades have concluded that subsidizing their stadiums isn't worth the cost for their communities. But supporters of bringing the Chiefs and Royals to Kansas believe that skepticism doesn't properly consider taxes from the large incomes of the best professional players.\n\n\"The 53 players are making approximately $250 million, and that continues to go up, and that doesn't include any of the executives, the coaching staff or rest of the team out there,\" Korb Maxell, a Chiefs attorney, told legislators during an informational hearing Monday at the Statehouse. \"You have all of the other visiting teams that are coming and always paying in those taxes as well.\"\n\nKansas already collects some income taxes from professional athletes, though the state Department of Revenue does not have figures. The state is home to NASCAR's Kansas Speedway, professional soccer's Sporting KC and several minor league baseball and hockey teams.\n\nMissouri is home for the Chiefs, the Royals, Major League Baseball's St. Louis Cardinals and the National Hockey League's St. Louis Blues, plus two minor-league baseball teams.\n\nMissouri has collected nearly $34 million in income taxes from professional athletes during the current budget year that began July 1, up 9% from the $31 million collected the previous year, according to the state. However, during the current budget year, when the Chiefs won their third Super Bowl in five years, taxes from football players jumped 39% from about $14 million to $19 million.\n\nIt's not clear how much of Missouri's revenue would come to Kansas if its lawmakers succeed in attracting the Chiefs, the Royals or both.\n\nGeoffrey Propheter, an associate professor of public affairs at the University of Colorado Denver who regularly publishes papers on sports economics, predicted that the figure for the Chiefs would be \"trivial,\" only a few million dollars, even if they also moved practice facilities to Kansas.\n\nHe also said lawmakers should consider additional issues that come with a new stadium, such as traffic congestion, light pollution and how rising property values make housing less affordable to local residents.\n\n\"On the Kansas side of the river, they get access to the team without paying the cost,\" he said. \"That's a fantastic situation to be in.\"\n\nOthers' figures for potential new income tax revenues are millions of dollars higher.\n\nOne potential issue is whether Kansas' rule could withstand a court challenge. Edward Zelinsky, a professor at Yeshiva University's Cardozo School of Law in New York City, said such rules unfairly over-tax athletes.\n\nA tax law specialist, he's familiar with how states tax visiting athletes. In the 1990s, Zelinsky challenged a New York rule like Kansas' because New York taxed all of his income even though he works mostly from home in Connecticut. He lost, but in 2015, the Ohio Supreme Court ruled that visiting athletes must be taxed based on how many total work days they spend in the state -- in that case, two out of 157 -- instead of the games played there, a larger percentage.\n\nZelinsky said stadium advocates can argue that being able to tax athletes' incomes is an advantage, but it doesn't drive the economics surrounding a venue.\n\n\"It'll be a nice chunk of change, but I wouldn't use this to control the debate,\" Zelinsky said.\n\n___\n\nAssociated Press writer Summer Ballentine in Columbia, Missouri, contributed to this story.", "source": {"uri": "independent.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Independent"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kansas_City_Chiefs", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Kansas City Chiefs"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kansas_City_Royals", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Kansas City Royals"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Income_tax", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Income tax"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Missouri", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Missouri"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Missouri"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kansas", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Kansas"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Kansas"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Super_Bowl", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Super Bowl"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minor_League_Baseball", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Minor League Baseball"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/U.S._Bank_Stadium", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "U.S. Bank Stadium"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kansas_Legislature", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Kansas Legislature"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infielder", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Infielder"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Professional_sports", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Professional sports"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metropolitan_area", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Metropolitan area"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bond_(finance)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Bond (finance)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baseball", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Baseball"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kansas_Speedway", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Kansas Speedway"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sporting_Kansas_City", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Sporting Kansas City"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/St._Louis_Blues", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "St. Louis Blues"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/St._Louis_Cardinals", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "St. Louis Cardinals"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Hockey_League", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "National Hockey League"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NASCAR", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "NASCAR"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lawyer", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Lawyer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Major_League_Baseball", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Major League Baseball"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wichita,_Kansas", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Wichita, Kansas"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Wichita, Kansas"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edward_Zelinsky", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Edward Zelinsky"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yeshiva_University", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Yeshiva University"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Benjamin_N._Cardozo_School_of_Law", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Benjamin N.

League Baseball's Kansas City Royals away from Missouri.\n\nThe measure to authorize state bonds to help finance new stadiums and practice facilities for both teams has been agreed.\n\nThey could be on the Kansas side of the metropolitan area of 2.3 million residents, which is split by the border with Missouri.\n\nThe plan is from the Republican-controlled Legislature.\n\nWhile Democratic Governor Laura Kelly has stopped short of promising to sign it, she said in a statement that \"Kansas now has the opportunity to become a professional sports powerhouse.\"\n\n\"We're excited about what happened here today,\" Korb Maxwell, an attorney for the Chiefs who lives on the Kansas side, said.\n\n\"This is incredibly real.\"\n\nThe lease on the Missouri complex which houses both the Chiefs and Royals runs until 2031.\n\nThe Chiefs have indicated they want to stay at Arrowhead long into the future, but the Royals have said they won't play at their Kauffman Stadium beyond the 2030 MLB season.\n\nEarlier this year, the Chiefs had their Arrowhead future thrown into further doubt as residents rejected a new tax plan to fund renovations.\n\nResidents of Jackson County, Missouri, resoundingly voted down a sales tax measure that the Chiefs were hoping would help with renovations to Arrowhead, and the Royals wanted for their proposed new park.\n\nMore than 58 per cent of voters ultimately rejected the plan, which would have replaced three-eighths of a cent sales tax that has been paying for the upkeep of Truman Sports Complex - which houses both stadiums - with a similar tax that was planned for the next 40 years.\n\nThe Kansas City Chiefs were always a big deal, but recent events have made them an even greater asset.\n\nUnder coach Andy Reid, the Chiefs have created the NFL's newest dynasty.\n\nThe Chiefs won the 2020 Super Bowl with victory over the San Francisco 49ers.\n\nThat was just the start as inspired by quarterback Patrick Mahomes, they've won back-to-back Super Bowls in the last two seasons to make it a glorious hat-trick.\n\nThe Chiefs beat the Philadelphia Eagles to win the 2023 Super Bowl.\n\nAnd Kansas City came back to stun the 49ers again in Las Vegas in February.\n\nArrowhead does at times show its age, but there's no doubt it's a famous and compelling home for the Chiefs.\n\nIt'a a stadium admired by fans locally and many far beyond.\n\nBut it's not certain right now that the Chiefs will play there long into the future.", "source": {"uri": "the-sun.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The US Sun"}, "authors": [{"uri":

Usually so-called STAR bonds are capped at 50% of project costs. After passing the House by a vote of 84 to 38, the legislation will now be considered by the state Senate.\n\nThe effort to entice the Chiefs comes after voters in a Missouri county rejected the extension of a sales tax that would help fund renovations to the team's 50-year-old NFL stadium in Kansas City, Missouri. The funds would have also been used to build a new ballpark for the MLB's Royals.\n\n\"How about those Chiefs?,\" jested Kansas lawmaker Ken Rahjes. He told his colleagues that the road to a \"yes\" vote was a lonely one and he initially had concerns about the proposal. However, many of his constituents were in favor of the plan, which helped ease worries.\n\nStill, some lawmakers spoke out against the bill. \"I think the Chiefs and the Royals are pretty much using us,\" Susan Ruiz, a Democratic lawmaker, said during the legislative hearing. She added that she thinks the teams will ultimately end up staying in Missouri.\n\nRuiz said she would rather lawmakers take on the expansion of Medicaid and provide funding for the homeless.\n\nAnd Paul Waggoner, a Republican lawmaker, spoke out about the financial risks of the proposal to taxpayers. \"This is not your mother's STAR bonds, this is a jacked up, supersized version of STAR bonds,\" he told colleagues.\n\nJackson County, Missouri, where voters rebuffed the subsidy for the teams, is taking note of Kansas's effort to lure the teams. Jackson County Executive Frank White, Jr., a former All-Star player for the Royals, criticized the \"bidding war\" for the teams in a statement on Tuesday.\n\n\"The state of Kansas is considering using STAR bonds at unprecedented levels to attract our teams across the state line, despite the historic 2019 agreement to end the economic border war between Missouri and Kansas,\" he said in the statement. \"This competition does not serve our residents or our communities.\"", "source": {"uri": "bnnbloomberg.ca", "dataType": "news", "title": "BNN"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kansas_City_Chiefs", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Kansas City Chiefs"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bond_(finance)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Bond (finance)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sales_tax", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Sales tax"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Major_League_Baseball", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Major League Baseball"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Missouri", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Missouri"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Missouri"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kansas", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Kansas"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Kansas"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/U.S._Bank_Stadium", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "U.S. Bank Stadium"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kentucky_Senate", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Kentucky Senate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kansas_City_Royals", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Kansas City Royals"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bloomberg_L.P.", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Bloomberg L.P."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/County_(United_States)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "County (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Democratic Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kansas_City,_Missouri", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Kansas City, Missouri"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Kansas City, Missouri"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-Hispanic_whites", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Non-Hispanic whites"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medicaid", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Medicaid"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Major_League_Baseball_All-Star_Game", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Major League Baseball All-Star Game"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homelessness", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Homelessness"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republican_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Republican Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jackson_County,_Missouri", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Jackson County, Missouri"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Jackson County, Missouri"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Paintball/Teams", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Paintball/Teams", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Robotics/Competitions", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Robotics/Competitions", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "dmoz/Science/Astronomy/Stars", "label": "dmoz/Science/Astronomy/Stars", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Financial_Services/Surety_Bonds", "label": "dmoz/Business/Financial Services/Surety Bonds", "wgt": 17}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Cheerleading/All-Stars", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Cheerleading/All-Stars", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 88}], "image": "http://www.bnnbloomberg.ca/polopoly_fs/1.2086779!/fileimage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/landscape_620/p-kansas-city-chiefs-rashee-rice-nbsp-during-offseason-workouts-on-may-22-p.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9660256", "eventUri": "eng-9660256", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.04313725490196085, "wgt": 160, "relevance": 1}

Lawmakers from across the state -- even western Kansas, far from any new stadium -- supported the measure.\n\nIt would allow state bonds to cover up to 70% of each new stadium, paying them off over 30 years with revenues from sports betting, state lottery ticket sales and new sales and alcohol taxes collected from shopping and entertainment districts around the new stadiums.\n\nHouse Commerce Committee Chair Sean Tarwater, a Kansas City-area Republican, said the Chiefs still are likely to spend $500 million to $700 million in private funds on a new stadium.\n\n\"There are no blank checks,\" Tarwater told GOP colleagues during a briefing.\n\nTravis Kelce responds to typo on Chiefs' $40,000 Super Bowl ring: 'Who cares?' | NBC Sports\n\n\"Miami was actually the sixth seed.

The Raider game against Kansas City -- obviously we were preparing for Kansas -- really stuck out to us. And I was watching those guys for two weeks just on tape, and I saw it. And then soon as I got a call from Luke Getsy to see if I'd be interested in taking this opportunity, I jumped at it because I watched what I saw on the tape.\n\n\"I saw Thayer Munford. I saw those kinds of guys like that. I saw Andre James. I saw all those guys. Kolton [Miller] was the missing piece in that game, but I know Kolton Miller, I've seen a ton of his film. And so I jumped at the chance to be here, and then back in a great organization, I didn't think twice about it. It's a great opportunity for me, and I'm excited as heck to work with these guys.

Usually so-called STAR bonds are capped at 50% of project costs. After passing the House by a vote of 84 to 38, the legislation will now be considered by the state Senate.\n\nThe effort to entice the Chiefs comes after voters in a Missouri county rejected the extension of a sales tax that would help fund renovations to the team's 50-year-old NFL stadium in Kansas City, Missouri. The funds would have also been used to build a new ballpark for the MLB's Royals.\n\n\"How about those Chiefs?,\" jested Kansas lawmaker Ken Rahjes. He told his colleagues that the road to a \"yes\" vote was a lonely one and he initially had concerns about the proposal. However, many of his constituents were in favor of the plan, which helped ease worries.\n\nStill, some lawmakers spoke out against the bill. \"I think the Chiefs and the Royals are pretty much using us,\" Susan Ruiz, a Democratic lawmaker, said during the legislative hearing. She added that she thinks the teams will ultimately end up staying in Missouri.\n\nRuiz said she would rather lawmakers take on the expansion of Medicaid and provide funding for the homeless.\n\nAnd Paul Waggoner, a Republican lawmaker, spoke out about the financial risks of the proposal to taxpayers. \"This is not your mother's STAR bonds, this is a jacked up, supersized version of STAR bonds,\" he told colleagues.\n\nJackson County, Missouri, where voters rebuffed the subsidy for the teams, is taking note of Kansas's effort to lure the teams. Jackson County Executive Frank White, Jr., a former All-Star player for the Royals, criticized the \"bidding war\" for the teams in a statement on Tuesday.\n\n\"The state of Kansas is considering using STAR bonds at unprecedented levels to attract our teams across the state line, despite the historic 2019 agreement to end the economic border war between Missouri and Kansas,\" he said in the statement. \"This competition does not serve our residents or our communities.\"\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek", "source": {"uri": "ca.finance.yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo!

Kansas House approves proposal to fund new stadium across state line - CBSSports.com", "body": "Getty Images\n\nThe Kansas City Chiefs had every intent to remain at Arrowhead Stadium, extending the lease in a renovated facility and stadium complex that would keep the franchise in the state of Missouri for the next several decades. The renovation plans still have a hurdle to clear, however, and the state of Kansas is officially ready to pounce.\n\nKansas lawmakers approved a House bill that would change certain criteria for STAR (sales tax and revenue) bonds qualification, via the Associated Press. STAR bonds are a financing tool that allows Kansas municipalities to issue bonds to finance the development of major commercial, entertainment and tourism projects. The measure now goes to the Kansas Senate.\n\nThe attempt to lure the Chiefs to cross the state line from Missouri to Kansas is seriously in play. The bill will also require any pro sports team development to include a 30,000-plus seat complex with at least $1 billion in investment. This is also an attempt to lure the Kansas City Royals' new MLB stadium plans into Kansas.\n\nThe Chiefs announced plans to renovate GEHA Field at Arrowhead Stadium this year, but those plans may be changing, thanks to some developments back in April. The voters in Jackson County, Missouri, rejected a sales tax measure that would have helped fund major renovations to Arrowhead Stadium and a new downtown ballpark for the Royals.\n\nWith the measure not being passed, the Chiefs may have to look elsewhere and build a new stadium. A potential move to Kansas doesn't force the Chiefs to relocate to another city if they can't reach a deal with Jackson County. Kansas legislation doesn't have to put a stadium sales tax up to vote, giving the Chiefs an option they'll strongly consider.\n\n\"I do feel very much a sense of urgency, and we will approach it from a broader perspective going forward because time is short for us at this point. So, we need to see what other options are out there for us,\" Chiefs CEO Clark Hunt said back in April, via a transcript provided by the team. \"I really can't speculate on how any of that is going to turn out.\n\n\"GEHA Field at Arrowhead Stadium is a special place for our family and our fanbase. That was one of the reasons we focused on it with the last effort. Going forward, it may make more sense for us to be in a new stadium.\"\n\nThe Chiefs will have options in building a new stadium, which appears to be the plan going forward with the STAR criteria passed. Hunt isn't abandoning an opportunity to remain at Arrowhead Stadium, but getting a new stadium is gaining traction.\n\nThe new stadium may not be an open-air stadium, either.\n\n\"We were obviously very focused on GEHA Field at Arrowhead Stadium. Obviously it's a special place for our fanbase and I believe it could be a special place for our fanbase for another 25 years with the right renovation,\" Hunt said. \"But we're just going to have to be open minded in how we approach this.\n\n\"That may involve a new stadium, and it could be an open-air stadium or it could be a dome stadium.\"", "source": {"uri": "cbssports.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "CBS Sports"}, "authors": [{"uri": "jeff_kerr@cbssports.com", "name": "Jeff Kerr", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arrowhead_Stadium", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Arrowhead Stadium"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kansas_City_Chiefs", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Kansas City Chiefs"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kansas", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Kansas"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Kansas"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sales_tax", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Sales tax"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Missouri", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Missouri"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Missouri"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/U.S._Bank_Stadium", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "U.S. Bank Stadium"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kansas_Senate", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Kansas Senate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kansas_City_Royals", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Kansas City Royals"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jackson_County,_Missouri", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Jackson County, Missouri"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Jackson County, Missouri"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Major_League_Baseball", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Major League Baseball"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clark_Hunt", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Clark Hunt"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Associated_Press", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Associated Press"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chief_executive_officer", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Chief executive officer"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Business/Accounting/Tax_Negotiation_and_Representation", "label": "dmoz/Business/Accounting/Tax Negotiation and Representation", "wgt": 9}, {"uri": "dmoz/Science/Social_Sciences/Urban_and_Regional_Planning", "label": "dmoz/Science/Social Sciences/Urban and Regional Planning", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/Stadiums", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/Stadiums", "wgt": 53}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Greyhound_Racing/Tracks", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Greyhound Racing/Tracks", "wgt": 17}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Greyhound_Racing", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Greyhound Racing", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 75}], "image": "https://sportshub.cbsistatic.com/i/r/2024/06/19/ed39a505-cdcc-465f-99b1-e40e51704b89/thumbnail/1200x675/e9c56610c56d5153f0898176a13abcb3/chiefs-field-g.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9660256", "eventUri": "eng-9660256", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.192156862745098, "wgt": 157, "relevance": 1}

Ethan Corson, right, arrives at a dinner hosted by the Kansas City Royals at a steakhouse in Lawrence. The dinner meeting came ahead of a vote on whether to expand a tax incentive program for a potential new baseball stadium in Kansas. (Sherman Smith/Kansas Reflector)\n\nLAWRENCE -- On the eve of a vote that could yield $750 million for a new Kansas City Royals baseball stadium in Kansas, a team executive met with several Democratic state lawmakers at a Lawrence steakhouse.\n\nBrooks Sherman, chief operating officer for the Royals, and lobbyists hosted lawmakers at the Six Mile Chop House and Tavern on Monday \"to talk about the Royals interest in Kansas,\" according to an email from a lobbyist inviting Kansas House and Senate Democrats.\n\nOutside the restaurant, lawmakers told Kansas Reflector they weren't concerned about the idea of their votes on legislation worth hundreds of millions of dollars being influenced over dinner.\n\n\"It happens,\" said Sen. Marci Francisco, a Lawrence Democrat. \"Most of the discussions in the Legislature go on behind closed doors.\"\n\nThe meal came the night before lawmakers were expected to vote on whether to expand a state tax incentive program to help finance a new stadium for the Royals or the Kansas City Chiefs to lure the teams from Missouri.\n\nThe bill, which was discussed in an informational hearing Monday, would enhance the state's existing Sales Tax and Revenue (STAR) Bond program to provide up to 75% of the project's cost for a professional football or baseball stadium project with a minimum $1 billion investment. STAR Bonds are issued to pay for the construction and repaid by the increased state sales tax revenue at the project site.\n\nNormally, STAR Bonds, which are intended to help pay for tourism and entertainment destinations, are only authorized to finance up to 50% of a project. Debt on a stadium constructed under the expansion wouldn't have to be repaid for 30 years instead of the normal 20.\n\nThe project could also receive a boost from liquor taxes generated in the STAR Bond district and revenues from a fund Kansas created when it legalized sports betting.\n\nThe Chiefs shut down a city block near the Capitol in Topeka for a rally at the Celtic Fox restaurant at lunchtime Tuesday.\n\nOn her way into the restaurant, Francisco said she wasn't supporting the current bill but would be interested to know whether the Royals would support a standalone deal. She wasn't sure what level of impact dinners with lobbyists have on lawmakers' overall support.\n\nFrancisco said she was uncomfortable that revenue information from the project would not be released and that there was not enough public testimony on the legislation.\n\nRep. Jerry Stogsdill, a Democrat from Prairie Village, said it was \"par for the course\" for lawmakers to get lobbied at evening events. He said he has discussed issues with lobbyists and asked for information but that in his eight years in the Legislature he has never been influenced to change his vote on an issue.\n\n\"I don't think there's going to be a single person in there tonight that is going to be persuaded to vote against their conscience and against their constituents,\" he said.\n\nStogsdill said he imagined he'd vote for the legislation and thought a stadium would be an economic boon to the community around it.\n\nSen. Ethan Corson, a fellow Prairie Village Democrat, said didn't see Kansas' efforts to help finance one or both stadiums as competing with Missouri. He'd be fine if the teams stayed in Kansas City, Missouri, but he said the Missouri Legislature is \"beyond dysfunctional.\"\n\n\"I worry about their ability to do anything, really,\" Corson said, \"so I think this is a chance to put something on the table so, that way, we can say we made a reasonable effort to keep the teams in the metro.\"\n\nRep. Linda Featherston, an Overland Park Democrat, said Monday she declined to attend the lobbying event.\n\n\"I don't want there to be any questions about undue influence,\" she said.\n\nRep. Cindy Neighbor, a Shawnee Democrat, attended Monday's dinner and recounted the sales pitch in a meeting of House Democrats Tuesday morning.\n\nShe said the Royals are looking at three potential sites in Wyandotte County where they could build a 34,500-seat stadium. The team, she said, believes its current home, Kauffman Stadium, is crumbling and that repairs would cost at least $800 million. It also doesn't have enough office space or room for medical personnel.\n\nRoyals executives told attendees that most ticket buyers are from Johnson County, Neighbor said, and that the team is not interested in having conversations about staying where they are.", "source": {"uri": "yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

Jones is testifying in a class-action lawsuit filed by \"Sunday Ticket\" subscribers claiming the NFL broke antitrust laws.\n\nASSOCIATED PRESS\n\nTOPEKA, Kan. -- Kansas legislators approved a plan Tuesday aimed at luring the Kansas City Chiefs away from Missouri by helping to finance a new stadium for the Super Bowl champions.\n\nThe bill passed by the Republican-controlled Legislature and sent to Democratic Gov. Laura Kelly would allow Kansas to issue bonds to cover up to 70% of the costs of a new stadium in the state for the Chiefs and another for Major League Baseball's Kansas City Royals.\n\nThe state would pay off its bonds over 30 years with revenues from sports betting, Kansas Lottery ticket sales and new sales and alcohol taxes collected from shopping and entertainment districts around the sites for the new stadiums.\n\nKelly has not said whether she will sign the bill. But her chief of staff told lawmakers Monday that she had seen nothing in the version that passed that would make her veto it.\n\nPeople are also reading...\n\nOwner of Starbeck's Smokehouse opening burger restaurant in Cedar Falls in July Deere & Co. to pay $1.1 million in back wages, interest to Black and Hispanic applicants College Football: Cedar Falls native, grandson of former Panther basketball assistant coach commits to UNI Car trapped under semitruck in collision on North Elk Run Road Two transported to hospital Saturday after motorcycle crashed in ditch Greene man airlifted after motorcycle crashes with pickup west of Plainfield One arrested in overnight Waterloo shooting that sent man to hospital MLB Baseball: Chicago Cubs sign Cedar Falls native, former Iowa Hawkeye to minor league deal Two women charged in counterfeiting operation at Evansdale home Nebraska man arrested in Quasqueton cemetery crash Cancer journey strengthens deep bond between Relay for Life honorary survivor, caregiver Several injured in Bremer County crash High School Baseball: Cedar Falls' Coonradt making most of opportunities before freshman season at Iowa Waterloo offices closed for Wednesday for Juneteenth; construction at yard waste site High School Baseball: West beats East as Gardner blasts grand slam, drives in five\n\nKansas legislators see the two teams as in play because in April, voters on the Missouri side of the Kansas City metropolitan area refused to extend a sales tax used to keep up the teams' existing stadiums, which sit side by side.\n\nThe votes came after a debate that many lawmakers said they needed to see before considering a plan to help the Super Bowl champions finance a new stadium. The measure would allow the state to issue bonds to help the Chiefs and Major League Baseball's Kansas City Royals finance new stadiums on the Kansas side of their metropolitan area, which is split by the border with Missouri.\n\nTop Republicans in the GOP-controlled Legislature had promised that the stadium proposal wouldn't be debated until the Legislature approved a plan that would cut income and property taxes by a total of $1.23 billion over the next three years. Many lawmakers argued that voters would be angry if the state helped finance new stadiums without cutting taxes.\n\n\"We definitely need to demonstrate that we're getting relief to our citizens,\" said Senate President Ty Masterson, a Wichita-area Republican who backed the stadium-financing plan.\n\nKelly called the special session to have lawmakers consider reducing taxes after she vetoed three tax-cutting plans before legislators adjourned their regular annual session May 1. The plan lawmakers approved was a compromise between her and Republican leaders.\n\n'Sunday Ticket'\n\nThe federal judge presiding over the class-action lawsuit filed by \"Sunday Ticket\" subscribers against the NFL voiced frustrations with the way the plaintiffs' attorneys have handled their side of the case.\n\nBefore Dallas Cowboys owner Jerry Jones took the stand Tuesday for a second day of testimony, U.S. District Judge Philip Gutierrez said the premise of the case was simple and that it had gone in direction that it shouldn't.\n\nThe class-action covers 2.4 million residential subscribers and 48,000 businesses who paid for the package from the 2011 through 2022 seasons.\n\nThe lawsuit claims the league broke antitrust laws by selling its package of Sunday games aired on CBS and Fox at an inflated price.\n\nBRIEFLY\n\nBEARS: Chicago signed veteran receiver and return specialist DeAndre Carter to a one-year contract.

He has averaged 9.8 yards on punt returns, and 22.4 yards with one touchdown on kickoff returns.\n\nLIONS: Detroit signed all-United Football League kicker Jake Bates, who made three field goals from at least 60 yards for the Michigan Panthers this past season. The Lions added depth at a position with veteran Michael Badgley. Undrafted rookie James Turner was released. Turner kicked for Michigan's national championship team last season after transferring from Louisville.\n\nLove\n\n0\n\nFunny\n\n0\n\nWow\n\n0\n\nSad\n\n0\n\nAngry\n\n0\n\nBe the first to know\n\nGet

The measure would allow the state to issue bonds to help the Chiefs and Major League Baseball's Kansas City Royals finance new stadiums on the Kansas side of their metropolitan area, which is split by the border with Missouri.\n\nBut top Republicans in the GOP-controlled Legislature promised that the stadium proposal wouldn't be debated until the Legislature approved a plan that would cut income and property taxes by a total of $1.23 billion over the next three years. Many lawmakers argued that voters would be angry if the state helped finance new stadiums without cutting taxes.\n\nPeople are also reading...\n\nFormer Sioux City hotel under renovation, to become high-rise senior housing this year Lost and found: How Arnolds Park got a miniature train back after more than 50 years Jefferson, S.D. dad shares secret to fatherhood on Father's Day celebration Perley to step down as Thompson CEO; Beaulieu to take over Man charged with stabbing at Sioux City hotel Sioux City Marina operator countersues city over lease dispute Omaha ballpark seeks to ban two Texas A&M fans who were kicked out of College World Series game Athlete of the Week: Miller's motor leading the way for West Monona Le Mars man arrested after standoff for breaking woman's nose Tyson Foods heir suspended as CFO after second alcohol-related arrest Our Opinion: WITCC settlement in human trafficking case raises more questions Marriage licenses for Woodbury County for June 17, 2024 Inclusive Sioux City Advisory Committee has lost members since Ghebrekidan suspension, termination Chainsaw sculptures among latest upgrades to Sioux City's historic Hubbard Park Elk Creek Road construction project begins next week\n\n\"We definitely need to demonstrate that we're getting relief to our citizens,\" said Senate President Ty Masterson, a Wichita-area Republican who backed the stadium-financing plan.\n\nDemocratic Gov. Laura Kelly called the special session to have lawmakers consider reducing taxes after she vetoed three tax-cutting plans before legislators adjourned their regular annual session May 1. The plan lawmakers approved was a compromise between her and Republican leaders.\n\nLegislators made no changes in the plan before passing it, 34-4 in the Senate and 121-2 in the House. Kelly pledged to sign the measure into law.\n\nOnce legislators convened the special session, Kelly couldn't control what they considered, and that created an opening to consider the stadium-financing plan. That measure would use revenues from sports betting, the state lottery and new taxes raised from the area around each new stadium to pay off the state's bonds over 30 years.\n\nThe first version of the stadium-financing plan emerged in late April, but lawmakers didn't vote on it before adjourning. It would have allowed state bonds to finance all stadium construction costs, but the version to be considered by lawmakers Tuesday would cap the amount at 70% and require legislative leaders and the governor to sign off on any bonding plan.\n\nHouse Commerce Committee Chair Sean Tarwater, a Kansas City-area Republican, said the Chiefs are likely to spend between $500 million and $700 million in private funds on a new stadium.\n\nBRIEFLY\n\nLIONS: Detroit signed all-United Football League kicker Jake Bates, who made three field goals from at least 60 yards for the Michigan Panthers this past season.

Sean Tarwater, (R-Kan.) who carried the bill, said on the House floor.\n\nWith the passage of this bill, the state of Kansas could pay for up to 70% of the cost of the stadium project.\n\nThe bonds would be paid back over a thirty-year period from new sales taxes created in the district, liquor taxes in the district, and money generated by a sports wagering fund. Cities and counties could participate in the district, or opt out.\n\nThe district would be determined by the secretary of commerce as part of negotiations.\n\nPeople on the \"no side of this are clear, this is too big of a risk, there is not enough information as to the benefit this would have and if in the end it would hurt Kansas tax payers.\n\n\"I couldn't ensure myself that the tax payers that I represent wouldn't ultimately be on the hook if this didn't work out. I think we do need more time. I don't know what the rush is, they say it has to be done yesterday a lot of us - somebody is going to be back here in 6 months and why can't we spend the first week of our return if this is that important to deal with it at that point,\" Rep. Bob Lewis (R-Kan.), who voted no said.\n\nBut nevertheless, that opposition never stood a chance. Both votes getting more than enough creating a super majority vote situation. The House voted 84-38 while the Senate was 27-8.\n\nThe importance of having the super majority support means that this is veto proof if Kansas Gov. Laura Kelly decided to do that.\n\nAlthough that would be a surprise because every indication given from her office indicates she will sign this into law once it makes it to her desk.\n\nThe Royals released the following statement Tuesday:\n\n\"We're grateful to the Kansas Legislature for today's bipartisan action that gives the state a pragmatic tool in which to achieve its economic development goals. The Kansas City Royals look forward to additional conversations as we evaluate where we will play baseball in the future. We will always prioritize the best interests of our fans, associates, and taxpayers in this process.\"\n\nThe Chiefs released the following statement as well Tuesday:\n\n\"We appreciate that leaders in the State of Kansas proactively reached out to us for input on the proposed STAR Bond legislation. We support their efforts to expand the existing program and congratulate them on passing the legislation in special session.

Laura Kelly envisions the day when the state becomes a \"professional sports powerhouse.\"\n\nThe state's legislators are following her lead.\n\nMs. Kelly will now review the plan and is expected to approve the proposal for the new athletic sites.\n\n\"Kansas now has the opportunity to become a professional sports powerhouse with the Chiefs and Royals potentially joining Sporting KC as major league attractions, all with robust, revenue-generating entertainment districts surrounding them providing new jobs, new visitors, and new revenues that boost the Kansas economy,\" she added.\n\nWhile there is still much work and debate ahead to get final approval for the facilities, both the defending Super Bowl champion Chiefs and Royals appreciate that the Kansas lawmakers are considering new facilities.\n\nThe Chiefs currently play in GEHA Field at Arrowhead Stadium, which was opened in 1972 and lacks many of the amenities of some of the new state-of-the-art stadiums such as those in Dallas and Los Angeles.\n\nIn April, residents of Jackson County, Missouri, voted down a sales tax measure that would have helped fund a new downtown ballpark along with major renovations to Arrowhead Stadium. The Chiefs had committed $300 million in private money and would have used their share as part of the current stadium's proposed $800 million renovation.\n\nThis opened the door for a potential new home in Kansas.\n\nThe Royals are dealing with similar issues because they play at Kauffman Stadium, which opened in 1973. While it is one of the most scenic stadiums in Major League Baseball, with a fountain and waterfall display behind the right-field fence, the site also lacks modern amenities.\n\nThe Royals had pledged at least $1 billion from ownership for the renovations to Kauffman Stadium and wanted to use their share of the tax revenue to help fund a $2 billion-plus ballpark district. The Royals lease at the Truman Sports Complex runs through Jan. 31, 2031, and team officials have said they will not play at Kauffman Stadium beyond the 2030 season.\n\nNow, a move to Kansas is in the works, and the Royals are receptive to a new home.\n\nOther states have taken measures to ensure their professional sports teams stay in town.\n\nThe Ravens are allocating about $430 million of the $600 million of state funds for stadium improvements.\n\n\"M&T Bank Stadium is not just home to the Ravens, but it's an epicenter of excitement, opportunity, and Maryland pride. ... This renovation program positions M&T Bank Stadium as a venue that will continue to provide Ravens fans with one of the best game day experiences in all of sports, while also attracting world-class concerts and other live events to Maryland,\" she added.\n\nIn December, the Orioles agreed to a 30-year lease extension at Camden Yards. The team was sold to David Rubenstein and his ownership group in March for $1.725 billion. Mr. Rubenstein plans to use the $600 million in state funds for stadium renovations to revitalize the park.\n\nMarty Conway, an adjunct professor at Georgetown University who teaches courses in sports leadership, told The Epoch Times that the vote in the Kansas Legislature is a very preliminary move and signals their interest in negotiating a package for the teams. The most likely next step is for the public officials in Jackson County, where both teams currently play, to revisit their stadium funding capabilities, likely in the upcoming fall 2024 election cycle.\n\n\"Typically, those moves, or threats of a move, are over much larger distances, sometimes thousands of miles,\" Mr. Conway said. \"Currently, the Royals and Chiefs play their games approximately 20 miles from the border between Kansas and Missouri. A move of this type wouldn't disrupt the fan experience or opportunity, somewhat like the Atlanta Braves moving from Fulton County to Cobb County in 2017.\"\n\nMissouri Gov. Mike Parson plans to find ways to keep the Chiefs and Royals in the state, but more money and support is currently one state away in Kansas.", "source": {"uri": "theepochtimes.com", "dataType":

(KSNW) -- A new tax plan is on the table for Kansas lawmakers, setting aside millions of dollars in tax relief, as well as a plan to lure the Kansas City Chiefs or Royals to Kansas.\n\nLawmakers wrapped up a round of informational hearings on Monday. It's starting to sound like a broken record with just how many tax plans we saw come up this session, but this seems to be one that everyone in leadership at least is signing on to, including the governor.\n\nIt's not that different from what we saw her strike down in April. This one still has some bipartisan perks, like cutting the Social Security and food tax. Still, it makes some minor adjustments to meet the \"affordability criteria\" from the governor, which means getting rid of some of the property tax relief. That's been a sore spot for some.\n\nWe could see this come up during the debate Tuesday. Lawmakers, though, get to keep the two-rate income tax system that some have been pushing for. It gets rid of the bottom bracket for low-income taxpayers.\n\nTax cuts could save Kansans $1.2B over 3 years\n\n\"The personal exemption for dependents increases from 2,250 to 2,320 for every dependent that you have. Then, we get rid of the bottom tax bracket, 3.1%. I think the calculation during the session was $31,000 and below will not be paying state income tax,\" said Senator Caryn Tyson (R), Senate Tax Chair.\n\nAccording to the senator, that's for a family of four. So, how much does this package cost?\n\nThat's been the biggest issue in this debate.\n\nFor perspective, the quote that came up on Monday was $471.6 million in fiscal year 2025.\n\nThat's about $128 million less than the package the governor vetoed would've cost for that fiscal year. We're told this package is going to be starting in the Senate.\n\nA plan to lure the Chiefs or Royals to Kansas is just hours away from going up for debate in Tuesday's special session of the legislature.\n\nIt's going to take a lot of money, and we're talking billions of dollars, to build a stadium for either team.\n\nThe bill will cover 70% percent of the cost, and the minimum capital investment would be $1 billion. In addition, it has a 30-year payback schedule.\n\nThe money would be paid back through 100% of the sales tax on alcohol sales made within the stadium district. That's along with the state revenue from sports gambling and lottery gaming.\n\nKansas committees meet over STAR bonds bill to lure Chiefs, Royals\n\nJust like the tax plan we've been tracking for the special session, cost has been a concern. Some groups arguing that the responsibility falls on the taxpayers.\n\n\"The bondholders themselves are the ones that are liable for the star bonds. The taxpayer is not liable for the star bonds,\" said Ron Ryckman, Scoop and Score.\n\n\"What I'm speaking of is the fact that it's a subsidy, which means taxpayers are paying for this, and as opposed to going to services that benefit everybody, it's going to one or possibly two out-of-state billionaires,\" said Michael Austin, AFP Kansas Legislative Director.\n\nIt's important to note that there is a provision in the bill that notes that the money will only come from those revenue streams that we mentioned as opposed to \"general state revenue.\" We're told that the plan is going to be starting off in the House.\n\nThe special session kicks off at 9 a.m. on Tuesday.\n\nCopyright 2024 Nexstar Media, Inc.

Laura Kelly would allow Kansas to issue bonds to cover up to 70% of the costs of a new stadium in the state for the Chiefs and another for Major League Baseball's Kansas City Royals.\n\nThe state would pay off its bonds over 30 years with revenues from sports betting, Kansas Lottery ticket sales and new sales and alcohol taxes collected from shopping and entertainment districts around the sites for the new stadiums.\n\nKelly has not said whether she will sign the bill.

The measure would allow the state to issue bonds to help the Chiefs and Major League Baseball's Kansas City Royals finance new stadiums on the Kansas side of their metropolitan area, which is split by the border with Missouri.\n\nTop Republicans in the GOP-controlled Legislature had promised that the stadium proposal wouldn't be debated until the Legislature approved a plan that would cut income and property taxes by a total of $1.23 billion over the next three years. Many lawmakers argued that voters would be angry if the state helped finance new stadiums without cutting taxes.\n\n\"We definitely need to demonstrate that we're getting relief to our citizens,\" said Senate President Ty Masterson, a Wichita-area Republican who backed the stadium-financing plan.\n\nKelly called the special session to have lawmakers consider reducing taxes after she vetoed three tax-cutting plans before legislators adjourned their regular annual session May 1. The plan lawmakers approved was a compromise between her and Republican leaders.\n\n'Sunday Ticket'\n\nThe federal judge presiding over the class-action lawsuit filed by \"Sunday Ticket\" subscribers against the NFL voiced frustrations with the way the plaintiffs' attorneys have handled their side of the case.\n\nBefore Dallas Cowboys owner Jerry Jones took the stand Tuesday for a second day of testimony, U.S. District Judge Philip Gutierrez said the premise of the case was simple and that it had gone in direction that it shouldn't.\n\nThe class-action covers 2.4 million residential subscribers and 48,000 businesses who paid for the package from the 2011 through 2022 seasons.\n\nThe lawsuit claims the league broke antitrust laws by selling its package of Sunday games aired on CBS and Fox at an inflated price.\n\nBRIEFLY\n\nBEARS: Chicago signed veteran receiver and return specialist DeAndre Carter to a one-year contract.

Laura Kelly's chief of staff Will Lawrence told lawmakers that Kelly would sign the bill if it wasn't meaningfully changed from what was presented at a committee meeting on Monday. The House and Senate passed the bill without amendments, meaning an incentive package is likely to be offered to the Kansas City sports teams.\n\n\"Our members saw a vision and a future for Kansas that literally will bring hundreds of thousands if not millions of people to see the Chiefs,\" said House Speaker Dan Hawkins, R-Wichita.\n\nJackson County, Missouri, voters rejected a proposed renewal of a three-eights cent sales tax in April. Kansas lawmakers sprang into action to workshop a bill that would target the franchises. The original proposal failed earlier this session after it didn't get a vote as legislators focused on passing tax cuts, but lawmakers returned Tuesday for a special session. After tax cuts passed Tuesday, they turned their attention to the Chiefs.\n\nBefore the floor debate, a joint committee heard testimony from both sides of the debate. Legal representatives for the Chiefs and Royals, as well as lobbyists from Scoop and Score, a 501c4 dedicated to moving the Chiefs to Kansas, spoke in favor of the proposition.\n\nOpposed were some of the most influential conservative groups in the state, Americans for Prosperity Kansas and the Kansas Policy Institute.\n\nThe proposal allots 70% of funding for stadium projects with a revamped version of Sales Tax and Revenue (STAR) bonds, which would use sales taxes from the stadiums and in the surrounding business districts to pay off the bonds. It only uses state sales taxes unless a municipality gets involved and foregoes some local sales taxes for the project.\n\nThe Kansas Department of Commerce would have to approve the project after an independent economists assesses the financial impact. The state's Legislative Coordinating Council would ultimately approve any deal, which would have to be made within a year. If negotiations aren't done within a year, the Legislature can extend talks another year.\n\nThe bill also allows funds earmarked for attracting a sports franchise that are currently funded by revenues from sports gambling and from lottery revenues in excess of $71.5 million per year. The bonds would need to be paid out over a 30-year period.\n\nRep. Sean Tarwater, R-Stilwell, served as the carrier of the bill, and was tasked with describing it's provisions and answering questions from other lawmakers. He said this is an opportunity to save the sports teams from a potential move out of state, and to take it out of the hands of Missouri -- which lost the St. Louis Rams, Kansas City Kings and other professional sports teams.\n\nTarwater also pointed to STAR Bond's success in large-scale sports projects, as well as the revenue generated by the Chiefs and the civic pride in retaining the teams.\n\n\"The number one tourism project that we paid for with STAR Bonds is that racetrack up in Wyandotte County, and the number two is the stadium up there, and number three is all up in the same area. Well that area was a field when it first started,\" Tarwater said. \"We produce over $100 million in just sales tax, there are 100 new companies that were created that are now up there. There are 5,700 every-day jobs. There are houses and apartment complexes and all kinds of construction and it started with a STAR Bond.\"\n\nSeveral Democratic supporters couched criticisms of the process while still maintaining support for the bill.\n\nHouse Minority Leader Vic Miller, D-Topeka, who ultimately voted for the bill, said he didn't like the lack of transparency in the bill. He proposed an amendment that would make the deal public before approval. Under the bill, the deal will only become public after it is approved by the Legislative Coordinating Council. Tarwater said that'd allow others to undermine Kansas's deal, and the amendment failed.\n\nRep. Boog Highberger, D-Lawrence, also noted that the lead lobbyists advocating for the move Scoop and Score don't disclose their donors. He likened it to the 2022 legalization of sports gambling that had a last-minute change that diverted 80% of revenues from sports gambling to a fund to attract a professional sports team, the same fund that'll partially finance bonds in this bill.\n\nRep. Jason Probst, D-Hutchinson, stood in support of the bill but protested how efficient the legislative process is when there are money and donors involved.\n\n\"It is amazing to me the speed with which we can solve problems when they're oriented around wealth, when they're oriented around business. We can come up with a solution and we can buy every lobbyist in the building and we can create a virtual armada of lobbying effort to get this done,\" Probst said. \"But I never see anything that even comes close to this kind of effort, to this kind of solidarity on anything that actually affects the human condition -- when we have discussions about homelessness or hunger or childhood poverty.\"\n\nFiscal conservatives also raised issue with the project, noting a historical precedent of poor returns on public investments in stadiums.\n\n\"You take the serious business press and they're all over what a scandal public subsidies to stadiums actually are, that as far as a notion that it has a good return on investment, that it meets a good economic development criteria is basically laughable,\" said Rep. Paul Waggoner, R-Hutchinson.\n\nThe bill passed with 84 votes, a two-thirds majority. Overall, the votes for and against didn't have a strong partisan bias, with both parties having a similar percent of their caucus voting for either side.\n\nAfter the House debate, the Senate passed the bill after about two hours of debate. Fewer opponents raised concern in the Senate, but Sen. Molly Baumgardner, R-Louisburg, did have several pointed questions for the bill's carrier Sen. J.R. Claeys, R-Salina, on potential use of eminent domain, potential renovation costs interrupting the bond schedule and the lack of time to review the bill.\n\nSeveral dissenters also spoke out after the vote: Sen. Mike Thompson, R-Shawnee, saying the loose framework and lack of legislative oversight could be an issue, Sen. Alicia Straub, R-Ellinwood, called it a gamble and Sen. Marci Francisco, D-Lawrence, was concerned about the transfer of lottery funds in excess of $71.5 million could lose value over time.\n\nThe vote was 27-8, with most of the dissenters being Republicans.\n\nKelly commended the legislature after the House and Senate approved the bill. Kelly can't officially sign it into law until after the legislation is formally delivered to her, which could take several days.\n\n\"The bipartisan effort to invite the Chiefs and Royals to Kansas shows we're all-in on keeping our beloved teams in the Kansas City metro,\" Kelly said in a statement. \"Kansas now has the opportunity to become a professional sports powerhouse with the Chiefs and Royals potentially joining Sporting KC as major league attractions, all with robust, revenue-generating entertainment districts surrounding them providing new jobs, new visitors, and new revenues that boost the Kansas economy.\"\n\nNow the sports teams and the Kansas Department of Commerce can commence negotiating on a potential stadium.

The measure would allow the state to issue bonds to help the Chiefs and Major League Baseball's Kansas City Royals finance new stadiums on the Kansas side of their metropolitan area, which is split by the border with Missouri.\n\nBut top Republicans in the GOP-controlled Legislature promised that the stadium proposal wouldn't be debated until the Legislature approved a plan that would cut income and property taxes by a total of $1.23 billion over the next three years. Many lawmakers argued that voters would be angry if the state helped finance new stadiums without cutting taxes.\n\nPeople are also reading...\n\nOwner of Starbeck's Smokehouse opening burger restaurant in Cedar Falls in July Deere & Co. to pay $1.1 million in back wages, interest to Black and Hispanic applicants College Football: Cedar Falls native, grandson of former Panther basketball assistant coach commits to UNI Car trapped under semitruck in collision on North Elk Run Road Two transported to hospital Saturday after motorcycle crashed in ditch Greene man airlifted after motorcycle crashes with pickup west of Plainfield One arrested in overnight Waterloo shooting that sent man to hospital MLB Baseball: Chicago Cubs sign Cedar Falls native, former Iowa Hawkeye to minor league deal Cancer journey strengthens deep bond between Relay for Life honorary survivor, caregiver Nebraska man arrested in Quasqueton cemetery crash Several injured in Bremer County crash High School Baseball: Cedar Falls' Coonradt making most of opportunities before freshman season at Iowa Waterloo offices closed for Wednesday for Juneteenth; construction at yard waste site High School Baseball: West beats East as Gardner blasts grand slam, drives in five High court ruling shields city in 'criminal' diving board suit\n\n\"We definitely need to demonstrate that we're getting relief to our citizens,\" said Senate President Ty Masterson, a Wichita-area Republican who backed the stadium-financing plan.\n\nDemocratic Gov. Laura Kelly called the special session to have lawmakers consider reducing taxes after she vetoed three tax-cutting plans before legislators adjourned their regular annual session May 1. The plan lawmakers approved was a compromise between her and Republican leaders.\n\nLegislators made no changes in the plan before passing it, 34-4 in the Senate and 121-2 in the House. Kelly pledged to sign the measure into law.\n\nOnce legislators convened the special session, Kelly couldn't control what they considered, and that created an opening to consider the stadium-financing plan. That measure would use revenues from sports betting, the state lottery and new taxes raised from the area around each new stadium to pay off the state's bonds over 30 years.\n\nThe first version of the stadium-financing plan emerged in late April, but lawmakers didn't vote on it before adjourning. It would have allowed state bonds to finance all stadium construction costs, but the version to be considered by lawmakers Tuesday would cap the amount at 70% and require legislative leaders and the governor to sign off on any bonding plan.\n\nHouse Commerce Committee Chair Sean Tarwater, a Kansas City-area Republican, said the Chiefs are likely to spend between $500 million and $700 million in private funds on a new stadium.\n\nBRIEFLY\n\nLIONS: Detroit signed all-United Football League kicker Jake Bates, who made three field goals from at least 60 yards for the Michigan Panthers this past season.

Lawmakers expect to consider a plan to authorize state bonds to help the Chiefs and professional baseball's Kansas City Royals finance new stadiums on the Kansas side of their metropolitan area, which is split by the border with Missouri.\n\nProfessional athletes and touring entertainers pay income taxes not only in their home states but also other states where they perform, if those states impose income taxes. For athletes, Kansas taxes a percentage of their income based on how many games they play in the state -- so that if a visiting minor-league infielder has 12 of his team's 120 games each season in Wichita, 10% of their income is taxed.\n\nPeople are also reading...

But supporters of bringing the Chiefs and Royals to Kansas believe that skepticism doesn't properly consider taxes from the large incomes of the best professional players.\n\n\"The amount of dollars that come in from the income tax side offset a good portion of some of the things that we're doing here,\" said Kansas state Sen. J.R. Claeys, a Republican from central Kansas who is working on the stadium plan.\n\nKansas already collects some income taxes from professional athletes, though the state Department of Revenue does not have figures. The state is home to NASCAR's Kansas Speedway, professional soccer's Sporting KC and several minor league baseball and hockey teams.\n\nMissouri is home for the Chiefs, the Royals, Major League Baseball's St. Louis Cardinals and the National Hockey League's St. Louis Blues, plus two minor-league baseball teams.\n\nMissouri has collected nearly $34 million in income taxes from professional athletes during the current budget year that began July 1, up 9% from the $31 million collected the previous year, according to the state. However, during the current budget year, when the Chiefs won their third Super Bowl in five years, taxes from football players jumped 39% from about $14 million to $19 million.\n\n'Sunday ticket'\n\nNFL Commissioner Roger Goodell reiterated during testimony in federal court Monday that the league's \"Sunday Ticket\" package, the subject of a class-action lawsuit, is a premium product while also defending the league's broadcast model.\n\nGoodell was called as a witness by the NFL as the trial for the lawsuit filed by \"Sunday Ticket\" subscribers entered its third week.\n\nThe class-action covers 2.4 million residential subscribers and 48,000 businesses who paid for the package from 2011 through 2022. The lawsuit claims the league broke antitrust laws by selling its package of out-of-market Sunday afternoon games at an inflated price.\n\nThe subscribers also say the league restricted competition by offering \"Sunday Ticket\" only on a satellite provider.\n\n'Hard Knocks'\n\nThe division best known for heated rivalries and star quarterbacks will be featured on HBO's \"Hard Knocks\" series this upcoming season.

popular series will feature the Chicago Bears' training camp this summer.\n\nBe the first to know\n\nGet local news delivered to your inbox!\n\nSign up! * I understand and agree that registration on

The measure would allow the state to issue bonds to help the Chiefs and Major League Baseball's Kansas City Royals finance new stadiums on the Kansas side of their metropolitan area, which is split by the border with Missouri.\n\nBut top Republicans in the GOP-controlled Legislature promised that the stadium proposal wouldn't be debated until the Legislature approved a plan that would cut income and property taxes by a total of $1.23 billion over the next three years. Many lawmakers argued that voters would be angry if the state helped finance new stadiums without cutting taxes.\n\nPeople are also reading...

Laura Kelly called the special session to have lawmakers consider reducing taxes after she vetoed three tax-cutting plans before legislators adjourned their regular annual session May 1. The plan lawmakers approved was a compromise between her and Republican leaders.\n\nLegislators made no changes in the plan before passing it, 34-4 in the Senate and 121-2 in the House. Kelly pledged to sign the measure into law.\n\nOnce legislators convened the special session, Kelly couldn't control what they considered, and that created an opening to consider the stadium-financing plan. That measure would use revenues from sports betting, the state lottery and new taxes raised from the area around each new stadium to pay off the state's bonds over 30 years.\n\nThe first version of the stadium-financing plan emerged in late April, but lawmakers didn't vote on it before adjourning. It would have allowed state bonds to finance all stadium construction costs, but the version to be considered by lawmakers Tuesday would cap the amount at 70% and require legislative leaders and the governor to sign off on any bonding plan.\n\nHouse Commerce Committee Chair Sean Tarwater, a Kansas City-area Republican, said the Chiefs are likely to spend between $500 million and $700 million in private funds on a new stadium.\n\nBRIEFLY\n\nLIONS: Detroit signed all-United Football League kicker Jake Bates, who made three field goals from at least 60 yards for the Michigan Panthers this past season.

For stadiums, that means sales taxes on food, tickets or merchandise in that area are used to pay off the bulk of the debt instead of taxpayer dollars in the state general fund.\n\nThat also means that sales tax dollars that might have otherwise paid for public services -- including entertainment spending that shifts from an existing business to whatever a STAR bond financed -- go to the project that's financed with state help.

But the Kansas Department of Commerce said almost 80% of STAR bonds projects are expected to pay off early -- often in a few decades.\n\nThe audit and a 2019 Kansas CIty Star article paint a bleak picture of STAR bonds, though, saying they are risky and used too often.\n\nThe Prairiefire development in Overland Park -- which has a museum, restaurants and shopping -- defaulted on its bond just months ago.

Here are the facts.' ... STAR bonds ... simply do not work,\" economist Michael Austin told lawmakers.\n\nThe Kansas Speedway, opened in 2001, was the state's first STAR bonds project. The original bond was for $24.3 million and has $10.6 million in outstanding debt, a 2023 report from the Department of Commerce said.\n\nKansas has successfully funded some stadium projects through STAR bonds.\n\nChildren's Mercy Park, opened in 2011 and home of Sporting KC, was originally issued $150 million in bonds and paid off its debt early.\n\nIn 2023, the Royals sold 1.3 million tickets and the Chiefs sold another 638,000. The Royals were a last-place team that year and poor play scared off some fans. The team sold 2.7 million regular-season tickets during its 2015 World Series run.\n\nA STAR bond district bringing in 2.7 million visitors is comparable to the Wichita River District, which had around 3 million visitors in 2018 and 2019.\n\nThe river district is paying back a $55.3 million bond, while a Chiefs or Royals district could cost substantially more.\n\nThe cost of any stadium is purely speculative, but the new Las Vegas Raiders stadium cost $1.9 billion when it opened in 2020. The new Texas Rangers stadium was $1.2 billion when it opened in 2020. That could mean around $1 billion or more for just a new Chiefs or Royals stadium.\n\nWhen the Royals asked Jackson County, Missouri, taxpayers to extend a sales tax to pay for a new downtown stadium earlier this year, that would have eaten up about $2 billion over 40 years to pay the principal and interest on construction costs. Half of that sales tax money would have gone to the Chiefs.\n\nTarwater, the Stilwell Republican, said he expects the stadium districts to draw far more than the river district. For starters, the stadiums could host concerts, college football playoff games or even March Madness Final Four visits.\n\nTarwater said the Arizona Diamondbacks draw millions more people who aren't at the game because of a district around the stadium.\n\n\"You're talking 70-80,000 people coming to a region several times a year,\" he said. \"That generates a lot of commerce.\"\n\nSome STAR bonds districts also went under because the attraction closed. It's been decades since a major American sports team went out of business.\n\nThe Legislature is expected to vote on a STAR bonds proposal on Tuesday. But the Legislature doesn't have the final say on how much is spent. That falls to the secretary for the Department of Commerce.\n\nBob North, chief counsel for the Department of Commerce, said STAR bonds usually only fund 30% of the proposed projects. The department could authorize financing for 50% of the bonds, but it determines how much bond funding to use by looking at expected revenue.\n\nKansas is one of few states using STAR bonds to fund projects. North said that gives the state an edge in economic development.\n\nNot only does it create new tourist attractions, he said, but it improves the economic well-being of the state.\n\n\"We believe STAR

The measure would allow the state to issue bonds to help the Chiefs and Major League Baseball's Kansas City Royals finance new stadiums on the Kansas side of their metropolitan area, which is split by the border with Missouri.\n\nBut top Republicans in the GOP-controlled Legislature promised that the stadium proposal wouldn't be debated until the Legislature approved a plan that would cut income and property taxes by a total of $1.23 billion over the next three years. Many lawmakers argued that voters would be angry if the state helped finance new stadiums without cutting taxes.\n\nPeople are also reading...

Laura Kelly called the special session to have lawmakers consider reducing taxes after she vetoed three tax-cutting plans before legislators adjourned their regular annual session May 1. The plan lawmakers approved was a compromise between her and Republican leaders.\n\nLegislators made no changes in the plan before passing it, 34-4 in the Senate and 121-2 in the House. Kelly pledged to sign the measure into law.\n\nOnce legislators convened the special session, Kelly couldn't control what they considered, and that created an opening to consider the stadium-financing plan. That measure would use revenues from sports betting, the state lottery and new taxes raised from the area around each new stadium to pay off the state's bonds over 30 years.\n\nThe first version of the stadium-financing plan emerged in late April, but lawmakers didn't vote on it before adjourning. It would have allowed state bonds to finance all stadium construction costs, but the version to be considered by lawmakers Tuesday would cap the amount at 70% and require legislative leaders and the governor to sign off on any bonding plan.\n\nHouse Commerce Committee Chair Sean Tarwater, a Kansas City-area Republican, said the Chiefs are likely to spend between $500 million and $700 million in private funds on a new stadium.\n\nBRIEFLY\n\nLIONS: Detroit signed all-United Football League kicker Jake Bates, who made three field goals from at least 60 yards for the Michigan Panthers this past season.

The 31-year-old Carter has 108 receptions for 1,259 yards and six touchdowns over six seasons with Philadelphia, Houston, Chicago, Washington, the Los Angeles Chargers and Las Vegas Raiders.\n\nBe the

Additional details include:\n\nBoth Chiefs owner Clark Hunt and Royals owner John Sherman were noncommittal after the vote about taking Kansas up on its stadium offers, and it seems very likely that this will be just the beginning of a cross-border bidding war. (Missouri House Majority Leader Jonathan Patterson said any counteroffer will likely wait until after the August primaries, because \"before the primary, there would be a lot of politics involved,\" which is a polite way of saying \"we don't want people holding us responsible for our stadium vote on election day.\") This would be in apparent violation of a truce agreed to in 2019 by Kelly and Missouri Gov. Mike Parson to stop poaching each other's businesses with tax breaks -- that agreement is supposed to be legally binding, though it also expires next year, so Kansas may just have to wait a few months to make an actual offer to the team owners.\n\nTl;dr: Kansas elected officials just dropped a $2.45-billion-and-up subsidy package on the table to lure the Chiefs and Royals across the border, with no public debate, despite it being against the law.

Laura Kelly's chief of staff Will Lawrence told lawmakers that Kelly would sign the bill if it wasn't meaningfully changed from what was presented at a committee meeting on Monday. The House and Senate passed the bill without amendments, meaning an incentive package likely to be offered to the Kansas City sports teams.\n\nJackson County, Missouri, voters rejected a proposed renewal of a three-eights cent sales tax in April. Kansas lawmakers sprang into action to workshop a bill that would target the franchises. The original proposal failed earlier this session after it didn't get a vote as legislators focused on passing tax cuts, but lawmakers returned Tuesday for a special session. After tax cuts passed Tuesday, they turned their attention to the Chiefs.\n\nBefore the floor debate, a joint committee heard testimony from both sides of the debate. Legal representatives for the Chiefs and Royals, as well as lobbyists from Scoop and Score, a 501c4 dedicated to moving the Chiefs to Kansas, spoke in favor of the proposition.\n\nOpposed were some of the most influential conservative groups in the state, Americans for Prosperity Kansas and the Kansas Policy Institute.\n\nThe proposal allots 70% of funding for stadium projects with a revamped version of Sales Tax and Revenue (STAR) bonds, which would use sales taxes from the stadiums and in the surrounding business districts to pay off the bonds. It only uses state sales taxes unless a municipality gets involved and foregoes some local sales taxes for the project.\n\nThe Kansas Department of Commerce would have to approve the project after an independent economists assesses the financial impact. The state's Legislative Coordinating Council would ultimately approve any deal, which would have to be made within a year. If negotiations aren't done within a year, the Legislature can extend talks another year.\n\nThe bill also allows funds earmarked for attracting a sports franchise that are currently funded by revenues from sports gambling and from lottery revenues in excess of $71.5 million per year. The bonds would need to be paid out over a 30-year period.\n\nRep. Sean Tarwater, R-Stilwell, served as the carrier of the bill, and was tasked with describing it's provisions and answering questions from other lawmakers. He said this is an opportunity to save the sports teams from a potential move out of state, and to take it out of the hands of Missouri -- which lost the St. Louis Rams, Kansas City Kings and other professional sports teams.\n\nTarwater also pointed to STAR Bond's success in large-scale sports projects, as well as the revenue generated by the Chiefs and the civic pride in retaining the teams.\n\n\"It was good for the racetrack, the stadium, the three are all in that area,\" Tarwater said. \"That was a field when it first started, and it was generating zero dollars in one of the poorest counties in the state. Look at what it's doing today, we produce over $100 million in just sales tax, there are 100 new companies that were created up there, started with a STAR Bond.\"\n\nSeveral Democratic supporters couched criticisms of the process while still maintaining support for the bill.\n\nHouse Minority Leader Vic Miller, D-Topeka, who ultimately voted for the bill, said he didn't like the lack of transparency in the bill. He proposed an amendment that would make the deal public before approval. Under the bill, the deal will only become public after it is approved by the Legislative Coordinating Council. Tarwater said that'd allow others to undermine Kansas's deal, and the amendment failed.\n\nRep. Boog Highberger, D-Lawrence, also noted that the lead lobbyists advocating for the move Scoop and Score don't disclose their donors. He likened it to the 2022 legalization of sports gambling that had a last-minute change that diverted 80% of revenues from sports gambling to a fund to attract a professional sports team, the same fund that'll partially finance bonds in this bill.\n\nRep. Jason Probst, D-Hutchinson, stood in support of the bill but protested how efficient the legislative process is when there are money and donors involved.\n\n\"It's amazing to me the speed with which we can solve problems when they're oriented around wealth, when they're oriented around business, we can come up with this solution and we can buy every lobbyist in the building and create a virtual armada of lobbying to get this done,\" Probst said. \"But haven't seen anything like this on concerns to the human condition. We do not see this collective effort for homelessness, drug addiction.\"\n\nFiscal conservatives also raised issue with the project, noting a historical precedent of poor returns on public investments in stadiums.\n\n\"You'll see study after study on what a bad return it is, what a bad investment it is, the folks who are pushing it frankly have some sort of financial benefit themselves,\" said Rep. Paul Waggoner, R-Hutchinson. \"Reality is past cities who thought this is some eco devo tool and it isn't. This isn't a conservative perspective, Brookings, Journal of Urban Affairs, lots of people looked at it and it's uniformly a negative indicator.\"\n\nThe bill passed with 84 votes, a two-thirds majority. Overall, the votes for and against didn't have a strong partisan bias, with both parties having a similar percent of their caucus voting for either side.\n\nAfter the House debate, the Senate passed the bill after about two hours of debate. Fewer opponents raised concern in the Senate, but Sen. Molly Baumgardner, R-Louisburg, did have several pointed questions for the bill's carrier Sen. J.R. Claeys, R-Salina, on potential use of eminent domain, potential renovation costs interrupting the bond schedule and the lack of time to review the bill.\n\nSeveral dissenters also spoke out after the vote: Sen. Mike Thompson, R-Shawnee, saying the loose framework and lack of legislative oversight could be an issue, Sen. Alicia Straub, R-Ellinwood, called it a gamble and Sen. Marci Francisco, D-Lawrence, was concerned about the transfer of lottery funds in excess of $71.5 million could lose value over time.\n\nThe vote was 27-8.\n\nKelly commended the legislature after the House and Senate approved the bill. Kelly can't officially sign it into law until after the legislation is formally delivered to her, which could take several days.\n\n\"The bipartisan effort to invite the Chiefs and Royals to Kansas shows we're all-in on keeping our beloved teams in the Kansas City metro,\" Kelly said in a statement. \"Kansas now has the opportunity to become a professional sports powerhouse with the Chiefs and Royals potentially joining Sporting KC as major league attractions, all with robust, revenue-generating entertainment districts surrounding them providing new jobs, new visitors, and new revenues that boost the Kansas economy.\"\n\nNow the sports teams and the Kansas Department of Commerce can commence negotiating on a potential stadium. Korb Maxwell, a lawyer representing the Chiefs, said the Chiefs position remains that they're going to review all options available before making a decision, but was pleased with the decision Kansas lawmakers made in creating a path for the team to negotiate.", "source": {"uri": "finance.yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo!

Have a suggestion for a future story? Email our journalists at RealityCheck@kcstar.com.\n\nWhen the Kansas City Chiefs and Royals asked Jackson County voters to approve a stadiums sales tax earlier this year, the teams negotiated with local activists seeking clear community benefits. Both sides campaigned publicly. Royals owner John Sherman stumped for votes.\n\nIt was messy, but also democratic.\n\nThe Kansas Legislature on Tuesday passed a plan aimed at attracting the teams away from Missouri that relies on potentially billions of dollars in bonds to finance new stadiums. This time, the process will take place mostly behind closed doors - potentially even more so than in Jackson County - with key decisions made by just a handful of officials.\n\nActivists and organizations enjoyed significant leverage during the Jackson County campaign because they could mobilize voters either for or against the sales tax. It's unlikely to be the case this time, since an agreement with teams won't require a public vote or a vote of the full Legislature.\n\nThat reality has begun to settle in the minds of some activists in Wyandotte County, which has been floated as a potential new home for one or both teams. And as efforts to win the teams progress, some are concerned about their ability to effectively advocate for community benefits.\n\n\"Even though it didn't ultimately get passed on the Missouri side, that model of community partners being at the table and a community benefits agreement being an essential piece shouldn't be skipped in Kansas,\" said Marcus Winn, a community organizer in Kansas City, Kansas.\n\n\"If any teams or government agencies were to try to skip that part of the process, just because they can, that'd be a huge red flag.\"\n\nUnder the proposal, Kansas could issue Sales Tax and Revenue, or STAR, bonds to finance up to 70% of the costs of stadiums for one or both teams. The bonds would be paid back over 30 years by tax revenue from within the stadiums and surrounding development, along with sports betting and some Lottery revenues.\n\nSecret deliberation OK'd\n\nThe bill empowers the Kansas secretary of commerce, Lt. Gov. David Toland, to negotiate an agreement with the Chiefs or Royals. Cities and counties also have the option to negotiate directly with the teams, but aren't required to participate.\n\nAny proposed agreement would go before the Legislative Coordinating Council, or LCC - comprised of the eight highest-ranking lawmakers from both parties - for approval. Republicans hold a 6-2 majority on the council.\n\nThe LCC would be allowed to deliberate in secret. Only after the LCC approves an agreement would the document become public. Rejected agreements would remain confidential. In effect, the public would only learn what's in a deal between Kansas and the teams after the fact.\n\n\"Fundamentally, if we're going to ask the LCC to approve something so huge, the public ought to have some notice of what it is they're being asked,\" House Minority Leader Vic Miller, a Topeka Democrat, said.\n\nSTAR bonds need reform to allow for more public input, said Sen. Mike Thompson, a Shawnee Republican. The bill doesn't contain an ability for the Legislature or voters to sign off on a final deal.\n\n\"While I appreciate the LCC as an added check, I also believe that any deal of this magnitude should be subject of the Legislature or even the people within the county or counties in which a district would sit,\" Thompson said.\n\nSen. J.R. Claeys, a Salina Republican who helped spearhead the STAR bonds legislation, said making agreements public before LCC approval would essentially give other states and cities a playbook to copy.\n\n\"At this point you would need to, through our guardrails that we've set up here, decide that you're going to trust the Department of Commerce is going to create a deal that is agreeable by the Legislative Coordinating Council that is represented by the leadership that we have voted upon in this body,\" Claeys said on the Senate floor.\n\nDuring the lead up to the Jackson County vote, the Chiefs and Royals pledged to contribute a combined $266 million over a span of 40 years toward various social and economic causes. The final agreement was a far cry from what community groups had initially asked for from the teams.\n\nThe Chiefs said their share would be $126 million, and the Royals would give $140 million. The money would have been distributed by separate governing boards, which would have been appointed by the county and the teams. Those boards would have then decided specifically where the money would go.\n\nEyes on Wyandotte\n\nThe Kansas legislation doesn't name a location for either team. But much focus has been on Wyandotte County as a potential site thanks to the availability of land, its proximity to the current home of the Chiefs and Royals and a track record of successful economic development projects made with STAR bonds.\n\nCommercial development can be a fierce political issue in Wyandotte County, where the western end has transformed into a top state tourism destination and other communities eastward face serious economic struggles, including high poverty rates.\n\nIn late December, Unified Government commissioners adopted a new local ordinance that established a community benefits fund.\n\nThe fund relies on developer fees to pay for local projects that include affordable housing, senior home repair or child care programs. It was the product of a task force initiated by Mayor Tyrone Garner, who has pointed to local tax relief and greater economic equity as a priority of his tenure.\n\nActivists who spoke to The Star on Tuesday about the incentives forwarded by state lawmakers highlighted clear community benefits as a necessity of any deal -- should one come to pass.\n\nLora McDonald, executive director of MORE2, a Kansas City metro social justice organization, said development in Wyandotte County is an entirely different story than in Jackson County. And she pointed to the areas surrounding the current stadiums on Kansas City, Missouri's eastern border.\n\n\"I think the voters and the people of Kansas should demand and expect more from projects like these and from economic development,\" McDonald said. \"If you look at Kansas City, Missouri and the area around the stadiums, it's not a desirable area. So, what do they want that to be like at the end of the day? And how do they want to benefit from this coming to their community other than bragging rights?\"\n\n\"If we see a window, we would like to be trying to get in it,\" McDonald added. \"But I don't see one. I don't know what's gonna happen.\"\n\nLouise Lynch, of Wyandotte County's Community Conscience Action Network, questioned why the conversation around incentives had reached Topeka before a public forum locally with elected officials.\n\n\"That's a problem. Not to discuss the good, the bad and the ugly, or any of it,\" Lynch said, pointing to a process that has \"rapidly\" unfolded in the statehouse.\n\n\"We are very concerned,\" Lynch said. \"Are we going to have a seat at the table? Or are we going to be told what's going to happen and how it's going to affect our lives whether we like it or not?\"", "source": {"uri": "kansascity.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Kansas

They also overcame criticism that lawmakers were moving too quickly.\n\nIt would allow state bonds to cover up to 70% of each new stadium, paying them off over 30 years with revenues from sports betting, state lottery ticket sales and new sales and alcohol taxes collected from shopping and entertainment districts around the new stadiums.\n\nhttps://www.espn.com/nfl/story/_/id/40382107/kansas-lawmakers-approve-plan-lure-chiefs-missouri", "source": {"uri": "democraticunderground.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Democratic Underground"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Missouri", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Missouri"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Missouri"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kansas", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Kansas"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Kansas"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Travis_Kelce", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Travis Kelce"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kansas_City_Chiefs", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Kansas City Chiefs"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Super_Bowl", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Super Bowl"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metropolitan_area", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Metropolitan area"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supermajority", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Supermajority"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bond_(finance)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Bond (finance)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taylor_Swift", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Taylor Swift"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kansas_City_Royals", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Kansas City Royals"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pop_icon", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Pop icon"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/U.S._Bank_Stadium", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "U.S. Bank Stadium"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alcoholic_drink", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Alcoholic drink"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lotteries_in_the_United_States", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Lotteries in the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subsidy", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Subsidy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Professional_sports", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Professional sports"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sports_betting", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Sports betting"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Business/Arts_and_Entertainment/Sports", "label": "dmoz/Business/Arts and Entertainment/Sports", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Science/Social_Sciences/Urban_and_Regional_Planning", "label": "dmoz/Science/Social Sciences/Urban and Regional Planning", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/Stadiums", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/Stadiums", "wgt": 34}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Theme_Merchandise", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Theme Merchandise", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Greyhound_Racing/Tracks", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Greyhound Racing/Tracks", "wgt": 12}], "image": null, "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9660256", "eventUri": "eng-9660256", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1607843137254903, "wgt": 133, "relevance": 1}

Sean Tarwater (R-Kan.), who carried the bill, said on the House floor.\n\nThe passage of this bill means that the state could pay for up to 70% of the cost of the stadium project.\n\nThe bonds would be paid back over a thirty-year period from new sales taxes created in the district, liquor taxes in the district, and money generated by a sports wagering fund. Cities and counties could participate in the district or opt-out.\n\nThe district would be determined by the secretary of commerce as part of negotiations.\n\nPeople on the no side of this are clear: this is too big of a risk, and there is not enough information as to the benefit this would have and if, in the end, it would hurt Kansas taxpayers.\n\n\"I couldn't ensure myself that the taxpayers that I represent wouldn't ultimately be on the hook if this didn't work out. I think we do need more time. I don't know what the rush is, they say it has to be done yesterday, a lot of us - somebody is going to be back here in 6 months and why can't we spend the first week of our return if this is that important to deal with it at that point,\" Rep. Bob Lewis (R-Kan.) who voted no said.\n\nNevertheless, the opposition never stood a chance, with both votes getting more than enough, creating a super-majority vote situation. The House voted 84-38, while the Senate was 27-8.\n\nThe importance of having the supermajority support means that this is veto-proof if Kansas Gov.

The basic idea behind STAR bonds is that the projects they help fund will eventually pay for themselves.\n\nIf Kansas works out a deal with the Chiefs and/or Royals to help fund new stadiums, the money would be recouped from alcohol sales in potential stadium districts, as well as the revenue from sports gambling and the lottery. It would take 30 years to cover the cost.\n\nThe downside to these bonds, or opportunity cost as Sollars put it, is that those tax dollars can't go towards other public needs like roads or education.\n\nTopekans receive strange alert about man wanted for murder in two other states\n\nSollars also says from what he's seen of similar projects across the country, the long-term benefits can be extremely difficult to predict.\n\n\"This works great for the first five or ten years and then, unfortunately, the teams and the league move on to something new and different,\" Sollars said. \"And they want to renovate, and the repairs happen. There's this never-ending battle back and forth over who's responsible for this, that, and the other.\"\n\nSollars told 27 News at the end of the day, there is certainly some benefit, but the question is \"does that benefit outweigh the cost?\"\n\nBased on yesterday's vote, most lawmakers seem to believe they do. Governor Laura Kelly could still veto the bill, but she is expected to sign it based on previous testimony from her Chief of Staff.\n\nFor more local news, click here.

The basic idea behind STAR bonds is that the projects they help fund will eventually pay for themselves.\n\nIf Kansas works out a deal with the Chiefs and/or Royals to help fund new stadiums, the money would be recouped from alcohol sales in potential stadium districts, as well as the revenue from sports gambling and the lottery. It would take 30 years to cover the cost.\n\nThe downside to these bonds, or opportunity cost as Sollars put it, is that those tax dollars can't go towards other public needs like roads or education.\n\nSollars also says from what he's seen of similar projects across the country, the long-term benefits can be extremely difficult to predict.\n\n\"This works great for the first five or ten years and then, unfortunately, the teams and the league move on to something new and different,\" Sollars said. \"And they want to renovate, and the repairs happen. There's this never-ending battle back and forth over who's responsible for this, that, and the other.\"\n\nSollars told 27 News at the end of the day, there is certainly some benefit, but the question is \"does that benefit outweigh the cost?\"\n\nBased on yesterday's vote, most lawmakers seem to believe they do.

Three Super Bowl victories in five years -- and player Travis Kelce's romance with pop icon Taylor Swift -- have made the Chiefs perhaps the area's most celebrated civic asset.\n\nThe plan from the Republican-controlled Legislature goes next to Democratic Gov. Laura Kelly. While she stopped short of promising to sign it, she said in a statement that \"Kansas now has the opportunity to become a professional sports powerhouse.\"\n\nBoth the Chiefs and the Royals said they look forward to considering Kansas options. The lease on the Missouri complex with their side-by-side stadiums runs through January 2031, but both have said they already should have been planning for the future.\n\n\"We're excited about what happened here today,\" Korb Maxwell, an attorney for the Chiefs who lives on the Kansas side, said at the Statehouse after the bill cleared the Legislature. \"This is incredibly real.\"\n\nThe approval capped a two-month push to capitalize on the refusal in April by voters on the Missouri side to continue a local sales tax used to finance the upkeep of the teams' stadiums.\n\nSwimmingSmith sets world record in 100 back\n\nINDIANAPOLIS -- Bouncing back from a close-but-no-Olympics call in her first race, Regan Smith set a world record in the women's 100-meter backstroke at the U.S. swimming trials on Tuesday night.\n\nThe 22-year-old Minnesota native touched in 57.13 seconds, easily beating the mark of 57.33 set a year ago by Australia's Kaylee McKeown.\n\nSmith was just 17 years old when she first set a world record in the 100 back at the 2019 world championships. But she struggled to deal with the sudden, newfound fame, ceding dominance in the event to McKeown.\n\nKatharine Berkoff claimed the second expected Olympic spot for the U.S. with a time of 57.91.\n\nIn the night's other final, Bobby Finke earned the right to defend the 800 freestyle gold he won in Tokyo with a time of 7 minutes, 44.22 seconds.\n\nFinke had to work hard to get to the wall ahead of 18-year-old Indiana phenom Luke Whitlock, who set a national age-group record at 7:45.19 and will likely head to his first Olympics with the second U.S. spot.\n\nBoston College hires Torres: Boston College hired five-time Olympian Dara Torres as its swimming and diving coach to help the school rebuild the program after a hazing scandal. Torres, 57, will coach both the men and women.\n\nBriefly\n\nBaseball: Astros ace Justin Verlander went on the IL with lingering neck discomfort. ... Yankees star Aaron Judge said X-rays and a CT scan were negative after he was hit on the left hand. ... Orioles third baseman Jordan Westburg left a game with left hip discomfort after colliding with Juan Soto. ... The Cubs placed outfielder Mike Tauchman on theIL with a left groin strain. ... The Twins will place outfielder Alex Kirilloff on the IL with back trouble. ... Gerrit Cole will make his season debut for the Yankees on Wednesday. ... Anthony Rizzo was placed on the IL by the Yankees with a broken right forearm. ... The Blue Jays put shortstop Bo Bichette on the IL with a sore right calf. ... Guardians third baseman Jos\u00e9 Ram\u00edrez was activated from the paternity list.\n\nBasketball: Sparks rookie Cameron Brink had to be helped off the court after suffering a knee injury. ... Aces point guard Chelsea Gray, who has not played since injuring her left foot in last season's WNBA Finals, is expected to make her season debut Wednesday.\n\nFootball: The Bears signed veteran receiver and return specialist DeAndre Carter to a one-year contract.\n\nHockey: The Utah Hockey Club named Chris Armstrong president of hockey operations. ... The Hurricanes officially promoted Eric Tulsky to general manager. ... The Canucks signed defenseman Filip Hronek to an eight-year extension with an average annual value of $7.25 million. ... The Blues signed defenseman Scott Perunovich to a $1.15 million contract for next season. ... The Rangers put Barclay Goodrow on waivers.\n\nCourt: The Washington Commanders settled a lawsuit with Virginia over their handling of season-ticket deposits under previous ownership, the last litigation remaining from that situation a decade ago. The $1.3 million settlement with Virginia includes returning $600,000 to nearly 500 fans who were affected.\n\nMotor sports: Arrow McLaren made yet another driver change when it signed 19-year-old Nolan Siegel to drive the remainder of the IndyCar season. He will be the third driver to race the No. 6 this year.\n\nTennis: Carlos Alcaraz began his grass-court season by beating Francisco Cerundolo 6-1, 7-5 in his opener at Queen's Club.\n\nTrack and field: Sprinting great Michael Johnson is launching a track league that looks to assemble nearly 100 of the sport's top performers four times a year to compete for $12.6 million in prize money over its first season. The league, Grand Slam Track, announced that it will launch next April with plans for one event in Los Angeles, the home of the 2028 Olympics, one in another American city and two more overseas.\n\nObituary: Bob Schul, the only American distance runner to win gold in the 5,000 meters at the Olympics, has died. He was 86.", "source": {"uri": "yakimaherald.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yakima Herald-Republic"}, "authors": [{"uri": "steve_eastham@yakimaherald.com", "name": "Steve Eastham", "type":

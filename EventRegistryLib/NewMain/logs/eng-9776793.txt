But to the surprise of many, Hachimura had Japan ahead late thanks to an absolutely stellar performance.\n\nHachimura had 24 points on 10-of-16 shooting in just 22 minutes, helping Japan cling to a two-point lead in the fourth quarter. However, Hachimura would commit a foul on France's Rudy Gobert, grabbing his arm and pulling him down as the big man attempted a layup. It was ruled an unsportsmanlike foul and was Hachimura's second of the contest meaning the Lakers forward would be ejected from the game.\n\nSurprisingly, Japan would continue to hold on to their lead and seemed poised to pull off the improbable upset. But trailing by four, French guard Matthew Strazel completed a miraculous four-point play to tie the game and send it to overtime. France would then dominate the extra period and hold off a late run from Japan to escape with a 94-90 win.\n\nIt was an unfortunate outcome for Japan who falls to 0-2 in group play despite an extremely spirited effort. And much of the discussion will go towards the foul call that led to Hachimura's ejection, especially as it looked to be a standard foul by NBA standards, but those don't always line up with FIBA rules.\n\nThe officials felt there was no play on the ball and excessive contact which led to the unsportsmanlike ruling. It wound up an unfortunate end for what was shaping up to be a memorable performance for Hachimura.\n\nFrance was led by Wembanyama who finished with 18 points, 11 rebounds, six assists, two steals and two blocks. Strazel, the regulation hero finished with 17 points while Evan Fournier added 14 points and six assists.\n\nIn the absence of Hachimura it was guard Yuki Kawamura who did his best to try and keep Japan afloat with 29 points, seven rebounds and six assists.\n\nThe Olympics bring together the greatest athletes in many disciplines and many athletes wonder what it would be like to compete in these other sports. For Rui Hachimura's Lakers teammate LeBron James, the choice is easy as he would compete in track and field if given the opportunity.\n\nSpecifically, LeBron said he would love to compete in the 4\u00d7100 relay as he is always about being on a team.

Japan fell to 0-2 and is danger of being eliminated with one group-stage game remaining.\n\nREAD: Wembanyama returns home for Paris Olympics 2024\n\nYuki Kawamura picked up the scoring load, topping Japan with 29 points, connecting on six 3-pointers.\n\nThe game was tight throughout regulation.\n\nJapan got within 72-70 on back-to-back 3-pointers by Hachimura. But on France's next possession his foul on Rudy Gobert was reviewed and determined to be unsportsmanlike -- his second technical of the game -- and he was disqualified with 8:31 remaining.\n\nFrance pushed its lead to 77 -- 72, but Japan scored the next six points to retake the lead.\n\nJapan stretched it to 80-77 on a basket by Josh Hawkinson. But Evan Fournier raced up the floor and hit a 3-pointer to tie the game with 50 seconds left. Kawamura was fouled and hit two free throws. France came down and had three attempts to tie that all missed.\n\nKawamura was fouled again and hit two more free throws to make it 84-80.\n\nFrance pushed the ball up the court and it ended up with Strazel, who made a deep 3 and was fouled. He completed the four-point play to tie it again with 10.2 seconds left.\n\nJapan ran the clock down and Kawamura got off a potential game-winning 3 over Rudy Gobert, but it missed off the back of the rim.", "source": {"uri": "sports.inquirer.net", "dataType": "news", "title": "Inquirer"}, "authors": [{"uri": "associated_press@sports.inquirer.net", "name": "Associated Press", "type": "author", "isAgency": true}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Victor_Wembanyama", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Victor Wembanyama"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Overtime_(sports)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Overtime (sports)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paris", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japan", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Japan"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Japan"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/France", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "France"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basketball", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Basketball"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matthew_Strazel", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Matthew Strazel"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basketball_court", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Basketball court"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brazil", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Brazil"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Brazil"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australia", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Australia"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Australia"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rui_Hachimura", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Rui Hachimura"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flagrant_foul", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Flagrant foul"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_throw", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Free throw"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Three-point_field_goal", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Three-point field goal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evan_Fournier", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Evan Fournier"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rudy_Gobert", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Rudy Gobert"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Games", "label": "dmoz/Games", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Recreation", "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Recreation", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Board_Games/Historical", "label": "dmoz/Games/Board Games/Historical", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Dice/Farkle", "label": "dmoz/Games/Dice/Farkle", "wgt": 16}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Tile_Games/Spectrangle", "label": "dmoz/Games/Tile Games/Spectrangle", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 95}], "image": "https://sports.inquirer.net/files/2024/07/AP24212646519144-scaled.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9776793", "eventUri": "eng-9776793", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1607843137254903, "wgt": 189, "relevance": 1}
{"uri": "8251384980", "lang": "eng", "isDuplicate": false, "date": "2024-07-30", "time": "21:43:17", "dateTime": "2024-07-30T21:43:17Z", "dateTimePub": "2024-07-30T21:42:48Z", "dataType": "news", "sim": 0.7333333492279053, "url": "https://www.cbssports.com/olympics/news/2024-paris-olympics-mens-basketball-scores-france-canada-germany-clinch-knockout-round-spots/", "title": "2024 Paris Olympics men's basketball scores: France, Canada, Germany clinch knockout round spots - CBSSports.com", "body": "Getty Images\n\nTuesday marked the second game in men's basketball group play for eight of the 12 teams at the 2024 Paris Olympics, and it saw three teams move to 2-0 and guarantee their spots in the next round. Germany, France and Canada have all clinched quarterfinal berths thanks to wins over Brazil, Japan and Australia, respectively on Tuesday.\n\nThe top two teams in these Olympics advance from group play, plus the top two third-place finishers. That's eight teams, the exact number of squads the remain with a shot at a 2-1 record. Team USA can become the fourth team to ensure a knockout stage spot if the Americans can beat South Sudan on Wednesday.\n\nGermany pulled away from Brazil for a 13-point win in the final game of the day Tuesday. Dennis Schroder led the way with 20 points and six assists. France had a much harder time with Japan.\n\nFor the first four-and-a-half minutes of overtime during France's thriller against Japan on Tuesday in Lille at the 2024 Paris Olympics, Victor Wembanyama was the only player to score. After narrowly avoiding a loss in regulation, Wembanyama scored eight of his 18 points in the extra frame and the home country came away with a 94-90 win.\n\nFrance needed a four-point play from Matthew Strazel with 10 seconds left in the fourth quarter to force overtime. Japan almost pulled off the upset -- and cut an eight-point deficit to two late in overtime -- despite Rui Hachimura getting ejected with eight-and-a -half minutes left in regulation. Yuki Kawamura had a game-high 29 points for Japan, and Hachimura had 24 points on 10-for-16 shooting in 28 minutes.\n\nBefore that, Canada leaped to the top of the \"Group of Death\" with a 93-83 win against Australia. For the second straight game, RJ Barrett led the Canadians in scoring. He finished with 24 points on 8-for-15 shooting in 25 minutes, plus seven rebounds, five assists and two steals.\n\nDespite the loss, Australia (1-1) is in second place in Group A. Spain (1-1) is in third, thanks to an 84-77 victory over Greece (0-2) on Tuesday, in which Giannis Antetokounmpo had 27 points on 12-for-17 shooting, 11 rebounds, three assists and two steals in defeat.\n\nTuesday's Olympic scores\n\nSpain 84, Greece 77\n\nCanada 93, Australia 83\n\nFrance 94, Japan 90 (OT)\n\nGermany 86, Brazil 73\n\nThe craziest game of the Olympics (so far)\n\nWhen Hachimura hacked Rudy Gobert and picked up his second unsportsmanlike foul, triggering an ejection, Japan was down by two points. At the time, Hachimura had just made a pair of tough 3s on consecutive offensive possessions, so it seemed like the worst possible break Japan could get.\n\nThat bad break, however, did not doom Japan. Without Hachimura, Japan's 5-foot-8 point guard, Kawamura, became even more aggressive on offense, alternately shaking loose for deep 3s and worming his way into the paint. Less than three minutes after Hachimura's costly foul, Kawamura hit a stunning, off-the-dribble 3-pointer over Nando de Colo, who contested it so tightly that he picked up a foul on the play. On Japan's next possession, Kawamura got downhill and socred off the glass, giving Japan the lead.\n\nFrance went scoreless for five and a half minutes in the fourth quarter before Evan Fournier hit a stepback 3 to tie the game at 80 with 50 seconds remaining. Just before Fournier's big bucket, Gobert was involved in two highlight blocks, but only one of them was good for France. The reigning (and four-time) NBA Defensive Player of the Year switched onto Kawamura and blocked a stepback 3, and, on the very next possession, Hugh Watanabe rejected Gobert at the rim in spectacular fashion.\n\nStrazel inexplicably picked up a foul in the backcourt with 47 seconds left, sending Kawamura to the line for two free throws. Kawamura made both, and after Fournier and Gobert missed decent looks and Japan's Josh Hawkinson made another pair of free throws, France needed a miracle. It got it when Strazel made a leaning 3 off the bounce over Kawamura and converted the four-point play.\n\n\"We could've easily given up down four with 10 seconds. We had no solution, and we got a crazy shot from Matthew,\" Nicolas Batum said, via fiba.com. \"Sometimes, God is on your side.\"\n\nKawamura missed a potential game-winner in regulation, and he shot just 9 for 26 in the game. He gave France's defense plenty of trouble, though, particularly when playing off Hawkinson's ball screens. Kawamura shot 6 for 15 from deep, Hawkinson 4 for 6, stretching France's defense out. After halftime, France came out with a smaller, quicker lineup than the one that started the game; Bilal Coulibaly was out there after not playing at all in the first half, and Gobert was on the bench. Wembanyama and Gobert did not share the floor at all in the second half until the 2:20 mark in the fourth quarter, but France stayed big the rest of the way.\n\nIn addition to his 18 points, Wembanyama finished with 11 rebounds, six assists, two steals and two blocks in 31 minutes. He started overtime with an and-1 after a missed 3 by Fournier, then blocked Kawamura in transition, made a 3 off an offensive rebound by Gobert, contested a Kawamura 3 on the other end and was fouled on an attempted alley-oop seconds later. After making a pair of free throws, France had an eight-point lead that it would not relinquish (even after Kawamura and Makoto Hiejima made late 3s).\n\nStrazel, the 21-year-old point guard who plays for Monaco, scored 17 points on 5-for-9 shooting in 23 minutes off the bench. Guerschon Yabusele made two pick-and-pop 3s as soon as he checked in and finished with 13 points on 5-for-10 shooting. France had 50 bench points to Japan's nine, and Gobert had 15 rebounds, including six on the offensive end.\n\nJapan was one stop away from earning a win at the Olympic Games for the first time since 1976. They didn't get it done, but they gave France a serious scare in the craziest game of this tournament.\n\n\"We can fight with any team,\" Hawkinson said, via fiba.com. \"This was a true road game experience for us, 27,000 people, on the road, so many French fans, all chanting against us. To be able to fight until the very end against one of the top teams in the world, that's definitely steps in the right direction for us. No moral victories. We wanted to win.\"\n\n\"They played great and lost,\" Batum said. \"They played amazing tonight, they kept fighting, and all credit to this team. Amazing team, man.\"\n\nNext up, Japan will play Brazil on Friday at 5 a.m. ET. France will will play Germany at 3 p.m. ET on Friday.\n\nCanada clamps Boomers\n\nShai Gilgeous-Alexander picked up two fouls in the first two minutes and missed most of the first quarter, which is one of the reasons that Australia had a four-point lead at halftime. Another reason: Josh Giddey had 15 points at halftime, looking completely at ease running the show for the Boomers.\n\nEverything changed in the second half, though. Canada put Lu Dort on Giddey, his former Oklahoma City Thunder teammate, and increased the physicality across the board. The Boomers committed nine of their 18 turnovers in the third quarter, and Canada held them to just 13 points in the fourth.\n\nAt their best, the Canadians, much like Team USA, create chaos with their collective length and athleticism on defense. Australia countered that with ball movement and quick decision-making early on, but later got discombobulated. Canada piled up deflections and scored 28 points off turnovers to Australia's 10.\n\nIt's a bummer that Andrew Wiggins isn't with Team Canada, but it's hard to separate his absence from Barrett's strong showings in the first two games. The fact that Barrett made three of his six 3-point attempts against Australia was merely a bonus; what has stood out the entire time is his aggressive, but controlled driving game. He is absolutely thriving as a secondary playmaker, with Gilgeous-Alexander the clear focus of the opponent's game plan. Since Jamal Murray still appears to be ramping up and Wiggins isn't present, Canada has needed everything that Barrett has provided.\n\nJock Landale continues to be a massive difference-maker for Australia. The big man finished with 16 points on 7-for-10 shooting, 12 rebounds (including six on the offensive glass) and four assists in a game-high 31 minutes. Australia's coaching staff hasn't quite figured out the non-Landale minutes; both Duop Reath and Will Magnay had short stints against Canada.\n\nWhen the Boomers play Greece on Friday at 7:30 a.m. ET, in their final game of group play, they will be hoping that national team legend Patty Mills can get back on track. He finished with eight points on 2-for-10 shooting (1-for-5 from deep) on Tuesday and was clearly bothered by Canada's collection of point-of-attack defenders.\n\n\"The concern coming into the game was their pressure and how we handle their pressure,\" Boomers coach Brian Goorjian said, via fiba.com. \"Even though we had depth in those spots, they wore us down physically, and we really had trouble getting into anything in the second half.\"\n\nGilgeous-Alexander had a modest 16 points, but was amazing. He shot 8 for 10, got three steals and blocked two shots, including one in which he seemed to materialize out of nowhere to swat Jack McVeigh from the weak side. The Boomers have a bunch of top-notch point-of-attack defenders themselves, but, as usual, Gilgeous-Alexander created good (for him) looks whenever he needed to.\n\n\"He's that guy,\" Canada coach Jordi Fernandez said, via fiba.com. \"Sometimes, I don't call plays for him and he just scores. That's what he does. Probably, I should be better and call more plays for him, but he finds a way.\"\n\nCanada's last game of group play is Friday at 11:15 a.m. ET against Spain.\n\nAntetokounmpo, Greece fall to 0-2\n\nHere's Antetokounmpo going coast to coast for a lefty dunk on Santi Aldama's head:\n\nThis play tied Greece's game against Spain with about four and a half minutes left in the fourth quarter. Greece had trailed by as many as 16 points in the first half, but Antetokounmpo -- and Vasilis Toliopoulos, who shot 4 for 6 from deep in 17 minutes off the bench -- led them back.\n\nSpain immediately answered, though, with an 8-0 run punctuated by a putback dunk from Aldama, who finished with a team-high 19 points on 6-for-14 shooting, 12 rebounds, two assists and three blocks in 29 minutes.\n\n\"He's our best player, and he knows it,\" Spain guard Dario Brizuela said, via fiba.com. \"He's making a step forward this year compared to the World Cup last year. He's our leader now. He played an amazing game and we're happy for him.\"\n\nIn crunch time, Spain surprised Greece by going to a box-and-1 defense, with Willy Hernangomez sticking to Antetokounmpo.\n\n\"We thought we'd keep it for the very end of the game,\" Spain coach Sergio Scariolo said, via fiba.com. \"Actually, with Luis Gil, our defensive coordinator, we've been talking a lot about doing it at some point, but we decided to keep it for the very end, because I wanted to keep Willy on the floor, his pick-and-roll with Lorenzo [Brown] is a big weapon for us.\"\n\nGreece made one last late push and had a chance to tie the game in the final minute, but Antetokounmpo clanked a 3.\n\nBrown finished with seven points and 10 assists in 28 minutes. Sergio Lllull had 13 points, including 11 (and all three of his 3-pointers) in the first half.\n\nToliopoulos gave Greece a spark with his shooting, but everybody else on the roster shot a combined 8 for 29 from 3-point range.\n\nAt 0-2, Greece must beat Australia on Friday to have a chance of advancing to the knockout round.", "source": {"uri": "cbssports.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "CBS

With France leading 72-70, Hachimura was ejected after he grabbed Rudy Gobert's arm on a layup attempt. Upon review, the refs deemed the play excessive and unnecessary.\n\nEarlier in the second half, Hachimura picked up his first unsportsmanlike foul while trying to stop Bilal Coulibaly from getting to the rim on a fastbreak. Hachimura leaned into Coulibaly and nudged him with his hips, resulting in a hard fall from the France forward. The French couldn't capitalize on the pair of free throws and extra possession, though the play would obviously set up Hachimura's disqualification later in the half.\n\nNonetheless, Japan simply wouldn't quit against the host nation. Yuki Kawamura, a 5-foot-8 guard from Yamaguchi, was not intimidated by France's imposing frontcourt tandem, as he hunted for his shot regardless of who was in front of him contesting.\n\nKawamura and Hachimura combined for 19 of Japan's 25 points in the first quarter, as the duo worked off each other on offense while Hachimura did his best to contain Wembanyama on the defensive end. A pair of jumpers from the Los Angeles Lakers forward, along with a pair of 3-pointers from Kawamura, kept the Japanese within striking distance.\n\nHachimura's jumper with 2:42 left in the first half put Japan up 42-40 and capped an 8-0 scoring run. France countered with a 7-0 spurt of its own before heading into the break up 49-44.\n\nKawamura gave Japan some life coming out of the locker room, as he spearheaded another 8-0 scoring burst to reclaim momentum. France couldn't find its post players with consistency and struggled to gain an advantage with its size, so much so that Gobert didn't start the second half in favor of a smaller lineup to combat the Japanese.\n\nThat's probably not what the home crowd expected to see from France, a 16.5-point favorite heading into the matchup, though Japan wasn't going down without a fight. The French ended the third quarter on another high note, setting up a thrilling final quarter between David and Goliath.\n\nHowever, the storybook ending didn't come to fruition despite a heroic effort from Kawamura and Josh Hawkinson down the stretch. Hawkinson, a former Washington State standout and Seattle native, had a few key defensive stops to keep Japan in the fight and knocked down a jumper to put his team up 80-77 with 1:08 left.\n\nAfter two empty possessions from France, Kawamura had Japan 16 seconds away from its first win in Olympic competition in over 50 years after a pair of free throws made it 84-80.\n\nNeeding a miracle, the French's prayers were answered as Matthew Strazel knocked down a fallaway 3-pointer while being fouled by Kawamura, setting up a 4-point play and a tie ballgame. Kawamura's last attempt in regulation fell short, as the two sides headed to overtime with all the momentum favoring the home team.\n\nFrance never looked back from Strazel's miraculous play. After an 8-0 run to start overtime, the French survived a 94-90 ballgame and advanced to 2-0 in group stage play. Wembanyama finished with 18 points, 11 rebounds, six assists, two blocks and two steals; Strazel had 17 off the bench.\n\nJapan, now 0-2, has lost 14 consecutive games in men's Olympic basketball as it prepares for a matchup against Brazil on Aug. 2.", "source": {"uri": "si.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Sports Illustrated"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rui_Hachimura", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Rui Hachimura"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japan", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Japan"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Japan"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/France", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "France"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Victor_Wembanyama", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Victor Wembanyama"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basketball_positions", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Basketball positions"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gonzaga_Bulldogs_men's_basketball", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Gonzaga Bulldogs men's basketball"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rudy_Gobert", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Rudy Gobert"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Layup", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Layup"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fast_break", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Fast break"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/France_national_football_team", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "France national football team"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_throw", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Free throw"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Three-point_field_goal", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Three-point field goal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los_Angeles_Lakers", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles Lakers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Defensive_end", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Defensive end"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matthew_Strazel", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Matthew Strazel"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Washington_State_Cougars_men's_basketball", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Washington State Cougars men's basketball"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goliath", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Goliath"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steal_(basketball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Steal (basketball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assist_(basketball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Assist (basketball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rebound_(basketball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Rebound (basketball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Overtime_(sports)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Overtime (sports)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tournament", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Tournament"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basketball", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Basketball"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Olympic_Games", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Olympic Games"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seattle", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Seattle"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Seattle"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brazil", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Brazil"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Brazil"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Games/Tile_Games/Mah_Jongg", "label": "dmoz/Games/Tile Games/Mah Jongg", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://images2.minutemediacdn.com/image/upload/c_crop,w_4000,h_2250,x_0,y_748/c_fill,w_1440,ar_16:9,f_auto,q_auto,g_auto/images/ImagnImages/mmsport/gonzaga_nation/01j42cckss9wxh48ye9x.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9776793", "eventUri": "eng-9776793", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-08-02", "textStart": 3677, "textEnd": 3683}], "sentiment": 0.1137254901960785, "wgt": 186, "relevance": 1}

We stopped what they wanted to do and they kicked it out and the ball moved around. Strazel made a great shot.\"\n\nWhile emphasizing there were no \"moral victories\" in basketball, Hawkinson said Japan showed its mettle against a French side expected to contend for medals.\n\n\"To be able to fight until the very end against one of the top teams in the world is definitely a step in the right direction for us,\" Hawkinson said.\n\n\"We wanted to win, but at the end of the day, we've got to move on.

the tournament, who started alongside Minnesota Timberwolves center Rudy Gobert in a twin towers lineup for head coach Vincent Collet.\n\nHaving struggled from beyond the arc against Germany, Japan found its three-point range early against the tournament host, hitting four of its eight first-quarter attempts.\n\nFrance's strength on the offensive glass helped it take a 32-25 lead at the end of the opening quarter, but Hovasse's team continued to knock down quality looks to prevent the home side from pulling away.\n\nThe host led 49-44 at halftime and 69-64 at the end of three before Japan came storming back in the fourth quarter.\n\nAs Japan defended a 78-77 lead with 1:33 left to play, reserve big man Hugh Watanabe blocked Gobert at the rim before Josh Hawkinson put the underdogs up by three with a push shot.\n\nKawamura then stunned the home crowd into silence when he created what appeared to be a two-possession lead with 0:16 left only to commit the costly foul that let France back into the game.\n\nRelated coverage:\n\nOlympics: Japan's men outgunned in basketball loss to Germany", "source": {"uri": "english.kyodonews.net", "dataType": "news", "title": "Kyodo News+"},

Japan star kicked out in wild ending in 2024 Olympics game", "body": "While group play is still ongoing, Tuesday's Olympic basketball game between France and Japan felt like a medal was on the line.\n\nFrance needed overtime to avoid a major upset, pulling away late for a 94-90 win over Japan. Before things made it to the extra period, the ejection of Japanese star Rui Hachimura set off a wild sequence of back-and-forth play for the final 8:31 of regulation.\n\nWhy was Hachimura ejected and what happened after? Here is more on the wild sequence that immediately stands as an instant classic at this year's tournament.\n\nMORE: Ranking Team USA's biggest threats at the Paris Olympics\n\nHachimura was ejected after picking up his second unsportsmanlike foul with 8:31 remaining in the fourth quarter. In FIBA competition, two unsportsmanlike fouls result in an automatic ejection.\n\nAt the time of his ejection, Hachimura had just drilled back-to-back 3-pointers to bring his total to 24 points on 10-of-16 shooting.\n\nThanks in large part to Hachimura's play, Japan, which entered the game as a heavy underdog, trailed by just two points and appeared to have a legitimate shot of upsetting the host team.\n\nHere is more on FIBA's rules around unsportsmanlike fouls:\n\nUnsportsmanlike fouls are used to describe what NBA fans have come to know as transition take fouls, clear path fouls, and flagrant fouls. In FIBA, those fouls all fall within the unsportsmanlike umbrella.\n\nA player can be disqualified with two technical fouls, two unsportsmanlike fouls, or a combination of five fouls that include one flagrant or one unsportsmanlike call.\n\nMORE: Explaining the major differences in Olympic basketball rules\n\nAfter Hachimura was ejected, Japan briefly fell by five points before going on an incredible run. With 6:23 remaining in regulation, France led 77-72 before Japan scored eight unanswered points to lead 80-77 with 1:06 left.\n\nJust as it appeared that France could not get anything going offensively, Evan Fournier tied things up by hitting a massive stepback 3 with 50 seconds remaining in regulation.\n\nThree seconds later, Japan's Yuki Kawamura drew a foul and sank both free throws to put Japan back up by two. After Fournier and Victor Wembanyama couldn't get looks to go, France intentionally fouled Kawamura, who sank two more free throws to give Japan an 84-80 lead with 16 seconds left.\n\nThen things got really wild.\n\nWith 10 seconds remaining, French guard Matthew Strazel hit an acrobatic 3-pointer while drawing a foul on Kawamura. Strazel coolly stepped to the line to complete the 4-point play, tying things up and placing France in position to force overtime.\n\nAfter Kawamura was unable to get the potential game-winning 3-pointer to go, things headed to overtime where Wembanyama put his stamp on the game.\n\nWembanyama opened the extra frame with an and-one, setting up a personal 8-0 run to bring his team-high total to 18 points and put France ahead by three possessions.\n\nOf course, Japan fought back, responding with a 6-0 run to cut the deficit to two points with eight seconds left. Unfortunately for Japan, there wasn't enough time to complete the overtime comeback as two free throws from Strazel iced the game.\n\nOver the 13:31 after Hachimura's ejection, both Japan and France went on multiple runs, but Wembanyama's overtime takeover proved too much for Japan to overcome.", "source": {"uri": "sportingnews.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Sporting News"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rui_Hachimura", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Rui Hachimura"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japan", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Japan"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Japan"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/France", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "France"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FIBA", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "FIBA"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basketball", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Basketball"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Overtime_(sports)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Overtime (sports)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paris", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Victor_Wembanyama", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Victor Wembanyama"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rules_of_basketball", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Rules of basketball"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evan_Fournier", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Evan Fournier"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Technical_foul", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Technical foul"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_throw", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Free throw"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Three-point_field_goal", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Three-point field goal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Basketball_Association", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "National Basketball Association"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matthew_Strazel", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Matthew Strazel"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basketball_positions", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Basketball positions"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Games/Board_Games/Historical", "label": "dmoz/Games/Board Games/Historical", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Tile_Games/Mah_Jongg", "label": "dmoz/Games/Tile Games/Mah Jongg", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Play_Groups/Asia", "label": "dmoz/Games/Play Groups/Asia", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 99}], "image": "https://ng-sportingnews.com/s3/files/styles/twitter_card_120x120/s3/2024-07/USATSI_23863487%20%281%29.jpg?itok=qOVhp8pv", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9776793", "eventUri": "eng-9776793", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1372549019607843, "wgt": 174, "relevance": 1}

He did well in the team's exhibition games just days ago, and he had 20 points and 10 rebounds in his nation's first game of group play on Saturday.\n\nAfter losing that game to Germany, Japan took the court against France, one of the better teams in the Olympics and a squad that boasts NBA stars Victor Wembanyama and Rudy Gobert. Hachimura was red-hot, scoring 24 points and going 10-of-16 from the field in just 22 minutes in a close game.\n\nHowever, late in the game, the forward grabbed Gobert's arm as Gorbert attempted a layup and was assessed a foul. It was his second unsportsmanlike foul of the game, and thus he was ejected, to the consternation of many.\n\nWhile it looked like a normal foul, not to mention a good foul, as Gobert is a mediocre free throw shooter, the officials working the game obviously felt otherwise.\n\nFrance ended up forcing overtime on a miracle 3-pointer and four-point play by guard Matthew Strazel, and it ultimately prevailed 94-90. Wembanyama shined brightly with 18 points, 11 rebounds, six assists, two steals and two blocked shots.", "source": {"uri": "lebronwire.usatoday.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "LeBron Wire"}, "authors": [{"uri": "robert_marvi@lebronwire.usatoday.com", "name": "Robert Marvi", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rui_Hachimura", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Rui Hachimura"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anthony_Davis", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Anthony Davis"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basketball_positions", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Basketball positions"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rudy_Gobert", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Rudy Gobert"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los_Angeles_Lakers", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles Lakers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Summer_Olympic_Games", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Summer Olympic Games"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exhibition_game", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Exhibition game"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LeBron_James", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "LeBron James"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paris", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Victor_Wembanyama", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Victor Wembanyama"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rebound_(basketball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Rebound (basketball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Basketball_Association", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "National Basketball Association"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/France", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "France"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matthew_Strazel", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Matthew Strazel"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flagrant_foul", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Flagrant foul"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_throw", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Free throw"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Layup", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Layup"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steal_(basketball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Steal (basketball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Block_(basketball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Block (basketball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assist_(basketball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Assist (basketball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Overtime_(sports)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Overtime (sports)"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Games/Board_Games/Historical", "label": "dmoz/Games/Board Games/Historical", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Tile_Games", "label": "dmoz/Games/Tile Games", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Play_Groups", "label": "dmoz/Games/Play Groups", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Dice/Farkle", "label": "dmoz/Games/Dice/Farkle", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://lebronwire.usatoday.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/37/2024/07/USATSI_23863456-e1722388039126.jpg?w=640", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9776793", "eventUri": "eng-9776793", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1843137254901961, "wgt": 172, "relevance": 1}

Japan got robbed. Simple as that.\"\n\nThat was far from the only questionable call however with Japan star Rui Hachimura given his marching orders with a little under nine minutes to play in the fourth quarter.\n\nHachimura was ejected after receiving two rather soft unsportsmanlike fouls.\n\nThe first came when he bumped a French player who was driving to the hoop while the second came after he grabbed Rudy Gobert's arm, stopping him from going up for an easy dunk.\n\nShortly before being ejected Hachimura had 24 points on 10-16 shooting with his play on both ends keeping his nation in the fight.\n\nAs replays of the second foul rolled, fans were left incredulous that he had been ejected from the match.\n\nLegion Hoops wrote on X: \"They just ejected Rui Hachimura in the Olympics against France over one of the softest unsportsmanlike calls you'll ever see. Horrible.\"\n\nDev Green added: \"There needs to be an inquiry into the refs for this France vs Japan game. The Hachimura ejection for a normal foul is wild. Then the 4 point play at the end of the game? Refs really making sure the home team doesn't flame out.\"\n\nAs the conspiracy theorists unleashed on social media, France soaked up their second straight win and will now turn their attention to a top of the table clash against Germany.\n\nWembanyama was once again the key for the French outfit as he poured in eight of his 18 points in overtime.\n\nThe 20-year-old left jaws on the floor during the contest with an image of him alongside Japan's Yuki Togashi going viral.\n\nWembanyama stands at an absurd 224cm while Togashi is a minuscule 163cm.\n\nWhile it was joyous scenes for France, it wasn't to be for the Boomers as they fell 93-83 against Canada.\n\nThe Aussies led 49-45 at half time, but gave the ball away too many times in the second half as Canada seized control.\n\nIt was NBA star Shai Gilgeous-Alexander that proved too much for the Boomers to handle. He finished with 16 points while RJ Barrett put up 24 points. Josh Giddey led Australia with 19 points after a blockbuster first half where he scored 15 points.\n\nThe result means Australia must now beat Greece - and NBA superstar Giannis Antetokounmpo - to

France needed a four-point play to force overtime, and it ultimately held off Japan, who covered the spread as a massive underdog in that game.\n\nBrazil, on the other hand, lost by double digits to Germany to fall to 0-2 in pool play, struggling for the second straight game to generate anything on offense. Brazil didn't have a single starter in double figures on Tuesday.\n\nDespite Brazil's struggles, it is favored to win its final matchup of pool play on Friday. Here's a look at the odds, key players to watch and my prediction for these two 0-2 squads.\n\nYago Santos: Brazil has struggled to score the basketball in the 2024 Olympics, but it did get good bench production from Yago Santos (18 points) in the loss to Germany. Could he be an X-Factor that helps Brazil earn a win on Friday? Oddsmakers have him set at 11.5 points in the prop market.\n\nRui Hachimura: If Hachimura wasn't ejected for a foul in the loss to France, Japan may be in a very different spot in this game. Japan lost to France by four in overtime, but Hachimura was tossed with eight minutes left in the game. He was going off before exiting, scoring 24 points on 10-of-16 shooting.\n\nAfter watching Japan give France a real scare on Tuesday, I don't know how one doesn't take the points in this matchup.\n\nNot only did Hachimura have a big game for Japan, but Yuki Kawamura (29 points) and Josh Hawkinson (16 points) also scored the ball at a high rate on Tuesday.\n\nBrazil has yet to clear 80 points in a game in these Olympics, and it doesn't really have a go-to option on offense, as showcased by the team having just two players in double figures against Germany.\n\nA lot of things went wrong for Japan to end up losing to France, and I wouldn't be shocked if it comes out firing in this game with a chance to earn an Olympic win. Also, in the off chance that a 1-2 team advances to the knockout stage, a win could give Japan a pretty good point differential to take into that conversation.\n\nPick: Japan +2.5 (-112)\n\nOdds refresh periodically and are subject to change.", "source": {"uri": "si.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Sports Illustrated"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rui_Hachimura", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Rui Hachimura"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Overtime_(sports)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Overtime (sports)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japan", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Japan"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Japan"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/France", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "France"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brazil", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Brazil"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Brazil"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basketball", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Basketball"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Santos_FC", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Santos FC"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single-elimination_tournament", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Single-elimination tournament"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Germany", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Germany"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Germany"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goal_difference", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Goal difference"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Games/Board_Games/Historical", "label": "dmoz/Games/Board Games/Historical", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Tile_Games/Mah_Jongg", "label": "dmoz/Games/Tile Games/Mah Jongg", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Dice/Farkle", "label": "dmoz/Games/Dice/Farkle", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Play_Groups/Asia", "label": "dmoz/Games/Play Groups/Asia", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 89}], "image": "https://images2.minutemediacdn.com/image/upload/c_crop,w_3595,h_2022,x_0,y_783/c_fill,w_1440,ar_16:9,f_auto,q_auto,g_auto/images/ImagnImages/mmsport/si/01j44ktekdvqfrn0knsy.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9776793", "eventUri": "eng-9776793", "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Japan"}}, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.2549019607843137, "wgt": 165, "relevance": 1}

The Los Angeles Lakers forward, who finished with 24 points, had been issued two technical fouls and was removed, per FIBA rules, as a result.\n\nKawamura, in turn, took over.\n\nWith 1:06 left in regulation, he found big man Josh Hawkinson on the inside for a layup that barely floated over Wembanyama's outstretched fingers and fell through to give Japan a three-point lead. Kawamura hit two free throws with 47 seconds left, then two more at the 16-second mark, to hold France at bay.\n\nYet with 10.2 seconds left and France down four, French point guard Matthew Strazel buried a 3-pointer from the left wing and was fouled to spark a four-point play that forced overtime. Kawamura, as it were, was the fouling offender on the play.\n\n\"Unreal,\" Wembanyama said of the shot. \"Even though I know Matthew, it's probably the best shot of his life.\"\n\nThe 20-year-old French phenom had scored eight points early in the first quarter, hitting two 3-pointers and a jumper to put France up 12-10, but he went quiet for a long period thereafter. In overtime, though, he scored eight of his 18 points while adding a block, steal and a rebound.\n\nWembanyama had 11 rebounds and six assists in all. He was asked afterward what changed in the extra period?\n\n\"Um, the realization of the dynamic of the game,\" he said. \"They were playing like underdogs, and we were waiting for them to punch a little bit too much. So I wanted to make a point and finish for us in overtime, and I think it worked.\"\n\nJapan, which also features a 5-6 point guard in Yuki Togashi, is considered one of the weaker teams remaining in the Olympic field. The Japanese lost to Germany 97-77 in a pool-play opener and will face Brazil on Friday. France, which is now 2-0 in pool play after beating Brazil in its opener, faces Germany, the reigning FIBA World Cup champion, on Friday.\n\nYet while these two teams are now headed in opposite Olympic directions, there was a mutual respect earned along the way.\n\n\"I mean, they definitely master their style,\" Wembanyama said of Japan. \"Except (for) the guys who've played against Japan before here, I don't think we've experienced such a team. ... We've got to give props, give respect to this, because they really know how to use their strength. We could learn from them.\"\n\nAs Japan coach Tom Hovasse sees it, his team's creativity is born out of necessity.\n\n\"When you're playing against these great European teams, like the Germanys and French, they have such a physical advantage on us,\" said Hovasse, who coached the Japanese women to a silver medal in the Tokyo Olympics. \"We have to make the game a little bit chaotic, and we have to use our speed and our pace to kind of keep up with and negate some of the disadvantages that we have. So Yuki is the perfect guy. He can penetrate. He can shoot. He's a great passer. So when you have a guy like that, you really have to utilize it. ... What he did was great.\"", "source": {"uri": "nytimes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The New York Times"}, "authors": [{"uri": "sam_amick@nytimes.com", "name": "Sam Amick", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Victor_Wembanyama", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Victor Wembanyama"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Overtime_(sports)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Overtime (sports)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japan", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Japan"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Japan"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/France", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "France"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rebound_(basketball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Rebound (basketball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Point_guard", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Point guard"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rui_Hachimura", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Rui Hachimura"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basketball_positions", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Basketball positions"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Technical_foul", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Technical foul"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Memphis_Grizzlies", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Memphis Grizzlies"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rudy_Gobert", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Rudy Gobert"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assist_(basketball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Assist (basketball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los_Angeles_Lakers", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles Lakers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FIBA", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "FIBA"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Basketball_Association", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "National Basketball Association"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basketball", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Basketball"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matthew_Strazel", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Matthew Strazel"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_throw", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Free throw"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Layup", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Layup"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Three-point_field_goal", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Three-point field goal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Germany", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Germany"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Germany"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brazil", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Brazil"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Brazil"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yuki_Togashi", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Yuki Togashi"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FIBA_Basketball_World_Cup", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "FIBA Basketball World Cup"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Silver_medal", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Silver medal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tokyo", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Tokyo"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Tokyo"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Japan"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Training", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Training", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Professional", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Professional", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Show_Basketball", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Show Basketball", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://cdn.theathletic.com/app/uploads/2024/07/30143704/GettyImages-2163931295-scaled.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9776793", "eventUri": "eng-9776793", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.2549019607843137, "wgt": 160, "relevance": 1}

On Tuesday, the French side went up against Japan in their second game of group play, and found themselves in a surprising dog fight with a Japanese side led by Rui Hachimura.\n\nThe game was back-and-forth throughout, with Hachimura leading the way for Japan with 24 points early in the fourth quarter, when the Japanese star and Lakers wing picked up his second unsportsmanlike foul of the game and was ejected for pulling down Rudy Gobert's arm and sending him tumbling to the floor. After review, the referees deemed it an unsportsmanlike foul and Hachimura had already picked one up in the third quarter for knocking Bilal Coulibaly to the floor, meaning his night was over.\n\nThe FIBA definition of an unsportsmanlike foul is a little bit different than an NBA Flagrant, but even so this felt like a pretty soft foul to lead to an ejection. Gobert falling to the floor didn't help Hachimura's case, but that felt more like the big man stumbling and losing his balance than getting forcefully thrown to the ground.", "source": {"uri": "uproxx.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "UPROXX"}, "authors": [{"uri": "derrick_rossignol@uproxx.com", "name": "Derrick Rossignol", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}, {"uri": "steven_hyden@uproxx.com", "name": "Steven Hyden", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}, {"uri": "aaron_williams@uproxx.com", "name": "Aaron Williams", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}, {"uri": "wongo_okon@uproxx.com", "name": "Wongo Okon", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japan", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Japan"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Japan"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rui_Hachimura", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Rui Hachimura"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flagrant_foul", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Flagrant foul"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basketball", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Basketball"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paris", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rudy_Gobert", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Rudy Gobert"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los_Angeles_Lakers", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles Lakers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FIBA", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "FIBA"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Basketball_Association", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "National Basketball Association"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Games/Board_Games/Historical", "label": "dmoz/Games/Board Games/Historical", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Tile_Games", "label": "dmoz/Games/Tile Games", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Tile_Games/Mah_Jongg", "label": "dmoz/Games/Tile Games/Mah Jongg", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Play_Groups/Asia", "label": "dmoz/Games/Play Groups/Asia", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 60}], "image": "https://uproxx.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/rui-gobert.jpg?w=640", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9776793", "eventUri": "eng-9776793", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.2627450980392156, "wgt": 159, "relevance": 1}

The contest saw some controversial calls that went in the favor of the hometown squad.\n\nBill Simmons took to X (formerly Twitter) to express how hilarious it was to see the officials supposedly give the win to the French squad.\n\nQuestionable whistles doomed Japan\n\nAsia's lone representative at the Paris Games performed admirably against the reigning Olympic silver medalist. Thanks largely to national star Yuri Kawamura, who scored 29, Japan nearly stole the game and secured its first win in the tournament.\n\nUp by four points in the closing seconds of regulation, Kawamura unfortunately fouled Matthew Strazel for a four-point play. Some folks, including (presumably) Simmons, don't think the 5-foot-8 point guard should have been called for the infraction because it looked like a phantom foul.\n\nStill, the Japanese should have known better than to get too close to the shooter, as the only way for France to get a chance at extending the contest to overtime was an and-one opportunity while shooting a 3-pointer.\n\nIn addition, Japan had a chance to upset one of the tournament favorites in the extra period. Unfortunately, it was shorthanded, with Los Angeles Lakers forward Rui Hachimura, who had 24, having been thrown out of the game in the fourth quarter for a second unsportsmanlike foul.\n\nThe call that ended in Hachimura's ejection has also earned the ire of many viewers because replays show that it probably didn't warrant such a decision. However, the referees can be heard saying that Rui's pulling down of Rudy Gobert's arm was not a play on the ball and was excessive.\n\nBidding goodbye to the Olympics?\n\nFollowing Japan's loss to France and earlier to Germany, the country's hopes of reaching the quarterfinals are almost gone. It would need to defeat Brazil in the next contest and pray that it ends up being one of the two best third-place squads of group play to qualify for the knockout stage.\n\nAs for Les Bleus, they are already assured of a spot in the next round, regardless of the result of their matchup with the 2023 FIBA Basketball World Cup gold medalist Germany.\n\nWith Victor Wembanyama and Gobert leading the way, the French are looking to clinch their first Olympic gold medal after three runner-up finishes, including twice in the past 24 years. They may have a twin-tower combination and home-court advantage, but the goal of coming out on top of the competition remains a tall task because the field looks as strong as ever.", "source": {"uri": "basketballnetwork.net", "dataType": "news", "title": "Basketball Network - Your daily dose of basketball"}, "authors": [{"uri": "orel_dizon@basketballnetwork.net", "name": "Orel Dizon", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bill_Simmons", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Bill Simmons"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basketball", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Basketball"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japan", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Japan"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Japan"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/France", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "France"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yuri_Kawamura", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Yuri Kawamura"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Silver_medal", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Silver medal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Summer_Olympic_Games", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Summer Olympic Games"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/France_national_football_team", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "France national football team"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twitter", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Twitter"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paris", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matthew_Strazel", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Matthew Strazel"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rui_Hachimura", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Rui Hachimura"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los_Angeles_Lakers", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles Lakers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Point_guard", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Point guard"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Overtime_(sports)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Overtime (sports)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Victor_Wembanyama", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Victor Wembanyama"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2023_FIBA_Basketball_World_Cup", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "2023 FIBA Basketball World Cup"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rudy_Gobert", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Rudy Gobert"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Home_advantage", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Home advantage"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Olympic_medal", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Olympic medal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gold_medal", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Gold medal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single-elimination_tournament", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Single-elimination tournament"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Germany", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Germany"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Germany"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brazil", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Brazil"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Brazil"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Movies/Contests", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Movies/Contests", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Youth_and_High_School", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Youth and High School", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Online_Writing/Drama", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Online Writing/Drama", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Disabled/Mentally_Challenged", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Disabled/Mentally Challenged", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Olympics", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Olympics", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 97}], "image": "https://www.basketballnetwork.net/.image/ar_1.91%2Cc_fill%2Ccs_srgb%2Cfl_progressive%2Cg_faces:center%2Cq_auto:good%2Cw_1200/MjA4MjMyNTYwOTE0ODY3NjUz/france-japan-olympics.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9776793", "eventUri": "eng-9776793", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1843137254901961, "wgt": 155, "relevance": 1}

San Antonio Spurs center Victor Wembanyama, meanwhile, logged an 18-point, 11-rebound double-double, while also dishing out six dimes (tied for a team-high alongside free agent journeyman NBA wing Evan Fournier), two blocks and two steals.", "source": {"uri": "si.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Sports Illustrated"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rui_Hachimura", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Rui Hachimura"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japan", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Japan"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Japan"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Personal_foul_(basketball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Personal foul (basketball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rudy_Gobert", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Rudy Gobert"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los_Angeles_Lakers", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles Lakers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Overtime_(sports)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Overtime (sports)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/France", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "France"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_throw", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Free throw"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minnesota_Timberwolves", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Minnesota Timberwolves"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los_Angeles", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Victor_Wembanyama", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Victor Wembanyama"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Double-double", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Double-double"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evan_Fournier", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Evan Fournier"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steal_(basketball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Steal (basketball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assist_(basketball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Assist (basketball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bill_Simmons", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Bill Simmons"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rebound_(basketball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Rebound (basketball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/San_Antonio_Spurs", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "San Antonio Spurs"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FIBA", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "FIBA"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_agent", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Free agent"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Basketball_Association", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "National Basketball Association"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Olympic_Games", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Olympic Games"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paris", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Ringer_(website)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "The Ringer (website)"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Professional", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Professional", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Fan_Pages", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Fan Pages", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Show_Basketball", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Show Basketball", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://images2.minutemediacdn.com/image/upload/c_crop,w_3964,h_2229,x_0,y_608/c_fill,w_1440,ar_16:9,f_auto,q_auto,g_auto/images/ImagnImages/mmsport/all_lakers/01j42jdrq6jphmwhfz3w.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9776793", "eventUri": "eng-9776793", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.02745098039215677, "wgt": 142, "relevance": 1}

The contest saw some controversial calls that went in the favor of the hometown squad.\n\nBill Simmons took to X (formerly Twitter) to express how hilarious it was to see the officials supposedly give the win to the French squad.\n\nQuestionable whistles doomed Japan\n\nAsia's lone representative at the Paris Games performed admirably against the reigning Olympic silver medalist. Thanks largely to national star Yuri Kawamura, who scored 29, Japan nearly stole the game and secured its first win in the tournament.\n\nUp by four points in the closing seconds of regulation, Kawamura unfortunately fouled Matthew Strazel for a four-point play. Some folks, including (presumably) Simmons, don't think the 5-foot-8 point guard should have been called for the infraction because it looked like a phantom foul.\n\nStill, the Japanese should have known better than to get too close to the shooter, as the only way for France to get a chance at extending the contest to overtime was an and-one opportunity while shooting a 3-pointer.\n\nIn addition, Japan had a chance to upset one of the tournament favorites in the extra period. Unfortunately, it was shorthanded, with Los Angeles Lakers forward Rui Hachimura, who had 24, having been thrown out of the game in the fourth quarter for a second unsportsmanlike foul.\n\nThe call that ended in Hachimura's ejection has also earned the ire of many viewers because replays show that it probably didn't warrant such a decision. However, the referees can be heard saying that Rui's pulling down of Rudy Gobert's arm was not a play on the ball and was excessive.\n\nRelated: NBA insider thinks Steve Kerr has a potential problem with Stephen Curry in the Olympics: \"It's time to get Steph Curry going.\"\n\nBidding goodbye to the Olympics?\n\nFollowing Japan's loss to France and earlier to Germany, the country's hopes of reaching the quarterfinals are almost gone. It would need to defeat Brazil in the next contest and pray that it ends up being one of the two best third-place squads of group play to qualify for the knockout stage.\n\nAs for Les Bleus, they are already assured of a spot in the next round, regardless of the result of their matchup with the 2023 FIBA Basketball World Cup gold medalist Germany.\n\nWith Victor Wembanyama and Gobert leading the way, the French are looking to clinch their first Olympic gold medal after three runner-up finishes, including twice in the past 24 years. They may have a twin-tower combination and home-court advantage, but the goal of coming out on top of the competition remains a tall task because the field looks as strong as ever.\n\nRelated: \"USA

Mandatory Credit: Kiyoshi Mio-USA TODAY Sports / Kiyoshi Mio-USA TODAY Sports\n\nStarting Los Angeles Lakers forward Rui Hachimura was shockingly ejected from his native Team Japan's ongoing pool play round Olympic game against the mighy Team France for a questionable foul call.\n\nThe 6-foot-8 star was whistled for his second personal foul of the day after lightly tugging on the arm of a flailing Rudy Gobert. The Team France big man, fresh off winning his fourth Defensive Player of the Year honor with the Minnesota Timberwolves this spring, tumbled to the ground, seemingly emphasizing the contact.\n\nJapan lost its opener of the Olympics' Group Phase, a 97-77 blowout to Team Germany, led by Orlando Magic frontcourt stars Franz and Moritz Wagner and Brooklyn Nets point guard Dennis Schroder. Losing Hachimura represents a major blow for Team Japan, as he is by far their best player and No. 1 scoring option.\n\nHachimura departed with a team-most 14 points on 6-of-10 shooting from the field (1-of-2 from long range) and 1-of-2 shooting from the charity stripe. Sharpshooter Yuta Watanabe is the only other player on the roster with longterm NBA experience.\n\nTeam France, meanwhile, boasts six players who were rostered with NBA franchises in 2023-24. Gobert is joined by fellow All-Defensive First Teamer Victor Wembanyama of the San Antonio Spurs, along with L.A. Clippers combo forward Nicolas Batum (the team's captain), free agent swingman Evan Fournier, 2023 Washington Wizards lottery pick Bilal Coulibaly, and former Charlotte Hornets defense-first backup point guard Frank Ntilikina (now with Partizan). Former Boston Celtics power forward Guerschon Yabusele and ex-San Antonio Spurs/Toronto Raptors combo guard Nando De Colo are the two other familiar NBA faces on the squad.", "source": {"uri":

In 2022 a fourth victim came forward to report Corcoran had sexually assaulted her while he was living in Manchester. He was charged with two further offences relating to this victim.\n\nIn a series of personal statements read to the court, the victims detailed the devastating impact Corcoran's offending has had on their lives. One described how she had been left feeling \"worthless\" and like she didn't deserve anything good in her life, and how she turned to self-harm, alcohol abuse and \"self-destructive behaviours\".\n\nAnother victim described how she too turned to self harm and binge drinking to take away the emotions she was dealing with and how she held herself in \"utter disregard\".\n\nShe said when she turned 21 she was \"surprised\" she had made it that far, and said she had \"sabotaged\" every relationship she had been in. She added that she would always feel like \"that scared little girl\", adding: \"I know I will never lead a normal life.... this kind of thing never leaves you\".\n\nIn her statement, another victim said as a result of the abuse she was left feeling \"empty and confused\" and went on to become \"the naughty girl\" at school who was always in trouble. She said as she got older she entered a series of toxic relationships with people who took advantage of her.\n\nAll three described the additional pain and distress caused by a series of delays in the case reaching the point of sentencing. All Corcoran's victims have life-long legal anonymity.\n\nCorcoran had previously been convicted at trial of eight counts of sexual assault, indent assault, and causing or inciting a child to engage in sexual activity when he returned to the dock for sentencing.\n\nHe has 30 previous convictions for 75 offences including robberies, burglaries, cocaine dealing, shoplifting and public disorder but none for sexual matters. Nicola Powell, for Corcoran, said the defendant still denies responsibility in relation to the offences but accepts he is to be sentenced following the jury's verdicts.\n\nJudge Catherine Richards gave Corcoran an effective 25-year extended sentence comprising a 10-year determinate sentence for the Manchester offending to be followed by a 15-year extended sentence for the Swansea offending to run consecutively comprising 11 years in custody followed by a four-year licence period. He will be a registered sex offender for the rest of his life, and was made the subject of an indefinite sexual harm prevention order.\n\nSpeaking after the sentencing, South Wales Police detective inspector Sharon Gill-Lewis said: \"Gavin Corcoran is a dangerous predator who inflicted untold damage upon his multiple child victims. His abuse spanned over two decades, from 1997 to 2018.

The journalist, author, and humorist - who became famous as an early music columnist for the Chronicle, then went on to write for Spin, Rolling Stone, National Lampoon, Dallas Morning News, and the Austin American-Statesman - loved ranking things related to Austin's music scene: the best-ever bands, the greatest venues, the most important shows. Corcoran himself ranks - in my book - atop the scrapheap of underslept, overserved Austin music writers with his decades of features and profiles that were indulgently witty, centered around highly original insights, and often braced with actual primary research. The interview was rarely the part of a Michael Corcoran story that stood out - and that didn't matter because he knew how to make the subject interesting. As such, his daring techniques as a writer helped make Austin music interesting.\n\nCorcoran, 68, was found dead this week in his home in Buda. It isn't yet known how he died.\n\nBy his own account, Corcoran wrote to get a reaction - evident from his seminal clippings: articles from school newspapers in Idaho where his sole endeavor was to make his classmates laugh, Hawaii's Sunbums rag where he'd shoehorn personal escapades into his teenage concert reviews, and his libelous punk zine Honolulu Babylon that seemed to exist only to fuck with its readers.\n\nAfter stints in L.A. and New York, Michael Corcoran landed in Austin in April 1984 at age 28, with his zine collaborator from Hawaii, tattoo artist Rollo Banks. Soon he was contributing to the Chronicle, where he'd serve as music columnist from 1985-88 with his \"Don't You Start Me Talking\" page. On a post from his website in 2013, Corcoran contextualized his column's impact in contemporary terms:\n\n\"With the proliferation of blogs, the food trucks of journalism, people are getting their information from all sorts of different sources on handheld devices, so I don't think it's possible for a writer to have Austin by the balls like I did. From 1984-88, I was social media in Austin, a snarky know-it-all before they were fucking everywhere. But rereading that stuff, I've gotta admit some of the writing makes me cringe. I've finally come to realize that I'm not as good as I thought I was. But no one can deny that I came to town guns blazing.\"\n\nHis early column writing was vibrant and hilarious, spiked with a flair for creating drama - like the flack he threw towards a teenage Charlie Sexton, who'd moved to L.A. and had a hit record. In 1986, Corcoran penned an infamous column titled \"Austin Music Sucks\" where he ruthlessly picked apart an entire city's music culture, calling out 27 bands and artists by name, including Daniel Johnston (\"It's just a cruel joke we've played on you. We really don't think you're brilliant, we think you're a squirrel.\") and Stevie Ray Vaughan (\"I think you need to change haircutters. The place you go to now is not so great. You should've been tipped off when you saw that all the barbers wear black hoods with holes cut for eyes.\")\n\nThat column ran with an editor's note: \"Due to the unusual nature of Corcoran's column in this issue, there was considerable doubt around the office as to whether it should be run at all. One staffer even suggested that publishing it might place Corky in imminent danger of serious bodily harm. It was at that point that we decided to run it.\"\n\nAfter decades of more sensible music writing for large-circulation daily papers and national rock magazines, Corcoran reprised his bad-guy role in 2012, skewering the city with a clever diatribe where he rechristened Austin: Mediocre, Texas. As usual, he flame-broiled sacred cows: \"Austin is touted as a movie town, but unless we want to count UT grad Wes Anderson, we haven't exactly been churning out the great flicks. 'Tree of Life,' what was that? Director Terrence Malick doesn't like to have his picture taken, but he'll let us watch him masturbate for three hours.\"\n\nCorcoran, a self-described \"anti-critic,\" often played up his reputation for reviewing concerts he didn't actually watch - like a 1990 show with Neil Young and Sonic Youth that caused Rolling Stone to lose his number. But as a feature writer, he penned book-quality profiles of musicians that bestowed deep context on their art - see these late-career gems he wrote for the Chronicle about Gary Clark Jr., Ramsay Midwood, and the Jones Family Singers - who should be a shoo-in to play at Corky's funeral.\n\nIn the final chapter of his career, Corcoran became a musical historian who used extensive primary research to illuminate the lives and impacts of Texas musicians with histories that hadn't been properly puzzled together. That began with major discoveries about the zither-playing gospel blues artist Washington Phillips and continued into a book about blind pianist Arizona Dranes, whose Holiness movement playing informed the ensuing gospel genre which influenced rock & roll. Ultimately Corcoran would author two other books, All Over the Map: True Heroes of Texas Music and [Ghost Notes]: Pioneering Spirits of Texas Music. His last book, Austin Music Is a Scene Not a Sound arrives posthumously Sept. 10.\n\nCorcoran also maintained a popular Substack for his writings and sometimes tormented working journalists by breaking news on his personal Facebook page. But he was encouraging to younger journalists too, loudly celebrating their \"scoops\" and commending quality writing.\n\nAs the news of his death sunk in last night, I clicked back through pages of emails to find our first correspondence - over a dozen years ago. I was a few months into my extended tenure as the music columnist and was still viewed by the city's musical cognoscenti as being some bong-shop employee the paper had foolishly hired to write an influential column. He emailed to tell me: \"Love your column and its mindset of a fan with newsman's responsibility. A must-read!\"\n\nMy dickish response was: \"I can't tell you how many graying-faces have vexed me with lectures on the importance of the column and how I have to live up to Michael Corcoran - so, naturally, I shudder when I hear your name.\"\n\nAnd with that we became friends.\n\nOver the last 13 years, Michael Corcoran frequently called me and gave me the most heartfelt compliments on my work and encouragement to keep going. This writer, whose reputation was being ruthless and willing to bury you for a good line, constantly went out of his way to put the wind in my sails. Four years ago, when I started making babies, our conversations changed as he'd dispense wisdom about fatherhood and share proud stories about his son Jack, now a songwriter and musician.\n\nBut as much as Michael Corcoran's passing means I lost the most unlikely of mentors, I'm more sad for the feeling that Austin has lost a voice that always kept things interesting.", "source": {"uri":

You can check out at any time. More info\n\nA prolific paedophile preyed on young girls over two decades of offending, a court has heard. Gavin Corcoran sexually abused four different girls inflicting devastating psychological harm on his victims.\n\nPolice have described the 44-year-old defendant as a \"dangerous predator\" and have praised the courage of the victims in coming forward. Corcoran has been handed a 25-year extended sentence at Swansea Crown Court - but still maintains he has done nothing wrong.\n\nPolice in Swansea launched an investigation in 2020 after one victim came forward to report that Corcoran had sexually assaulted her when she was a child. During the course of the investigation two women then came forward and disclosed sexual abuse by Corcoran on numerous occasions when they were children.\n\nCorcoran was charged in relation to the three victims in 2021 and subsequently remanded into custody after failing to attend his trial later that year. In 2022 a fourth victim came forward to report Corcoran had sexually assaulted her while he was living in Manchester. He was charged with two further offences relating to this victim.\n\nREAD MORE: Former police officer found not guilty of assaulting man during arrest\n\nREAD MORE: Armed police called as 'petrified' domestic abuse victim seen through window\n\nIn a series of personal statements read to the court the victims detailed the devastating impact Corcoran's offending has had on their lives. One described how she had been left feeling \"worthless\" and like she didn't deserve anything good in her life, and how she turned to self-harm, alcohol abuse and \"self-destructive behaviours\". She said while she would never forget what the defendant did she was determined to move on with her life and not let what happened define her as Corcoran \"is not worth it\".\n\nAnother victim described how she too turned to self harm and binge drinking to take away the emotions she was dealing with and how she held herself in \"utter disregard\". She said when she turned 21 she was \"surprised\" she had made it that far, and said she had \"sabotaged\" every relationship she had been in. She added that she would always feel like \"that scared little girl\", adding: \"I know I will never lead a normal life.... this kind of thing never leaves you\". In her statement, another victim said as a result of the abuse she was left felt feeling \"empty and confused\" and went on to become \"the naughty girl\" at school who was always in trouble. She said as she got older she entered a series of toxic relationships with people who took advantage of her. All three described the additional pain and distress caused by a series of delays in the case reaching the point of sentencing. All Corcoran's victims have life-long legal anonymity.\n\nGavin Martin Paul Corcoran, now of Holmfield Avenue, Moston, Manchester, had previously been convicted at trial of eight counts of sexual assault, indent assault, and causing or inciting a child to engage in sexual activity when he returned to the dock for sentencing. He has 30 previous convictions for 75 offences including robberies, burglaries, cocaine dealing, shoplifting and public disorder but none for sexual matters. Nicola Powell, for Corcoran, said the defendant still denies responsibility in relation to the offences but accepts he is to be sentenced following the jury's verdicts.\n\nJudge Catherine Richards gave Corcoran an effective 25-year extended sentence comprising a 10-year determinate sentence for the Manchester offending to be followed by a 15-year extended sentence for the Swansea offending to run consecutively comprising 11 years in custody followed by a four-year licence period. He will be a registered sex offender for the rest of his life, and was made the subject of an indefinite sexual harm prevention order.\n\nSpeaking after the sentencing, South Wales Police detective inspector Sharon Gill-Lewis said: \"Gavin Corcoran is a dangerous predator who inflicted untold damage upon his multiple child victims. His abuse spanned over two decades, from 1997 to 2018. This case has been particularly difficult and very distressing for the victims, with the trial having been run five times due to a number of factors, including Covid and the fourth victim being identified.\n\n\"Today's sentence reflects the professionalism, hard work, and dedication of detective constable Eleanor Dallas, who has worked tirelessly throughout this investigation to ensure that the victims got the justice they deserve.

My heart is with his son, Jack, along with his former wife and dear friend, Victoria.\n\nI was able to return Michael's tough praise when his books, \"Ghost Notes: Pioneering Spirits of Texas Music\" and \"All Over the Map: \"True Heroes of Texas Music\" came out.\n\nThese efforts represent truly remarkable and deep cultural history. They will be read for decades to come. You should read them now. And we should make a pact that they never fall out of print.\n\nFor some balm in Gilead, I can confirm some gratifying news: TCU Press will publish his book, \"Austin Music Is a Scene, Not a Sound: An Illustrated History of the First 100 Years,\" already in the making.\n\n\"Our plan currently is to go ahead with the book\", says James Lehr, marketing director for TCU Press, \"targeting sometime this fall for its release.\"\n\nFor some people, a hurried news obituary is not enough. I've gathered, therefore, some memories of \"Corky\" from coworkers and others. While writing about Corcoran, these folks are also writing about our life's calling, our culture and ourselves.\n\n'He saw stories everywhere'\n\nKathy Blackwell, former Statesman features editor, now executive editor for Texas Monthly: One thing I always admired about Michael and why I loved working with him was that he saw stories everywhere. And when it came to music, which was his beat for so long, he was never satisfied by the easy reach. He wanted to dig deep into everything, and was especially passionate about making sure overlooked musicians, especially those of color, got their due.\n\nAnd the main thing about him -- and this is the highest compliment I know to pay anyone -- was that he was generous. It's a trait shared by the best writers, and the best people. Even when we were disagreeing on something, which we did often, he would turn around and compliment me on a project I oversaw, or share music with me, or just try to make me laugh. He made himself available to everyone.\n\n'Absolute pinnacle of American letters': Texas writers talk about the late Cormac McCarthy\n\nI was a paid subscriber to \"Overserved,\" his Substack (newsletter), and so looked forward to seeing his name in my inbox. When it came to telling stories about legends past, there was no one like him. I hope other writers do the same for him.\n\n'Arguably the greatest'\n\nDeborah Sengupta Stith, former Statesman music beat reporter, now Austin360 editor: Michael Corcoran, arguably the greatest chronicler of the Austin music scene, has died.\n\nCorky was a gleeful provocateur. The original troll. He made a name for himself shooting down Austin's stars, and throughout his career, he never shied away from a hot take. But his opinions were malleable. Once dubious of the band Blue October, late in his career at the Statesman, he became the greatest champion of San Marcos' favorite sons.\n\nSometimes he operated in ethical gray areas. Each year, he accepted a ludicrously expensive backstage pass to the Austin City Limits Music Festival for his son, Jack, the light of his life. But no one rode fest promoter C3 Presents harder than the man who once did a deep analysis on the difference in park fees the company pays to use Chicago's Grant Park for Lollapalooza and Austin's Zilker for ACL. (Hint: the Chicago fees were much higher.)\n\n'Pastures of the Empty Page': Top Texas writers lionize Larry McMurtry in absorbing new book\n\nOver time, I earned his respect and we developed a solid working relationship. When I applied for the music writer position -- I was writing about music while working on the digital desk -- he met with the paper's top editors to insist I should be hired.\n\nWhen we ran into each other at the South by Southwest Music Festival a few years later (after an online confrontation about comments Corcoran posted in stunningly bad taste), we had a warm exchange. And whenever he took the time to say something nice about a story I wrote, it felt like the greatest badge of honor.\n\nI never subscribed to his Substack newsletter, \"Overserved,\" despite our shared love of music history. But I'm remedying that now. For $60, I get full access to the archives and I look forward to listening to the voice of my old colleague and onetime friend telling lascivious stories of the seedy side of the Austin music scene in a way that only he can.\n\n'The GOAT of Austin music journalism'\n\nAndy Langer, journalist and radio host: End of an era. He was his own man. He was singular talent, equal parts frustrating and brilliant. He was the GOAT of Austin music journalism. Those are all clich\u00e9s, but with the added advantage of being true.\n\nI met Corky in the early '90s and, while we were never traditional friends, we were definitely friendly, and a for a while, I guess what you might consider frenemies.\n\nWe argued, in person and on Facebook, about music, music journalism, ethics, and the state of Austin and you couldn't help but love his devotion to contrariness -- he was the truest, bluest contrarian I've ever met and while sometimes he'd lay out an insane assessment that you knew he genuinely believed, he also did the contrarian for contrarian's sake better than anyone.\n\nMore: A generation of Black and Hispanic civil rights pioneers left Austin a better place\n\nHe did it to get a rise of out of us. Later, he did it for clicks, likes, newsletter views and book sales. I'm glad the first version of his Statesman obit has \"historian\" in the headline. He earned that the hard, lonely, not so financially rewarding way, but damn, his knowledge -- and number of incredible stories he'd tucked away and would rattle off with delight -- was so deep, so wide.\n\nThe part I'm not ready to fully write about, but can't stop thinking about, is that in some ways his pioneer status -- someone who came along at the middle of the first real wave of music journalism -- put him a tough spot once music journalism shifted from long-form and columns to quick hits and clicks. The OG were too often casualties left behind writing words for pennies that used to be dollars. Ugh.\n\nHe was a one-man Statler and Waldorf, had a lot of heart, a lot of wisdom and offered all of us a lot of laughs. He left millions of words behind -- so much future generations will hopefully find and use to frame their own opinions -- but it's also heartbreaking to think about how much he knew about Austin, about Austin music, about music history that dies with him. May his memory be a blessing.\n\n'The most thankless job there is'\n\nChris Riemenschneider, former Statesman music writer, now music writer for the Star Tribune: Corcoran used to tell me being a newspaper music critic was \"the most thankless job there is.\" He said it many times.\n\nIn the two decades since I worked with him in Texas -- starting as the summer intern at the Dallas Morning News the year his son was born, and then 5 to 6 more years at the American-Statesman, where he still sometimes called me his intern, but I didn't mind -- I've unfortunately grown to learn what he meant. It wasn't a whiny or self-pitying statement. It was a get-over-it kind of comment.\n\nYou often work for newsroom editors who only want you covering whatever they get a press release for, and who more than anything don't want you writing anything to piss anyone off. Lord forbid. You work with egocentric musicians who only want you writing praise for them, and even when you do praise them, you either don't give them enough, or don't write it exactly how they want to hear it.\n\nYou work with a lot of other people in the music business who think you're there to serve them; or shouldn't be there at all. And of course the real people you work for, the readers and music lovers, only email or -- in those days -- phone you when they disagree with you, or you get some stupid Fall Out Boy song title wrong or whatever.\n\nI believe Michael's point was: \"Do the job for yourself.\" Find your own rewards. Write the story you find interesting. Write the barbed line that makes you laugh. Write that much-maligned \"25 albums that killed rock 'n' roll\" list because pissing off humorless Beatles fans sounds fun. He took this approach better than anyone, and thus I truly believe he was as good at the job as anyone. I actually think his upcoming books deep-diving into Austin's music history will go down as his crowning achievement.\n\nWith this devastating news of his sudden passing, though, I'm seeing so many people around Austin and beyond expressing their admiration for him personally and -- wait for it -- thanks to him for his work. I'd like to thank everyone for proving him wrong in the end on at least that one count.\n\nI, of course, want to thank him myself, too. He was good to me, and -- with a few minor exceptions -- good for me.", "source": {"uri": "eu.statesman.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "USA TODAY"}, "authors": [{"uri": "austin_american_statesman@eu.statesman.com", "name": "Austin American-Statesman", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Corcoran", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Michael Corcoran"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Music_of_Austin,_Texas", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Music of Austin, Texas"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chicago", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Chicago"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Chicago"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Texas", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Texas"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Texas"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Texas_Christian_University", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Texas Christian University"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Journalist", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Journalist"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Austin,_Texas", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Austin, Texas"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Austin, Texas"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Substack", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Substack"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heroes_(American_TV_series)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Heroes (American TV series)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Humorist", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Humorist"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_D._Wittliff", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "William D.

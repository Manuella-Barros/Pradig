The document does not reject the proposal outright, as the final decision rests with the Supreme Council, which Iohannis chairs.\n\nHowever, the situation is still expected to lead to complex discussions between political and military leaders within the Supreme Council.\n\nAccording to some sources, it might approve sending the system if it can ensure Romania's anti-aircraft defence remains unaffected.\n\nDiscussions on providing a Patriot system to Ukraine began in early May when President Iohannis discussed the matter with US President Joe Biden during a visit to the United States.\n\nIn May, Iohannis stressed that \"it is unacceptable for Romania to remain without anti-aircraft defence\" and insisted that \"if something is given up, Romania must receive something in return.\"\n\nAt the time, Romania had only one operational Patriot system, but a second system became operational on 14 June, with a third expected by the end of the year and a fourth early next year.\n\nRomania has paid $4 billion for seven Patriot systems, four of which have been delivered by the United States so far, and the remaining three are due to arrive by 2027.\n\nThe report's conclusion is not surprising, given that Defence Minister Angel T\u00eelv\u0103r has repeatedly opposed the deployment of the system, which he considers \"indispensable for the defence of the national territory.\"\n\nPrime Minister Marcel Ciolacu has also expressed reservations, saying that Romania does not currently have enough Patriot systems to spare. However, he conceded that \"placing a system in Ukraine could potentially benefit Romania's defence\", although it remains \"a strategic decision with both pros and cons\".\n\nAt the NATO-Ukraine Council in April, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said that Ukraine needed at least seven Patriot systems to counter Russian air strikes.\n\nWhile several NATO countries have promised to send such systems, only a few, including the US and Germany, have fulfilled their commitments so far.", "source": {"uri": "euractiv.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "EurActiv.com"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Klaus_Iohannis", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Klaus Iohannis"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Biden", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ukraine", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Ukraine"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Ukraine"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Romania", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Romania"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Romania"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Verkhovna_Rada", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Verkhovna Rada"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supreme_Council_of_National_Defence_(Romania)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Supreme Council of National Defence (Romania)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ministry_of_Defence_(Russia)", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Ministry of Defence (Russia)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anti-aircraft_warfare", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Anti-aircraft warfare"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Angel_T\u00eelv\u0103r", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Angel T\u00eelv\u0103r"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Volodymyr_Zelenskyy", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Volodymyr Zelenskyy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marcel_Ciolacu", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Marcel Ciolacu"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minister_for_Defence_(Australia)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Minister for Defence (Australia)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/President_of_Ukraine", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "President of Ukraine"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NATO", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "NATO"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russia", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Russia"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Russia"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Germany", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Germany"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Germany"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Business/Business_Services/Supplies_and_Equipment", "label": "dmoz/Business/Business Services/Supplies and Equipment", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Aerospace_and_Defense/Defense", "label": "dmoz/Business/Aerospace and Defense/Defense", "wgt": 20}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Government/Defense_Ministries", "label": "dmoz/Society/Government/Defense Ministries", "wgt": 21}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Programming/Operating_Systems", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Programming/Operating Systems", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Artificial_Life/Lindenmayer_Systems", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Artificial Life/Lindenmayer Systems", "wgt": 20}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 92}], "image": "https://www.euractiv.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/06/shutterstock_1817404100-800x450.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9667877", "eventUri": "eng-9667877", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-06-14", "textStart": 1250, "textEnd": 1257}], "sentiment": 0.2549019607843137, "wgt": 207, "relevance": 1}

The U.S.-made air defense system to be sent to Ukraine is one of several that Romania possesses.\n\n\"The decision was based on an in-depth technical evaluation of the Romanian authorities, all measures being taken to eliminate the risk of creating possible vulnerabilities for Romania,\" Iohannis' office said. \"At the same time, they will continue discussions with allies so that our country's air defense is further strengthened.\"\n\nThe U.S. has donated a Patriot system to Ukraine, and earlier this month approved sending another. Other allies, including Germany, also have provided air defense systems. U.S. officials have routinely pressed for allies to provide air defense systems to Kyiv, but some Eastern European nations have been reluctant to give up the high-tech systems.\n\nUkrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy has repeatedly urged Western allies to boost his country's air defenses in the face of sustained Russian attacks on Ukraine's power grid, which in recent weeks forced energy companies to institute nationwide rolling blackouts.\n\n\"Romania's position is and will continue to be unequivocal in its multidimensional support of Ukraine, alongside the international community, in its legitimate right to self-defense against Russia's illegal and unprovoked aggression,\" Iohannis' office said.\n\nAfter Russia launched a full-scale invasion of Ukraine on Feb. 24, 2022, NATO increased its presence on Europe's eastern flank by sending additional multinational battlegroups to alliance members Romania, Hungary, Bulgaria, and Slovakia.\n\nSince then, Romania has played an increasingly prominent role in the alliance throughout the war, including opening an international training hub in southeast of the country for F-16 jet pilots from allied countries and other partners, including Ukraine.\n\nCopyright 2024 The Associated Press.

The Council also noted the need to find a temporary solution to address the operational vulnerability resulting from the donation.\n\n\"This crucial contribution will bolster our air shield and help us better protect our people and critical infrastructure from Russian air terror. I appreciate Romania's strong leadership and principled support for Ukraine,\" Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelensky said in a social media post on Thursday.\n\nRomania currently owns four Patriot missile batteries. The US State Department cleared the sale of seven systems in 2017 for an estimated $3.9 billion (3.636 billion euro). Four of the seven Patriot systems were paid for, with the fourth delivered in 2023. In November 2018, Romania signed a deal with Raytheon to buy three additional Patriot systems, bringing the total number of agreed purchases to ten.\n\nStarting in January 2025, Romania will take over the role of commander of the EUFOR Althea military deployment in Bosnia and Herzegovina for a period of twelve months, as per the presidency's statement. During the Council's meeting Iohannis also said that he has informed NATO allies about the withdrawal of his candidacy for the position of Secretary General of the organisation.\n\nThe Romanian defence ministry said on Wednesday that Romania will buy three battalion-level 155mm howitzer systems, including 54 K9 Thunder self-propelled howitzers from South Korean arms manufacturer Hanwha Aerospace, following a meeting between the two countries' defence ministers. The purchase of the howitzer systems comes on the back of multiple other arms deals meant to strengthen Romania's defence capabilities in the context of Russia's aggression on Ukraine, including acquisitions of Patriot missiles, Sidewinder missiles, and Marte ER missiles.", "source": {"uri": "seenews.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "See News"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

This decision follows the demand expressed by the current US President, Joe Biden, and the constant pressures exerted on Romania to comply.\n\nThe decision has been constantly criticized, even by Romania's Army officers. Notably, the Romanian Army mentioned that the country should not send the only functional anti-missile system to Ukraine. The Ministry of Defense clearly states, in a document already sent to President Johannis, that Romania will not cede any PATRIOT system to Ukraine, at least not at this moment. The report does not show that our country remains exposed but that the heads of the Army fear that Romania will not be able to recover this system once sent to a theatre of war.\n\nAccording to President Zelensky, Ukrainians need two Patriot systems for Kharkiv - and much more. You can't find Patriot systems at the supermarket. They are pretty few, challenging to produce, there are many promises, and Taiwan is also waiting for them. The big problem, the political pressure President Biden has put on Romania, in my opinion, is almost crushing. Romania's big dilemma is that there are elections. Romania's second dilemma is that Poland does not give Patriot. If Poland had given Patriot, it was impossible to say \"no\". If Poland does not give a Patriot, it is tough to convince why you give it.\n\nThe formal request was made in Washington this month when Romania's President Klaus Johannis met Joe Biden. At that moment, when asked by the journalists, Johannis avoided a direct answer to whether Romania would deliver a Patriot system to Ukraine.\n\nConsidering the significant deterioration of the security situation in Ukraine as a result of Russia's constant and massive attacks on civilians and civil infrastructure, especially on the energy sector, as well as the regional consequences of this situation, including on Romania's security, in close coordination with the Allies, Council members decided to donate a PATRIOT system to Ukraine.\n\nGlobal Patriot\u2122 Solutions is an anti-missile defence system consisting of radar, command and control technology and multiple types of interceptors, all working together to detect, identify and neutralize tactical ballistic missiles, cruise missiles, drones, advanced aircraft and other threats.\n\nPatriot is the basis of the anti-aircraft and anti-missile defence of 18 countries.\n\nIt is manufactured by the U.S. defence contractor Raytheon and derives its name from the radar component of the weapon system. The AN/MPQ-53 at the heart of the system is known as the \"Phased Array Tracking Radar to Intercept on Target,\" a backronym for \"Patriot.\"", "source": {"uri": "valahia.news", "dataType": "news", "title": "Valahia.News"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MIM-104_Patriot", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "MIM-104 Patriot"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ukraine", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Ukraine"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Ukraine"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Romania", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Romania"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Romania"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Klaus_Iohannis", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Klaus Iohannis"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Missile_defense", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Missile defense"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Biden", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Army", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "United States Army"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Romanian_Land_Forces", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Romanian Land Forces"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arms_industry", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Arms industry"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ministry_of_Defence_(Russia)", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Ministry of Defence (Russia)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Verkhovna_Rada", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Verkhovna Rada"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poland", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Poland"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Poland"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Volodymyr_Zelenskyy", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Volodymyr Zelenskyy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theater_(warfare)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Theater (warfare)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kharkiv", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Kharkiv"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Kharkiv"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Ukraine"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taiwan", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Republic of China (Taiwan)"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Republic of China (Taiwan)"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Backronym", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Backronym"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tactical_ballistic_missile", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Tactical ballistic missile"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cruise_missile", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Cruise missile"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anti-aircraft_warfare", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Anti-aircraft warfare"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Command_and_control", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Command and control"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radar", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Radar"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unmanned_aerial_vehicle", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Unmanned aerial vehicle"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Washington_(state)", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Washington (state)"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Washington (state)"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russia", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Russia"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Russia"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Business/Aerospace_and_Defense", "label": "dmoz/Business/Aerospace and Defense", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Aerospace_and_Defense/Defense", "label": "dmoz/Business/Aerospace and Defense/Defense", "wgt": 19}, {"uri": "dmoz/Science/Technology/Military_Science", "label": "dmoz/Science/Technology/Military Science", "wgt": 23}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Military/Weapons_and_Equipment", "label": "dmoz/Society/Military/Weapons and Equipment", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Artificial_Life/Lindenmayer_Systems", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Artificial Life/Lindenmayer Systems", "wgt": 17}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 67}], "image": "https://valahia.news/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/Raytheon-Missile-Patriot.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9667877", "eventUri": "eng-9667877", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-06-20", "textStart": 201, "textEnd": 208}], "sentiment": 0.07450980392156858, "wgt": 178, "relevance": 1}

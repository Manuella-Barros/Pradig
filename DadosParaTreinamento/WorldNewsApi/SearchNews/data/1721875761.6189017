The ball felt heavy, his body felt heavy. For a second time this season, Paddack described feeling dead arm after a start, something that\u2019s not terribly surprising given the workload he\u2019s had in the past two seasons. Paddack underwent his second Tommy John surgery in May 2022 and entered this season having pitched just 27 1/3 major league innings in the previous two seasons. \u201cWe\u2019ve got to stay on top of that. I\u2019ve had a rough four weeks,\u201d Paddack said after allowing three runs on five hits with three walks and three strikeouts in 4 2/3 innings against the Athletics. \u201cAs I entered June, the body felt just a little heavy. You can prepare all offseason, all spring training, but a man that hasn\u2019t been able to throw this many innings in three years now due to injury, you can\u2019t do enough to prepare for this.\u201d The Twins haven\u2019t done much to minimize his workload this season. Occasionally he\u2019s had a shorter start or two, but they haven\u2019t skipped one. And to this point, Twins manager Rocco Baldelli said, they weren\u2019t ready to do anything different with Paddack. But they\u2019ll take the next day or two to assess and then see where he\u2019s at, the manager said. \u201cThere\u2019s nothing \u2014 and I use the word acute a lot \u2014 but there\u2019s nothing acute going on right here,\u201d Baldelli said. \u201cThere are ups and downs in everyone\u2019s season, especially his, coming back from what he\u2019s coming back from.\u201d Baldelli noted that Paddack felt this way a couple weeks ago and then saw a spike in his velocity after going through a dead-arm period. Baldelli called the dramatic ups and downs with Paddack\u2019s stuff \u201cnot unheard of and not unexpected.\u201d But the Twins will still watch him closely to see if there\u2019s anything they can do for him. \u201cWe knew that coming in that there was going to be a roller coaster of events, up, down with the body and the mind,\u201d Paddack said. \u201cBut \u2026 I have to get ready for my next start.\u201d Bullpen gets day off Before Saturday\u2019s game, Baldelli talked about how taxed his team\u2019s bullpen was after a run of close games. Bailey Ober figured out one way to solve that. \u201cBullpens are going to get beat up sometimes just because of tight games,\u201d Ober said. \u201cAs starting pitchers your job is to sometimes go as deep as you can and try to give them a break. How about nine innings? Ober\u2019s complete game against the Athletics on Saturday meant that a group of tired relievers got a rest day. The team also has the day off on Monday. \u201cWe were really looking for something like this. You don\u2019t normally get the nine innings,\u201d Baldelli said. \u201c \u2026 This is the kind of win and performance by Bailey Ober that can carry on beyond today, for a while. We have an off day on Monday. You start adding this day and Monday together and you get a nice little reset for the bullpen.\u201d Briefly The Twins close out the series Sunday at Oakland Coliseum. It will be their final game in the ballpark, which has been the Athletics\u2019 home since 1968. Starting next season, the A\u2019s plan to play at 14,000-seat Sutter Health Park in Sacramento through 2027 as their new stadium in Las Vegas is constructed. \u2026 Pablo L\u00f3pez will draw the start for that game, looking to rebound after giving up five runs in four innings his last time out.", "summary": "The starter, who had his second Tommy John surgery in 2022, has thrown 78 1/3 innings this season.", "url": "https://www.twincities.com/2024/06/22/twins-starter-chris-paddack-battles-through-dead-arm-period/", "image": "https://www.twincities.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/STP-Z-TWINSPIX-0611-01.jpg?w=1024", "video": null, "publish_date": "2024-06-23 00:15:47", "author": "Betsy Helfand", "authors": ["Betsy Helfand"], "language": "en", "source_country": "us", "sentiment": -0.231}

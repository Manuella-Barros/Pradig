Sometimes it doesn't always take a grand romantic gesture to whisk them off their feet, as they can easily be impressed by the little things, from cooking them their favourite meals or sending them a message to show you care. However, for one woman that means taking a bite out of her husband's packed lunch every day which helps \"bring them closer together.\" Tracy Howell has been married to her husband Clifford for 41 years. In a post to Facebook, Howell explained to her followers that she regularly takes a bite out of his sandwich while preparing his meal for work. She wrote: \"Clifford and I have been married almost 41 years and I have made his lunch every working day since day one. On occasion, I would join him on the job site and have lunch with him. He made the comment once that lunch tastes better when you share it with someone you love. Soon after that, while fixing his sandwich one night, I took a bite out of it before putting it away.\" She continued: \"When he got home (long before cell phones), he commented that someone took a bite out of his sandwich. I told him that since I couldn't join him for lunch, I took a bite so he knew I was joining him.\" Her followers were left touched by the sweet gesture and took to the comments section to express their joy. One person penned: \"That is so sweet! Happy Anniversary! Keep hugging each other tight!\" Another person added: \"Y'all are the sweetest and have such a great story from the very first date,\" before commenting with a series of love heart emojis.\" Meanwhile, a third person simply wrote: \"This is so heart-warming.\" Meanwhile, an adorable couple melted fans hearts after recreating their old school photo on their wedding day and people can't get enough. The video has been shared around social media numerous times, and was recently posted on X (formerly Twitter) by an account called @Bezeley_MBChB1. Alongside the video, the user simply wrote: \"Awesome,\" with a fire emoji. Several commenters simply left heart emojis on the video, while one person wrote: \"I find this the most beautiful love story.\" Another person added: \"What my dreams are made of! Hope they find all the happiness in the world.\" Do you have a story to sell?

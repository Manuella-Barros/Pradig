{"id": 225036724, "title": "War against Hamas will last \u2018at least\u2019 until end of 2024, says Israeli security chief", "text": "The war against Hamas terrorists in the Gaza Strip will last at least until the end of the year, Israeli National Security Adviser Tzachi Hanegbi declared on Wednesday. \u201cWe expect another seven months of fighting in order to deepen the accomplishments and achieve what we have defined as \u2018the destruction of the governmental and military capabilities of Hamas,'\u201d said Hanegbi. The former Cabinet minster stressed that Jerusalem has no choice but to act in Gaza\u2019s southernmost city of Rafah and stop Hamas from smuggling weapons, funds and terrorists into the Strip from Egypt\u2019s Sinai. \u201cNo one will volunteer to look after us, and we will have to look after ourselves,\u201d Hanegbi said in the interview with Kan Reshet Bet radio. Both Egypt and the Ramallah-based Palestinian Authority have rejected Israeli proposals to reopen the Rafah Border Crossing and manage its operation jointly. Israeli ground forces entered Gaza on October 27 following weeks of airstrikes in response to the October 7 Hamas attacks, in which terrorists murdered some 1,200 people, wounded thousands more, and abducted more than 250 men, women and children to Gaza. The IDF took control of the Gaza side of the Rafah Crossing on May 7. A day earlier, Israel\u2019s War Cabinet decided unanimously to \u201ccontinue the operation in Rafah to exert military pressure on Hamas in order to promote the release of our hostages and the other goals of the war.\u201d The Rafah operation, which Israel estimates will last around two months, is being carried out in phases as opposed to a full-scale invasion. The phased nature of the operation allows for it to be paused should a hostage release deal be reached between Israel and Hamas. Commenting on Jerusalem\u2019s efforts to bring about a deal to release the remaining 125 hostages held in Gaza, Hanegbi stressed on Wednesday that \u201cthe prime minister, the minister of defence, and the Cabinet unanimously approved activities that carried the risk of casualties.\u201d Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu also \u201cexpanded the scope of the [negotiation] mandate; Israel had to erode its position so much that the Americans now say that the Israeli offer is very generous,\u201d he said. Hanegbi added: \u201cWe meet with the families [of those held in Gaza] and talk to them. It\u2019s a nightmare that you can\u2019t even imagine. It\u2019s hard for us to understand the intensity of the nightmare that the families are experiencing. There are 125 people we need to bring home. We deal with this every day.\u201d Israel\u2019s War Cabinet has approved updated guidelines for its negotiation team, and a delegation led by Mossad head David Barnea returned from Paris Saturday, where they agreed with counterparts to resume talks. In December, Hanegbi warned that a war with the Hezbollah terrorist group in Southern Lebanon was likely after the defeat of Hamas in Gaza. \u201cWe can no longer accept [Hezbollah\u2019s elite] Radwan Force sitting on the border. We can no longer accept [UN] Resolution 1701 not being implemented,\u201d he added, referring to the 2006 Security Council resolution that bars the Iranian terrorist proxy from maintaining a presence south of the Litani River, which is located some 18 miles north of Israel. Over 60,000 Israelis from more than 40 communities located within 6.2 miles of the Lebanese border have been internally displaced since Hezbollah joined the war in support of Hamas on October 8.", "summary": "Israeli National Security Adviser Tzachi Hanegbi expects another seven months of fighting", "url": "https://www.thejc.com/news/israel/war-against-hamas-will-last-at-least-until-end-of-2024-says-israeli-security-chief-qwt7y972", "image": "https://api.thejc.atexcloud.io/image-service/view/acePublic/alias/contentid/1bkt3fjvdmv0j2376cz/0/idf-rafah-2024_credit-idf.webp", "video": null, "publish_date": "2024-05-29 13:15:35", "author": "Jc Reporter,Jewish News Syndicate", "authors": ["Jc Reporter", "Jewish News Syndicate"], "language": "en", "source_country": "gb", "sentiment": -0.09}

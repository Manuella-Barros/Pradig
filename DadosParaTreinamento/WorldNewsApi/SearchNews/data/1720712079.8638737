William stood in for his father Thursday at two events, including an international ceremony commemorating the 80th anniversary of the D-Day landings at Omaha Beach. As The Daily Beast previously reported, royal sources said a decision had been made for Charles to skip the large event in Normandy attended by other heads of state\u2014including President Joe Biden\u2014in order to \u201cprotect\u201d his \u201ccontinued recovery\u201d from cancer. \u201cA friend of the King says that in recent years Charles\u2019s tendency to consult William on tricky family issues involving the Duke of York and the Duke and Duchess of Sussex has helped to ease the anxieties of the past and boost their personal and working relationships,\u201d the Sunday Times reported. Despite missing the international event, Charles attended a D-Day ceremony earlier in the day honoring British troops. \u201cEighty years ago on D-Day, the 6th of June 1944, our nation\u2014and those which stood alongside it\u2014faced what my grandfather, King George VI, described as the supreme test,\u201d Charles said. \u201cHow fortunate we were\u2014and the entire free world\u2014that a generation of men and women in the United Kingdom and other allied nations did not flinch when the moment came to face that test.\u201d William, aware that he\u2019s way more popular in opinion polls than his dad, has always been conscious of not \u201cqueering his father\u2019s pitch,\u201d friends tell the Sunday Times. \u201cIf there was ever a green-eyed monster or a sense of rivalry between the two, that is a chapter of the past,\u201d the friend of Charles told the paper. \u201cThe King sees his son as a useful ally on family matters and increasingly in discharging the duties of nation and state. When you are monarch, you\u2019re not counting the column inches. You\u2019re thinking about performing your role for your country, not just as King Charles but as \u2018the family.\u2019\u201d A source close to William told the Sunday Times: \u201cHe very much wants to support his father. That isn\u2019t something new, but of course with everything the King is going through with his treatment, he will continue to support him as much as he can.\u201d His visibility in Normandy, and proximity to global power players, also boosts William\u2019s own international statesman profile. Meanwhile, father and son will appear alongside one another at more events this summer, like the garter service at St George\u2019s Chapel, Windsor, on June 17 and for a day\u2019s racing at Royal Ascot later that week. It\u2019s just as well father and son are getting so well\u2014the number of senior royals available for events has shrunk in recent years, following Harry and Meghan\u2019s exit from their roles, and Prince Andrew\u2019s sidelining following allegations of sexual assault and his friendship with Jeffrey Epstein. Charles\u2019 portrait may get some in-palace love King Charles is so enamored with Jonathan Yeo\u2019s controversial portrait of him that it may be going on display at Buckingham Palace. Depending on your view, the portrait looked great, or like the king was being consumed by hellish fire, or as if he was bobbing around in a watery tomato soup. The Times reports there are plans for the portrait to go on display at the Palace for its summer opening months between July and the end of September. The large painting features Charles in the garb of the Welsh Guards, holding a sword. Charles was appointed the Guards\u2019 Regimental Colonel in 1975, with Prince William taking on the post in 2023. At the time of its unveiling in mid-May, the BBC reported that the painting has one confirmed fan: Queen Camilla, who, on seeing the portrait, said to Yeo: \u201cYes, you\u2019ve got him.\u201d Inevitably, online opinion raged about the dramatic painting\u2014about whether it showed Charles\u2019 \u201cacceptance of the revelation of your flaws and your mortality,\u201d or it being a \u201cvery fine portrait,\u201d or conversely \u201clike the poster for a truly nightmarish horror movie,\u201d or even so bad it was deemed \u201cabsolutely fecking hideous, looks like he is burning in hell.\u201d Yeo\u2014whose other royal sitters included Queen Elizabeth and Prince Philip, and who has painted celebrities like Nicole Kidman\u2014told the BBC that Charles had sat for the portrait four times since 2021. \u201cMy interest is really in figuring out who someone is and trying to get that on a canvas,\u201d he said. As for the presence of the butterfly, it \u201csymbolizes metamorphosis and rebirth,\u201d Yeo said, referencing Charles\u2019 ascension to the throne. \u201cI think it\u2019s lovely,\u201d Yeo said of the debate the portrait had caused. \u201cPart of the reason the portrait has gone as far and wide as it has, is because of that whole bit of theatrics of the unveiling happening there [at the palace], the King doing it, the palace being visible as a backdrop. It looked great in there so it\u2019s no bad thing that people will be able to see it in that setting.\u201d \u201cI do my best to capture the life experiences etched into any individual sitter's face. In this case, my aim was also to make reference to the traditions of royal portraiture but in a way that reflects a 21st Century Monarchy and, above all else, to communicate the subject's deep humanity,\u201d Yeo said. \u201cI\u2019m unimaginably grateful for the opportunity to capture such an extraordinary and unique person, especially at the historic moment of becoming king.\u201d As for feeling nervous about how the portrait might be received by the king himself, Yeo joked: \u201cIf this was seen as treasonous, I could literally pay for it with my head, which would be an appropriate way for a portrait painter to die\u2014to have their head removed!\u201d Camilla: Charles won\u2019t slow down Queen Camilla has said King Charles, currently receiving treatment for cancer, was \u201cdoing fine except he won't slow down and won't do what he\u2019s told.\u201d The Sun reports that Camilla was speaking with author Lee Child during the second annual Queen's Reading Room Literary Festival at Hampton Court Palace. Child replied that it \u201csounds to me like a typical husband.\u201d Earl Spencer \u2018immensely sad\u2019 as marriage breaks down Princess Diana\u2019s brother, Earl Spencer, says his marriage to his third wife Karen Spencer broke down in the wake of writing his recent memoir detailing the abuse he endured at boarding school when he was a kid. The couple wed in 2011, and are divorcing after 13 years of marriage. Spencer told the Mail on Sunday: \u201cIt is immensely sad. I just want to devote myself to all my children, and to my grandchildren, and I wish Karen every happiness in the future.\u201d Working on the memoir, in which Spencer wrote about an assistant matron at his school abusing him, led Spencer to undergo residential treatment for trauma late last year. Spencer said the matron\u2014whose real-life identity was also revealed by the Mail this weekend\u2014had written a note in Spencer\u2019s schoolboy diary, reading \u201cMe,\u201d which he discovered when researching his memoir. \u201cThere is something about the word, \u2018Me,\u2019 that strikes me now as not only wildly inappropriate, but intensely intimate\u2014and, of course, slyly anonymous,\u201d Spencer said.

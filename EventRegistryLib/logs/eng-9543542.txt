Sebrechts denied the allegations in a statement sent to BI at the time. His wife, Crystle Stewart, stepped down as president of Miss USA in August 2023 and was replaced by Laylah Rose.\n\nVoigt, Michelle, and representatives for the Miss USA and Miss Universe organizations did not immediately respond to requests for comment from Business Insider.", "source": {"uri": "businessinsider.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Business Insider"}, "authors": [{"uri": "anneta_konstantinides@businessinsider.com", "name": "Anneta Konstantinides", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miss_USA", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Miss USA"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mental_health", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Mental health"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miss_Universe", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Miss Universe"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miss_Teen_USA", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Miss Teen USA"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Instagram", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Instagram"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beauty_pageant", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Beauty pageant"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_media", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Social media"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/R'Bonney_Gabriel", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "R'Bonney Gabriel"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cheslie_Kryst", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Cheslie Kryst"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crystle_Stewart", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Crystle Stewart"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Business_Insider", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Business Insider"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sexual_harassment", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Sexual harassment"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Suicide", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Suicide"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vice_President_of_the_United_States", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Vice President of the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Utah", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Utah"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Utah"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Relationships", "label": "dmoz/Society/Relationships", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Advice", "label": "dmoz/Society/Advice", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Relationships", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Relationships", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 65}], "image": "https://i.insider.com/663901efb8f515beaf11cd7e?width=1200&format=jpeg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9543542", "eventUri": "eng-9543542", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "date": "-09-29", "textStart": 35, "textEnd": 47}, {"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-04-12", "textStart": 2543, "textEnd": 2551}], "sentiment": 0.411764705882353, "wgt": 223, "relevance": 1}

As individuals, we grow through experiencing different things in life that lead us to learning more about ourselves. My journey as Miss USA has been incredibly meaningful, representing Utah with pride, and later the USA at Miss Universe.

She also points out how she loved to \"shedding light\" on her roots as the first Venezuelan-American woman to win the annual American beauty pageant.\n\nShe closed the statement by saying: \"Deep down I know that this is just the beginning of a new chapter for me, and my hope is that I continue to inspire others to remain steadfast, prioritize your mental health, advocate for yourself and others by using your voice, and never be afraid of what the future holds, even if it feels uncertain.\"\n\nMoreover, part of the caption on her press statement reads: \"Never compromise your physical and mental well-being.

She is the first Miss USA in the pageant's 72-year history to voluntarily give up the crown.\n\nOn Thursday, the pageant announced Miss Hawaii Savannah Gakiewicz would replace Voigt.\n\nMiss USA revealed Gankiewicz's appointment in the caption of an Instagram photo, saying the organization was \"thrilled to announce that Miss Hawaii USA Savannah Gankiewicz is Miss USA 2023.\"\n\n\"She will be crowned in her native state of Hawaii in a celebratory coronation on Wednesday, May 15,\" the post said.\n\nGankiewicz, a model, entrepreneur, and philanthropist, was the first runner-up in the pageant in the fall.\n\nThe caption also included a quote from Miss USA's CEO and president, Laylah Rose.\n\n\"We are proud to crown Savannah Miss USA 2023. A true representation of vision, intelligence, and compassion,\" Rose said. \"Her dedication to empowering women through self-love and confidence is inspiring, and we look forward to her impactful reign as Miss USA.\"\n\nGankiewicz announced her appointment on her Instagram, thanking followers who sent her messages that \"ensured me that accepting the title is the right thing to do.\"\n\n\"Please know that my decision to accept the Miss USA crown was not one that was made lightly,\" she wrote. \"I stand with Noelia and admire her strength to step down and prioritize her mental health.\"\n\nGankiewicz also said she hopes to use her title to help Lahaina, a town on Maui that was damaged in wildfires in 2023, while she holds the crown.\n\nOn Monday, Voigt released a lengthy statement on Instagram to share her resignation, alongside a caption addressing the surprising nature of her announcement.\n\n\"I realize this may come as a large shock to many. Never compromise your physical and mental well-being,\" Voigt said in the caption. \"Our health is our wealth. A million thank you's to all of you for your constant and unwavering support. Time to write the next chapter. I hope you'll stick around to see what's next.\"\n\nFollowing Voigt's announcement, a spokesperson for Miss USA said the organization supports her decision in a statement shared with BI.\n\n\"The well-being of our titleholders is a top priority, and we understand her need to prioritize herself at this time,\" the statement said. \"The organization is currently reviewing plans for the transition of responsibilities to a successor and an announcement regarding the crowning of the new Miss USA will be coming soon.\"\n\nVoigt's resignation alone was surprising, but on Wednesday, Miss Teen USA UmaSofia Srivastava also gave up her crown.\n\nIn a statement on Instagram, Srivasta, who represented New Jersey in the Miss Teen USA pageant, said she was resigning \"after months of grappling with the decision\" because her \"personal values no longer fully align with the direction of the organization.\"\n\nFollowing Srivasta's announcement, Rose said in a statement shared with BI that her goal is \"to inspire women to always create new dreams, have the courage to explore it all, and continue to preserve integrity along the way.\"\n\nShe added: \"I hold myself to these same high standards and I take these allegations seriously. Please be assured that the well-being of all individuals associated with Miss USA is my top priority.\"\n\nVoigt and Srivasta's resignations followed that of Miss USA's social-media manager, Claudia Michelle. In an Instagram announcement about her resignation on Friday, Michelle pointed to the organization's treatment of both titleholders as a reason she quit.\n\n\"I don't believe in taking sides. I believe in telling the truth,\" she wrote in her statement. \"I believe Noelia and Uma's mental health and happiness has taken a toll and I cannot remain silent about that.\"\n\nThe mass exodus comes on the heels of a volatile year for Miss USA.\n\nContestants accused the organization of rigging the 2022 competition in Miss Texas R'Bonney Gabriel's favor. She went on to win Miss Universe in January 2023.\n\nIt was also uncovered that Max Sebrechts had quietly stepped down as vice president following allegations he sexually harassed contestants during the Miss USA 2021 pageant.

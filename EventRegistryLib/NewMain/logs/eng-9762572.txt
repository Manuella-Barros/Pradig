But the change will also help the company charge some passengers more for their tickets.\n\n\"The research is clear and indicates that 80% of Southwest customers, and 86% of potential customers, prefer an assigned seat,\" said the airline in a statement. \"By moving to an assigned seating model, Southwest expects to broaden its appeal and attract more flying from its current and future customers.\"\n\nSouthwest did not give details about when the changes will go into effect, but it said it would be discussed further in September.\n\nSouthwest's unusual boarding process started decades ago as a way for the airline to save money by reducing the amount of time it took for a plane to land, load new passengers, and take off again -- turn time, as it is called in the business.\n\n\"Moving to assigned seating and offering premium legroom options will be a transformational change that cuts across almost all aspects of the company,\" Jordan said in a news release about the changes. \"Although our unique open seating model has been a part of Southwest Airlines since our inception, our thoughtful and extensive research makes it clear this is the right choice -- at the right time -- for our customers, our people, and our shareholders. We are excited to incorporate customer and employee feedback to design a unique experience that only Southwest can deliver.\"\n\nThe airline had announced in April that it was looking at a change in its seating policy that has been in effect for its entire 50-year history. Southwest is under pressure from activist investors who have been pushing for changes in management and growth in profitability.\n\nSouthwest doesn't charge for carry on bags and has long allowed passengers to check two bags for free. The airline also doesn't charge customers to change flights.\n\nThe company made no mention in its statement about whether it will change its baggage or change fee policy. The premium seats, which will offer more legroom, will not be available until 2025 as it will require reconfiguring its planes.\n\nSouthwest used to be the most profitable US airline. But that is no longer the case.\n\nSouthwest, based in Dallas, said its second-quarter profit fell 46% from a year earlier, to $367 million, as higher costs for labor, fuel and other expenses outstripped an increase in revenue.

The moves could also generate revenue and boost financial performance.\n\nSouthwest made the announcement on the same day that both it and American Airlines reported a steep drop in second-quarter profit despite higher revenue.\n\nAirlines are struggling with higher costs and reduced pricing power, especially on flights within the United States, as the industry adds flights faster than the growth in travel demand.\n\nSouthwest, based in Dallas, said its second-quarter profit fell 46% from a year earlier, to $367 million, as higher costs for labor, fuel and other expenses outstripped an increase in revenue. The results met Wall Street expectations.\n\nAmerican Airlines also reported a 46% drop in profit, to $717 million, and said it would break even in the third quarter -- well below Wall Street expectations of 48 cents per share profit in the July-through-September period.\n\nAmerican \"did not perform to our initial expectations\" because of a since-abandoned sales strategy and an oversupply of domestic flights, CEO Robert Isom said. He said the airline was responding with a strategy that boosts profits and \"makes it easy for customers to do business with American.\"\n\nSouthwest's unusual boarding process started decades ago as a way for the airline to save money by reducing the amount of time it took for a plane to land, load new passengers, and take off again -- turn time, as it is called in the business.\n\nMost airlines assign each passenger to a seat when they buy a ticket. Southwest requires customers to check in exactly 24 hours before departure unless they pay extra to guarantee a better place in the boarding line. Those who hate it call it a \"cattle call\" but many Southwest loyalists love it.\n\nHowever, as flights have become more full it has gotten harder to score a window or aisle seat without paying extra. Also, some passengers appear to game the system: They use a wheelchair to get to the gate, where they are given priority in boarding, then miraculously walk off the plane without assistance after the flight.\n\nThe airline said in surveys 80% of its customers -- and 86% of \"potential\" customers -- want an assigned seat. It said open seating is the top reason that travelers stop flying Southwest and choose another airline.\n\nSouthwest also said it will offer redeye flights for the first time.\n\nSouthwest said that its first overnight, redeye flights will land on Feb. 14, 2025, on nonstop routes including Las Vegas to Baltimore and Orlando; Los Angeles to Baltimore and Nashville; and Phoenix to Baltimore. It plans to add more redeyes over time.\n\nThe changes in seating policy and redeye flights come as Southwest is under pressure from Elliott Investment Management. The hedge fund argues that the airline lags rivals in financial performance and has failed to change with the times. It wants to replace CEO Robert Jordan and Chairman Gary Kelly.\n\nThe airline said it will provide more details about its upcoming changes at an investor day in September.\n\nShares of all major airlines dipped before the opening bell Thursday.

Southwest said it will also introduce redeye flights.\n\nThe moves are part of the company's transformation and are intended to elevate the customer experience, improve financial performance, and drive shareholder value, Southwest said.\n\nBob Jordan, Southwest's president, CEO, and vice chairman of the board, called the move to offer assigned seating and additional legroom \"a transformational change\" that impacts almost every aspect of the airline.\n\n\"Although our unique open seating model has been a part of Southwest Airlines since our inception, our thoughtful and extensive research makes it clear this is the right choice -- at the right time -- for our customers, our people, and our shareholders,\" Jordan said in a statement.\n\nHe said that the Southwest team is excited to incorporate customer and employee feedback \"to design a unique experience that only Southwest can deliver.\"\n\nSouthwest said it continually reviews customer expectations and that during its quarterly financial results in April, it shared that it was studying product preferences and expectations, including onboard seating.\n\nAlong with meeting customer demand, Southwest said the new amenities are expected to produce additional revenue and strengthen financial performance.\n\nJordan added, \"We have been building purposefully to this change as part of a comprehensive upgrade to the Southwest experience as we focus on customer expectations -- and it will unlock new sources of revenue consistent with our laser focus on delivering improved financial performance.\"\n\nSouthwest said it will provide more details on its plan to deliver transformational commercial initiatives, improved operational efficiency, and capital allocation discipline during its Investor Day in late September.\n\nSouthwest said that after listening to customers and conducting extensive research, it decided it will assign seats and offer premium seating options on all flights.\n\nSouthwest has been known for its unique open seating model for more than 50 years, but preferences have evolved with more customers taking longer flights where a seat assignment is preferred. The airline also said it conducted \"robust operational testing\" that included live and over 8 million simulation-based boarding trials.\n\nThe airline said that the research is clear and indicates that 80% of Southwest customers, and 86% of potential customers, prefer an assigned seat. It said that when a customer elects to stop flying with Southwest and chooses a competitor, open seating is cited as the number-one reason for the change.\n\nSouthwest said that by moving to an assigned seating model, it expects to broaden its appeal and attract more flying from its current and future customers.\n\nThe carrier also said it will offer a premium, extended legroom portion of the cabin that research shows many customers strongly prefer. Specific cabin layout details are still in design, but Southwest said it expects roughly one-third of seats across the fleet to offer extended legroom, in line with that offered by industry peers on narrowbody aircraft.\n\nDuring the past two years, Southwest has enhanced its onboard offerings with improvements such as faster Wi-Fi, in-seat power, and larger overhead bins. In February, Dallas Innovates wrote about Southwest's plans to upgrade cabins with premium seats from a German manufacturer, and offer redesigned cabin interiors and conveniences, new airline employee uniforms, and even new ways to prop up your mobile phone or tablet.\n\nSouthwest said that work is underway on a refreshed cabin design, including new, more comfortable RECARO seats.\n\nSouthwest also announced it is adding 24-hour operation capabilities with the introduction of overnight, redeye flights. Booking on initial routes is available through Southwest.com, with the first overnight flights landing on Valentine's Day 2025 in five initial nonstop markets: Las Vegas to Baltimore and Orlando; Los Angeles to Baltimore and Nashville; and Phoenix to Baltimore.\n\nSouthwest said it intends to phase in more redeye flying in the carrier's coming schedules as part of its multiyear transformation to a 24-hour operation. The airline said redeye flying, along with continued reductions in turn-time through new technologies and procedures, is expected to provide incremental revenue and cost savings, enabling Southwest to fund nearly all new capacity over the next three years without incremental aircraft capital deployment.\n\nRyan Green, previously executive vice president, & chief commercial officer, will take on the new role of EVP Commercial Transformation, leading development and rollout of these and other commercial initiatives already underway. Green currently leads the work on cabin transformation.\n\nPreviously, Green directed efforts to transform Southwest Airlines' Rapid Rewards loyalty program and the digital customer experience. He reports to Jordan in his new role.\n\nGreen said that he is eager to lead this step in the airline's transformation to better serve its customers.\n\n\"In addition to meeting the evolving needs of customers and fostering more loyalty, these changes are expected to generate additional revenue as we capitalize on greater demand for Southwest Airlines and offer customers the ability to purchase premium seating options,\" Green said in a statement. \"Together, these strategic initiatives play an integral role in the airline's comprehensive strategy to meet customer needs and enhance Shareholder value, while maintaining the unique culture, hospitality, and flexibility that make Southwest Southwest.\"\n\nThe company said it will share more details about product designs, cabin layout, timing, and incremental financial value at its Investor Day in late September.\n\n\"The board fully supports these efforts to usher in a new era for Southwest Airlines, and we have the ultimate confidence in Bob and our leadership team to design and deliver an experience that is unique and true to our Southwest Legacy,\" Executive Chairman Gary Kelly said in a statement.\n\nSign up

Here are the big changes Southwest Airlines just revealed", "body": "Soon, your seat on a Southwest Airlines flight won't depend on your boarding group.\n\nSouthwest revealed major changes to its boarding policy and flight schedule on Thursday, July 25, including phasing out its longstanding open seating policy in favor of assigned and premium seating.\n\nSouthwest also plans to introduce redeye flights. One of its first redeye flights will be from Phoenix.\n\nThe move comes as Southwest, which operates the second-largest flight capacity at Phoenix Sky Harbor International Airport, is working to improve its profitability and the flying experience. In April, Southwest CEO Bob Jordan told investors in an earnings call that his staff was looking into whether ending open seating would satisfy customers' preferences.\n\nHere's what to know about the end of open seating on Southwest Airlines and what other changes may be coming.\n\nIs Southwest Airlines doing away with open seating?\n\nYes. Southwest will begin assigned seating on all flights in 2025.\n\nIn addition, Southwest will create a premium cabin section with extended-legroom seats. This premium section will encompass about one-third of the available seats.\n\nThe changes won't occur right away because the new cabin layouts require approval from the Federal Aviation Administration, according to Southwest's announcement.\n\nSouthwest will reveal more details about how assigned and premium seats will work and what the cabin layouts will look like during the airline's Investor Day in late September.\n\nWhen reached for comment by The Arizona Republic, Southwest did not say what the premium-seat legroom will be and whether standard legroom would change from the 32-inch average seat pitch in the current cabins.\n\nWhy is Southwest ending open seating?\n\nIt has to do with both customer preference and the airline's profitability.\n\nSouthwest said it conducted extensive research on passengers' seating preferences and found that 80% of its customers and 86% of potential customers prefer seat assignments. Customers cited the airline's open seating policy as the No. 1 reason why they chose to fly with a competing airline.\n\n\"We have been building purposefully to this change as part of a comprehensive upgrade to the Southwest experience as we focus on customer expectations - and it will unlock new sources of revenue consistent with our laser focus on delivering improved financial performance,\" Jordan said in the airline's announcement.\n\nSouthwest is working to improve its financial position. The airline reported a net loss of $231 million in the first three months of 2024.\n\nThe airline brought in $7.4 billion in operating revenues from April to June 2024, but the $367 million it took in in profits was more than 46% less than its profit during the same period in 2023, according to its second-quarter 2024 financial report.\n\nAirline staff also expect its non-fuel operating costs, which include employees' salaries and aircraft maintenance, will increase around 11% to 13% in the next three months.\n\nWhat is open seating on Southwest Airlines?\n\nOn a flight with open seating, passengers don't have assigned seats.\n\nWhere they sit largely depends on their place in the boarding queue: Those boarding in Group A get the best choice of seats. After Group B, those who board in Group C usually are limited to middle seats and little to no overhead space for carry-ons.\n\nSouthwest's open seating policy was introduced with the airline's founding in 1971. Back then, the seating was first come, first served. The boarding groups began after a 2006 experiment with assigned seating revealed customers' frustrations with the first come, first served approach.\n\nDoes Southwest do redeyes?\n\nBesides ending open seating, Southwest announced Thursday that it would begin offering redeye flights that leave at night and arrive the next morning.\n\nSouthwest's first redeyes include a nonstop Phoenix-Baltimore flight, which will begin flying on Feb. 13, 2025. The flight leaves Sky Harbor at 11:05 p.m. Arizona time and arrives in Baltimore at 5:10 p.m. Eastern time. We found fares from $236 one way, comparable to or slightly cheaper than other Southwest fares between the two cities.\n\nSouthwest will introduce four other redeye routes in February 2025 -- Las Vegas-Baltimore, Las Vegas-Orlando, Los Angeles-Baltimore and Los Angeles-Nashville -- with more possible in the future.\n\nWill Southwest change its Bags Fly Free policy?\n\nSome travel industry analysts, such as Steve and Paul Glenn of the Nebraska-based travel management company Executive Travel, speculate that Southwest will eventually change its checked bag policy.\n\nRight now, the airline allows each passenger to check their first two bags for free -- a sharp contrast from competitors such as American Airlines, which recently changed its baggage policy to charge $40 for the first checked bag.\n\nThe Glenns forecasted in a June podcast that Southwest would reduce that to one free checked bag if its profitability doesn't improve.\n\nWhen asked by The Republic if Southwest would change its baggage policy, a Southwest spokesperson said, \"No additional changes forthcoming at this time.\"", "source": {"uri": "azcentral.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "AZ Central"},

According to the airline, Southwest conducted research, and 8 million simulation-based boarding trials.\n\n\"Moving to assigned seating and offering premium legroom options will be a transformational change that cuts across almost all aspects of the company,\" said Bob Jordan, CEO of Southwest in a release. \"Although our unique open seating model has been a part of Southwest Airlines since our inception, our thoughtful and extensive research makes it clear this is the right choice -- at the right time -- for our customers, our people, and our shareholders.\"\n\nSouthwest's research found 80% of its customers and 86% of potential customers prefer an assigned seat. When customers choose a different airline, the open seating policy is the No. 1 reason cited for the change, Southwest reported.\n\nThe airline will also add premium, extended legroom to the cabin. Details of how the aircrafts' cabins will change are still in the design phase, but Southwest expects roughly one-third of seats across the fleet to offer extended legroom, the same as its narrowbody aircraft competitors.\n\nJordan also said financial results for the second quarter were \"impacted by both external and internal factors.\" Southwest had previously lowered its financial expectations for the quarter and reported a $7.4 billion operating revenue for the quarter, a 4.5% increase from the previous year. Unit revenue was slightly better than the company's previous expectation of up to 4.5% for the quarter, which Southwest attributed to the final days of June and \"the resulting benefit from incremental bookings from other carrier cancellations.\"\n\nSouthwest also announced the addition of red-eye flights. The flights will begin on Valentine's Day 2025 in five initial nonstop markets: Las Vegas to Baltimore and Orlando; Los Angeles to Baltimore and Nashville; and Phoenix to Baltimore.\n\nOvernight flights at Southwest were rumored to begin in the next few years, but were rolled out ahead of expectations from leaders. Southwest will phase in additional redeye flying in its upcoming schedules as part of its \"multi-year transformation to a 24-hour operation,\" the airline reported. It expects to provide incremental revenue and cost savings.\n\nThe changes come as activist investor Elliott Investment Management has called on Southwest to make dramatic alterations to the airline's business model to generate a return for shareholders. Elliott has disclosed a $1.9 billion stake in the air carrier.", "source": {"uri": "finance.yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo!

The moves could also generate revenue and boost financial performance.\n\nSouthwest made the announcement on the same day that both it and American Airlines reported a steep drop in second-quarter profit despite higher revenue.\n\nAirlines are struggling with higher costs and reduced pricing power, especially on flights within the United States, as the industry adds flights faster than the growth in travel demand.\n\nSouthwest, based in Dallas, said its second-quarter profit fell 46% from a year earlier, to $367 million, as higher costs for labor, fuel and other expenses outstripped an increase in revenue. The results met Wall Street expectations.\n\nAmerican Airlines also reported a 46% drop in profit, to $717 million, and said it would break even in the third quarter -- well below Wall Street expectations of 48 cents per share profit in the July-through-September period.\n\nAmerican \"did not perform to our initial expectations\" because of a since-abandoned sales strategy and an oversupply of domestic flights, CEO Robert Isom said. He said the airline was responding with a strategy that boosts profits and \"makes it easy for customers to do business with American.\"\n\nSouthwest's unusual boarding process started decades ago as a way for the airline to save money by reducing the amount of time it took for a plane to land, load new passengers, and take off again -- turn time, as it is called in the business.\n\nMost airlines assign each passenger to a seat when they buy a ticket. Southwest requires customers to check in exactly 24 hours before departure unless they pay extra to guarantee a better place in the boarding line. Those who hate it call it a \"cattle call\" but many Southwest loyalists love it.\n\nHowever, as flights have become more full it has gotten harder to score a window or aisle seat without paying extra. Also, some passengers appear to game the system: They use a wheelchair to get to the gate, where they are given priority in boarding, then miraculously walk off the plane without assistance after the flight.\n\nThe airline said in surveys 80% of its customers -- and 86% of \"potential\" customers -- want an assigned seat. It said open seating is the top reason that travelers stop flying Southwest and choose another airline.\n\nSouthwest also said it will offer redeye flights for the first time.\n\nSouthwest said that its first overnight, redeye flights will land on Feb. 14, 2025, on nonstop routes including Las Vegas to Baltimore and Orlando; Los Angeles to Baltimore and Nashville; and Phoenix to Baltimore. It plans to add more redeyes over time.\n\nThe changes in seating policy and redeye flights come as Southwest is under pressure from Elliott Investment Management. The hedge fund argues that the airline lags rivals in financial performance and has failed to change with the times. It wants to replace CEO Robert Jordan and Chairman Gary Kelly.\n\nThe airline said it will provide more details about its upcoming changes at an investor day in September.\n\nShares of all major airlines dipped before the opening bell Thursday. Southwest Airlines Co. fell 6% and American Airlines Group Inc. fell 7%. Delta, JetBlue and United slipped more than 1%.\n\nCopyright 2024 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.

The airline also plans to start overnight flights, starting in February.\n\nSouthwest executives have said for years that they were studying such changes and hinted in April that it was seriously considering assigning seats and offering pricier seats with more legroom. The airline currently puts customers in one of three boarding groups and assigns a number, setting off a mad dash to check in a day before the flight. Customers can get earlier boarding though if they pay for a higher-priced ticket, they'll get a better boarding slot.\n\nWhen travelers choose a competitor over Southwest, the airline found in its research that its open seating model was the No. 1 reason for that choice, the carrier said in a release that outlined the changes. It also said 80% of its own customers prefer an assigned seat.\n\n\"Although our unique open seating model has been a part of Southwest Airlines since our inception, our thoughtful and extensive research makes it clear this is the right choice -- at the right time -- for our Customers, our People, and our Shareholders,\" CEO Bob Jordan said in a news release Thursday.\n\nThe airline is under even more pressure now to segment its product like other airlines after activist investor Elliott Investment Management disclosed in June a nearly $2 billion stake in the airline and called for new leadership as the airline underperformed competitors.\n\n\"We will adapt as our customers' needs adapt,\" Jordan said at an industry event last month.\n\nSouthwest said it expects about a third of the seats on its Boeing 737s will offer \"extended legroom, in line with that offered by industry peers on narrowbody aircraft.\" The Federal Aviation Administration would need to approve the cabin layouts, the airline added.\n\nThe Dallas-based airline had prided itself and raked in steady profits for most of its more than five decades of flying on its simple business model. Jordan said last month that not assigning seats was easier to offer when planes weren't so full.\n\nAnalysts criticized Southwest for moving too slowly. Rival carriers offer a host of options to upsell customers like extra legroom seats, premium economy or business class. Other airlines, however, like Delta, United and American, four years ago took a cue from Southwest and ended flight-change fees for most tickets.\n\nSouthwest will provide more details about the upcoming changes at an investor day at the end of September.", "source": {"uri": "nbcboston.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "NBC Boston"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Airline", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Airline"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Southwest_Airlines", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Southwest Airlines"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Business_model", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Business model"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Airplane", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Airplane"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chief_executive_officer", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Chief executive officer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jordan", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Jordan"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Jordan"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elliott_Investment_Management", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Elliott Investment Management"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Premium_economy_class", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Premium economy class"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Narrow-body_aircraft", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Narrow-body aircraft"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Delta_Air_Lines", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Delta Air Lines"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Business_class", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Business class"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boeing_737", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Boeing 737"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Aviation_Administration", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Federal Aviation Administration"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Transportation", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Transportation", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Travel/Transportation", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Travel/Transportation", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Aviation/Multimedia", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Aviation/Multimedia", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 83}], "image": "https://media.nbcboston.com/2024/04/107405249-17138953192024-02-08t232023z_123676527_rc2ly5atu2sj_rtrmadp_0_southwest-results_531dc4.jpeg?quality=85&strip=all&resize=1200%2C675", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9762572", "eventUri": "eng-9762572", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.05098039215686279, "wgt": 215, "relevance": 1}

Southwest, far and away the dominant carrier at Baltimore/Washington International Thurgood Marshall Airport, discovered that preferences have changed over the years and the vast majority of travelers now want to know where they are sitting before they get to the airport.\n\nSouthwest's unusual boarding process started as a fast way to load passengers and limit the time that planes and crews spend sitting idly on the ground, not making money. It helped the airline operate more efficiently and even squeeze a few more flights into the daily schedule.\n\nIt was one reason that Southwest alone among U.S. airlines remained profitable every year until the coronavirus pandemic.\n\nHere's how it works: Instead of being assigned a seat when they buy a ticket, Southwest customers check in exactly 24 hours before departure to secure their spots in boarding lines. In the beginning, the first 30 to check in were put in the coveted \"A\" boarding group, guaranteeing them a window or aisle seat. Dawdlers landed in \"B,\" which was still OK, or \"C,\" which would often result in a middle seat.\n\nThe system became less democratic over time as Southwest let people pay extra to guarantee a spot near the front of the line. Despite that, many Southwest loyalists still love open seating. The airline thinks they will adapt.\n\n\"I know there are going to be customers who say, 'I want to stay with open seating.' It's a minority,\" Southwest CEO Robert Jordan told CNBC, \"but we had the same thing when we switched from plastic boarding passes. We had the same thing when we took peanuts out of the cabin. I'm convinced we can win them over.\"\n\nThe airline said surveys showed that 80% of its customers -- and 86% of \"potential\" customers -- want an assigned seat. Jordan said open seating was the top reason that travelers cited for choosing another airline over Southwest.\n\nIn addition to the seating switch, Southwest also plans to sell premium seating with more legroom - matching a practice that is standard among other large U.S. carriers - and to offer redeye flights for the first time.\n\nSouthwest said redeyes will start flying in mid-February on nonstop routes including Las Vegas to Baltimore and Orlando; Los Angeles to Baltimore and Nashville; and Phoenix to Baltimore, with more routes added over time.\n\nThe changes come as Southwest is under pressure from Elliott Investment Management. The hedge fund argues that the airline lags rivals in financial performance and has failed to change with the times. It wants to replace Jordan and Chairman Gary Kelly.\n\nSouthwest also faces increased scrutiny from the Federal Aviation Administration after a series of worrisome flights, including one that dove within 400 feet of the ocean off Hawaii, two that flew at extremely low altitudes while still miles from landing at airports in Oklahoma and Florida, and another that was discovered to have rudder-area damage after an unusual \"Dutch roll\" wiggle during a flight.\n\nSouthwest announced the seating move and other changes on the same day that both it and American Airlines reported a steep drop in second-quarter profit despite higher revenue.\n\nAirlines are struggling with higher costs and reduced pricing power, especially on flights within the United States, as the industry adds flights faster than the growth in travel demand.\n\nSouthwest, based in Dallas, said its second-quarter profit fell 46% from a year earlier, to $367 million, as higher costs for labor, fuel and other expenses outstripped an increase in revenue.

Here are the big changes Southwest Airlines just revealed", "body": "Soon, your seat on a Southwest Airlines flight won't depend on your boarding group.\n\nSouthwest revealed major changes to its boarding policy and flight schedule on Thursday, July 25, including phasing out its longstanding open seating policy in favor of assigned and premium seating.\n\nSouthwest also plans to introduce redeye flights. One of its first redeye flights will be from Phoenix.\n\nThe move comes as Southwest, which operates the second-largest flight capacity at Phoenix Sky Harbor International Airport, is working to improve its profitability and the flying experience. In April, Southwest CEO Bob Jordan told investors in an earnings call that his staff was looking into whether ending open seating would satisfy customers' preferences.\n\nHere's what to know about the end of open seating on Southwest Airlines and what other changes may be coming.\n\nIs Southwest Airlines doing away with open seating?\n\nYes. Southwest will begin assigned seating on all flights in 2025.\n\nIn addition, Southwest will create a premium cabin section with extended-legroom seats. This premium section will encompass about one-third of the available seats.\n\nThe changes won't occur right away because the new cabin layouts require approval from the Federal Aviation Administration, according to Southwest's announcement.\n\nSouthwest will reveal more details about how assigned and premium seats will work and what the cabin layouts will look like during the airline's Investor Day in late September.\n\nWhen reached for comment by The Arizona Republic, Southwest did not say what the premium-seat legroom will be and whether standard legroom would change from the 32-inch average seat pitch in the current cabins.\n\nWhy is Southwest ending open seating?\n\nIt has to do with both customer preference and the airline's profitability.\n\nSouthwest said it conducted extensive research on passengers' seating preferences and found that 80% of its customers and 86% of potential customers prefer seat assignments. Customers cited the airline's open seating policy as the No. 1 reason why they chose to fly with a competing airline.\n\n\"We have been building purposefully to this change as part of a comprehensive upgrade to the Southwest experience as we focus on customer expectations - and it will unlock new sources of revenue consistent with our laser focus on delivering improved financial performance,\" Jordan said in the airline's announcement.\n\nSouthwest is working to improve its financial position. The airline reported a net loss of $231 million in the first three months of 2024.\n\nThe airline brought in $7.4 billion in operating revenues from April to June 2024, but the $367 million it took in in profits was more than 46% less than its profit during the same period in 2023, according to its second-quarter 2024 financial report.\n\nAirline staff also expect its non-fuel operating costs, which include employees' salaries and aircraft maintenance, will increase around 11% to 13% in the next three months.\n\nWhat is open seating on Southwest Airlines?\n\nOn a flight with open seating, passengers don't have assigned seats.\n\nWhere they sit largely depends on their place in the boarding queue: Those boarding in Group A get the best choice of seats. After Group B, those who board in Group C usually are limited to middle seats and little to no overhead space for carry-ons.\n\nSouthwest's open seating policy was introduced with the airline's founding in 1971. Back then, the seating was first come, first served. The boarding groups began after a 2006 experiment with assigned seating revealed customers' frustrations with the first come, first served approach.\n\nDoes Southwest do redeyes?\n\nBesides ending open seating, Southwest announced Thursday that it would begin offering redeye flights that leave at night and arrive the next morning.\n\nSouthwest's first redeyes include a nonstop Phoenix-Baltimore flight, which will begin flying on Feb. 13, 2025. The flight leaves Sky Harbor at 11:05 p.m. Arizona time and arrives in Baltimore at 5:10 p.m. Eastern time. We found fares from $236 one way, comparable to or slightly cheaper than other Southwest fares between the two cities.\n\nSouthwest will introduce four other redeye routes in February 2025 -- Las Vegas-Baltimore, Las Vegas-Orlando, Los Angeles-Baltimore and Los Angeles-Nashville -- with more possible in the future.\n\nWill Southwest change its Bags Fly Free policy?\n\nSome travel industry analysts, such as Steve and Paul Glenn of the Nebraska-based travel management company Executive Travel, speculate that Southwest will eventually change its checked bag policy.\n\nRight now, the airline allows each passenger to check their first two bags for free -- a sharp contrast from competitors such as American Airlines, which recently changed its baggage policy to charge $40 for the first checked bag.\n\nThe Glenns forecasted in a June podcast that Southwest would reduce that to one free checked bag if its profitability doesn't improve.\n\nWhen asked by The Republic if Southwest would change its baggage policy, a Southwest spokesperson said, \"No additional changes forthcoming at this time.\"\n\nMichael Salerno is an award-winning journalist who's covered travel and tourism since 2014.

According to the airline, Southwest conducted research and 8 million simulation-based boarding trials. The announcement came ahead of Southwest's earnings call planned for 11:30 a.m. CT on Thursday. More details are expected then and during the company's investor day in late September.\n\n\"Moving to assigned seating and offering premium legroom options will be a transformational change that cuts across almost all aspects of the company,\" said Bob Jordan, CEO of Southwest in a release. \"Although our unique open seating model has been a part of Southwest Airlines since our inception, our thoughtful and extensive research makes it clear this is the right choice -- at the right time -- for our customers, our people, and our shareholders.\"\n\nSouthwest's research found 80% of its customers and 86% of potential customers, prefer an assigned seat. When customers choose a different airline, the open seating policy is the No. 1 reason cited for the change, Southwest reported.\n\nThe airline will also add premium, extended legroom to the cabin. Details of how the aircrafts' cabins will change are still in the design phase, but Southwest expects roughly one-third of seats across the fleet to offer extended legroom, the same as its narrowbody aircraft competitors.\n\nFeatured Local Savings\n\nJordan also said financial results for the second quarter were \"impacted by both external and internal factors.\" Southwest had previously lowered its financial expectations for the quarter and reported a $7.4 billion operating revenue for the quarter, a 4.5% increase from the previous year. Unit revenue was slightly better than the company's previous expectation of up to 4.5% for the quarter, which Southwest attributed to the final days of June and \"the resulting benefit from incremental bookings from other carrier cancellations.\"\n\nSouthwest also announced the addition of red-eye flights. The flights will begin on Valentine's Day 2025 in five initial nonstop markets: Las Vegas to Baltimore and Orlando; Los Angeles to Baltimore and Nashville; and Phoenix to Baltimore.\n\nOvernight flights at Southwest were rumored to begin in the next few years, but were rolled out ahead of expectations from leaders. Southwest will phase in additional redeye flying in its upcoming schedules as part of its \"multi-year transformation to a 24-hour operation,\" the airline reported. It expects to provide incremental revenue and cost savings.\n\nThe changes come as activist investor Elliott Investment Management has called on Southwest to make dramatic alterations to the airline's business model to generate a return for shareholders. Elliott has disclosed a $1.9 billion stake in the air carrier.\n\n\u00a92024 The Dallas Morning News.

Southwest Airlines said Thursday that it plans to drop the open-boarding system it has used for more than 50 years and will start assigning passengers to seats, just like all the other big airlines.\n\nDALLAS (AP) -- Goodbye, cattle call.\n\nSouthwest Airlines said Thursday that it plans to drop the open-boarding system it has used for more than 50 years and will start assigning passengers to seats, just like all the other big airlines.\n\nThe airline said it has been studying seating options, running tests and surveying customers. Southwest discovered that preferences have changed over the years and the vast majority of travelers now want to know where they are sitting before they get to the airport.\n\nSouthwest's unusual boarding process started as a fast way to load passengers and limit the time that planes and crews spend sitting idly on the ground, not making money. It helped the airline operate more efficiently and even squeeze a few more flights into the daily schedule.\n\nIt was one reason that Southwest alone among U.S. airlines remained profitable every year until the coronavirus pandemic.\n\nHere's how it works: Instead of being assigned a seat when they buy a ticket, Southwest customers check in exactly 24 hours before departure to secure their spots in boarding lines. In the beginning, the first 30 to check in were put in the coveted \"A\" boarding group, guaranteeing them a window or aisle seat. Dawdlers landed in \"B,\" which was still OK, or \"C,\" which would often result in a middle seat.\n\nThe system became less democratic over time as Southwest let people pay extra to guarantee a spot near the front of the line. Despite that, many Southwest loyalists still love open seating. The airline thinks they will adapt.\n\n\"I know there are going to be customers who say, 'I want to stay with open seating.' It's a minority,\" Southwest CEO Robert Jordan told CNBC, \"but we had the same thing when we switched from plastic boarding passes. We had the same thing when we took peanuts out of the cabin. I'm convinced we can win them over.\"\n\nThe airline said surveys showed that 80% of its customers -- and 86% of \"potential\" customers -- want an assigned seat. Jordan said open seating was the top reason that travelers cited for choosing another airline over Southwest.\n\nIn addition to the seating switch, Southwest also plans to sell premium seating with more legroom - matching a practice that is standard among other large U.S. carriers - and to offer redeye flights for the first time.\n\nSouthwest said redeyes will start flying in mid-February on nonstop routes including Las Vegas to Baltimore and Orlando; Los Angeles to Baltimore and Nashville; and Phoenix to Baltimore, with more routes added over time.\n\nThe changes come as Southwest is under pressure from Elliott Investment Management. The hedge fund argues that the airline lags rivals in financial performance and has failed to change with the times. It wants to replace Jordan and Chairman Gary Kelly.\n\nSouthwest also faces increased scrutiny from the Federal Aviation Administration after a series of worrisome flights, including one that dove within 400 feet of the ocean off Hawaii, two that flew at extremely low altitudes while still miles from landing at airports in Oklahoma and Florida, and another that was discovered to have rudder-area damage after an unusual \"Dutch roll\" wiggle during a flight.\n\nSouthwest announced the seating move and other changes on the same day that both it and American Airlines reported a steep drop in second-quarter profit despite higher revenue.\n\nAirlines are struggling with higher costs and reduced pricing power, especially on flights within the United States, as the industry adds flights faster than the growth in travel demand.\n\nSouthwest, based in Dallas, said its second-quarter profit fell 46% from a year earlier, to $367 million, as higher costs for labor, fuel and other expenses outstripped an increase in revenue. The results met Wall Street expectations.\n\nAmerican Airlines also reported a 46% drop in profit, to $717 million, and said it would break even in the third quarter -- well below Wall Street expectations of 48 cents per share profit in the July-through-September period.\n\nAmerican \"did not perform to our initial expectations\" because of a since-abandoned sales strategy and an oversupply of domestic flights, CEO Robert Isom said. He said the airline was responding with a strategy that boosts profits and \"makes it easy for customers to do business with American.\"\n\nAmerican cut its forecast of full-year earnings to between 70 cents and $1.30 per share, down from a previous prediction of $2.25 to $3.25 per share.\n\nShares of the leading U.S. airlines rose after the opening bell Thursday. Southwest Airlines Co. gained 3% and American Airlines Group Inc., based in Fort Worth, Texas, rose 5% in late-morning trading. Delta, United, Alaska and JetBlue also gained.", "source": {"uri": "register-herald.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Beckley Register-Herald"}, "authors": [{"uri":

In the beginning, the first 30 to check in were put in the coveted \"A\" boarding group, guaranteeing them a window or aisle seat. Dawdlers landed in \"B,\" which was still OK, or \"C,\" which would often result in a middle seat.\n\nThe system became less democratic over time as Southwest let people pay extra to guarantee a spot near the front of the line. Despite that, many Southwest loyalists still love open seating. The airline thinks they will adapt.\n\n\"I know there are going to be customers who say, 'I want to stay with open seating.' It's a minority,\" Southwest CEO Robert Jordan told CNBC, \"but we had the same thing when we switched from plastic boarding passes. We had the same thing when we took peanuts out of the cabin. I'm convinced we can win them over.\"\n\nThe airline said surveys showed that 80% of its customers -- and 86% of \"potential\" customers -- want an assigned seat. Jordan said open seating was the top reason that travelers cited for choosing another airline over Southwest.\n\nIn addition to the seating switch, Southwest also plans to sell premium seating with more legroom - matching a practice that is standard among other large U.S. carriers - and to offer redeye flights for the first time.\n\nSouthwest said redeyes will start flying in mid-February on nonstop routes including Las Vegas to Baltimore and Orlando; Los Angeles to Baltimore and Nashville; and Phoenix to Baltimore, with more routes added over time.\n\nThe changes come as Southwest is under pressure from Elliott Investment Management. The hedge fund argues that the airline lags rivals in financial performance and has failed to change with the times. It wants to replace Jordan and Chairman Gary Kelly.\n\nSouthwest also faces increased scrutiny from the Federal Aviation Administration after a series of worrisome flights, including one that dove within 400 feet of the ocean off Hawaii, two that flew at extremely low altitudes while still miles from landing at airports in Oklahoma and Florida, and another that was discovered to have rudder-area damage after an unusual \"Dutch roll\" wiggle during a flight.\n\nSouthwest announced the seating move and other changes on the same day that both it and American Airlines reported a steep drop in second-quarter profit despite higher revenue.\n\nAirlines are struggling with higher costs and reduced pricing power, especially on flights within the United States, as the industry adds flights faster than the growth in travel demand.\n\nSouthwest, based in Dallas, said its second-quarter profit fell 46% from a year earlier, to $367 million, as higher costs for labor, fuel and other expenses outstripped an increase in revenue. The results met Wall Street expectations.\n\nAmerican Airlines also reported a 46% drop in profit, to $717 million, and said it would break even in the third quarter -- well below Wall Street expectations of 48 cents per share profit in the July-through-September period.\n\nAmerican \"did not perform to our initial expectations\" because of a since-abandoned sales strategy and an oversupply of domestic flights, CEO Robert Isom said. He said the airline was responding with a strategy that boosts profits and \"makes it easy for customers to do business with American.\"\n\nAmerican cut its forecast of full-year earnings to between 70 cents and $1.30 per share, down from a previous prediction of $2.25 to $3.25 per share.\n\nShares of the leading U.S. airlines rose after the opening bell Thursday.

(Scripps News)\n\nSouthwest Airlines plans to drop its tradition of more than 50 years and start assigning seats and selling premium seating for customers who want more legroom.\n\nThe airline said Thursday that it has been studying seating options and is making the changes because passenger preferences have shifted. The moves could also generate revenue and boost financial performance.\n\nSouthwest made the announcement on the same day that both it and American Airlines reported a steep drop in second-quarter profit despite higher revenue.\n\nAirlines are struggling with higher costs and reduced pricing power, especially on flights within the United States, as the industry adds flights faster than the growth in travel demand.\n\nPeople are also reading...\n\nSouthwest, based in Dallas, said its second-quarter profit fell 46% from a year earlier, to $367 million, as higher costs for labor, fuel and other expenses outstripped an increase in revenue. The results met Wall Street expectations.\n\nAmerican Airlines also reported a 46% drop in profit, to $717 million, and said it would break even in the third quarter -- well below Wall Street expectations of 48 cents per share profit in the July-through-September period.\n\nAmerican \"did not perform to our initial expectations\" because of a since-abandoned sales strategy and an oversupply of domestic flights, CEO Robert Isom said. He said the airline was responding with a strategy that boosts profits and \"makes it easy for customers to do business with American.\"\n\nSouthwest's unusual boarding process started decades ago as a way for the airline to save money by reducing the amount of time it took for a plane to land, load new passengers, and take off again -- turn time, as it is called in the business.\n\nMost airlines assign each passenger to a seat when they buy a ticket. Southwest requires customers to check in exactly 24 hours before departure unless they pay extra to guarantee a better place in the boarding line. Those who hate it call it a \"cattle call\" but many Southwest loyalists love it.\n\nHowever, as flights have become more full it has gotten harder to score a window or aisle seat without paying extra. Also, some passengers appear to game the system: They use a wheelchair to get to the gate, where they are given priority in boarding, then miraculously walk off the plane without assistance after the flight.\n\nThe airline said in surveys 80% of its customers -- and 86% of \"potential\" customers -- want an assigned seat. It said open seating is the top reason that travelers stop flying Southwest and choose another airline.\n\nSouthwest also said it will offer redeye flights for the first time.\n\nSouthwest said that its first overnight, redeye flights will land on Feb. 14, 2025, on nonstop routes including Las Vegas to Baltimore and Orlando; Los Angeles to Baltimore and Nashville; and Phoenix to Baltimore. It plans to add more redeyes over time.\n\nThe changes in seating policy and redeye flights come as Southwest is under pressure from Elliott Investment Management. The hedge fund argues that the airline lags rivals in financial performance and has failed to change with the times. It wants to replace CEO Robert Jordan and Chairman Gary Kelly.\n\nThe airline said it will provide more details about its upcoming changes at an investor day in September.\n\nShares of all major airlines dipped before the opening bell Thursday. Southwest Airlines Co. fell 6% and American Airlines Group Inc. fell 7%. Delta, JetBlue and United slipped more than 1%.\n\nAirfares are down, but baggage fees are up Low-cost airlines are reshaping how we pay for flights The rise of low-cost carriers How to navigate low-cost carrier fees\n\nCopyright 2024 The Associated Press.

The moves could also generate revenue and boost financial performance.\n\nSouthwest made the announcement on the same day that both it and American Airlines reported a steep drop in second-quarter profit despite higher revenue.\n\nAirlines are struggling with higher costs and reduced pricing power, especially on flights within the United States, as the industry adds flights faster than the growth in travel demand.\n\nSouthwest, based in Dallas, said its second-quarter profit fell 46% from a year earlier, to $367 million, as higher costs for labor, fuel and other expenses outstripped an increase in revenue. The results met Wall Street expectations.\n\nAmerican Airlines also reported a 46% drop in profit, to $717 million, and said it would break even in the third quarter -- well below Wall Street expectations of 48 cents per share profit in the July-through-September period.\n\nAmerican \"did not perform to our initial expectations\" because of a since-abandoned sales strategy and an oversupply of domestic flights, CEO Robert Isom said. He said the airline was responding with a strategy that boosts profits and \"makes it easy for customers to do business with American.\"\n\nSouthwest's unusual boarding process started decades ago as a way for the airline to save money by reducing the amount of time it took for a plane to land, load new passengers, and take off again -- turn time, as it is called in the business.\n\nMost airlines assign each passenger to a seat when they buy a ticket. Southwest requires customers to check in exactly 24 hours before departure unless they pay extra to guarantee a better place in the boarding line. Those who hate it call it a \"cattle call\" but many Southwest loyalists love it.\n\nHowever, as flights have become more full it has gotten harder to score a window or aisle seat without paying extra. Also, some passengers appear to game the system: They use a wheelchair to get to the gate, where they are given priority in boarding, then miraculously walk off the plane without assistance after the flight.\n\nThe airline said in surveys 80% of its customers -- and 86% of \"potential\" customers -- want an assigned seat. It said open seating is the top reason that travelers stop flying Southwest and choose another airline.\n\nSouthwest also said it will offer redeye flights for the first time.\n\nSouthwest said that its first overnight, redeye flights will land on Feb. 14, 2025, on nonstop routes including Las Vegas to Baltimore and Orlando; Los Angeles to Baltimore and Nashville; and Phoenix to Baltimore. It plans to add more redeyes over time.\n\nThe changes in seating policy and redeye flights come as Southwest is under pressure from Elliott Investment Management. The hedge fund argues that the airline lags rivals in financial performance and has failed to change with the times. It wants to replace CEO Robert Jordan and Chairman Gary Kelly.\n\nThe airline said it will provide more details about its upcoming changes at an investor day in September.\n\nShares of all major airlines dipped before the opening bell Thursday. Southwest Airlines Co. fell 6% and American Airlines Group Inc. fell 7%. Delta, JetBlue and United slipped more than 1%.\n\nMore from this section\n\nPromoting the Value of Drug-Free Living at the UEFA Championship Games\n\nOptimal Blue Launches New Generative AI Assistant

Southwest discovered that preferences have changed over the years and the vast majority of travelers now want to know where they are sitting before they get to the airport.\n\nSouthwest's unusual boarding process started as a fast way to load passengers and limit the time that planes and crews spend sitting idly on the ground, not making money. It helped the airline operate more efficiently and even squeeze a few more flights into the daily schedule.\n\nIt was one reason that Southwest alone among U.S. airlines remained profitable every year until the coronavirus pandemic.\n\nHere's how it works: Instead of being assigned a seat when they buy a ticket, Southwest customers check in exactly 24 hours before departure to secure their spots in boarding lines. In the beginning, the first 30 to check in were put in the coveted \"A\" boarding group, guaranteeing them a window or aisle seat. Dawdlers landed in \"B,\" which was still OK, or \"C,\" which would often result in a middle seat.\n\nThe system became less democratic over time as Southwest let people pay extra to guarantee a spot near the front of the line. Despite that, many Southwest loyalists still love open seating. The airline thinks they will adapt.\n\n\"I know there are going to be customers who say, 'I want to stay with open seating.' It's a minority,\" Southwest CEO Robert Jordan told CNBC, \"but we had the same thing when we switched from plastic boarding passes. We had the same thing when we took peanuts out of the cabin. I'm convinced we can win them over.\"\n\nThe airline said surveys showed that 80% of its customers -- and 86% of \"potential\" customers -- want an assigned seat. Jordan said open seating was the top reason that travelers cited for choosing another airline over Southwest.\n\nSome Southwest passengers reacted with sadness and disappointment to news that open seating is going away.\n\n\"Hearing that announcement today, I was like, no, this is my favorite part of Southwest,\" said Lindsey Magness, who works in college athletics in Oklahoma City.\n\nMagness said that with open seating, she can try for a window seat or, depending on her mood, an aisle. And assigned seating doesn't always work either. Magness said American Airlines seated her away from her husband on their honeymoon trip earlier this summer\n\nBrandon Bowser of Odenton, Maryland, said he flies on different airlines based on which one has the best deal, but he has found Southwest's open boarding to be faster and less complicated than other airlines.\n\n\"The convenience that comes with being able to pick your own seat is what sets Southwest apart and makes them sort of a preferred airline,\" he said. \"A lot of my friends swear by Southwest, that's all they will fly, and they are completely irate about this decision.\"\n\nAt Chicago's O'Hare Airport, Kimberly King was happy to learn of the change. She was at a check-in kiosk with her four children for a flight home to California.\n\n\"I used to fly United a lot and I liked the assigned seats, especially with kids, kind of expecting and knowing where we were going to be,\" King said. \"The only reason really why I continue to fly Southwest is for the free bags.\"\n\nSouthwest still lets passengers check two bags for free. It's been a centerpiece of the airline's advertising campaigns for years. CEO Jordan said Southwest has no plans to end bags-fly-free \"at this point.\"\n\nThere are drawbacks to Southwest boarding. It's hard to get a good spot in line without paying an extra fee. Southwest executives said 60% of passengers check in the first 30 seconds. Those who miss the rush fear there won't be room in the overhead bins for their carry-on bag. Late boarders can struggle to see an open seat anywhere, and start roaming up and down the aisle -- Southwest calls them \"spinners.\"\n\nThere are a number of tricks that passengers use to game the system.\n\nSome take advantage of early boarding for people who need extra time. Others ignore the age limit (6 or under) for children in families that are allowed to board right after the \"A\" group. Once on the plane, some passengers hold choice seats for mates who are far behind them in line.\n\nPhotos appear occasionally on social media of an unusually large number of people in wheelchairs at Southwest gates. They get to board early.\n\n\"It's certainly one of the things that anger people even if it doesn't have a material impact on them,\" said Brett Snyder, a travel agent and author of the Cranky Flier blog. \"In some cases those are people who have absolutely legitimate reasons. In other cases, it's the 'Jetway Jesus' phenomenon.\"\n\nThat's a reference to recoveries so miraculous that the disability causing the person to need a wheelchair to reach the gate is cured during flight, and they walk off the plane like everybody else.\n\nSnyder doubts that fans of open seating will abandon Southwest.\n\n\"Those people will still fly Southwest,\" he said. \"They may grumble about it, but there's no one else they can go to that has open seating.\"\n\nIn addition to the boarding change, Southwest also plans to convert about one-third of the seats on its planes to premium seating with more legroom, matching a practice that is standard among other large U.S. carriers.\n\nThe airline's newest schedule also includes a few redeye flights -- a first for Southwest.\n\nThe overnight flights will start in mid-February on nonstop routes including Las Vegas to Baltimore and Orlando; Los Angeles to Baltimore and Nashville; and Phoenix to Baltimore. More routes will be added over time, the airline said.\n\nThe changes come as Southwest is under pressure from Elliott Investment Management. The hedge fund argues that the airline lags rivals in financial performance and has failed to change with the times. It wants to replace Jordan and Chairman Gary Kelly.\n\nSouthwest also faces increased scrutiny from the Federal Aviation Administration after a series of worrisome flights, including one that dove within 400 feet of the ocean off Hawaii, two that flew at extremely low altitudes while still miles from landing at airports in Oklahoma and Florida, and another that was discovered to have rudder-area damage after an unusual \"Dutch roll\" wiggle during a flight.\n\nSouthwest announced the seating move and other changes on the same day that both it and American Airlines reported a steep drop in second-quarter profit despite higher revenue. Airlines are struggling with higher costs and reduced pricing power, especially on flights within the United States, as the industry adds flights faster than the growth in travel demand.\n\nSouthwest, based in Dallas, said its second-quarter profit fell 46% from a year earlier, to $367 million, as higher costs for labor, fuel and other expenses outstripped an increase in revenue. The results met Wall Street expectations.\n\nAmerican Airlines also reported a 46% drop in profit, to $717 million. CEO Robert Isom said the airline was held back by a sales strategy that it is now rolling back and by an oversupply of domestic flights.\n\nAmerican said its earnings per share in the third quarter will be break-even, well below Wall Street's expectation of 48 cents per share. American also cut its forecast of full-year earnings to between 70 cents and $1.30 per share, down from a previous prediction of $2.25 to $3.25 per share.\n\nShares of the leading U.S. airlines rose Thursday. Southwest Airlines Co. gained 5.5% and American Airlines Group Inc., based in Fort Worth, Texas, rose 4%. Delta, United, Alaska and JetBlue also gained.\n\n___\n\nAssociated Press writer Wyatte Grantham-Philips in New York and video journalist Teresa Crawford in Chicago contributed to this report.",

The premium legroom offering is expected to be available for flights sometime next year.\n\nSouthwest said its hopes these changes meet customer expectations and demands while driving additional revenue. The airline said it plans to release additional details at an investor day event in September, according to CNBC.\n\nBelow, you can find the full section of the Southwest Airlines press release announcing the change to assigned and premium seating:\n\n\"As the next step in a continuing strategic transformation, Southwest Airlines Co. (NYSE: LUV) (the \"Company\") is announcing several new initiatives designed to elevate the Customer experience, improve financial performance, and drive Shareholder value. As part of its ongoing focus on product evolution, the airline is moving forward with plans to assign seats, offer premium seating options, redesign the boarding model, and introduce redeye flying.\n\nSouthwest continually reviews Customer expectations. During its quarterly financial results in April, the airline shared that it was studying product preferences and expectations, including onboard seating. In addition to meeting Customer demand, the new amenities are expected to produce additional revenue and strengthen financial performance. Southwest will provide more details on its comprehensive plan to deliver transformational commercial initiatives, improved operational efficiency and capital allocation discipline during its Investor Day in late September.\n\nAssigned and Premium Seating\n\nAfter listening carefully to Customers and conducting extensive research, Southwest decided it will assign seats and offer premium seating options on all flights. The airline has been known for its unique open seating model for more than 50 years, but preferences have evolved with more Customers taking longer flights where a seat assignment is preferred. Additionally, Southwest conducted robust operational testing that included live and over 8 million simulation-based boarding trials. The airline is confident that these Customer enhancements will meet expectations and not compromise the airline's operational efficiency.\n\nThe research is clear and indicates that 80% of Southwest Customers, and 86% of potential Customers, prefer an assigned seat. When a Customer elects to stop flying with Southwest and chooses a competitor, open seating is cited as the number one reason for the change. By moving to an assigned seating model, Southwest expects to broaden its appeal and attract more flying from its current and future Customers.\n\nIn addition to assigning seats, Southwest will offer a premium, extended legroom portion of the cabin that research shows many Customers strongly prefer. While specific cabin layout details are still in design, Southwest expects roughly one-third of seats across the fleet to offer extended legroom, in line with that offered by industry peers on narrowbody aircraft.\n\nThe decision to update the seating and boarding model is part of Southwest's ongoing modernization efforts. During the past two years, Southwest has enhanced its onboard offerings with improvements such as faster WiFi, in-seat power, and larger overhead bins. Work is well underway on a refreshed cabin design, including new, more comfortable RECARO seats. The addition of assigned and premium seating will give Customers more choice and is expected to further enhance the all-in value Southwest Airlines is known for.", "source": {"uri": "nbcnewyork.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "NBC New York"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Southwest_Airlines", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Southwest Airlines"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Airline", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Airline"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CNBC", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "CNBC"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shareholder_value", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Shareholder value"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_Stock_Exchange", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "New York Stock Exchange"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Narrow-body_aircraft", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Narrow-body aircraft"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wi-Fi", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Wi-Fi"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Airliner", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Airliner"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Transportation", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Transportation", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Travel/Transportation", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Travel/Transportation", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Aviation/Simulation", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Aviation/Simulation", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 69}], "image": "https://media.nbcnewyork.com/2024/07/GettyImages-2153584135.jpg?quality=85&strip=all&resize=1200%2C675", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9762572", "eventUri": "eng-9762572", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1529411764705881, "wgt": 209, "relevance": 1}

Southwest discovered that preferences have changed over the years and the vast majority of travelers now want to know where they are sitting before they get to the airport.\n\nSouthwest's unusual boarding process started as a fast way to load passengers and limit the time that planes and crews spend sitting idly on the ground, not making money. It helped the airline operate more efficiently and even squeeze a few more flights into the daily schedule.\n\nIt was one reason that Southwest alone among U.S. airlines remained profitable every year until the coronavirus pandemic.\n\nHere's how it works: Instead of being assigned a seat when they buy a ticket, Southwest customers check in exactly 24 hours before departure to secure their spots in boarding lines. In the beginning, the first 30 to check in were put in the coveted \"A\" boarding group, guaranteeing them a window or aisle seat. Dawdlers landed in \"B,\" which was still OK, or \"C,\" which would often result in a middle seat.\n\nThe system became less democratic over time as Southwest let people pay extra to guarantee a spot near the front of the line. Despite that, many Southwest loyalists still love open seating. The airline thinks they will adapt.\n\n\"I know there are going to be customers who say, 'I want to stay with open seating.' It's a minority,\" Southwest CEO Robert Jordan told CNBC, \"but we had the same thing when we switched from plastic boarding passes. We had the same thing when we took peanuts out of the cabin. I'm convinced we can win them over.\"\n\nThe airline said surveys showed that 80% of its customers -- and 86% of \"potential\" customers -- want an assigned seat. Jordan said open seating was the top reason that travelers cited for choosing another airline over Southwest.\n\nIn addition to the seating switch, Southwest also plans to sell premium seating with more legroom - matching a practice that is standard among other large U.S. carriers - and to offer redeye flights for the first time.\n\nSouthwest said redeyes will start flying in mid-February on nonstop routes including Las Vegas to Baltimore and Orlando; Los Angeles to Baltimore and Nashville; and Phoenix to Baltimore, with more routes added over time.\n\nThe changes come as Southwest is under pressure from Elliott Investment Management. The hedge fund argues that the airline lags rivals in financial performance and has failed to change with the times. It wants to replace Jordan and Chairman Gary Kelly.\n\nSouthwest also faces increased scrutiny from the Federal Aviation Administration after a series of worrisome flights, including one that dove within 400 feet of the ocean off Hawaii, two that flew at extremely low altitudes while still miles from landing at airports in Oklahoma and Florida, and another that was discovered to have rudder-area damage after an unusual \"Dutch roll\" wiggle during a flight.\n\nSouthwest announced the seating move and other changes on the same day that both it and American Airlines reported a steep drop in second-quarter profit despite higher revenue.\n\nAirlines are struggling with higher costs and reduced pricing power, especially on flights within the United States, as the industry adds flights faster than the growth in travel demand.\n\nSouthwest, based in Dallas, said its second-quarter profit fell 46% from a year earlier, to $367 million, as higher costs for labor, fuel and other expenses outstripped an increase in revenue. The results met Wall Street expectations.\n\nAmerican Airlines also reported a 46% drop in profit, to $717 million, and said it would break even in the third quarter -- well below Wall Street expectations of 48 cents per share profit in the July-through-September period.\n\nAmerican \"did not perform to our initial expectations\" because of a since-abandoned sales strategy and an oversupply of domestic flights, CEO Robert Isom said. He said the airline was responding with a strategy that boosts profits and \"makes it easy for customers to do business with American.\"\n\nAmerican cut its forecast of full-year earnings to between 70 cents and $1.30 per share, down from a previous prediction of $2.25 to $3.25 per share.\n\nShares of the leading U.S. airlines rose after the opening bell Thursday. Southwest Airlines Co. gained 3% and American Airlines Group Inc., based in Fort Worth, Texas, rose 5% in late-morning trading. Delta, United, Alaska and JetBlue also gained.\n\nMore from this section\n\nMost airlines except one are recovering from the CrowdStrike tech outage.

The hedge fund has called on the airline to enhance its board of directors, upgrade leadership and take a comprehensive business review.\n\nIn May, the airline began listing airfares on Google Flights, making it easier for travelers to compare their options on a single dashboard.\n\nA Southwest spokesperson said the move, which the carrier said it's testing, broadens its reach with consumers while allowing the company to retain control of the booking process.", "source": {"uri": "cbsnews.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "CBS News"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Airline", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Airline"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baltimore", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Baltimore"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Baltimore"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vice_President_of_the_United_States", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Vice President of the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Valentine's_Day", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Valentine's Day"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nashville,_Tennessee", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Nashville, Tennessee"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Nashville, Tennessee"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chief_executive_officer", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Chief executive officer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Las_Vegas", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Las Vegas"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Las Vegas"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los_Angeles", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phoenix,_Arizona", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Phoenix, Arizona"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Phoenix, Arizona"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orlando,_Florida", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Orlando, Florida"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Orlando, Florida"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jordan", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Jordan"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Jordan"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google_Flights", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Google Flights"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Southwest_Airlines", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Southwest Airlines"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Board_of_directors", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Board of directors"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hedge_fund", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Hedge fund"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Transportation", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Transportation", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Travel/Transportation", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Travel/Transportation", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Aviation/Simulation", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Aviation/Simulation", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 74}], "image": "https://assets3.cbsnewsstatic.com/hub/i/r/2024/03/15/ea253f1a-c952-4cbe-9dc5-c84a3bfa4fd6/thumbnail/1200x630/91956c479379d84264bfbc977b8551b9/2024-03-12t104932z-1057595617-rc29k6a2i5nv-rtrmadp-3-boeing-737max-southwest.jpg?v=5501038cbc281520ff9fdc308faab7dc", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9762572", "eventUri": "eng-9762572", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.02745098039215677, "wgt": 208, "relevance": 1}

Los Angeles to Baltimore and Nashville; and Phoenix to Baltimore.", "source": {"uri": "paddleyourownkanoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Paddle Your Own Kanoo"}, "authors": [{"uri": "mateusz_maszczynski@paddleyourownkanoo.com", "name": "Mateusz Maszczynski", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Southwest_Airlines", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Southwest Airlines"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Airline", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Airline"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elliott_Investment_Management", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Elliott Investment Management"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shareholder", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Shareholder"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red-eye_flight", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Red-eye flight"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Valentine's_Day", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Valentine's Day"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nashville,_Tennessee", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Nashville, Tennessee"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Nashville, Tennessee"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wi-Fi", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Wi-Fi"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Las_Vegas", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Las Vegas"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Las Vegas"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los_Angeles", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phoenix,_Arizona", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Phoenix, Arizona"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Phoenix, Arizona"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baltimore", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Baltimore"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Baltimore"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orlando,_Florida", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Orlando, Florida"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Orlando, Florida"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jordan", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Jordan"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Jordan"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Transportation", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Transportation", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Travel/Transportation", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Travel/Transportation", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 86}], "image": "https://www.paddleyourownkanoo.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/160527-New-Interior-web0001-source.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9762572", "eventUri": "eng-9762572", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.0117647058823529, "wgt": 207, "relevance": 1}

Southwest discovered that preferences have changed over the years and the vast majority of travelers now want to know where they are sitting before they get to the airport.\n\nSouthwest's unusual boarding process started as a fast way to load passengers and limit the time that planes and crews spend sitting idly on the ground, not making money. It helped the airline operate more efficiently and even squeeze a few more flights into the daily schedule.\n\nIt was one reason that Southwest alone among U.S. airlines remained profitable every year until the coronavirus pandemic.\n\nHere's how it works: Instead of being assigned a seat when they buy a ticket, Southwest customers check in exactly 24 hours before departure to secure their spots in boarding lines. In the beginning, the first 30 to check in were put in the coveted \"A\" boarding group, guaranteeing them a window or aisle seat. Dawdlers landed in \"B,\" which was still OK, or \"C,\" which would often result in a middle seat.\n\nThe system became less democratic over time as Southwest let people pay extra to guarantee a spot near the front of the line. Despite that, many Southwest loyalists still love open seating. The airline thinks they will adapt.\n\nRelated Story: Fresno Airline Flights Cancelled Amid Global IT Shutdown\n\n\"I know there are going to be customers who say, 'I want to stay with open seating.' It's a minority,\" Southwest CEO Robert Jordan told CNBC, \"but we had the same thing when we switched from plastic boarding passes. We had the same thing when we took peanuts out of the cabin. I'm convinced we can win them over.\"\n\nThe airline said surveys showed that 80% of its customers -- and 86% of \"potential\" customers -- want an assigned seat. Jordan said open seating was the top reason that travelers cited for choosing another airline over Southwest.\n\nSome Southwest passengers reacted with sadness and disappointment to news that open seating is going away.\n\n\"Hearing that announcement today, I was like, no, this is my favorite part of Southwest,\" said Lindsey Magness, who works in college athletics in Oklahoma City.\n\nMagness said that with open seating, she can try for a window seat or, depending on her mood, an aisle. And assigned seating doesn't always work either. Magness said American Airlines seated her away from her husband on their honeymoon trip earlier this summer\n\nBrandon Bowser of Odenton, Maryland, said he flies on different airlines based on which one has the best deal, but he has found Southwest's open boarding to be faster and less complicated than other airlines.\n\n\"The convenience that comes with being able to pick your own seat is what sets Southwest apart and makes them sort of a preferred airline,\" he said. \"A lot of my friends swear by Southwest, that's all they will fly, and they are completely irate about this decision.\"\n\nAt Chicago's O'Hare Airport, Kimberly King was happy to learn of the change. She was at a check-in kiosk with her four children for a flight home to California.\n\n\"I used to fly United a lot and I liked the assigned seats, especially with kids, kind of expecting and knowing where we were going to be,\" King said. \"The only reason really why I continue to fly Southwest is for the free bags.\"\n\nSouthwest still lets passengers check two bags for free. It's been a centerpiece of the airline's advertising campaigns for years. CEO Jordan said Southwest has no plans to end bags-fly-free \"at this point.\"\n\nRelated Story: Smoking Laptop in Passenger's Bag Prompts Evacuation on American Airlines ...\n\nThere are drawbacks to Southwest boarding. It's hard to get a good spot in line without paying an extra fee. Southwest executives said 60% of passengers check in the first 30 seconds. Those who miss the rush fear there won't be room in the overhead bins for their carry-on bag. Late boarders can struggle to see an open seat anywhere, and start roaming up and down the aisle -- Southwest calls them \"spinners.\"\n\nThere are a number of tricks that passengers use to game the system.\n\nSome take advantage of early boarding for people who need extra time. Others ignore the age limit (6 or under) for children in families that are allowed to board right after the \"A\" group. Once on the plane, some passengers hold choice seats for mates who are far behind them in line.\n\nPhotos appear occasionally on social media of an unusually large number of people in wheelchairs at Southwest gates. They get to board early.\n\n\"It's certainly one of the things that anger people even if it doesn't have a material impact on them,\" said Brett Snyder, a travel agent and author of the Cranky Flier blog. \"In some cases those are people who have absolutely legitimate reasons. In other cases, it's the 'Jetway Jesus' phenomenon.\"\n\nThat's a reference to recoveries so miraculous that the disability causing the person to need a wheelchair to reach the gate is cured during flight, and they walk off the plane like everybody else.\n\nSnyder doubts that fans of open seating will abandon Southwest.\n\nRelated Story: American Airlines Retreats After Blaming a 9-Year-Old for Not Seeing a Hidden ...\n\n\"Those people will still fly Southwest,\" he said. \"They may grumble about it, but there's no one else they can go to that has open seating.\"\n\nIn addition to the boarding change, Southwest also plans to convert about one-third of the seats on its planes to premium seating with more legroom, matching a practice that is standard among other large U.S. carriers.\n\nThe airline's newest schedule also includes a few redeye flights -- a first for Southwest.\n\nThe overnight flights will start in mid-February on nonstop routes including Las Vegas to Baltimore and Orlando; Los Angeles to Baltimore and Nashville; and Phoenix to Baltimore. More routes will be added over time, the airline said.\n\nThe changes come as Southwest is under pressure from Elliott Investment Management. The hedge fund argues that the airline lags rivals in financial performance and has failed to change with the times. It wants to replace Jordan and Chairman Gary Kelly.\n\nSouthwest also faces increased scrutiny from the Federal Aviation Administration after a series of worrisome flights, including one that dove within 400 feet of the ocean off Hawaii, two that flew at extremely low altitudes while still miles from landing at airports in Oklahoma and Florida, and another that was discovered to have rudder-area damage after an unusual \"Dutch roll\" wiggle during a flight.\n\nSouthwest announced the seating move and other changes on the same day that both it and American Airlines reported a steep drop in second-quarter profit despite higher revenue. Airlines are struggling with higher costs and reduced pricing power, especially on flights within the United States, as the industry adds flights faster than the growth in travel demand.\n\nSouthwest, based in Dallas, said its second-quarter profit fell 46% from a year earlier, to $367 million, as higher costs for labor, fuel and other expenses outstripped an increase in revenue. The results met Wall Street expectations.\n\nAmerican Airlines also reported a 46% drop in profit, to $717 million. CEO Robert Isom said the airline was held back by a sales strategy that it is now rolling back and by an oversupply of domestic flights.\n\nAmerican said its earnings per share in the third quarter will be break-even, well below Wall Street's expectation of 48 cents per share. American also cut its forecast of full-year earnings to between 70 cents and $1.30 per share, down from a previous prediction of $2.25 to $3.25 per share.\n\nShares of the leading U.S. airlines rose Thursday. Southwest Airlines Co. gained 5.5% and American Airlines Group Inc., based in Fort Worth, Texas, rose 4%. Delta, United, Alaska and JetBlue also gained.", "source": {"uri": "gvwire.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "GV Wire"}, "authors": [{"uri": "associated_press@gvwire.com", "name": "Associated Press",

Although they have offered group boarding for over 50 years, the airline says they decided to make the move after operational testing including 8 million simulation-based boarding trials and live testing.\n\n\"The research is clear and indicates that 80% of Southwest customers, and 86% of potential customers, prefer an assigned seat,\" the airline said in a press release. \"When a customer elects to stop flying with Southwest and chooses a competitor, open seating is cited as the number one reason for the change.

The moves could also generate revenue and boost financial performance.\n\nSouthwest made the announcement on the same day that both it and American Airlines reported a steep drop in second-quarter profit despite higher revenue.\n\nAirlines are struggling with higher costs and reduced pricing power, especially on flights within the United States, as the industry adds flights faster than the growth in travel demand.\n\nSouthwest, based in Dallas, said its second-quarter profit fell 46% from a year earlier, to $367 million, as higher costs for labor, fuel and other expenses outstripped an increase in revenue. The results met Wall Street expectations.\n\nAmerican Airlines also reported a 46% drop in profit, to $717 million, and said it would break even in the third quarter -- well below Wall Street expectations of 48 cents per share profit in the July-through-September period.\n\nAmerican \"did not perform to our initial expectations\" because of a since-abandoned sales strategy and an oversupply of domestic flights, CEO Robert Isom said. He said the airline was responding with a strategy that boosts profits and \"makes it easy for customers to do business with American.\"\n\nSouthwest's unusual boarding process started decades ago as a way for the airline to save money by reducing the amount of time it took for a plane to land, load new passengers, and take off again -- turn time, as it is called in the business.\n\nMost airlines assign each passenger to a seat when they buy a ticket. Southwest requires customers to check in exactly 24 hours before departure unless they pay extra to guarantee a better place in the boarding line. Those who hate it call it a \"cattle call\" but many Southwest loyalists love it.\n\nHowever, as flights have become more full it has gotten harder to score a window or aisle seat without paying extra. Also, some passengers appear to game the system: They use a wheelchair to get to the gate, where they are given priority in boarding, then miraculously walk off the plane without assistance after the flight.\n\nThe airline said in surveys 80% of its customers -- and 86% of \"potential\" customers -- want an assigned seat. It said open seating is the top reason that travelers stop flying Southwest and choose another airline.\n\nSouthwest also said it will offer redeye flights for the first time.\n\nSouthwest said that its first overnight, redeye flights will land on Feb. 14, 2025, on nonstop routes including Las Vegas to Baltimore and Orlando; Los Angeles to Baltimore and Nashville; and Phoenix to Baltimore. It plans to add more redeyes over time.\n\nThe changes in seating policy and redeye flights come as Southwest is under pressure from Elliott Investment Management. The hedge fund argues that the airline lags rivals in financial performance and has failed to change with the times. It wants to replace CEO Robert Jordan and Chairman Gary Kelly.\n\nThe airline said it will provide more details about its upcoming changes at an investor day in September.\n\nShares of all major airlines dipped before the opening bell Thursday. Southwest Airlines Co. fell 6% and American Airlines Group Inc. fell 7%. Delta, JetBlue and United slipped more than 1%.\n\nDownload the FOX13 Memphis app to receive alerts from breaking news in your neighborhood.\n\nCLICK HERE TO DOWNLOAD\n\nTrending

(Scripps News)\n\nAfter more than 50 years, Southwest Airlines is getting rid of its unique open seating model and will now assign seats.\n\nThe airline made the move to meet the evolving preferences of customers who say they want seat assignments. Southwest also said it conducted testing that included live and more than 8 million simulation-based boarding trials before making the change.\n\nResearch from the airline shows 80% of Southwest customers and 86% of potential customers prefer an assigned seat. And when customers opt to stop flying with Southwest in favor of a competitor, the number one reason they cite leaving is open seating.\n\nThe major shift comes as the airline faces mounting pressure to increase revenue.\n\nWith open seating, travelers would board according to their boarding group and seat selection was first come, first served on the plane. The seating model was unique to Southwest. With the switch, seating will be determined in advance, following suit with other airlines.\n\nSouthwest said it will also offer a premium section of the plane with extended legroom, which research shows customers \"strongly prefer.\" About a third of the cabin will have seats with extended legroom.\n\n\"Moving to assigned seating and offering premium legroom options will be a transformational change that cuts across almost all aspects of the company,\" said Southwest president, CEO, and vice chairman of the board Bob Jordan, in a press release.\n\n\"Although our unique open seating model has been a part of Southwest Airlines since our inception, our thoughtful and extensive research makes it clear this is the right choice -- at the right time -- for our customers, our people, and our shareholders,\" Jordan said. \"We are excited to incorporate customer and employee feedback to design a unique experience that only Southwest can deliver.

The airline also plans to start overnight flights, starting in February.\n\nSouthwest executives have said for years that they were studying such changes and hinted in April that it was seriously considering assigning seats and offering pricier seats with more legroom. When travelers choose a competitor over Southwest, the airline found in its research that its open seating model was the No. 1 reason for that choice, the carrier said in a release that outlined the changes. It also said 80% of its own customers prefer an assigned seat.\n\nThe airline is under even more pressure now to segment its product like other airlines after activist investor Elliott Investment Management disclosed in June a nearly $2 billion stake in the airline and called for new leadership as the airline underperformed competitors.\n\n\"We will adapt as our customers' needs adapt,\" Southwest CEO Bob Jordan said at an industry event last month.\n\nSouthwest said it expects about a third of the seats on its Boeing 737s will offer \"extended legroom, in line with that offered by industry peers on narrowbody aircraft.\"\n\nThe Dallas-based airline had prided itself and raked in steady profits for most of its more than five decades of flying on its simple business model. Jordan said last month that not assigning seats was easier to offer when planes weren't so full.\n\nAnalysts criticized Southwest for moving too slowly. Rival carriers offer a host of options to upsell customers like extra legroom seats, premium economy or business class.

Passengers in the first boarding group got their choice of seat.

Southwest added that its open-seating plan is \"the number one reason\" customers choose to fly with a competing airline, according to the release.\n\nSouthwest's unique seating policy, as it currently exists, initially began as a way to load passengers faster, thereby limiting the time that planes and crews spend sitting idly on the ground. It works like this: Instead of being assigned a seat when they buy a ticket, Southwest customers check in exactly 24 hours before departure to secure their spots in boarding lines. The earliest to check in are placed in an \"A\" boarding group, with \"B\" and \"C\" groups containing those who checked in later.\n\nThe system became less democratic over time as Southwest let people pay extra to guarantee a spot near the front of the line. Despite that, many Southwest loyalists still love open seating. The airline thinks they will adapt.\n\nThe change isn't exactly happening overnight, though. In a statement obtained by Nexstar, a Southwest representative confirmed that customers will have some time to get used to the idea.\n\n\"We expect to make bookings available in 2025,\" the representative said in response to a question about the assigned-seating timeline. \"More specifics will be discussed at our Investor Day in September.\"\n\nIn addition to assigned seating, Southwest announced Thursday its plans to begin offering premium seating options and overnight flights, the latter of which are scheduled to begin departing on Feb. 14, 2025.\n\nThese decisions were made to offer \"more choice\" and \"enhance\" value for Southwest travelers, the company says. But of course, the carrier's bottom line is always a consideration.\n\n\"We have been building purposefully to this change as part of a comprehensive upgrade to the Southwest experience as we focus on Customer expectations -- and it will unlock new sources of revenue consistent with our laser focus on delivering improved financial performance,\" said Bob Jordan, the president and CEO of Southwest.", "source": {"uri": "wivb.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "wivb4"}, "authors": [{"uri": "michael_bartiromo@wivb.com", "name": "Michael Bartiromo", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Airline", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Airline"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Southwest_Airlines", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Southwest Airlines"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trademark", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Trademark"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democracy", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Democracy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bob_Jordan_(businessman)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Bob Jordan (businessman)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nexstar_Media_Group", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Nexstar Media Group"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laser", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Laser"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chief_executive_officer", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Chief executive officer"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Transportation", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Transportation", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Office_Products/Furniture", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Office Products/Furniture", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Travel/Transportation", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Travel/Transportation", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Home_and_Garden/Bathroom", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Home and Garden/Bathroom", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Customer_Service/Consulting", "label": "dmoz/Business/Customer Service/Consulting", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 80}], "image": "https://www.wivb.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/97/2024/07/SouthwestGettyImages-1671801221-e1721934622496.jpg?strip=1&w=640", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9762572", "eventUri": "eng-9762572", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "date": "2014-02-", "textStart": 2112, "textEnd": 2119}], "sentiment": -0.04313725490196074, "wgt": 205, "relevance": 1}

Amid a string of worse-than-expected earnings reports, chief executive Bob Jordan previously said that the airline was \"exploring new initiatives\" and changes to \"the way we seat and the way we board our aircraft.\"\n\n'Southwest expects to broaden its appeal and attract more flying'\n\nOn July 25, Southwest released a second-quarter earnings report showing that revenue fell by 46% to $367 million, while nonfuel expenses are expected to rise a further 13% by the end of the year. In a statement, Jordan said that \"urgent and deliberate steps\" were needed to increase profits and one such change is the introduction of premium seating.\n\nMore on travel:\n\nWhile Southwest is not yet releasing the details of what this would look like or how much it would cost, the general concept is paying extra for assigned seating. Jordan said that Southwest executives will be meeting to discuss the details further in September. The biggest remaining question is whether the open seating plan will remain after those with assigned seats have boarded or whether the system will be replaced entirely.\n\n\"The research is clear and indicates that 80% of Southwest customers, and 86% of potential customers, prefer an assigned seat,\" Southwest said in a statement. \"By moving to an assigned seating model, Southwest expects to broaden its appeal and attract more flying from its current and future customers.\"\n\nHere are the other changes Southwest plans to make (and how they affect travelers)\n\nOther changes announced by Southwest include the introduction of its first red-eye flights. The airline has, for years, flown exclusively during daytime hours but has hinted that it was looking to launch routes in which one can board at night and arrive the next day. The new routes will start running from Las Vegas to Baltimore and Orlando, Los Angeles to Baltimore and Nashville and Phoenix to Baltimore starting on Feb. 14, 2025.\n\nFor those questioning whether to book an assigned seat, Southwest said that it also plans to offer spaces with additional legroom -- the airline expects one third of cabins on new or retrofitted planes to feature seats with more space to stretch out.\n\nAll of this represents a massive change to how Southwest formerly conducted business, which may leave some who are used to the old system unhappy, but, according to Jordan, it will help the airline return to profit.\n\n\"Although our unique open seating model has been a part of Southwest Airlines since our inception, our thoughtful and extensive research makes it clear this is the right choice -- at the right time -- for our Customers, our People, and our Shareholders,\" Jordan said.", "source": {"uri": "thestreet.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "TheStreet"}, "authors": [{"uri": "veronika_bondarenko@thestreet.com", "name": "Veronika Bondarenko", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Airline", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Airline"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jordan", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Jordan"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Jordan"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TikTok", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "TikTok"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dallas_Stars", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Dallas Stars"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Delta_Air_Lines", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Delta Air Lines"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Southwest_Airlines", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Southwest Airlines"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flight_attendant", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Flight attendant"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baltimore", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Baltimore"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Baltimore"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nashville,_Tennessee", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Nashville, Tennessee"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Nashville, Tennessee"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Las_Vegas", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Las Vegas"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Las Vegas"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los_Angeles", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phoenix,_Arizona", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Phoenix, Arizona"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Phoenix, Arizona"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orlando,_Florida", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Orlando, Florida"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Orlando, Florida"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Transportation", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Transportation", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Science/Technology/Aerospace", "label": "dmoz/Science/Technology/Aerospace", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Travel/Transportation", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Travel/Transportation", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Home_and_Garden/Bathroom", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Home and Garden/Bathroom", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Travel/Accessories", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Travel/Accessories", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 54}], "image": "https://www.thestreet.com/.image/ar_1.91%2Cc_fill%2Ccs_srgb%2Cfl_progressive%2Cg_xy_center%2Cq_auto:good%2Cw_1200%2Cx_1371%2Cy_596/MjA2NjcwMjU5NTgxNjI1Nzkw/southwest-airlines.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9762572", "eventUri": "eng-9762572", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-07-25", "textStart": 665, "textEnd": 672}, {"amb": false, "date": "2014-02-", "textStart": 2272, "textEnd": 2279}], "sentiment": 0.2078431372549019, "wgt": 205, "relevance": 1}

While Southwest indicated earlier this year that it was reconsidering the seating policy, it's now facing heightened pressure to revamp underperforming operations from activist investor Elliott Investment Management.\n\nThe steps represent a strategic shift for the carrier, which has steadfastly maintained open seating while other airlines raked in revenue by charging extra for more-desirable seats. That unfulfilled opportunity is a major tenet of Elliott's campaign -- that Southwest has refused to modernize its business to appeal to today's travelers.\n\nAdoption of premium seating could open the door for the carrier -- which has long appealed primarily to leisure travelers -- to potentially offer business- and first-class sections in the future.\n\nSouthwest still won't charge for checked bags. The \"bags fly free\" policy has been a focal point of Southwest promotions and advertisements, and some analysts have speculated charging for bags could cost the airline customers. It's the only US carrier that doesn't impose fees to check two.\n\nSouthwest will begin offering assigned seats and premium seating with more legroom next year. It will start flying overnight, cross-country routes on Feb. 13. Those flights are for sale from Las Vegas, Los Angeles and Phoenix to Baltimore/Washington International Thurgood Marshall Airport; Las Vegas to Orlando; and Los Angeles to Nashville.\n\nDetails on which seats will carry fees and the extra cost are still being decided, Southwest said. All seats will be assigned, but there won't be a separate cabin for premium offerings. The carrier has studied various seating options in the past, but always rejected a shift to assigned spots, saying passengers didn't support such a move.\n\nWhile Southwest has long stood by some of its central policies, it hasn't been entirely resistant to change. It began routes to nearby international destinations and, more recently, added flights to Hawaii. The airline previously revamped its boarding system, offered early boarding options at an additional cost and developed a corporate booking tool to win more business travelers.\n\nSouthwest said in April that it had begun evaluating premium products and others changes, well before Elliott disclosed a $1.9 billion stake last month. But until Thursday, the airline said it wouldn't disclose any details until an investor meeting slated for September.\n\nElliott wants to oust Chief Executive Officer Bob Jordan and Chairman Gary Kelly for poor execution and a \"stubborn unwillingness to evolve the company's strategy.\" They are \"not up to the task of modernizing Southwest,\" the activist has said.\n\nSouthwest earlier this month named a veteran airline industry executive to its board to help address other concerns raised by Elliott.

(NYSE: LUV) (\"the Company\") is unveiling several new initiatives aimed at enhancing the customer experience, boosting financial performance, and increasing shareholder value. These plans include assigning seats, offering premium seating options, redesigning the boarding process, and introducing redeye flights.\n\nSouthwest Airlines continually reviews customer expectations. In April, during its quarterly financial results, the airline announced it was studying product preferences and expectations, including onboard seating. The new amenities are designed to meet customer demand while generating additional revenue and enhancing financial performance. Southwest will provide more details on its comprehensive plan to deliver transformational commercial initiatives, improved operational efficiency, and disciplined capital allocation during its Investor Day in late September.\n\nAssigned and Premium Seating\n\nAfter carefully listening to customers and conducting extensive research, Southwest has decided to implement assigned seating and introduce premium seating options on all flights. For over 50 years, the airline has been known for its unique open seating model, but customer preferences have evolved, with more travelers favoring assigned seats on longer flights. Extensive operational testing, including live trials and over 8 million simulation-based boarding trials, has assured the airline that these enhancements will meet customer expectations without compromising operational efficiency.\n\nResearch indicates that 80% of Southwest customers and 86% of potential customers prefer assigned seating. When customers choose to fly with a competitor, open seating is the primary reason for the switch. By adopting an assigned seating model, Southwest expects to broaden its appeal and attract more travelers, both current and future.\n\nIn addition to assigned seating, Southwest will introduce a premium seating option with extended legroom, which many customers strongly prefer. While specific cabin layout details are still being finalized, Southwest anticipates that roughly one-third of seats across its fleet will offer extended legroom, comparable to industry peers on narrowbody aircraft.\n\nThis decision to update the seating and boarding model is part of Southwest's ongoing modernization efforts. Over the past two years, the airline has improved its onboard offerings by introducing faster WiFi, in-seat power, and larger overhead bins. A refreshed cabin design, including new, more comfortable RECARO seats, is well underway. The addition of assigned and premium seating will provide customers with more choices and is expected to further enhance the all-in value that Southwest Airlines is known for.\n\n\"Moving to assigned seating and offering premium legroom options will be a transformational change that cuts across almost all aspects of the Company,\" said Bob Jordan, President, CEO, & Vice Chairman of the Board. \"Although our unique open seating model has been a part of Southwest Airlines since our inception, our thoughtful and extensive research makes it clear this is the right choice -- at the right time -- for our Customers, our People, and our Shareholders. We are excited to incorporate Customer and Employee feedback to design a unique experience that only Southwest can deliver. We have been building purposefully to this change as part of a comprehensive upgrade to the Southwest experience as we focus on Customer expectations - and it will unlock new sources of revenue consistent with our laser focus on delivering improved financial performance.\"\n\nRedeye Flights Now for Sale\n\nSouthwest has announced the addition of 24-hour operation capabilities with the introduction of overnight, redeye flights. Booking for initial routes is now available on Southwest.com, with the first overnight flights landing on Valentine's Day 2025 in five nonstop markets: Las Vegas to Baltimore and Orlando, Los Angeles to Baltimore and Nashville, and Phoenix to Baltimore. Southwest plans to expand redeye flights in upcoming schedules as part of its multi-year transformation to a 24-hour operation. This move, along with continued reductions in turn-time through new technologies and procedures, is expected to generate incremental revenue and cost savings, enabling Southwest to fund nearly all new capacity over the next three years without additional aircraft capital deployment.\n\nNew EVP Commercial Transformation\n\nRyan Green, previously Executive Vice President & Chief Commercial Officer, will assume the new role of Executive Vice President Commercial Transformation to lead the development and rollout of these and other commercial initiatives. Green, who has deep knowledge of customer trends and currently oversees cabin transformation efforts, has also directed the transformation of Southwest Airlines' Rapid Rewards\u00ae loyalty program and the digital customer experience. In his new role, he will report to President, CEO, and Vice Chairman of the Board Bob Jordan.\n\n\"I'm eager to lead this next step in our transformation to serve our Customers with an even better Southwest. In addition to meeting the evolving needs of Customers and fostering more loyalty, these changes are expected to generate additional revenue as we capitalize on greater demand for Southwest Airlines and offer Customers the ability to purchase premium seating options,\" Green said. \"Together, these strategic initiatives play an integral role in the airline's comprehensive strategy to meet Customer needs and enhance Shareholder value, while maintaining the unique Culture, Hospitality, and flexibility that make Southwest - Southwest.\"\n\nThe Company will provide more details about product designs, cabin layout, timing, and incremental financial value at its Investor Day in late September. The shift to assigned and premium seating marks a significant change. Along with incorporating new technologies and procedures for a smooth transition, the new cabin layout will require approval from the Federal Aviation Administration. Southwest anticipates making bookings available in 2025.\n\nGary Kelly, Executive Chairman of the Board, said, \"The Board fully supports these efforts to usher in a new era for Southwest Airlines, and we have the ultimate confidence in Bob and our Leadership Team to design and deliver an experience that is unique and true to our Southwest Legacy.\"", "source": {"uri": "travelandtourworld.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Travel And Tour World"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Southwest_Airlines", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Southwest Airlines"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Airline", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Airline"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shareholder_value", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Shareholder value"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_Stock_Exchange", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "New York Stock Exchange"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baltimore", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Baltimore"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Baltimore"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bob_Jordan_(businessman)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Bob Jordan (businessman)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chairperson", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Chairperson"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Narrow-body_aircraft", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Narrow-body aircraft"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wi-Fi", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Wi-Fi"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vice_president", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Vice president"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Airliner", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Airliner"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chief_executive_officer", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Chief executive officer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hospitality", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Hospitality"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Valentine's_Day", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Valentine's Day"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nashville,_Tennessee", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Nashville, Tennessee"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Nashville, Tennessee"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Loyalty_program", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Loyalty program"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laser", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Laser"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Aviation_Administration", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Federal Aviation Administration"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Las_Vegas", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Las Vegas"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Las Vegas"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los_Angeles", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phoenix,_Arizona", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Phoenix, Arizona"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Phoenix, Arizona"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orlando,_Florida", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Orlando, Florida"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Orlando, Florida"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Transportation", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Transportation", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Travel/Transportation", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Travel/Transportation", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Financial_Services/Leasing_Services", "label": "dmoz/Business/Financial Services/Leasing Services", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Aviation/Simulation", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Aviation/Simulation", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 94}], "image": "https://www.travelandtourworld.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Southwest-Airlines-3.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9762572", "eventUri": "eng-9762572", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.223529411764706, "wgt": 203, "relevance": 1}

Amid a string of worse-than-expected earnings reports, chief executive Bob Jordan previously said that the airline was \"exploring new initiatives\" and changes to \"the way we seat and the way we board our aircraft.\"\n\n'Southwest expects to broaden its appeal and attract more flying'\n\nOn July 25, Southwest released a second-quarter earnings report showing that revenue fell by 46% to $367 million, while nonfuel expenses are expected to rise a further 13% by the end of the year. In a statement, Jordan said that \"urgent and deliberate steps\" were needed to increase profits and one such change is the introduction of premium seating.\n\nMore on travel:\n\nWhile Southwest is not yet releasing the details of what this would look like or how much it would cost, the general concept is paying extra for assigned seating. Jordan said that Southwest executives will be meeting to discuss the details further in September. The biggest remaining question is whether the open seating plan will remain after those with assigned seats have boarded or whether the system will be replaced entirely.\n\n\"The research is clear and indicates that 80% of Southwest customers, and 86% of potential customers, prefer an assigned seat,\" Southwest said in a statement. \"By moving to an assigned seating model, Southwest expects to broaden its appeal and attract more flying from its current and future customers.\"\n\nRelated: Get the best cruise tips, deals, and news on the ships from our expert cruiser\n\nHere are the other changes Southwest plans to make (and how they affect travelers)\n\nOther changes announced by Southwest include the introduction of its first red-eye flights. The airline has, for years, flown exclusively during daytime hours but has hinted that it was looking to launch routes in which one can board at night and arrive the next day. The new routes will start running from Las Vegas to Baltimore and Orlando, Los Angeles to Baltimore and Nashville and Phoenix to Baltimore starting on Feb. 14, 2025.\n\nFor those questioning whether to book an assigned seat, Southwest said that it also plans to offer spaces with additional legroom -- the airline expects one third of cabins on new or retrofitted planes to feature seats with more space to stretch out.\n\nAll of this represents a massive change to how Southwest formerly conducted business, which may leave some who are used to the old system unhappy, but, according to Jordan, it will help the airline return to profit.\n\n\"Although our unique open seating model has been a part of Southwest Airlines since our inception, our thoughtful and extensive research makes it clear this is the right choice -- at the right time -- for our Customers, our People, and our Shareholders,\" Jordan said.\n\nRelated: Veteran fund manager picks favorite stocks for 2024", "source": {"uri": "newsobserver.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The News&Observer"}, "authors": [{"uri": "veronika_bondarenko@newsobserver.com", "name": "Veronika Bondarenko", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Airline", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Airline"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jordan", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Jordan"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Jordan"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TikTok", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "TikTok"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dallas_Stars", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Dallas Stars"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Delta_Air_Lines", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Delta Air Lines"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Southwest_Airlines", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Southwest Airlines"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Viral_video", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Viral video"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flight_attendant", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Flight attendant"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baltimore", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Baltimore"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Baltimore"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nashville,_Tennessee", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Nashville, Tennessee"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Nashville, Tennessee"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stock", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Stock"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Las_Vegas", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Las Vegas"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Las Vegas"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los_Angeles", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phoenix,_Arizona", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Phoenix, Arizona"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Phoenix, Arizona"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orlando,_Florida", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Orlando, Florida"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Orlando, Florida"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Transportation", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Transportation", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Science/Technology/Aerospace", "label": "dmoz/Science/Technology/Aerospace", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Travel/Transportation", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Travel/Transportation", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Home_and_Garden/Bathroom", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Home and Garden/Bathroom", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Travel/Accessories", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Travel/Accessories", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 74}], "image": "https://www.mcclatchy-wires.com/incoming/o6rjq7/picture288758440/alternates/LANDSCAPE_1140/06945a80-25ba-4e91-9be4-21e077977450", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9762572", "eventUri": "eng-9762572", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-07-25", "textStart": 749, "textEnd": 756}, {"amb": false, "date": "2014-02-", "textStart": 2445, "textEnd": 2452}], "sentiment": 0.1372549019607843, "wgt": 203, "relevance": 1}

In its announcement, the carrier said it expects that about one-third of seats across its fleet will have extra legroom. The company did not provide a timeline for the changes.\n\nSouthwest, which started service to Manchester in 1998, currently averages eight daily flights out of Manchester. The airline flies to Orlando, Tampa, Chicago and Baltimore.\n\nSouthwest is averaging 1,277 daily outbound seats from Manchester in July and August, giving Southwest 52% of the total outbound seats from all airlines serving Manchester, according to the airport.\n\nIn 2003, Southwest had 22 daily flights from Manchester. That included a non-stop flight to Las Vegas -- which at 2,356 miles was the second-longest flight for Southwest nationwide.\n\nThursday's move quickly drew negative reaction from die-hard Southwest fans who say the airline is jeopardizing its identity.\n\nSaty Reddy, a lawyer who lives in the Bay Area and flies Southwest frequently with his family, said the shift marks \"the end of the people's airline.\"\n\nBen\u00e9t J. Wilson, a veteran aviation journalist and Southwest superfan who lives in Baltimore, said she woke up to \"a ton of texts and messages from friends giving me this news.\" The new policies will inevitably make Southwest feel different -- but also more like its competitors, she said.\n\n\"It's like another airline, any old plain airline,\" Wilson said. \"Southwest has swag and personality, bon vivant. Part of that was the open seating. Now I just feel like it will kind of change how the airline feels to me.\"\n\nSouthwest fan Grant Goodman, 24, sent a message to a reporter Thursday morning saying he felt betrayed. The Atlanta-based actor described himself as \"a dedicated front row, middle seat enthusiast.\"\n\n\"My favorite endurance hobby was checking in at the 24-hour mark,\" he said in an interview. \"The button -- I got it down.\"\n\nGoodman said he appreciated how passengers could book a flight 48 hours before departure, check in 24 hours in advance and still have a shot at a seat upfront.\n\n\"It was basically like a democracy,\" he said.\n\nThe company acknowledged that changing the seating policy was a big shift for the airline, which boasts that it set out to \"democratize the sky\" with low-cost travel when it began offering service in 1971.\n\n\"Moving to assigned seating and offering premium legroom options will be a transformational change that cuts across almost all aspects of the company,\" Southwest CEO Bob Jordan said in a statement.\n\nThe company said its research showed that 80% of its customers and 86% of \"potential\" customers prefer an assigned seat.\n\n\"When a customer elects to stop flying with Southwest and chooses a competitor, open seating is cited as the number one reason for the change,\" it said in a news release.\n\nJordan first hinted at the change in April. \"Early indications both for our customers and for Southwest look pretty darn interesting,\" he said at the time.\n\nThe changes are the most significant shift in decades for the airline, which built its reputation as a scrappy discount underdog but has evolved to become one of the dominant carriers in the United States. Even so, Southwest has been under pressure to boost revenue. As other airlines have found ways to charge for various \"upgrades,\" including more legroom and early boarding, Southwest's model left it with few options.\n\nThe carrier will also begin offering overnight \"red-eye\" flights, confirming an announcement from earlier this year. It said the flights will begin in February, with the first overnight flight landing on Valentine's Day 2025.\n\nRyan Fisher, a digital marketing analyst and frequent Southwest flier based in Fort Lauderdale, Florida, said the switch is not a surprise, but it's still disappointing.\n\n\"If people are willing to pay up for that seat guarantee, I get it,\" Fisher said in a direct message on X. \"I'm just not that person ... so this news overall is disappointing for a Southwest loyalist like myself.\"\n\nSouthwest fan Goodman anticipates that the airline's changes will result in higher prices for passengers. He expects Southwest to continue offering free checked bags, a differentiating perk the company's leadership has promised to keep. But he mourned the loss of the open-seating policy.\n\n\"It was the commoner's airline,\" he said. \"That feeling, I think, has kind of fallen a little bit.\"", "source": {"uri": "unionleader.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "UnionLeader.com"}, "authors": [{"uri": "lori_aratani@unionleader.com", "name": "Lori Aratani", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Airline", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Airline"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manchester", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Manchester"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Manchester"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baltimore", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Baltimore"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Baltimore"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-stop_flight", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Non-stop flight"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Southwest_Airlines", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Southwest Airlines"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Egalitarianism", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Egalitarianism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Airport", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Airport"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Las_Vegas", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Las Vegas"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Las Vegas"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chicago", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Chicago"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Chicago"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tampa,_Florida", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Tampa, Florida"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Tampa, Florida"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orlando,_Florida", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Orlando, Florida"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Orlando, Florida"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ulysses_S._Grant", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Ulysses S.

Amid a string of worse-than-expected earnings reports, chief executive Bob Jordan previously said that the airline was \"exploring new initiatives\" and changes to \"the way we seat and the way we board our aircraft.\"\n\n'Southwest expects to broaden its appeal and attract more flying'\n\nOn July 25, Southwest released a second-quarter earnings report showing that revenue fell by 46% to $367 million, while nonfuel expenses are expected to rise a further 13% by the end of the year. In a statement, Jordan said that \"urgent and deliberate steps\" were needed to increase profits and one such change is the introduction of premium seating.\n\nMore on travel:\n\nAnother National Park just made it more difficult for you to visitDelta Air Lines makes a baggage change that travelers will likeUnited Airlines passenger incident triggers quick response\n\nWhile Southwest is not yet releasing the details of what this would look like or how much it would cost, the general concept is paying extra for assigned seating. Jordan said that Southwest executives will be meeting to discuss the details further in September. The biggest remaining question is whether the open seating plan will remain after those with assigned seats have boarded or whether the system will be replaced entirely.\n\n\"The research is clear and indicates that 80% of Southwest customers, and 86% of potential customers, prefer an assigned seat,\" Southwest said in a statement. \"By moving to an assigned seating model, Southwest expects to broaden its appeal and attract more flying from its current and future customers.\"\n\nRelated: Get the best cruise tips, deals, and news on the ships from our expert cruiser\n\nHere are the other changes Southwest plans to make (and how they affect travelers)\n\nOther changes announced by Southwest include the introduction of its first red-eye flights. The airline has, for years, flown exclusively during daytime hours but has hinted that it was looking to launch routes in which one can board at night and arrive the next day. The new routes will start running from Las Vegas to Baltimore and Orlando, Los Angeles to Baltimore and Nashville and Phoenix to Baltimore starting on Feb. 14, 2025.\n\nFor those questioning whether to book an assigned seat, Southwest said that it also plans to offer spaces with additional legroom -- the airline expects one third of cabins on new or retrofitted planes to feature seats with more space to stretch out.\n\nAll of this represents a massive change to how Southwest formerly conducted business, which may leave some who are used to the old system unhappy, but, according to Jordan, it will help the airline return to profit.\n\n\"Although our unique open seating model has been a part of Southwest Airlines since our inception, our thoughtful and extensive research makes it clear this is the right choice -- at the right time -- for our Customers, our People, and our Shareholders,\" Jordan said.\n\nRelated: Veteran fund manager picks favorite stocks for 2024", "source": {"uri": "postandcourier.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Post and Courier"}, "authors": [{"uri": "veronika_bondarenko@postandcourier.com", "name": "Veronika Bondarenko", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Airline", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Airline"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jordan", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Jordan"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Jordan"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TikTok", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "TikTok"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dallas_Stars", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Dallas Stars"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Delta_Air_Lines", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Delta Air Lines"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Southwest_Airlines", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Southwest Airlines"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Viral_video", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Viral video"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flight_attendant", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Flight attendant"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baltimore", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Baltimore"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Baltimore"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nashville,_Tennessee", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Nashville, Tennessee"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Nashville, Tennessee"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stock", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Stock"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Las_Vegas", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Las Vegas"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Las Vegas"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los_Angeles", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phoenix,_Arizona", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Phoenix, Arizona"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Phoenix, Arizona"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orlando,_Florida", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Orlando, Florida"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Orlando, Florida"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Transportation", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Transportation", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Travel/Transportation", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Travel/Transportation", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Aviation/Simulation", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Aviation/Simulation", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 74}], "image": "https://bloximages.newyork1.vip.townnews.com/postandcourier.com/content/tncms/custom/image/6903687a-a7dc-11e9-896c-0bef6d6c9301.jpg?resize=600%2C314", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9762572", "eventUri": "eng-9762572", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-07-25", "textStart": 944, "textEnd": 951}, {"amb": false, "date": "2014-02-", "textStart": 2829, "textEnd": 2836}], "sentiment": 0.192156862745098, "wgt": 203, "relevance": 1}

Southwest added that its open-seating plan is \"the number one reason\" customers choose to fly with a competing airline, according to the release.\n\nCan you get compensation if your flight was delayed or canceled by the CrowdStrike outage?\n\nSouthwest's unique seating policy, as it currently exists, initially began as a way to load passengers faster, thereby limiting the time that planes and crews spend sitting idly on the ground. It works like this: Instead of being assigned a seat when they buy a ticket, Southwest customers check in exactly 24 hours before departure to secure their spots in boarding lines. The earliest to check in are placed in an \"A\" boarding group, with \"B\" and \"C\" groups containing those who checked in later.\n\nThe system became less democratic over time as Southwest let people pay extra to guarantee a spot near the front of the line. Despite that, many Southwest loyalists still love open seating. The airline thinks they will adapt.\n\nThe change isn't exactly happening overnight, though. In a statement obtained by Nexstar, a Southwest representative confirmed that customers will have some time to get used to the idea.\n\n\"We expect to make bookings available in 2025,\" the representative said in response to a question about the assigned-seating timeline. \"More specifics will be discussed at our Investor Day in September.\"\n\nPan Am is returning to skies in 2025. What's included for $65K?\n\nIn addition to assigned seating, Southwest announced Thursday its plans to begin offering premium seating options and overnight flights, the latter of which are scheduled to begin departing on Feb. 14, 2025.\n\nThese decisions were made to offer \"more choice\" and \"enhance\" value for Southwest travelers, the company says. But of course, the carrier's bottom line is always a consideration.\n\n\"We have been building purposefully to this change as part of a comprehensive upgrade to the Southwest experience as we focus on Customer expectations -- and it will unlock new sources of revenue consistent with our laser focus on delivering improved financial performance,\" said Bob Jordan, the president and CEO of Southwest.\n\nThe Associated Press contributed to this report.\n\nCopyright 2024 Nexstar Media, Inc.

But the change will also help the company charge some passengers more for their tickets.\n\n\"The research is clear and indicates that 80% of Southwest customers, and 86% of potential customers, prefer an assigned seat,\" said the airline in a statement. \"By moving to an assigned seating model, Southwest expects to broaden its appeal and attract more flying from its current and future customers.\"\n\nSouthwest did not give details about when the changes will go into effect, but it said it would be discussed further in September.\n\nThe airline had announced in April that it was looking at a change in its seating policy that has been in effect for its entire 50 year history. Southwest is under pressure from activist investors who have been pushing for changes in management and growth in profitability.\n\nSouthwest has long been known as a low-cost, low-fare carrier, but it has been facing competition from the three other major carriers, American, United and Delta, which get much of their revenue from charging more for premium seating. It also faces growing rivalries on the other end of the spectrum: ultra-low cost carriers, such as Spirit and Frontier, which offer bargain-priced seats for which customers have to pay extra for just about anything including carry on bags.\n\nSouthwest doesn't charge for carry on bags and has long allowed passengers to check two bags for free. The airline also doesn't charge customers to change flights.\n\nThe company made no mention in its statement about whether it will change its baggage or change fee policy. The premium seats, which will offer more legroom, will not be available until 2025 as it will require reconfiguring its planes.\n\nSouthwest used to be the most profitable US airline. But that is no longer the case.\n\nThursday, it reported a 51% drop in profit to $370 million, despite reporting record revenue for the quarter.\n\nAlthough Southwest still has the healthiest credit rating of any US airline, it has been struggling with a number of issues in recent years - some as a result of its own mismanagement, but some because of outside factors and changing industry dynamics.\n\nThe airline went 47 consecutive years without reporting an annual loss - until 2020, when the pandemic nearly halted all demand for air travel.\n\nSouthwest's fleet is made up entirely of Boeing 737 jets. That had reduced its operating costs, because it allowed its pilots to fly any of its planes, giving it a flexibility and efficiency not available to its larger rivals. But it also made it most susceptible to Boeing's substantial problems in recent years - both a 20-month grounding of the 737 Max in 2019 and 2020 following two fatal crashes, and a slowdown in production this year due to concerns about the quality and safety of its planes.\n\nBut its low-cost efforts also hurt Southwest at times, most notably in December 2022, when its suffered a catastrophic service meltdown that caused it to cancel about 17,000 flights, or nearly half of its schedule, during the busy holiday travel period. While other airlines recovered quickly from a winter storm that month, Southwest's computer technology, denounced as \"antiquated\" by its unions, made it difficult for it to schedule its pilots and flight attendants and resume normal operations.\n\nThat meltdown cost Southwest around $1 billion, including a $140 million fine. But it underwent a massive update to its technology since then, and notably, Southwest managed to recover quickly from the global tech outage last week. This time, it was rival Delta that took days to recover.\n\nShares of Southwest (LUV) were down 2% in premarket trading on its news.\n\nThis story has been updated with additional context and developments.\n\nThe-CNN-Wire\n\n\u2122 & \u00a9 2024 Cable News Network, Inc., a Warner Bros.

The data backed it up.\n\nBut not anymore. As Southwest announced Thursday morning:\n\n\"After listening carefully to Customers and conducting extensive research, Southwest decided it will assign seats and offer premium seating options on all flights.\n\nThe airline has been known for its unique open seating model for more than 50 years, but preferences have evolved with more Customers taking longer flights where a seat assignment is preferred.\"\n\nFor passengers and people who follow the airlines, it's hard to overstate how big a change this is. Southwest listed several other key points:\n\nAbout one-third of seats will be in the new extended legroom sections of the cabin. The new layouts will require approval from federal regulators, and so bookings under the new system won't begin until next year.\n\n\"Moving to assigned seating and offering premium legroom options will be a transformational change that cuts across almost all aspects of the Company,\" said Bob Jordan, Southwest's president, CEO and vice chairman of the board. \"Although our unique open seating model has been a part of Southwest Airlines since our inception, our thoughtful and extensive research makes it clear this is the right choice ...\"\n\nSouthwest also said its previously announced new redeye flights are now available for booking.\n\nAs big as these changes to the Southwest cabin experience are, they're not unexpected.\n\nSouthwest has been facing an activist shareholder, a hedge fund that has a nearly $2 billion stake in the company, and has been demanding change--everything from the kinds of changes announced today to the idea of replacing the top leadership like Jordan.\n\nLooking more broadly, it's also part of a trend among all businesses to \"unbundle\" products and services, so that customers who are willing to pay more for a better experience do so--and those who decline don't have their experience subsidized by others.\n\nIn retrospect, Southwest has moved incrementally toward this unbundled model, for example, by adding ways for passengers to pay more to get a higher boarding priority, which theoretically would allow them to choose better seats.\n\nHowever, this was highly imperfect, as customers would reserve multiple seats for other, lower-priority passengers. Reportedly, Southwest Airlines flight attendants were getting tired of being asked to intervene in seat disputes.\n\nThere are still a few other onboard experiences that set Southwest apart from its competitors. The biggest among these might now be the airline's \"bags fly free\" policy, which gives passengers the ability to two checked bags at no additional cost.\n\nSouthwest confirms that this policy remains unchanged. Also, there are no plans to change the airline's food and beverage service, which is limited compared to competitors.\n\nChange is hard in business, especially when you realize that the thing that customers used to love about you might not be so appealing to them anymore.\n\nBut it can happen to any company--and it can be hard to admit to yourself as a leader.\n\nSo, pay attention to Southwest. If you ever find your business in a similar situation, you might be glad to have seen how they handled this big change.", "source": {"uri": "inc.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Inc.com"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Southwest_Airlines", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Southwest Airlines"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Airline", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Airline"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jordan", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Jordan"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Jordan"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chairperson", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Chairperson"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Activist_shareholder", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Activist shareholder"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hedge_fund", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Hedge fund"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chief_executive_officer", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Chief executive officer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flight_attendant", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Flight attendant"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Transportation", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Transportation", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Transportation_and_Logistics/Aviation", "label": "dmoz/Business/Transportation and Logistics/Aviation", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Travel/Transportation", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Travel/Transportation", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Home_and_Garden/Bathroom", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Home and Garden/Bathroom", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Management/Organizational_Change", "label": "dmoz/Business/Management/Organizational Change", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 81}], "image": "https://img-cdn.inc.com/image/upload/w_1024,h_576,c_fill/images/panoramic/southwest-airlines-inc-2149408839_543183_eewvue.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9762572", "eventUri": "eng-9762572", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.06666666666666665, "wgt": 201, "relevance": 1}

comes as pressure mounts on Southwest to change its 53-year-old business model and increase revenue.\n\nThe airline hinted in April that it was considering cabin changes.\n\nCEO Bob Jordan told CNBC that they were considering single-class, open-seating cabins to increase profits.\n\n\"We're looking into new initiatives, things like the way we seat and board our aircraft,\" Jordan said.\n\nCurrently, Southwest offers a single economy class cabin with no seating assignments.\n\nSeats are first-come, first-serve, although the airline does offer early boarding for an extra fee.\n\nSouthwest customers are placed in one of three boarding groups and then assigned a number, which places travelers in a race to get on the plane.\n\nOver the past two years, the budget airline has made changes, such as improved WiFi, in-seat power, and larger oversized bins, in attempts to boost revenue.\n\n\"Moving to assigned seating and offering premium legroom options will be a transformational change that cuts across almost all aspects of the Company,\" said Bob Jordan in a statement.\n\n\"Although our unique open seating model has been a part of Southwest Airlines since our inception, our thoughtful and extensive research makes it clear this is the right choice, at the right time, for our customers, our people, and our shareholders.\"\n\nOn top of assigned seats, the airline explained that the premium portion of the cabin would upgrade \"roughly one-third of seats across the fleet to offer extended legroom, in line with that offered by industry peers on narrowbody aircraft.\"\n\nLuckily for loyal Southwest fliers, the company will not make any changes to its two free checked bags policy.\n\nThe airline will also be adding new flights to its program, introducing overnight redeye flights.\n\nSouthwest plans to bolster its 24-hour operation with late-night flights starting Valentine's Day 2025.\n\nThe first redeye flights will include routes from Las Vegas to Baltimore and Orlando, Los Angeles to Baltimore and Nashville, and Phoenix to Baltimore.\n\n\"Redeye flying, coupled with continued reductions in turn-time through new technologies and procedures, is expected to provide incremental revenue and cost savings,\" Southwest explained.\n\n[It will enable] Southwest to fund nearly all new capacity over the next three years without incremental aircraft capital deployment.\"\n\nCustomers can purchase the first flights to offer the extra legroom starting next year.\n\nThe airline is expected to deliver more details about these changes on an investor

It also plans to begin overnight flights, starting in February.\n\nSouthwest executives have said for years that they were studying such changes and hinted in April that the airline was seriously considering assigning seats and offering pricier seats with more legroom. The airline currently puts customers in one of three boarding groups and assigns a number, setting off a mad dash to check in a day before the flight. Customers can get earlier boarding though if they pay for a higher-priced ticket, they'll get a better boarding slot.\n\nWhen travelers choose a competitor over Southwest, the airline found in its research that its open seating model was the No. 1 reason for that choice, the carrier said in a release that outlined the changes. It also said 80% of its own customers prefer an assigned seat.\n\n\"Although our unique open seating model has been a part of Southwest Airlines since our inception, our thoughtful and extensive research makes it clear this is the right choice -- at the right time -- for our Customers, our People, and our Shareholders,\" CEO Bob Jordan said in a news release Thursday.\n\nSouthwest did not, however, unveil any changes to its beloved two free checked bags policy.\n\nThe airline is under even more pressure now to segment its product like other airlines after activist investor Elliott Investment Management disclosed in June a nearly $2 billion stake in Southwest and called for new leadership as the carrier underperformed competitors.\n\n\"We will adapt as our customers' needs adapt,\" Jordan said at an industry event last month.\n\nSouthwest said it expects about a third of the seats on its Boeing 737s will offer \"extended legroom, in line with that offered by industry peers on narrowbody aircraft.\" The Federal Aviation Administration would need to approve the cabin layouts, the airline added.\n\nThe Dallas-based carrier had prided itself and raked in steady profits for most of its more than five decades of flying on its simple business model. Jordan said last month that not assigning seats was easier to offer when planes weren't so full.\n\nAnalysts criticized Southwest for moving too slowly. Rival carriers offer a host of options to upsell customers like extra legroom seats, premium economy or business class.

The moves could also generate revenue and boost financial performance.\n\nSouthwest made the announcement on the same day that both it and American Airlines reported a steep drop in second-quarter profit despite higher revenue.\n\nAirlines are struggling with higher costs and reduced pricing power, especially on flights within the United States, as the industry adds flights faster than the growth in travel demand.\n\nSouthwest, based in Dallas, said its second-quarter profit fell 46% from a year earlier, to $367 million, as higher costs for labor, fuel and other expenses outstripped an increase in revenue. The results met Wall Street expectations.\n\nAmerican Airlines also reported a 46% drop in profit, to $717 million, and said it would break even in the third quarter -- well below Wall Street expectations for the July-through-September period.\n\nAmerican \"did not perform to our initial expectations\" because of a since-abandoned sales strategy and an oversupply of domestic flights, CEO Robert Isom said. He said the airline was responding with a strategy that boosts profits and \"makes it easy for customers to do business with American.\"\n\nSouthwest has used an open-seating model since its founding, with passengers lining up to board, then choosing their own seat once they are on the airplane. But, the airline said, preferences have \"evolved\" -- as more travelers take longer flights, they want an assigned seat.\n\nThe airline also said it will offer redeye flights for the first time.\n\nSouthwest said that its first overnight, redeye flights will land on Feb. 14, 2025 in nonstop markets that include Las Vegas to Baltimore and Orlando; Los Angeles to Baltimore and Nashville; and Phoenix to Baltimore. It plans to phase in additional redeye flights over time.\n\nThe change in seating policy comes as Southwest is under pressure from Elliott Investment Management. The hedge fund argues that the airline lags rivals in financial performance and has failed to change with the times.

But the change will also help the company charge some passengers more for their tickets.\n\n\"The research is clear and indicates that 80% of Southwest customers, and 86% of potential customers, prefer an assigned seat,\" said the airline in a statement. \"By moving to an assigned seating model, Southwest expects to broaden its appeal and attract more flying from its current and future customers.\"\n\nSouthwest did not give details about when the changes will go into effect, but it said it would be discussed further in September.\n\nA tectonic shift\n\nThe airline had announced in April that it was looking at a change in its seating policy that has been in effect for its entire 50 year history. Southwest is under pressure from activist investors who have been pushing for changes in management and growth in profitability.\n\nSouthwest has long been known as a low-cost, low-fare carrier, but it has been facing competition from the three other major carriers, American, United and Delta, which get much of their revenue from charging more for premium seating. It also faces growing rivalries on the other end of the spectrum: ultra-low cost carriers, such as Spirit and Frontier, which offer bargain-priced seats for which customers have to pay extra for just about anything including carry on bags.\n\nSouthwest doesn't charge for carry on bags and has long allowed passengers to check two bags for free. The airline also doesn't charge customers to change flights.\n\nThe company made no mention in its statement about whether it will change its baggage or change fee policy. The premium seats, which will offer more legroom, will not be available until 2025 as it will require reconfiguring its planes.\n\n(Copyright (c) 2024 CNN. All Rights Reserved.

The moves could also generate revenue and boost financial performance.\n\nSouthwest made the announcement on the same day that both it and American Airlines reported a steep drop in second-quarter profit despite higher revenue.\n\nAirlines are struggling with higher costs and reduced pricing power, especially on flights within the United States, as the industry adds flights faster than the growth in travel demand.\n\nSouthwest, based in Dallas, said its second-quarter profit fell 46% from a year earlier, to $367 million, as higher costs for labor, fuel and other expenses outstripped an increase in revenue. The results met Wall Street expectations.\n\nAmerican Airlines also reported a 46% drop in profit, to $717 million, and said it would break even in the third quarter -- well below Wall Street expectations for the July-through-September period.\n\nAmerican \"did not perform to our initial expectations\" because of a since-abandoned sales strategy and an oversupply of domestic flights, CEO Robert Isom said. He said the airline was responding with a strategy that boosts profits and \"makes it easy for customers to do business with American.\"\n\nSouthwest has used an open-seating model since its founding, with passengers lining up to board, then choosing their own seat once they are on the airplane. But, the airline said, preferences have \"evolved\" -- as more travelers take longer flights, they want an assigned seat.\n\nThe airline also said it will offer redeye flights for the first time.\n\nSouthwest said that its first overnight, redeye flights will land on Feb. 14, 2025 in nonstop markets that include Las Vegas to Baltimore and Orlando; Los Angeles to Baltimore and Nashville; and Phoenix to Baltimore. It plans to phase in additional redeye flights over time.\n\nThe change in seating policy comes as Southwest is under pressure from Elliott Investment Management. The hedge fund argues that the airline lags rivals in financial performance and has failed to change with the times. It wants to replace CEO Robert Jordan and Chairman Gary Kelly.\n\nShares of all major airlines dipped before the opening bell Thursday.

If you love flying with Southwest Airlines, there's an important update you need to know about. Southwest Airlines is changing its open seating policy, and we want to make sure you're ready for your next flight!\n\nFirst, let's talk about what open seating means. On most airlines, you get a specific seat number on your ticket. But Southwest does things differently! When you fly with them, you don't have an assigned seat. Instead, you choose your seat when you board the plane. This is called open seating, customers can pay extra to board early to get their preferred seat.\n\nSouthwest Airlines has decided to change its open seating policy to make the boarding process faster and more organized. This change aims to help passengers find seats more quickly, reduce the time planes spend at the gate, and ensure that everyone has a smoother experience.\n\nThe recently announced changes would allow the carrier to increase revenue by charging higher prices for premium tickets on all of its flights.\n\nSouthwest stated it intends to offer a premium, extended legroom section of the cabin, with approximately one-third of seats across the fleet offering extended legroom. That is consistent with what industry peers offer on narrow-body aircraft.\n\nSouthwest said the decision was made after research showed that 80% of its current and nearly 90% of potential customers prefer an allocated seat.\n\n\"When a customer elects to stop flying with Southwest and chooses a competitor, open seating is cited as the number one reason for the change,\" Southwest said in its Thursday release. \"By moving to an assigned seating model, Southwest expects to broaden its appeal and attract more flying from its current and future customers.\"\n\nRead More about this story by CLICKING HERE.\n\nThe changes to Southwest Airlines' open seating policy are designed to make flying easier and more enjoyable for everyone. Whether you're traveling for business or pleasure, these updates aim to enhance your flying experience.

The first overnight flights are slated for five initial nonstop markets: Las Vegas to Baltimore and Orlando; Los Angeles to Baltimore and Nashville; and Phoenix to Baltimore.\n\nSouthwest said it will release more details on changes during an investor day in September.", "source": {"uri": "theepochtimes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "www.theepochtimes.com"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Airline", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Airline"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Southwest_Airlines", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Southwest Airlines"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nashville,_Tennessee", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Nashville, Tennessee"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Nashville, Tennessee"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chief_executive_officer", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Chief executive officer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Las_Vegas", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Las Vegas"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Las Vegas"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los_Angeles", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phoenix,_Arizona", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Phoenix, Arizona"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Phoenix, Arizona"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baltimore", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Baltimore"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Baltimore"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orlando,_Florida", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Orlando, Florida"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Orlando, Florida"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jordan", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Jordan"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Jordan"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Transportation", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Transportation", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Transportation_and_Logistics/Aviation", "label": "dmoz/Business/Transportation and Logistics/Aviation", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Travel/Transportation", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Travel/Transportation", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Aviation/Simulation", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Aviation/Simulation", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 72}], "image": "https://img.theepochtimes.com/assets/uploads/2024/04/27/id5638876-Southwest_Flight_Attendants_24115733809981-1080x720.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9762572", "eventUri": "eng-9762572", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-07-25", "textStart": 132, "textEnd": 139}], "sentiment": 0.05098039215686279, "wgt": 198, "relevance": 1}

Charles Krupa/Associated Press\n\nSouthwest Airlines announced Thursday that it will do away with its longtime practice of open seating, abandoning a feature that helped establish its egalitarian identity in the name of boosting revenue and adapting to evolving customer tastes.\n\nThe carrier, long known for its unique model of having passengers board in groups of 30 and then choose their seats once on board, said it will now assign seats and unveil \"premium seating options\" that offer more legroom. In its announcement, the carrier said it expects that about one-third of seats across its fleet will have extra legroom. The company did not provide a timeline for the changes.\n\nThe move quickly drew negative reaction from die-hard Southwest fans who say the airline is jeopardizing its identity.\n\nSaty Reddy, a lawyer who lives in the Bay Area and flies Southwest frequently with his family, said the shift marks \"the end of the people's airline.\"\n\nBen\u00e9t J. Wilson, a veteran aviation journalist and Southwest superfan who lives in Baltimore, said she woke up to \"a ton of texts and messages from friends giving me this news.\" The new policies will inevitably make Southwest feel different - but also more like its competitors, she said.\n\n\"It's like another airline, any old plain airline,\" Wilson said. \"Southwest has swag and personality, bon vivant. Part of that was the open seating. Now I just feel like it will kind of change how the airline feels to me.\"\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSouthwest fan Grant Goodman, 24, sent a message to a reporter Thursday morning saying he felt betrayed. The Atlanta-based actor described himself as \"a dedicated front row, middle seat enthusiast.\"\n\n\"My favorite endurance hobby was checking in at the 24-hour mark,\" he said in an interview. \"The button - I got it down.\"\n\nGoodman said he appreciated how passengers could book a flight 48 hours before departure, check in 24 hours in advance and still have a shot at a seat upfront.\n\n\"It was basically like a democracy,\" he said.\n\nThe company acknowledged that changing the seating policy was a big shift for the airline, which boasts that it set out to \"democratize the sky\" with low-cost travel when it began offering service in 1971.\n\n\"Moving to assigned seating and offering premium legroom options will be a transformational change that cuts across almost all aspects of the company,\" Southwest CEO Bob Jordan said in a statement.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe company said its research showed that 80 percent of its customers and 86 percent of \"potential\" customers prefer an assigned seat.\n\n\"When a customer elects to stop flying with Southwest and chooses a competitor, open seating is cited as the number one reason for the change,\" it said in a news release.\n\nJordan first hinted at the change in April. \"Early indications both for our customers and for Southwest look pretty darn interesting,\" he said at the time.\n\nThe changes are the most significant shift in decades for the airline, which built its reputation as a scrappy discount underdog but has evolved to become one of the dominant carriers in the United States. Even so, Southwest has been under pressure to boost revenue. As other airlines have found ways to charge for various \"upgrades,\" including more legroom and early boarding, Southwest's model left it with few options.\n\nThe carrier will also begin offering overnight \"red-eye\" flights, confirming an announcement from earlier this year. It said the flights will begin in February, with the first overnight flight landing on Valentine's Day 2025.\n\nRyan Fisher, a digital marketing analyst and frequent Southwest flier based in Fort Lauderdale, Fla., said the switch is not a surprise, but it's still disappointing.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\"If people are willing to pay up for that seat guarantee, I get it,\" Fisher said in a direct message on X. \"I'm just not that person ... so this news overall is disappointing for a Southwest loyalist like myself.\"\n\nSouthwest fan Goodman anticipates that the airline's changes will result in higher prices for passengers. He expects Southwest to continue offering free checked bags, a differentiating perk the company's leadership has promised to keep. But he mourned the loss of the open-seating policy.\n\n\"It was the commoner's airline,\" he said. \"That feeling, I think, has kind of fallen a little bit.\"\n\nEdward Russell contributed to this report.\n\nCopy the Story Link\n\nSend questions/comments to the editors.\n\n\" Previous\n\nU.S. economy grew at a healthy 2.8% annual pace in the last quarter filed under: Southwest Airlines Related Stories Latest Articles", "source": {"uri": "pressherald.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Portland Press Herald"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Airline", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Airline"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Southwest_Airlines", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Southwest Airlines"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manchester\u2013Boston_Regional_Airport", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Manchester\u2013Boston Regional Airport"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/San_Francisco_Bay_Area", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "San Francisco Bay Area"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boeing_737", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Boeing 737"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Egalitarianism", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Egalitarianism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ton", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Ton"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Journalist", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Journalist"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lawyer", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Lawyer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aviation", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Aviation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manchester,_New_Hampshire", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Manchester, New Hampshire"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Manchester, New Hampshire"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baltimore", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Baltimore"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Baltimore"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ulysses_S._Grant", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Ulysses S.

It also plans to begin overnight flights, starting in February.\n\nSouthwest executives have said for years that they were studying such changes and hinted in April that the airline was seriously considering assigning seats and offering pricier seats with more legroom. The airline currently puts customers in one of three boarding groups and assigns a number, setting off a mad dash to check in a day before the flight. Customers can get earlier boarding though if they pay for a higher-priced ticket, they'll get a better boarding slot.\n\nWhen travelers choose a competitor over Southwest, the airline found in its research that its open seating model was the No. 1 reason for that choice, the carrier said in a release that outlined the changes. It also said 80% of its own customers prefer an assigned seat.\n\n\"Although our unique open seating model has been a part of Southwest Airlines since our inception, our thoughtful and extensive research makes it clear this is the right choice -- at the right time -- for our Customers, our People, and our Shareholders,\" CEO Bob Jordan said in a news release Thursday.\n\nSouthwest did not, however, unveil any changes to its beloved two free checked bags policy.\n\nThe airline is under even more pressure now to segment its product like other airlines after activist investor Elliott Investment Management disclosed in June a nearly $2 billion stake in Southwest and called for new leadership as the carrier underperformed competitors.\n\n\"We will adapt as our customers' needs adapt,\" Jordan said at an industry event last month.\n\nSouthwest said it expects about a third of the seats on its Boeing 737s will offer \"extended legroom, in line with that offered by industry peers on narrowbody aircraft.\" The Federal Aviation Administration would need to approve the cabin layouts, the airline added.\n\nThe Dallas-based carrier had prided itself and raked in steady profits for most of its more than five decades of flying on its simple business model. Jordan said last month that not assigning seats was easier to offer when planes weren't so full.\n\nAnalysts criticized Southwest for moving too slowly. Rival carriers offer a host of options to upsell customers like extra legroom seats, premium economy or business class.

That unfulfilled opportunity is a major tenet of Elliott's campaign -- that Southwest has refused to modernize its business to appeal to today's travelers.\n\nAdoption of premium seating could open the door for the carrier -- which has long appealed primarily to leisure travelers -- to potentially offer business- and first-class sections in the future.\n\nSouthwest still won't charge for checked bags. The \"bags fly free\" policy has been a focal point of Southwest promotions and advertisements, and some analysts have speculated charging for bags could cost the airline customers. It's the only US carrier that doesn't impose fees to check two.\n\nSouthwest will begin offering assigned seats and premium seating with more legroom next year. It will start flying overnight, cross-country routes on Feb. 13. Those flights are for sale from Las Vegas, Los Angeles and Phoenix to Baltimore/Washington International Thurgood Marshall Airport; Las Vegas to Orlando; and Los Angeles to Nashville.\n\nDetails on which seats will carry fees and the extra cost are still being decided, Southwest said. All seats will be assigned, but there won't be a separate cabin for premium offerings. The carrier has studied various seating options in the past, but always rejected a shift to assigned spots, saying passengers didn't support such a move.\n\nWhile Southwest has long stood by some of its central policies, it hasn't been entirely resistant to change. It began routes to nearby international destinations and, more recently, added flights to Hawaii. The airline previously revamped its boarding system, offered early boarding options at an additional cost and developed a corporate booking tool to win more business travelers.\n\nSouthwest said in April that it had begun evaluating premium products and others changes, well before Elliott disclosed a $1.9 billion stake last month.

In its announcement, the carrier said it expects that about one-third of seats across its fleet will have extra legroom. The company did not provide a timeline for the changes.\n\nThe move quickly drew negative reaction from die-hard Southwest fans who say the airline is jeopardizing its identity.\n\nSaty Reddy, a lawyer who lives in the Bay Area and flies Southwest frequently with his family, said the shift marks \"the end of the people's airline.\"\n\nBen\u00e9t J. Wilson, a veteran aviation journalist and Southwest superfan who lives in Baltimore, said she woke up to \"a ton of texts and messages from friends giving me this news.\" The new policies will inevitably make Southwest feel different - but also more like its competitors, she said.\n\n\"It's like another airline, any old plain airline,\" Wilson said. \"Southwest has swag and personality, bon vivant. Part of that was the open seating. Now I just feel like it will kind of change how the airline feels to me.\"\n\nSouthwest fan Grant Goodman, 24, sent a message to a reporter Thursday morning saying he felt betrayed. The Atlanta-based actor described himself as \"a dedicated front row, middle seat enthusiast.\"\n\n\"My favorite endurance hobby was checking in at the 24-hour mark,\" he said in an interview. \"The button - I got it down.\"\n\nGoodman said he appreciated how passengers could book a flight 48 hours before departure, check in 24 hours in advance and still have a shot at a seat upfront.\n\n\"It was basically like a democracy,\" he said.\n\nThe company acknowledged that changing the seating policy was a big shift for the airline, which boasts that it set out to \"democratize the sky\" with low-cost travel when it began offering service in 1971.\n\n\"Moving to assigned seating and offering premium legroom options will be a transformational change that cuts across almost all aspects of the company,\" Southwest CEO Bob Jordan said in a statement.\n\nThe company said its research showed that 80 percent of its customers and 86 percent of \"potential\" customers prefer an assigned seat.\n\n\"When a customer elects to stop flying with Southwest and chooses a competitor, open seating is cited as the number one reason for the change,\" it said in a news release.\n\nJordan first hinted at the change in April. \"Early indications both for our customers and for Southwest look pretty darn interesting,\" he said at the time.\n\nThe changes are the most significant shift in decades for the airline, which built its reputation as a scrappy discount underdog but has evolved to become one of the dominant carriers in the United States. Even so, Southwest has been under pressure to boost revenue. As other airlines have found ways to charge for various \"upgrades,\" including more legroom and early boarding, Southwest's model left it with few options.\n\nThe carrier will also begin offering overnight \"red-eye\" flights, confirming an announcement from earlier this year. It said the flights will begin in February, with the first overnight flight landing on Valentine's Day 2025.\n\nRyan Fisher, a digital marketing analyst and frequent Southwest flier based in Fort Lauderdale, Fla., said the switch is not a surprise, but it's still disappointing.\n\n\"If people are willing to pay up for that seat guarantee, I get it,\" Fisher said in a direct message on X. \"I'm just not that person ... so this news overall is disappointing for a Southwest loyalist like myself.\"\n\nSouthwest fan Goodman anticipates that the airline's changes will result in higher prices for passengers. He expects Southwest to continue offering free checked bags, a differentiating perk the company's leadership has promised to keep. But he mourned the loss of the open-seating policy.\n\n\"It was the commoner's airline,\" he said. \"That feeling, I think, has kind of fallen a little bit.\"", "source": {"uri": "m.thepeninsulaqatar.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "m.thepeninsulaqatar.com"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Airline", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Airline"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/San_Francisco_Bay_Area", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "San Francisco Bay Area"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Southwest_Airlines", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Southwest Airlines"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Egalitarianism", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Egalitarianism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Journalist", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Journalist"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lawyer", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Lawyer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aviation", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Aviation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baltimore", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Baltimore"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Baltimore"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ulysses_S._Grant", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Ulysses S.

Southwest discovered that preferences have changed over the years and the vast majority of travelers now want to know where they are sitting before they get to the airport.\n\nSouthwest's unusual boarding process started as a fast way to load passengers and limit the time that planes and crews spend sitting idly on the ground, not making money. It helped the airline operate more efficiently and even squeeze a few more flights into the daily schedule.\n\nPeople are also reading...

In the beginning, the first 30 to check in were put in the coveted \"A\" boarding group, guaranteeing them a window or aisle seat. Dawdlers landed in \"B,\" which was still OK, or \"C,\" which would often result in a middle seat.\n\nThe system became less democratic over time as Southwest let people pay extra to guarantee a spot near the front of the line. Despite that, many Southwest loyalists still love open seating. The airline thinks they will adapt.\n\n\"I know there are going to be customers who say, 'I want to stay with open seating.' It's a minority,\" Southwest CEO Robert Jordan told CNBC, \"but we had the same thing when we switched from plastic boarding passes. We had the same thing when we took peanuts out of the cabin. I'm convinced we can win them over.\"\n\nThe airline said surveys showed that 80% of its customers -- and 86% of \"potential\" customers -- want an assigned seat. Jordan said open seating was the top reason that travelers cited for choosing another airline over Southwest.\n\nListen now and subscribe: Apple Podcasts | Google Podcasts | Spotify | Stitcher | RSS Feed | SoundStack | All Of Our Podcasts\n\nIn addition to the seating switch, Southwest also plans to sell premium seating with more legroom - matching a practice that is standard among other large U.S. carriers - and to offer redeye flights for the first time.\n\nSouthwest said redeyes will start flying in mid-February on nonstop routes including Las Vegas to Baltimore and Orlando; Los Angeles to Baltimore and Nashville; and Phoenix to Baltimore, with more routes added over time.\n\nThe changes come as Southwest is under pressure from Elliott Investment Management. The hedge fund argues that the airline lags rivals in financial performance and has failed to change with the times. It wants to replace Jordan and Chairman Gary Kelly.\n\nSouthwest also faces increased scrutiny from the Federal Aviation Administration after a series of worrisome flights, including one that dove within 400 feet of the ocean off Hawaii, two that flew at extremely low altitudes while still miles from landing at airports in Oklahoma and Florida, and another that was discovered to have rudder-area damage after an unusual \"Dutch roll\" wiggle during a flight.\n\nSouthwest announced the seating move and other changes on the same day that both it and American Airlines reported a steep drop in second-quarter profit despite higher revenue.\n\nAirlines are struggling with higher costs and reduced pricing power, especially on flights within the United States, as the industry adds flights faster than the growth in travel demand.\n\nSouthwest, based in Dallas, said its second-quarter profit fell 46% from a year earlier, to $367 million, as higher costs for labor, fuel and other expenses outstripped an increase in revenue. The results met Wall Street expectations.\n\nAmerican Airlines also reported a 46% drop in profit, to $717 million, and said it would break even in the third quarter -- well below Wall Street expectations of 48 cents per share profit in the July-through-September period.\n\nAmerican \"did not perform to our initial expectations\" because of a since-abandoned sales strategy and an oversupply of domestic flights, CEO Robert Isom said. He said the airline was responding with a strategy that boosts profits and \"makes it easy for customers to do business with American.\"\n\nAmerican cut its forecast of full-year earnings to between 70 cents and $1.30 per share, down from a previous prediction of $2.25 to $3.25 per share.\n\nShares of the leading U.S. airlines rose after the opening bell Thursday.

(Angus Mordant/Bloomberg)\n\nSouthwest Airlines Co. will begin offering assigned seats, ditching the free-for-all policy that has been a defining feature of the carrier for more than half a century.\n\nThe airline announced the seismic change to its business model Thursday alongside a new premium-class option and plans for redeye flights -- shifts the company sees boosting sales and enhancing its appeal. While Southwest said earlier this year that it was reconsidering the seating policy, it's now facing heightened pressure to revamp underperforming operations from activist investor Elliott Investment Management.\n\nThe strains on Southwest's business were underscored in the company's earnings report, also released Thursday. While profit last quarter beat expectations, its guidance for revenue and costs in the current period was worse than Wall Street's estimates.\n\n\"We are taking urgent and deliberate steps to mitigate near-term revenue challenges and implement longer-term transformational initiatives,\" Chief Executive Officer Bob Jordan said in a statement. He pointed to the seating changes as pieces of \"an ongoing and comprehensive upgrade\" to passenger accommodations.\n\nIts shares fell 4% as of 6:52 a.m. in New York following the release of financial results.\n\nThe airline has struggled this year with slowing growth, fewer-than-expected aircraft deliveries from Boeing Co. and a series of flight-safety incidents that triggered a Federal Aviation Administration review of the carrier this week. Southwest's stock has declined modestly this year even as the broader market has gained.\n\nThe latest steps represent a strategic shift for the carrier, which has steadfastly maintained open seating while other airlines raked in revenue by charging extra for more-desirable seats. That unfulfilled opportunity is a major tenet of Elliott's campaign - that Southwest has refused to modernize its business to appeal to today's travelers.\n\nAdoption of premium seating could open the door for the carrier -- which has long appealed primarily to leisure travelers -- to potentially offer business- and first-class sections in the future.\n\nSouthwest still won't charge for checked bags. The \"bags fly free\" policy has been a focal point of Southwest promotions and advertisements, and some analysts have speculated charging for bags could cost the airline customers. It's the only US carrier that doesn't impose fees to check two. Redeye Flights\n\nSouthwest will begin offering assigned seats and premium seating with more legroom next year. It will start flying overnight, cross-country routes on Feb. 13. Those flights are already on sale from Las Vegas, Los Angeles and Phoenix to Baltimore/Washington International Thurgood Marshall Airport; Las Vegas to Orlando; and Los Angeles to Nashville.\n\nSouthwest didn't provide specifics on potential revenue from the changes, which also include a redesign of its boarding process. All seats will be assigned, and about one-third will be premium class, but there won't be a separate cabin for premium offerings. Changes to the onboard layout will require FAA approval.\n\nThe airline said it opted to adopt the updates after its own research found that 80% of current customers and 86% of potential passengers prefer an assigned seat, particularly during the larger number of longer flights operated by Southwest now. Southwest Chief Commercial Officer Ryan Green will be moved to a new position to oversee the transformation and other commercial initiatives.\n\nThe carrier has studied various seating options in the past, but always rejected a shift to assigned spots, saying passengers didn't support such a move.\n\nWhile Southwest has long stood by some of its central policies, it hasn't been entirely resistant to change. It began routes to nearby international destinations and, more recently, added flights to Hawaii. The airline previously revamped its boarding system, offered early boarding options at an additional cost and developed a corporate booking tool to win more business travelers.\n\nSouthwest said in April that it had begun evaluating premium products and others changes, well before Elliott disclosed a $1.9 billion stake last month. But until Thursday, the airline said it wouldn't disclose any details until an investor meeting slated for September.\n\nElliott wants to oust Jordan and Chairman Gary Kelly for poor execution and a \"stubborn unwillingness to evolve the company's strategy.\" They are \"not up to the task of modernizing Southwest,\" the activist has said.\n\nSouthwest earlier this month named a veteran airline industry executive to its board to help address other concerns raised by Elliott. The carrier also adopted a \"poison pill\" shareholder rights plan to discourage the activist from gaining a larger share. Quarterly Results\n\nIn addition to policy changes, Southwest said Thursday that it earned an adjusted profit of 58 cents a share in the second quarter. That topped the 51-cent average of analyst estimates compiled by Bloomberg. Operating revenue of $7.4 billion also beat expectations.\n\nStill, the carrier acknowledged challenges from an industrywide capacity glut. Domestic-focused US airlines have had to slash fares to fill planes after the industry added too much capacity in anticipation of a record summer travel season. The discounting has cut into revenue and profit expectations at even the largest US airlines.\n\nSouthwest said it's made changes to better match the supply of seats with demand in the remaining summer, fall and early winter schedules. But fare management issues that reduced unit revenue in the first three months will extend into this quarter.\n\nThe recent performance \"fell short of what we believe we are capable of delivering,\" Jordan said.\n\nIts outlook for key sales and cost measures were worse than Wall Street estimates. Third-quarter revenue for each seat flown a mile, a gauge of demand and fares, will be flat to down 2% year over year, the airline said, while analysts were expecting growth of 4.9%. Non-fuel costs on the same basis will increase as much as 13%, compared with analysts' estimates for a 6.8% rise.", "source": {"uri": "stripes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Stars and Stripes"},

The airline previously revamped its boarding system, offered early boarding options at an additional cost and developed a corporate booking tool to win more business travelers.\n\nSouthwest said in April that it had begun evaluating premium products and others changes, well before Elliott disclosed a $1.9 billion stake last month. But until Thursday, the airline said it wouldn't disclose any details until an investor meeting slated for September.\n\nElliott wants to oust Jordan and Chairman Gary Kelly for poor execution and a \"stubborn unwillingness to evolve the company's strategy.\" They are \"not up to the task of modernizing Southwest,\" the activist has said.\n\nSouthwest earlier this month named a veteran airline industry executive to its board to help address other concerns raised by Elliott. The carrier also adopted a \"poison pill\" shareholder rights plan to discourage the activist from gaining a larger share.\n\nIn addition to policy changes, Southwest said Thursday that it earned an adjusted profit of 58 cents a share in the second quarter. That topped the 51-cent average of analyst estimates compiled by Bloomberg. Operating revenue of $7.4 billion also beat expectations.\n\nStill, the carrier acknowledged challenges from an industrywide capacity glut. Domestic-focused US airlines have had to slash fares to fill planes after the industry added too much capacity in anticipation of a record summer travel season. The discounting has cut into revenue and profit expectations at even the largest US airlines.\n\nSouthwest said it's made changes to better match the supply of seats with demand in the remaining summer, fall and early winter schedules. But fare management issues that reduced unit revenue in the first three months will extend into this quarter.\n\nThe recent performance \"fell short of what we believe we are capable of delivering,\" Jordan said.\n\nIts outlook for key sales and cost measures were worse than Wall Street estimates. Third-quarter revenue for each seat flown a mile, a gauge of demand and fares, will be flat to down 2% year over year, the airline said, while analysts were expecting growth of 4.9%. Non-fuel costs on the same basis will increase as much as 13%, compared with analysts' estimates for a 6.8% rise.", "source": {"uri": "matzav.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "matzav.com"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Airline", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Airline"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elliott_Investment_Management", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Elliott Investment Management"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_(state)", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "New York (state)"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Southwest_Airlines", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Southwest Airlines"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Business_model", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Business model"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boeing", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Boeing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Aviation_Administration", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Federal Aviation Administration"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chief_executive_officer", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Chief executive officer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Las_Vegas", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Las Vegas"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Las Vegas"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los_Angeles", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jordan", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Jordan"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Jordan"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baltimore/Washington_International_Airport", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Baltimore/Washington International Airport"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Southwest_Chief", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Southwest Chief"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nashville,_Tennessee", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Nashville, Tennessee"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Nashville, Tennessee"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wall_Street", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Wall Street"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phoenix,_Arizona", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Phoenix, Arizona"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Phoenix, Arizona"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orlando,_Florida", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Orlando, Florida"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Orlando, Florida"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chairperson", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Chairperson"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shareholder_rights_plan", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Shareholder rights plan"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bloomberg_L.P.", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Bloomberg L.P."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_dollar", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "United States dollar"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hawaii", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Hawaii"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Hawaii"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Transportation", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Transportation", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Transportation_and_Logistics/Aviation", "label": "dmoz/Business/Transportation and Logistics/Aviation", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Travel/Transportation", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Travel/Transportation", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Financial_Services/Leasing_Services", "label": "dmoz/Business/Financial Services/Leasing Services", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 91}], "image": "https://matzav.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/636619808645417189-mke-southwest.jpeg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9762572", "eventUri": "eng-9762572", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "date": "-02-13", "textStart": 2556, "textEnd": 2563}], "sentiment": 0.05882352941176472, "wgt": 194, "relevance": 1}

Even though the airline has been known for its unique seating model for more than 50 years, preferences have evolved, with more customers taking longer flights where they prefer a seat assignment, the statement said. The new policy was reported earlier by The Wall Street Journal.\n\nThe changes bring Southwest, which for years has distinguished itself by offering low prices and a simple business approach, more in line with conventional airlines like American Airlines and United Airlines.\n\nAirlines have tinkered with ways to make boarding more efficient since they started charging for checked bags 15 years ago. That change led more people to bring carry-on luggage and increased demand for early boarding to compete for space in overhead bins.\n\nUnited Airlines last year updated its boarding process so that passengers in economy with window seats and exit rows would board the plane before people in the middle and aisle seats. The change, which affected domestic flights and some international ones, was expected to cut up to two minutes from boarding time on each flight, according to an internal memo shared with The New York Times in October.\n\nSouthwest's new plans came as it faced significant challenges in achieving its growth plans. The airline reported a loss of $231 million for the first quarter, worse than analysts expected, sending its share price down 10 percent in early trading. Southwest, which flies only Boeing 737 planes, said in April that delayed deliveries of Boeing planes had caused it to struggle. In January, a panel of a Boeing 737 blew out during an Alaska Airlines flight, leading to a slowdown in production as Boeing faced increased regulatory scrutiny over its quality control.\n\nSouthwest in April said that it was studying the implication of ending its open-seating policy after listening to customers and conducting extensive research. This included more than eight million simulation-based boarding trials, the airline said, adding that it was confident the changes would \"not compromise the airline's operational efficiency.\"\n\nWhile some passengers love Southwest's open seating policy, especially when flights are empty, Southwest said that open seating was the top reason that customers cited for choosing airlines other than Southwest.\n\nCurrently, Southwest has open seating for Groups A through C, each with a boarding position numbered 1 through 60 or higher. Passengers line up by number, assigned by order of check-in, with some exceptions for frequent fliers and people who pay more for boarding upgrades or pricier ticket options.\n\nSouthwest said on Thursday that it would also soon start offering seats with extra legroom, a plan that the airline said it would give more details about in late September. About a third of the seats on each flight would offer extended legroom, the statement said.\n\nStarting next February, Southwest will also introduce overnight flights, initially on five routes: Las Vegas to Baltimore and Orlando; Los Angeles to Baltimore and Nashville; and Phoenix to Baltimore. These scheduling changes were expected to provide incremental revenue increases and cost savings, the airline said.", "source": {"uri": "nytimes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The New York Times"}, "authors": [{"uri": "jenny_gross@nytimes.com", "name": "Jenny Gross", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Southwest_Airlines", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Southwest Airlines"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Airline", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Airline"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Airlines", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United Airlines"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trademark", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Trademark"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shareholder", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Shareholder"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jordan", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Jordan"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Jordan"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boeing_737", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Boeing 737"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Wall_Street_Journal", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "The Wall Street Journal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Airlines", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "American Airlines"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boeing", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Boeing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Airliner", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Airliner"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_New_York_Times", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "The New York Times"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Airport_check-in", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Airport check-in"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alaska_Airlines", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Alaska Airlines"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nashville,_Tennessee", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Nashville, Tennessee"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Nashville, Tennessee"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Las_Vegas", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Las Vegas"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Las Vegas"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los_Angeles", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phoenix,_Arizona", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Phoenix, Arizona"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Phoenix, Arizona"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baltimore", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Baltimore"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Baltimore"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orlando,_Florida", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Orlando, Florida"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Orlando, Florida"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Transportation", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Transportation", "wgt": 21}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Transportation_and_Logistics/Aviation", "label": "dmoz/Business/Transportation and Logistics/Aviation", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Travel/Transportation", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Travel/Transportation", "wgt": 18}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Aviation/Multimedia", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Aviation/Multimedia", "wgt": 16}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Aviation/Simulation", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Aviation/Simulation", "wgt": 16}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 97}], "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/07/25/multimedia/25xp-southwest/25xp-southwest-videoSixteenByNine3000.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9762572", "eventUri": "eng-9762572", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.04313725490196085, "wgt": 192, "relevance": 1}

Today, the carrier announced that's set to change, as it plans to introduce assigned seats and premium seating options. The announcement coincided with disappointing second-quarter profits, which dropped 46% from a year prior.\n\nSouthwest Airlines changes course based on customer research\n\nBefore making the change, Southwest conducted consumer research, which showed a strong preference for assigned seats. Additionally, the new policy should strengthen revenue and improve financial results.\n\nRecommended Videos\n\nAccording to Southwest, \"The research is clear and indicates that 80% of Southwest customers, and 86% of potential customers, prefer an assigned seat. When a customer elects to stop flying with Southwest and chooses a competitor, open seating is cited as the number one reason for the change. By moving to an assigned seating model, Southwest expects to broaden its appeal and attract more flying from its current and future customers.\"\n\nBesides that, premium seating options with enhanced legroom cater to another research-based passenger preference. Though cabin designs are yet to be finalized, Southwest plans about one-third of seating fleet-wide to be premium.\n\nBob Jordan, President, CEO, & Vice Chairman of the Board at Southwest, stated, \"Although our unique open seating model has been a part of Southwest Airlines since our inception, our thoughtful and extensive research makes it clear this is the right choice -- at the right time -- for our customers, our people, and our shareholders.\"\n\n\"We are excited to incorporate customer and employee feedback to design a unique experience that only Southwest can deliver. We have been building purposefully to this change as part of a comprehensive upgrade to the Southwest experience as we focus on customer expectations - and it will unlock new sources of revenue consistent with our laser focus on delivering improved financial performance.\"\n\nEditors' Recommendations Luxury in the skies: Alaska Airlines expands first-class and premium seating Save on your getaway: Fiji Airways begins partnership with this U.S. carrier Visiting Sonoma?

He said the airline was responding with a strategy that boosts profits and \"makes it easy for customers to do business with American.\"\n\nSouthwest's unusual boarding process started decades ago as a way for the airline to save money by reducing the amount of time it took for a plane to land, load new passengers, and take off again -- turn time, as it is called in the business.\n\nMost airlines assign each passenger to a seat when they buy a ticket. Southwest requires customers to check in exactly 24 hours before departure unless they pay extra to guarantee a better place in the boarding line. Those who hate it call it a \"cattle call\" but many Southwest loyalists love it.\n\nHowever, as flights have become more full it has gotten harder to score a window or aisle seat without paying extra. Also, some passengers appear to game the system: They use a wheelchair to get to the gate, where they are given priority in boarding, then miraculously walk off the plane without assistance after the flight.\n\nThe airline said in surveys 80% of its customers -- and 86% of \"potential\" customers -- want an assigned seat. It said open seating is the top reason that travelers stop flying Southwest and choose another airline.\n\nSouthwest also said it will offer redeye flights for the first time.\n\nSouthwest said that its first overnight, redeye flights will land on Feb. 14, 2025, on nonstop routes including Las Vegas to Baltimore and Orlando; Los Angeles to Baltimore and Nashville; and Phoenix to Baltimore. It plans to add more redeyes over time.\n\nThe changes in seating policy and redeye flights come as Southwest is under pressure from Elliott Investment Management. The hedge fund argues that the airline lags rivals in financial performance and has failed to change with the times. It wants to replace CEO Robert Jordan and Chairman Gary Kelly.\n\nThe airline said it will provide more details about its upcoming changes at an investor day in September.\n\nShares of all major airlines dipped before the opening bell Thursday. Southwest Airlines Co. fell 6% and American Airlines Group Inc. fell 7%. Delta, JetBlue and United slipped more than 1%.\n\nAirfares are down, but baggage fees are up Low-cost airlines are reshaping how we pay for flights The rise of low-cost carriers How to navigate low-cost carrier fees\n\nCopyright 2024 The Associated Press.

There's been a trend towards premium, and also long haul international, both of which the airline has been unable to take advantage of. Their product and route network haven't aligned with what customers have most wanted to buy.\n\nThey're expected to offer extra legroom seats at the front of the cabin, in what's being referred to as Love Cabin. These seats would be assigned. Southwest could offer blocked middle seats for sale in Love Cabin, along the lines of Frontier, where the airline sells a seat block to both the aisle and middle seat passenger as an option. And they're preparing to increase fleet utilization - cheaper additional flying using current aircraft - by offering redeye flights for the first time. New union contracts now provide for redeye operations, and the airline no longer has to turn their systems off and on in a reset each night which required operations to halt.\n\nWe'll have to wait for details on what kind of basic economy product they might offer as a replacement for their cheapest Wanna Get Away fare. Presumably these passengers would board last and have last choice of seats, and perhaps change restrictions as well. This would likely be a new 'Group D' boarding that permitted only a small personal item, and only one free checked bag.\n\nSouthwest has quietly loaded their first redeye flights into the system. Routes discovered, but not yet announced, so far include:\n\nWe will certainly see Hawaii redeye flights. Currently Southwest can't really sell most connections to the middle of the country and east coast without an overnight stop without flying redeyes.\n\nThe current expectation is that we'll begin seeing extra legroom seats coming quickly - four rows at the front of cabins plus exit row seats available only for those with these seats pre-assigned. Planes could begin reconfiguration as soon as September, and would be rapidly cycled through the fleet over the course of just several months. While I imagine this could slip, there is talk of targeting February 1, 2025 for selling these assigned seats.\n\nThis would mean that Southwest partially abandons 'open seating' and also that those with preboarding would only be permitted to sit behind row four.\n\nSouthwest is also rumored to be eliminating seat saving. No more spreading out bags of donuts on seats so that one passenger can reserve seats for friends and family with lower boarding order, such as basic economy.\n\nIf the airline is going to further monetize its boarding process, it makes no sense to allow one member of a large party to pull everyone else in basic economy forward.", "source": {"uri": "viewfromthewing.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "View from the Wing"}, "authors": [{"uri": "gary_leff@viewfromthewing.com", "name": "Gary Leff", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Airline", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Airline"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Delta_Air_Lines", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Delta Air Lines"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Southwest_Airlines", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Southwest Airlines"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Airlines", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "American Airlines"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Business_model", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Business model"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doughnut", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Doughnut"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Airplane", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Airplane"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hawaii", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Hawaii"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Hawaii"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Transportation", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Transportation", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Travel/Transportation", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Travel/Transportation", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Aviation/Simulation", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Aviation/Simulation", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 84}], "image": "https://viewfromthewing.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/southwest-airlines-hawaii.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9762572", "eventUri": "eng-9762572", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1215686274509804, "wgt": 191, "relevance": 1}

We are excited to incorporate customer and employee feedback to design a unique experience that only Southwest can deliver.\"\n\nIn May, the airline began listing airfares on Google Flights, making it easier for travelers to compare their options on a single dashboard.\n\nA Southwest spokesperson said the move, which the carrier said it's testing, broadens its reach with consumers while allowing the company to retain control of the booking process.", "source": {"uri": "cbsnews.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "CBS News"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Airline", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Airline"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baltimore", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Baltimore"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Baltimore"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vice_President_of_the_United_States", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Vice President of the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Valentine's_Day", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Valentine's Day"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nashville,_Tennessee", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Nashville, Tennessee"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Nashville, Tennessee"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chief_executive_officer", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Chief executive officer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Las_Vegas", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Las Vegas"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Las Vegas"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los_Angeles", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phoenix,_Arizona", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Phoenix, Arizona"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Phoenix, Arizona"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orlando,_Florida", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Orlando, Florida"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Orlando, Florida"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jordan", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Jordan"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Jordan"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chairperson", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Chairperson"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google_Flights", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Google Flights"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Southwest_Airlines", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Southwest Airlines"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Transportation", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Transportation", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Travel/Transportation", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Travel/Transportation", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Aviation/Multimedia", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Aviation/Multimedia", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Aviation/Simulation", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Aviation/Simulation", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 62}], "image": "https://assets3.cbsnewsstatic.com/hub/i/r/2024/03/15/ea253f1a-c952-4cbe-9dc5-c84a3bfa4fd6/thumbnail/1200x630/91956c479379d84264bfbc977b8551b9/2024-03-12t104932z-1057595617-rc29k6a2i5nv-rtrmadp-3-boeing-737max-southwest.jpg?v=5501038cbc281520ff9fdc308faab7dc", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9762572", "eventUri": "eng-9762572", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.003921568627450966, "wgt": 190, "relevance": 1}

The moves could also generate revenue and boost financial performance.\n\nSouthwest made the announcement on the same day that both it and American Airlines reported a steep drop in second-quarter profit despite higher revenue.\n\nAirlines are struggling with higher costs and reduced pricing power, especially on flights within the United States, as the industry adds flights faster than the growth in travel demand.\n\nCardinals' TV ratings on record-low pace amid continuing distribution problems: Media Views Tammie Holland, longtime St. Louis radio personality, dies at 53 Third bear sighting reported in southern Illinois, sheriff says Former St. Louis Rams lineman ordered to pay $500,000 to injured worker Woman from Valley Park drowns in Big River trying to help another canoeist Kohn's Kosher Deli facing lawsuit of nearly $150,000 Ranch in Wildwood is sanctuary for abused miniature horses O'Fallon, Mo., woman charged with making politically motivated false child sex abuse claim Messenger: A disturbing twist in the case of security guards who tackled BJC patient St. Louis Public Schools halts hiring over questions on new administrator from Texas BenFred: So, you're looking to trade with the Cardinals.

Ankle injury interrupts Tommy Edman's rehab games, delays his return: Cardinals Extra Judge pauses $500 monthly checks to poor St. Louis families\n\nSouthwest, based in Dallas, said its second-quarter profit fell 46% from a year earlier, to $367 million, as higher costs for labor, fuel and other expenses outstripped an increase in revenue. The results met Wall Street expectations.\n\nAmerican Airlines also reported a 46% drop in profit, to $717 million, and said it would break even in the third quarter -- well below Wall Street expectations of 48 cents per share profit in the July-through-September period.\n\nAmerican \"did not perform to our initial expectations\" because of a since-abandoned sales strategy and an oversupply of domestic flights, CEO Robert Isom said. He said the airline was responding with a strategy that boosts profits and \"makes it easy for customers to do business with American.\"\n\nSouthwest's unusual boarding process started decades ago as a way for the airline to save money by reducing the amount of time it took for a plane to land, load new passengers, and take off again -- turn time, as it is called in the business.\n\nMost airlines assign each passenger to a seat when they buy a ticket. Southwest requires customers to check in exactly 24 hours before departure unless they pay extra to guarantee a better place in the boarding line. Those who hate it call it a \"cattle call\" but many Southwest loyalists love it.\n\nHowever, as flights have become more full it has gotten harder to score a window or aisle seat without paying extra. Also, some passengers appear to game the system: They use a wheelchair to get to the gate, where they are given priority in boarding, then miraculously walk off the plane without assistance after the flight.\n\nThe airline said in surveys 80% of its customers -- and 86% of \"potential\" customers -- want an assigned seat. It said open seating is the top reason that travelers stop flying Southwest and choose another airline.\n\nSouthwest also said it will offer redeye flights for the first time.\n\nSouthwest said that its first overnight, redeye flights will land on Feb. 14, 2025, on nonstop routes including Las Vegas to Baltimore and Orlando; Los Angeles to Baltimore and Nashville; and Phoenix to Baltimore. It plans to add more redeyes over time.\n\nThe changes in seating policy and redeye flights come as Southwest is under pressure from Elliott Investment Management. The hedge fund argues that the airline lags rivals in financial performance and has failed to change with the times. It wants to replace CEO Robert Jordan and Chairman Gary Kelly.\n\nThe airline said it will provide more details about its upcoming changes at an investor day in September.\n\nShares of all major airlines dipped before the opening bell Thursday. Southwest Airlines Co. fell 6% and American Airlines Group Inc. fell 7%. Delta, JetBlue and United slipped more than 1%.\n\nCopyright 2024 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.

But the change will also help the company charge some passengers more for their tickets.\n\n\"The research is clear and indicates that 80% of Southwest customers, and 86% of potential customers, prefer an assigned seat,\" said the airline in a statement. \"By moving to an assigned seating model, Southwest expects to broaden its appeal and attract more flying from its current and future customers.\"\n\nSouthwest did not give details about when the changes will go into effect, but it said it would be discussed further in September.\n\nThe airline had announced in April that it was looking at a change in its seating policy that has been in effect for its entire 50 year history. Southwest is under pressure from activist investors who have been pushing for changes in management and growth in profitability.\n\nSouthwest has long been known as a low-cost, low-fare carrier, but it has been facing competition from the three other major carriers, American, United and Delta, which get much of their revenue from charging more for premium seating. It also faces growing rivalries on the other end of the spectrum: ultra-low cost carriers, such as Spirit and Frontier, which offer bargain-priced seats for which customers have to pay extra for just about anything including carry on bags.\n\nSouthwest doesn't charge for carry on bags and has long allowed passengers to check two bags for free.

They discovered that when customers chose a competitor, open seating was cited as the number one reason for the change.\n\nIn addition to assigning seats, Southwest will offer a premium, extended legroom portion of the cabin, \"strongly preferred\" by many customers. While specific cabin layout details are still in design, Southwest expects roughly one-third of seats across the fleet to offer extended legroom, in line with that offered by industry peers on narrowbody aircraft.\n\nThe decision to update the seating and boarding model is part of Southwest's ongoing modernization efforts. During the past two years, they've made improvements such as faster WiFi, in-seat power, and larger overhead bins. Work is underway on a refreshed cabin design, including new, more comfortable Recaro seats.\n\n\"Moving to assigned seating and offering premium legroom options will be a transformational change that cuts across almost all aspects of the Company,\" said Bob Jordan, President, CEO, & Vice Chairman of the Board. \"Although our unique open seating model has been a part of Southwest Airlines since our inception, our thoughtful and extensive research makes it clear this is the right choice -- at the right time -- for our Customers, our People, and our Shareholders.\"\n\nRedeye Flights Now for Sale\n\nSouthwest is also adding 24-hour operation capabilities with the introduction of overnight, redeye flights. Booking on initial routes is available today through Southwest.com, with the first overnight flights landing on Valentine's Day 2025 in five initial nonstop markets:\n\nSouthwest plans to phase in additional redeye flying in the carrier's coming schedules as part of its multi-year transformation to a 24-hour operation.\n\nRedeye flying, coupled with continued reductions in turn-time through new technologies and procedures, is expected to provide incremental revenue and cost savings, enabling Southwest to fund nearly all new capacity over the next three years without incremental aircraft capital deployment.\n\nNew EVP Commercial Transformation\n\nGiven the significance of the changes, Ryan Green, previously Executive Vice President, & Chief Commercial Officer, will take on the new role of Executive Vice President Commercial Transformation, leading development and rollout of these and other commercial initiatives already underway. Green has deep knowledge of Customer trends and currently leads the work on cabin transformation. He previously directed efforts to transform Southwest Airlines' Rapid Rewards\u00ae loyalty program and the digital Customer experience. He reports to President, CEO, & Vice Chairman of the Board Bob Jordan in this new role.\n\nThe Company will share further details about product designs, cabin layout, timing, and incremental financial value at its Investor Day in late September.

transform customer experience and improve financial performance,\" and stating in a press release that adding assigned seats and premium seating meets \"evolving customer preferences.\"\n\nSouthwest

\"We have been building purposefully to this change as part of a comprehensive upgrade to the Southwest experience as we focus on Customer expectations -- and it will unlock new sources of revenue consistent with our laser focus on delivering improved financial performance.\"\n\nThe company has not yet said when the seating changes will go into effect, but plans to provide more details on the product designs, cabin layout and timing at its Investor Day in late September.\n\nAny new cabin layout in this seating transformation will need to undergo approvals from the Federal Aviation Administration.\n\nSouthwest conducted \"robust operational testing\" of both live and more than 8 million simulation-based boarding trials, citing research that showed 80% of its customers and 86% of potential customers prefer an assigned seat.\n\n\"When a customer elects to stop flying with Southwest and chooses a competitor, open seating is cited as the number one reason for the change,\" the

fell short of expectations, according to Jordan.\n\nSouthwest's RASM (Revenue per Available Seat Mile), which is a measure of total revenue from each seat flown per mile, regardless of whether it's empty or full, has decreased by 3.8% year-over-year.\n\nThe CEO said the airline is \"taking urgent and deliberate steps to mitigate near-term revenue challenges and implement longer-term transformational initiatives\" to help with financial top and bottom line growth.\n\n\"As we announced this morning, our implementation of assigned and premium seating is part of an ongoing and

And here's what they saw and what they're going to start doing as early as this fall:\n\nAssigned and Premium Seating\n\nOpen seating has been a hallmark of Southwest for a long time, but unfortunately, some travelers have ruined the experience for the rest of us. Recently, one family put grandma in a wheelchair so she - and the entire family - could board first and have their choice of seats. No mas. In doing its homework, Southwest noted that customer preferences have evolved with more people taking longer flights where a seat assignment is preferred.\n\nOpen-seating has cost the airline dearly. It said that when a customer elects to stop flying with Southwest and chooses a competitor, open seating is cited as the number one reason for the change. It feels that assigned seating will broaden its appeal and encourage more current and future customers to fly Southwest.\n\nAnd, like other airlines, there will be an option to upgrade to extended legroom seating, too. It's too early to tell how many of those seats will be available per plane because cabin layout details are still in design, but Southwest expects roughly one-third of seats across the fleet to offer extended legroom.\n\nRedeye flights for sale\n\nRedeye flights are a good thing for the airlines that have them - increased aircraft utilization and lower operating costs. They're good for travelers, too, because they are usually cheaper, a fact not lost on Southwest.\n\nWith that knowledge well in hand, the airline is adding 24-hour operation capabilities with the introduction of overnight flights beginning Valentine's Day 2025 in five initial nonstop markets: Las Vegas to Baltimore and Orlando; Los Angeles to Baltimore and Nashville; and Phoenix to Baltimore.\n\nAfter those are off the ground and all the kinks worked out, Southwest plans to phase in additional redeye flying as part of its multi-year transformation to a 24-hour operation.\n\nSouthwest said that redeye flying, coupled with continued reductions in turn-time through new technologies and procedures, is a win-win. The traveler gets a good deal and redeye flights are expected to provide increased revenue and cost savings. \"enabling Southwest to fund nearly all new capacity over the next three years without incremental aircraft capital deployment.\"\n\nWill this mean that other airlines are going to start paying more attention to what consumers give a darn about?

The airline added that details about seating products -- including cabin layout, the timing of cabin conversions and how much incremental revenue will be generated -- will be provided at a September investor day event. Cabin reconfigurations will require FAA approval.\n\n\"Moving to assigned seating and offering premium legroom options will be a transformational change that cuts across almost all aspects of the company,\" CEO Bob Jordan said Thursday. \"Although our unique open-seating model has been a part of Southwest Airlines since our inception, our thoughtful and extensive research makes it clear this is the right choice -- at the right time -- for our customers, our people and our shareholders. We are excited to incorporate customer and employee feedback to design a unique experience that only Southwest can deliver.\"\n\nSouthwest had telegraphed plans to begin assigning seats, as well as potential considerations for cabin reconfigurations, in late April. The moves have been spurred by the airline's underperformance financially compared to its primary competitors, especially United and Delta.\n\nA consumer shift toward premium seats since the pandemic is a key reason for Southwest's anemic financial performance in recent years.\n\nSouthwest is also facing pressure from activist investment firm Elliott Management, which took an 11% stake in the company in June and called for commercial changes as well as the replacement of Jordan and board chairman Gary Kelly. Jordan refused to step down.\n\nSouthwest said Thursday that it has conducted over 8 million simulation-based boarding trials. In addition, airline research indicates that more 80% of its customers and 86% of potential customers prefer an assigned seat.\n\n\"When a customer elects to stop flying with Southwest and chooses a competitor, open seating is cited as the No. 1 reason for the change,\" the airline said. \"By moving to an assigned-seating model, Southwest expects to broaden its appeal and attract more flying from its current and future customers.\"\n\nUpending its boarding process and adding extra-legroom seats aren't the only initiatives Southwest announced Thursday.\n\nSouthwest will add red-eye flights\n\nThe carrier also unveiled a Valentine's Day 2025 launch date for its long-planned inception of red-eye flying. Tickets for the five initial redeye flights are now on sale. The routes include Las Vegas-Baltimore, Las Vegas-Orlando, Los Angeles-Baltimore, Nashville-Baltimore and Phoenix-Baltimore.\n\nThe airline plans to gradually phase in more overnight flights as part of a multiyear transformation to a 24-hour operation. Southwest said that the combination of red-eye flying and turn-time reduction will enable nearly all new capacity over the coming three years to be implemented without additional expenditures on aircraft.\n\nTo facilitate the various new commercial initiatives, Southwest has created a new position called executive vice president of transformation.

(NYSE: LUV) is advancing its strategic evolution by unveiling a series of new measures aimed at enhancing the customer experience, boosting financial results, and increasing shareholder returns. The airline is initiating several changes, including assigned seating, premium seating options, a revamped boarding process, and the introduction of overnight flights. This initiative comes as part of Southwest's commitment to continual product development, as evidenced by discussions during its April financial disclosures where it revealed ongoing evaluations of customer seating preferences and expectations. These innovations are anticipated to not only meet customer demands but also to generate additional revenue and fortify the airline's financial health. More comprehensive details regarding these transformational commercial strategies and their expected impacts on operational efficacy and capital management will be shared at Southwest's Investor Day in late September.\n\nAssigned and Premium Seating\n\nIn response to detailed customer feedback and extensive research, Southwest has resolved to implement assigned seating across all its flights and introduce a premium seating option. Historically celebrated for its unique open seating approach for over five decades, the airline recognizes that customer preferences have shifted, particularly among passengers on longer flights who favor assigned seating. The airline's extensive evaluations, including live experiments and over 8 million simulated boarding processes, assure that these new changes will satisfy customer expectations without compromising operational effectiveness.\n\nResearch distinctly shows a strong preference for assigned seating, with 80% of existing Southwest customers and 86% of prospective customers favoring this model. The lack of assigned seating has been frequently cited as a primary reason for customers choosing other airlines. By adopting assigned seating, Southwest aims to expand its customer base and enhance its appeal to both existing and potential flyers.\n\nMoreover, the airline plans to introduce a premium section with extra legroom in about one-third of its seats, aligning with industry standards for narrowbody aircraft seating. While details of the cabin layout are still being finalized, this addition reflects the significant customer preference for enhanced comfort during flights.\n\nThese updates are integral to Southwest's broader modernization agenda, which over the past two years has included onboard enhancements like quicker WiFi, in-seat power options, and larger overhead bins. The modernization will continue with a revamped cabin design featuring new, more comfortable RECARO seats. By offering both assigned and premium seating options, Southwest aims to provide customers with greater choice and reinforce the airline's commitment to delivering exceptional value.\n\n\"Moving to assigned seating and offering premium legroom options will be a transformational change that cuts across almost all aspects of the Company,\" said Bob Jordan, President, CEO, & Vice Chairman of the Board. \"Although our unique open seating model has been a part of Southwest Airlines since our inception, our thoughtful and extensive research makes it clear this is the right choice -- at the right time -- for our Customers, our People, and our Shareholders. We are excited to incorporate Customer and Employee feedback to design a unique experience that only Southwest can deliver. We have been building purposefully to this change as part of a comprehensive upgrade to the Southwest experience as we focus on Customer expectations - and it will unlock new sources of revenue consistent with our laser focus on delivering improved financial performance.\"\n\nSouthwest Airlines is expanding its service offerings to include 24-hour operations with the launch of overnight redeye flights. Customers can now book these flights for routes starting on Valentine's Day 2025, initially available between Las Vegas and Baltimore, Las Vegas and Orlando, Los Angeles and Baltimore, Los Angeles and Nashville, and Phoenix and Baltimore. This move marks the beginning of Southwest's strategic transition to a full 24-hour operation model. Future schedules will incorporate more redeye flights, enhancing the airline's operational flexibility and service coverage. This initiative is expected to generate additional revenue and cost savings through technological advancements and streamlined procedures, which will support the airline's capacity expansion over the next three years without the need for additional aircraft investment.\n\nNew Leadership Role to Spearhead Initiatives\n\nIn light of these significant operational changes, Ryan Green, who has served as Executive Vice President and Chief Commercial Officer, will assume a new position as Executive Vice President of Commercial Transformation. In this role, Green will oversee the implementation of these new services as well as other ongoing commercial projects. His extensive experience with customer engagement and his previous leadership over the cabin redesign and enhancement of the Southwest Airlines Rapid Rewards\u00ae loyalty program, as well as the digital customer interface, positions him well for this role. He will report directly to Bob Jordan, the President, CEO, and Vice Chairman of the Board, in his new capacity.\n\n\"I'm eager to lead this next step in our transformation to serve our Customers with an even better Southwest. In addition to meeting the evolving needs of Customers and fostering more loyalty, these changes are expected to generate additional revenue as we capitalize on greater demand for Southwest Airlines and offer Customers the ability to purchase premium seating options,\" Green said. \"Together, these strategic initiatives play an integral role in the airline's comprehensive strategy to meet Customer needs and enhance Shareholder value, while maintaining the unique Culture, Hospitality, and flexibility that make Southwest - Southwest.\"\n\nSouthwest Airlines will provide more detailed information about its new product designs, cabin layouts, scheduling, and the projected financial benefits at its upcoming Investor Day in late September. The shift towards assigned and premium seating marks a major transformation for the airline. This transition will not only involve the introduction of new technologies and procedures to ensure smooth operations but will also require regulatory approvals from the Federal Aviation Administration. The airline anticipates making these new seating options available for booking in 2025.\n\nGary Kelly, Executive Chairman of the Board, said, \"The Board fully supports these efforts to usher in a new era for Southwest Airlines, and we have the ultimate confidence in Bob and our Leadership Team to design and deliver an experience that is unique and true to our Southwest Legacy.\"", "source":

While a timetable was not released for when the switch will take place, executives say more information will be released at a shareholders meeting in September.\n\nSouthwest says it conducted a tremendous amount of research ahead of making the decision to assign seats and customer feedback showed the company the option is something guests want. Research showed that 80% of Southwest customers and 86% of potential customers prefer to have an assigned seat. The company also found the number one reason why customers choose to stop flying Southwest is because of the open seating policy.\n\nCurrently, customers who fly with Southwest must \"check-in\" for their flight 24 hours before the scheduled departure time. Once you check-in, you're assigned a boarding number and once the flight starts boarding, you are allowed to board the plane based on which number you have. Once you're on the plane, you're free to pick any open seat on the plane.\n\nPassengers who end up at the back of the line often end up having to sit separately from those who are traveling in the same party as them.\n\nCustomers who pay a premium or have elevated status with the Southwest rewards program have the option of checking in earlier, which supposedly gives the customer a better shot at boarding the plane earlier than others.\n\nThe company is also reworking the seating arrangements on planes in order to add seating that offers extra legroom. Those seats will be available for customers to purchase at a premium as well.\n\n\"Moving to assigned seating and offering premium legroom options will be a transformational change that cuts across almost all aspects of the company,\" said Bob Jordan, President, CEO, & Vice Chairman of the Board. \"Although our unique open seating model has been a part of Southwest Airlines since our inception, our thoughtful and extensive research makes it clear this is the right choice -- at the right time -- for our customers, our people, and our shareholders.\"\n\nOnce the new seating is installed across the fleet, Southwest expects one-third of the seats it offers will feature the extra legroom.\n\nThe changes in offerings for guests comes at a time when the company is also in the midst of a downturn in revenue.

saying at the time that the move to \"assigned seating and offering premium legroom options will be a transformational change that cuts across almost all aspects of the company.\"\n\n\"Although our unique open seating model has been a part of Southwest Airlines since our inception, our thoughtful and extensive research makes it clear this is the right choice -- at the right time -- for our customers, our people, and our shareholders,\" said Jordan, who also serves as vice chairman of the board. \"We have been building purposefully to this change as part of a comprehensive upgrade to the Southwest experience as we focus on Customer expectations -- and it will unlock new sources of revenue consistent with our laser focus on delivering improved financial performance.\"\n\nThe company has not yet said when the seating changes will go into effect, but plans to provide more details on the product designs, cabin layout and timing at its Investor Day in late September.\n\nAny new cabin layout in this seating transformation will need to undergo approvals from the Federal Aviation Administration.\n\nSouthwest conducted \"robust operational testing\" of both live and more than 8 million simulation-based boarding trials, citing research that showed 80% of its customers and 86% of potential customers prefer an assigned seat.\n\n\"When a customer elects to stop flying with Southwest and chooses a competitor, open seating is cited as the number one reason for the change,\" the company noted. \"The airline is confident that these customer enhancements will meet expectations and not compromise the airline's operational efficiency.\"\n\nThe specific cabin layout details are still in design, but Southwest said it \"expects roughly one-third of seats across the fleet to offer extended legroom, in line with that offered by industry peers on narrowbody aircraft.\"\n\nIn the last two years, Southwest's modernization efforts have included enhancements to other onboard offerings such as faster WiFi, in-seat power, larger overhead bins and more comfortable RECARO seats.\n\nIn addition to the seating changes, Southwest also announced it is officially adding 24-hour operation capabilities with overnight redeye flights \"to further optimize the network and increase aircraft utilization.\"\n\nBooking on initial routes is available starting Thursday, with the first overnight flights landing on Valentine's Day 2025 in five initial nonstop markets: Las Vegas to Baltimore and Orlando, Los Angeles to Baltimore and Nashville, and Phoenix to Baltimore.\n\nThursday's announcements came in tandem with the airline's second quarter financial results, which fell short of expectations, according to Jordan.\n\nSouthwest's RASM (Revenue per Available Seat Mile), which is a measure of total revenue from each seat flown per mile, regardless of whether it's empty or full, has decreased by 3.8% year-over-year.\n\nThe CEO said the airline is \"taking urgent and deliberate steps to mitigate near-term revenue challenges and implement longer-term transformational initiatives\" to help with financial top and bottom line growth.\n\n\"As we announced this morning, our implementation of assigned and premium seating is part of an ongoing and comprehensive upgrade to the Customer Experience, one that research shows Customers overwhelmingly prefer,\" he said.", "source": {"uri": "abcnews.go.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "ABC News"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Southwest_Airlines", "type": "org",

But the change will also help the company charge some passengers more for their tickets.\n\n\"The research is clear and indicates that 80% of Southwest customers, and 86% of potential customers, prefer an assigned seat,\" said the airline in a statement. \"By moving to an assigned seating model, Southwest expects to broaden its appeal and attract more flying from its current and future customers.\"\n\nSouthwest did not give details about when the changes will go into effect, but it said it would be discussed further in September.\n\nThe airline had announced in April that it was looking at a change in its seating policy that has been in effect for its entire 50 year history. Southwest is under pressure from activist investors who have been pushing for changes in management and growth in profitability.\n\nSouthwest has long been known as a low-cost, low-fare carrier, but it has been facing competition from the three other major carriers, American, United and Delta, which get much of their revenue from charging more for premium seating. It also faces growing rivalries on the other end of the spectrum: ultra-low cost carriers, such as Spirit and Frontier, which offer bargain-priced seats for which customers have to pay extra for just about anything including carry on bags.\n\nSouthwest doesn't charge for carry on bags and has long allowed passengers to check two bags for free. The airline also doesn't charge customers to change flights.\n\nThe company made no mention in its statement about whether it will change its baggage or change fee policy. The premium seats, which will offer more legroom, will not be available until 2025 as it will require reconfiguring its planes.\n\nSouthwest used to be the most profitable US airline. But that is no longer the case.\n\nThursday, it reported a 51% drop in adjusted profit to $370 million, despite reporting record revenue for the quarter that was boosted by strong passenger traffic.\n\nBut this has been a tough environment for US airlines to make money. Significant increases in labor costs and higher fuel prices, two of the largest expenses in the industry, have eaten into profits. And relatively low average fares have exacerbated the damage.\n\nRival American Airlines also reported its profit fell 44% in the second quarter, despite its own record revenue.\n\nAlthough Southwest still has the healthiest credit rating of any US airline, it has been struggling with a number of issues in recent years - some as a result of its own mismanagement, but some because of outside factors and changing industry dynamics.\n\nShares of Southwest (LUV) were down more than 4% in premarket trading on its news.\n\nThe airline went 47 consecutive years without reporting an annual loss - until 2020, when the pandemic nearly halted all demand for air travel.\n\nSouthwest's fleet is made up entirely of Boeing 737 jets. That had reduced its operating costs, because it allowed its pilots to fly any of its planes, giving it a flexibility and efficiency not available to its larger rivals. But it also made it most susceptible to Boeing's substantial problems in recent years - both a 20-month grounding of the 737 Max in 2019 and 2020 following two fatal crashes, and a slowdown in production this year due to concerns about the quality and safety of its planes.\n\nBut its low-cost efforts also hurt Southwest at times, most notably in December 2022, when its suffered a catastrophic service meltdown that caused it to cancel about 17,000 flights, or nearly half of its schedule, during the busy holiday travel period. While other airlines recovered quickly from a winter storm that month, Southwest's computer technology, denounced as \"antiquated\" by its unions, made it difficult for it to schedule its pilots and flight attendants and resume normal operations.\n\nSouthwest made changes in its software and operations in the wake of those service issues. And last week, as many of the world's airlines were forced to cancel 5,000 flights in a single day due to a flawed software update from cyber security firm CrowdStrike, Southwest was one of the few carriers that avoided the issue and did not have to cancel flights. This time it was rival Delta Air Lines that suffered the service meltdown.\n\nBut that December 2022 meltdown cost Southwest around $1 billion, including a $140 million fine from the Department of Transportation. And it resulted in a loss in the fourth quarter of 2022 as well as the first quarter of 2023 as passengers were reluctant to book on airline in the immediate aftermath of the service problems.\n\nThe company reported losses in the fourth quarter of 2023 and first quarter of 2024 as well amid higher labor and fuel costs. Losing money in four of six quarters before the most recent period is a stunning and unwanted reversal of fortunes for Southwest. The airline had previously posted losses only during the pandemic, Great Recession and after the September 11 terrorist attacks - even while its rivals were flying in and out of bankruptcy. It also brought unwanted attention from activists investors at Elliott Investment Management, which announced in June it had taken a $1.9 billion stake in the airline and called for management changes.\n\nSouthwest has also gotten unwanted attention from the Federal Aviation Administration, which announced earlier this month it is stepping up oversight of its operations due to a number of potentially dangerous incidents involving its planes in recent months.\n\nIn March, a Southwest jet veered off course and had a close call with an air traffic control tower during an attempted landing at New York's LaGuardia Airport. In April, a plane plunged to within 400 feet of the surface of the Pacific Ocean off the coast of Hawaii. In June another plane came within 525 feet of the ground over an Oklahoma town when it was still nine miles away from the Oklahoma City airport. And later that month a plane took off on a closed runway at the airport in Portland Maine which had a repair vehicle on it that had to race to get out of its way. Earlier this month, a plane got within 150 feet of the ground when it was still five miles away from the airport in Tampa, according to data from Flightradar24.\n\n\"The FAA has increased oversight of Southwest Airlines to ensure it is complying with federal safety regulations,\" the agency said in a statement.\n\nSouthwest said it has formed an internal team to also look at the incidents.\n\n\"Southwest is working closely with the Federal Aviation Administration in the review of recent events,\" it said.\n\nCNN's Ross Levitt, Gregory Wallace, Chris Boyette and Pete Muntean contributed to this report.", "source": {"uri": "finance.yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo!

Southwest is under pressure from activist investors who have been pushing for changes in management and growth in profitability.\n\nSouthwest has long been known as a low-cost, low-fare carrier, but it has been facing competition from the three other major carriers, American, United and Delta, which get much of their revenue from charging more for premium seating. It also faces growing rivalries on the other end of the spectrum: ultra-low cost carriers, such as Spirit and Frontier, which offer bargain-priced seats for which customers have to pay extra for just about anything including carry on bags.\n\nSouthwest doesn't charge for carry on bags and has long allowed passengers to check two bags for free. The airline also doesn't charge customers to change flights.\n\nThe company made no mention in its statement about whether it will change its baggage or change fee policy. The premium seats, which will offer more legroom, will not be available until 2025 as it will require reconfiguring its planes.\n\nAn ailing business\n\nSouthwest used to be the most profitable US airline. But that is no longer the case.\n\nThursday, it reported a 51% drop in adjusted profit to $370 million, despite reporting record revenue for the quarter that was boosted by strong passenger traffic.\n\nBut this has been a tough environment for US airlines to make money. Significant increases in labor costs and higher fuel prices, two of the largest expenses in the industry, have eaten into profits. And relatively low average fares have exacerbated the damage.\n\nRival American Airlines also reported its profit fell 44% in the second quarter, despite its own record revenue.\n\nAlthough Southwest still has the healthiest credit rating of any US airline, it has been struggling with a number of issues in recent years - some as a result of its own mismanagement, but some because of outside factors and changing industry dynamics.\n\nShares of Southwest (LUV) were down more than 4% in premarket trading on its news.\n\nEnding five decades of precedent\n\nThe airline went 47 consecutive years without reporting an annual loss - until 2020, when the pandemic nearly halted all demand for air travel.\n\nSouthwest's fleet is made up entirely of Boeing 737 jets. That had reduced its operating costs, because it allowed its pilots to fly any of its planes, giving it a flexibility and efficiency not available to its larger rivals. But it also made it most susceptible to Boeing's substantial problems in recent years - both a 20-month grounding of the 737 Max in 2019 and 2020 following two fatal crashes, and a slowdown in production this year due to concerns about the quality and safety of its planes.\n\nBut its low-cost efforts also hurt Southwest at times, most notably in December 2022, when its suffered a catastrophic service meltdown that caused it to cancel about 17,000 flights, or nearly half of its schedule, during the busy holiday travel period. While other airlines recovered quickly from a winter storm that month, Southwest's computer technology, denounced as \"antiquated\" by its unions, made it difficult for it to schedule its pilots and flight attendants and resume normal operations.\n\nSouthwest made changes in its software and operations in the wake of those service issues. And last week, as many of the world's airlines were forced to cancel 5,000 flights in a single day due to a flawed software update from cyber security firm CrowdStrike, Southwest was one of the few carriers that avoided the issue and did not have to cancel flights. This time it was rival Delta Air Lines that suffered the service meltdown.\n\nBut that December 2022 meltdown cost Southwest around $1 billion, including a $140 million fine from the Department of Transportation. And it resulted in a loss in the fourth quarter of 2022 as well as the first quarter of 2023 as passengers were reluctant to book on airline in the immediate aftermath of the service problems.\n\nThe company reported losses in the fourth quarter of 2023 and first quarter of 2024 as well amid higher labor and fuel costs. Losing money in four of six quarters before the most recent period is a stunning and unwanted reversal of fortunes for Southwest. The airline had previously posted losses only during the pandemic, Great Recession and after the September 11 terrorist attacks - even while its rivals were flying in and out of bankruptcy. It also brought unwanted attention from activists investors at Elliott Investment Management, which announced in June it had taken a $1.9 billion stake in the airline and called for management changes.\n\nIncidents raise safety concerns\n\nSouthwest has also gotten unwanted attention from the Federal Aviation Administration, which announced earlier this month it is stepping up oversight of its operations due to a number of potentially dangerous incidents involving its planes in recent months.\n\nIn March, a Southwest jet veered off course and had a close call with an air traffic control tower during an attempted landing at New York's LaGuardia Airport. In April, a plane plunged to within 400 feet of the surface of the Pacific Ocean off the coast of Hawaii. In June another plane came within 525 feet of the ground over an Oklahoma town when it was still nine miles away from the Oklahoma City airport. And later that month a plane took off on a closed runway at the airport in Portland Maine which had a repair vehicle on it that had to race to get out of its way. Earlier this month, a plane got within 150 feet of the ground when it was still five miles away from the airport in Tampa, according to data from Flightradar24.\n\n\"The FAA has increased oversight of Southwest Airlines to ensure it is complying with federal safety regulations,\" the agency said in a statement.\n\nSouthwest said it has formed an internal team to also look at the incidents.\n\n\"Southwest is working closely with the Federal Aviation Administration in the review of recent events,\" it said.\n\nCNN's Ross Levitt, Gregory Wallace, Chris Boyette and Pete Muntean contributed to this report.\n\nThis story has been updated with additional context and developments.\n\nThe-CNN-Wire\n\n\u2122 & \u00a9 2024 Cable News Network, Inc., a Warner Bros.

The moves could also generate revenue and boost financial performance.\n\nSouthwest made the announcement on the same day that both it and American Airlines reported a steep drop in second-quarter profit despite higher revenue.\n\nAirlines are struggling with higher costs and reduced pricing power, especially on flights within the United States, as the industry adds flights faster than the growth in travel demand.\n\nSouthwest, based in Dallas, said its second-quarter profit fell 46% from a year earlier, to $367 million, as higher costs for labor, fuel and other expenses outstripped an increase in revenue. The results met Wall Street expectations.\n\nAmerican Airlines also reported a 46% drop in profit, to $717 million, and said it would break even in the third quarter -- well below Wall Street expectations for the July-through-September period.\n\nAmerican \"did not perform to our initial expectations\" because of a since-abandoned sales strategy and an oversupply of domestic flights, CEO Robert Isom said. He said the airline was responding with a strategy that boosts profits and \"makes it easy for customers to do business with American.\"\n\nSouthwest has used an open-seating model since its founding, with passengers lining up to board, then choosing their own seat once they are on the airplane. But, the airline said, preferences have \"evolved\" -- as more travelers take longer flights, they want an assigned seat.\n\nThe airline also said it will offer redeye flights for the first time.\n\nSouthwest said that its first overnight, redeye flights will land on Feb. 14, 2025 in nonstop markets that include Las Vegas to Baltimore and Orlando; Los Angeles to Baltimore and Nashville; and Phoenix to Baltimore. It plans to phase in additional redeye flights over time.\n\nThe change in seating policy comes as Southwest is under pressure from Elliott Investment Management.

The changes are being made in an effort to appeal to more passengers who skip it for other airlines like Delta, United and American. Additionally, the plan will serve as a way to fend off an activist investor who is pushing for an overhaul of the airline's leadership and operating strategy.\n\nOpen seating has sort of been Southwest's calling card since it started operations over a half-century ago, according to the Washington Post. That business model, which was unique among major carriers, produced decades of uninterrupted profits and democratized flying while doing so. For the most part, people seemed to really like it, but alas, all good things must come to an end.\n\nHere's what the Wall Street Journal reports about the decision to end open seating:\n\nBut Southwest executives said the company needs to adapt to what today's customers want, marking what may be its biggest-ever shift.\n\n\"This is the right change at the right time,\" Southwest Chief Executive Bob Jordan said in an interview.\n\nIt isn't clear when flying with assigned seats and premium rows will start, but Southwest said bookings for them are expected to begin next year. The exact timing of the changes depend on the airline gaining regulatory approval and retrofitting its planes.\n\nIt expects to share more details at an investor presentation in late September. Southwest also plans to operate red-eye flights for the first time starting next year.\n\nThis move comes as profit margins continue to lag behind competitors, and it pulls back from new cities it entered into during an expansion strategy a few years ago.\n\nSouthwest also just reported a second-quarter profit of $367 million, which works out to a 46 percent drop from the same time last year. That news came despite record quarterly operating revenue.\n\nElliott Investment Management, an influential hedge fund that has amassed a $1.9 billion stake in the company, has criticized the airline for being slow to adapt to modern flying. Elliott wrote in a letter to Southwest's board that changes it has been contemplating are too little, too late, and that many investors have lost confidence in the airline's leaders.\n\nSouthwest said it started studying potential changes last fall, before Elliott in June disclosed its stake in the airline.\n\nJordan declined to estimate exactly how much extra revenue the airline's new initiatives will bring in, but said he expects it to be \"significantly north\" of the nearly $1 billion Southwest currently generates selling extras like those that allow passengers to board sooner.\n\nSouthwest is rolling out a whole new boarding plan to go along with its assigned seating, according to the Journal:\n\nSouthwest's plan eases pressure on fliers to check in precisely 24 hours in advance or to pay extra to get a good spot in queues at airport gates.\n\nFans of the airline have said they loved open seating. When flights were emptier, they could often land a window or aisle seat. That is happening far less frequently though, as planes are more packed.\n\nThe airline said it surveyed thousands of customers to understand what they want and what they would be willing to pay for. It found that 80% favored assigned seats -- an overwhelming share that Jordan said took him by surprise. \"Our customers really, really, really want it,\" he said.\n\n[...]\n\nCurrently, Southwest's boarding procedure involves sorting customers into three groups (A, B or C), assigning them a number, and calling for them to line up in order. Passengers who pay for boarding and check-in upgrades, have elite status or pay for pricier ticket options can improve their position.\n\nTo test out different boarding methods, Southwest enlisted employees along with their families to practice getting on and off planes over several days in Houston. The passengers were loaded up with carry-ons and strollers, and some used wheelchairs. They tried different boarding and assigned seating configurations to determine whether assigning seats would slow things down -- one reason the airline previously opted not to do it.\n\nI'll be honest folks, I've never flown on Southwest, so I can't tell you if this sounds like a good thing or a bad thing. That being said, I know people who fly Southwest regularly, and they all seem to love the idea of open seating. I don't know. I sort of like knowing where I'm going to be sitting before I'm on the plane. Open seating feels a little bit too \"Lord of the Flies\" to me.\n\nWhat do you folks think? Was this a good move by Southwest, or is it getting rid of the one thing that made it really unique among U.S. airlines?", "source": {"uri": "jalopnik.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Jalopnik"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Airline", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Airline"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jordan", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Jordan"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Jordan"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Major_airlines_of_the_United_States", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Major airlines of the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Southwest_Chief", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Southwest Chief"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Activist_shareholder", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Activist shareholder"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Delta_Air_Lines", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Delta Air Lines"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Southwest_Airlines", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Southwest Airlines"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Wall_Street_Journal", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "The Wall Street Journal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Business_model", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Business model"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Washington_Post", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "The Washington Post"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elliott_Investment_Management", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Elliott Investment Management"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Profit_margin", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Profit margin"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hedge_fund", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Hedge fund"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gate_(airport)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Gate (airport)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lord_of_the_Flies", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Lord of the Flies"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wheelchair", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Wheelchair"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flight", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Flight"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Houston", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Houston"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Houston"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Transportation", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Transportation", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Travel/Transportation", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Travel/Transportation", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 83}], "image": "https://i.kinja-img.com/image/upload/c_fill,h_675,pg_1,q_80,w_1200/c9afc4c7e86d66753d24939de561c9e3.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9762572", "eventUri": "eng-9762572", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.223529411764706, "wgt": 184, "relevance": 1}

(Scripps News)\n\nSouthwest Airlines plans to drop its tradition of more than 50 years and start assigning seats and selling premium seating for customers who want more legroom.\n\nThe airline said Thursday that it has been studying seating options and is making the changes because passenger preferences have shifted. The moves could also generate revenue and boost financial performance.\n\nSouthwest made the announcement on the same day that both it and American Airlines reported a steep drop in second-quarter profit despite higher revenue.\n\nAirlines are struggling with higher costs and reduced pricing power, especially on flights within the United States, as the industry adds flights faster than the growth in travel demand.\n\nSouthwest, based in Dallas, said its second-quarter profit fell 46% from a year earlier, to $367 million, as higher costs for labor, fuel and other expenses outstripped an increase in revenue. The results met Wall Street expectations.\n\nAmerican Airlines also reported a 46% drop in profit, to $717 million, and said it would break even in the third quarter -- well below Wall Street expectations for the July-through-September period.\n\nSouthwest has used an open-seating model since its founding, with passengers lining up to board, then choosing their own seat once they are on the airplane. But, the airline said, preferences have \"evolved\" -- as more travelers take longer flights, they want an assigned seat.\n\nThe airline is said it will offer redeye flights for the first time.\n\nSouthwest said that its first overnight, redeye flights will land on Feb. 14, 2025 in nonstop markets that include Las Vegas to Baltimore and Orlando; Los Angeles to Baltimore and Nashville; and Phoenix to Baltimore. It plans to phase in additional redeye flights over time.\n\nCopyright 2024 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.

It discovered that preferences have changed over the years, and the vast majority of travelers now want to know where they are sitting on a plane before they get to the airport.\n\nSouthwest's unusual boarding process started as a fast way to load passengers and limit the time that planes and crews spend sitting idly on the ground, not making money. It helped the airline, which has served Charleston International for more than a decade, operate more efficiently and even squeeze a few more flights into the daily schedule.\n\nIt was one reason that Southwest alone among U.S. airlines remained profitable every year until the coronavirus pandemic.\n\nHere's how it works: Instead of being assigned a seat when they buy a ticket, Southwest customers check in exactly 24 hours before departure to secure their spots in boarding lines. In the beginning, the first 30 to check in were put in the coveted \"A\" group, guaranteeing them window or aisle seats. Dawdlers landed in \"B,\" which was still OK, or \"C,\" which would often result in a middle seat.\n\nThe system became less democratic over time as Southwest allowed customers to pay extra to guarantee a spot near the front of the line. Despite that, many loyalists of the airline still love open seating.\n\nSouthwest thinks they will adapt.\n\n\"I know there are going to be customers who say, 'I want to stay with open seating.' It's a minority,\" CEO Robert Jordan told CNBC, \"but we had the same thing when we switched from plastic boarding passes. We had the same thing when we took peanuts out of the cabin. I'm convinced we can win them over.\"\n\nThe airline said surveys showed that 80 percent of its customers -- and 86 percent of \"potential\" customers -- want an assigned seat. Jordan said open seating was the top reason that travelers cited for choosing another airline over Southwest.\n\nSome passengers reacted with sadness and disappointment to news that open seating is going away.\n\n\"Hearing that announcement today, I was like, no, this is my favorite part of Southwest,\" said Lindsey Magness, who works in college athletics in Oklahoma City.\n\nMagness said that with open seating, she can try for a window seat or, depending on her mood, an aisle. And assigned seating doesn't always work either. Magness said American Airlines seated her away from her husband on their honeymoon trip earlier this summer\n\nBrandon Bowser of Odenton, Md., said he flies on different airlines based on which one has the best deal, but he has found Southwest's open boarding to be faster and less complicated than other airlines.\n\n\"The convenience that comes with being able to pick your own seat is what sets Southwest apart and makes them sort of a preferred airline,\" he said. \"A lot of my friends swear by Southwest, that's all they will fly, and they are completely irate about this decision.\"\n\nToday's Top Headlines\n\nStory continues below\n\nSouth Carolina's castle on the coast continues to amaze tourists Decades-old furniture store in Columbia's Vista set to close its doors Battle lines drawn as Duke prepares to plow through Spartanburg farm community Sea Fox is officially done with Charleston County Parks after monthslong controversy Cafe Strudel owners are opening a new restaurant and market on Lake Murray Want to buy a plane from Clemson?

She was at a check-in kiosk with her four children for a flight home to California.\n\n\"I used to fly United a lot and I liked the assigned seats, especially with kids, kind of expecting and knowing where we were going to be,\" King said. \"The only reason really why I continue to fly Southwest is for the free bags.\"\n\nSouthwest still lets passengers check two bags for free. It's been a centerpiece of the airline's advertising campaigns for years. Jordan, the CEO, said Southwest has no plans to end bags-fly-free \"at this point.\"\n\nThere are drawbacks to Southwest's boarding method. It's hard to get a good spot in line without paying an extra fee. Southwest executives said 60 percent of passengers check as soon as they can, within the first 30 seconds. Those who miss the rush fear they won't find room in the overhead bins for their carry-on bags. Late boarders can struggle to see an open seat anywhere, and start roaming up and down the aisle -- Southwest calls them \"spinners.\"\n\nThere are a number of tricks that passengers use to game the system.\n\nSome take advantage of early boarding for people who need extra time. Others ignore the age limit (6 or under) for children in families who are allowed to board right after the \"A\" group. Once on the plane, some passengers hold choice seats for mates who are far behind them in line.\n\nPhotos appear occasionally on social media of an unusually large number of people in wheelchairs at Southwest gates. They get to board early.\n\n\"It's certainly one of the things that anger people even if it doesn't have a material impact on them,\" said Brett Snyder, a travel agent and author of the Cranky Flier blog. \"In some cases those are people who have absolutely legitimate reasons. In other cases, it's the 'Jetway Jesus' phenomenon.\"\n\nThat's a reference to recoveries so miraculous that the disability causing the person to need a wheelchair to reach the gate is cured during flight, and they walk off the plane like everybody else.\n\nSnyder doubts that fans of open seating will abandon Southwest.\n\n\"Those people will still fly Southwest,\" he said. \"They may grumble about it, but there's no one else they can go to that has open seating.\"\n\nIn addition to the boarding change, Southwest also plans to convert about one-third of the seats on its planes to premium seating with more legroom, matching a practice that is standard among other large U.S. carriers.\n\nThe airline's newest schedule also includes a few redeye flights -- a first for Southwest.\n\nThe changes come as Southwest is under pressure from Elliott Investment Management. The hedge fund argues that the airline lags rivals in financial performance and has failed to change with the times. It wants to replace Jordan as CEO and the chairman, Gary Kelly.", "source": {"uri": "postandcourier.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Post and Courier"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

This new boarding model aims to meet the preferences of its customers and attract more flying from both current and potential customers.\n\nFor the past 50 years, Southwest has been known for its single economy-class cabin with open seating assignments. Passengers were assigned a boarding group, but once onboard, they were free to choose any available seat. However, the airline has conducted extensive research which indicates that 80% of its customers and 86% of potential customers prefer an assigned seat.\n\n\"The research is clear and indicates that 80% of Southwest customers, and 86% of potential customers, prefer an assigned seat,\" said the airline in a statement. \"By moving to an assigned seating model, Southwest expects to broaden its appeal and attract more flying from its current and future customers.\" CEO Bob Jordan also said in a news release Thursday, \"Although our unique open seating model has been a part of Southwest Airlines since our inception, our thoughtful and extensive research makes it clear this is the right choice -- at the right time -- for our Customers, our People, and our Shareholders.\"\n\nRELATED:Delta Airlines Under Investigation Over Passenger Protection Policies As It Continues Struggling To Recover After Global Tech Outage, Unable To Find Pilots And Flight Attendants\n\nRELATED:Breaking: Widespread Technology Outage Disrupts Banks, Media Outlets, Companies, And Forces Airlines To Ground Flights Worldwide\n\nStarting next year, Southwest will begin selling the first flights that offer extra legroom, providing passengers with more comfort during their journey. In addition, the airline plans to introduce overnight flights in February.\n\nWhile the introduction of assigned seating and premium seats will allow Southwest to charge higher rates for its premium offerings, the airline assures that these changes will not compromise its operational efficiency.\n\nSouthwest executives have been studying these changes for years and hinted at the possibility of assigning seats and offering extra legroom options earlier this year. Currently, customers are placed into one of three boarding groups and assigned a number, leading to a rush to check-in a day before the flight. However, customers who purchase higher-priced tickets are given earlier boarding slots.\n\nBy implementing these changes, Southwest aims to broaden its appeal and enhance the overall flying experience for its customers.\n\nSocialites, how do you feel about this?

The new cabins, pending the approval of the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) should be available in 2025. In Q2 2024, Southwest Airlines earned a net income of $367 million.\n\nUnder pressure from an activist investor and admitting that the airline has underperformed financially, Southwest Airlines executives have made monumental changes to its onboard experience, introducing assigned seating while also offering premium seat options for its customers.\n\nMeeting customer demand and increasing revenues\n\nThe changes will be coming on all flights, with the airline admitting that while Southwest Airlines has been known for its unique open seating model for more than 50 years, preferences have evolved, which included passengers taking longer flights. As a result, seat assignment was preferred to ensure additional comfort.\n\n\"The research is clear and indicates that 80% of Southwest Customers, and 86% of potential Customers, prefer an assigned seat. When a Customer elects to stop flying with Southwest and chooses a competitor, open seating is cited as the number one reason for the change.\"\n\nPhoto: Joni Hanebutt | Shutterstock\n\nIn addition to assigned seats, premium seating options will also be available to customers. These will offer extended legroom, with many customers preferring such options, according to the carrier.\n\nThe airline stated that one-third of its seats would offer extra legroom, which would be comparable to what its competitors have offered to passengers.\n\nRelated Will Southwest Airlines Transform Its Cabin & Fares?\n\nWould you pay additionally to be seated in a specific cabin section on a Southwest Airlines flight?\n\n6\n\nHowever, Southwest Airlines warned that in addition to incorporating new technologies and procedures for a seamless transition, the new cabin layout will require the Federal Aviation Administration's (FAA) approval. The carrier said that bookings should become available in 2025.\n\nFurthermore, Southwest Airlines will introduce red-eye flights, which will begin operating in February 2025. The flights will be available on routes from Los Angeles International Airport (LAX) to Baltimore/Washington International Thurgood Marshall Airport (BWI), from Las Vegas Harry Reid International Airport (LAS) to BWI, from LAS to Orlando International Airport (MCO), from Phoenix Sky Harbor International Airport (PHX) to BWI, and from LAX to Nashville International Airport (BNA).\n\nRelated Welcome To The Red-Eye: Southwest Schedules Its 1st Ever Overnight Flights\n\nFive daily services are planned at first.\n\n5 Pressure from Elliot Investment Management\n\nWhen the airline announced its Q1 2024 results, Bob Jordan, the president and chief executive officer (CEO) of Southwest Airlines, admitted that he was disappointed in its Q1 performance.\n\nStill, Jordan added that there were efforts and progress underway to ensure that the carrier delivers the returns shareholders have expected from Southwest Airlines.\n\nPhoto: Angel DiBilio | Shutterstock\n\nJordan's remarks came despite Southwest Airlines earning record-breaking Q1 revenues, with the company ending the three-month period with operating revenues of $6.3 billion, which were still shy of its aspirations.\n\n\"Separately, we are considering more transformational options and follow-on initiatives. That includes work previously underway to study customer preference around seating and our cabin.\"\n\nNow, the CEO stated that the new cabin experience will be a transformational change that cuts across almost all aspects of the company. While the open seating model has been part of the airline's identity since its inception, research showed that it was the right choice made at the right time, Jordan said.\n\n\"We have been building purposefully to this change as part of a comprehensive upgrade to the Southwest experience as we focus on Customer expectations - and it will unlock new sources of revenue consistent with our laser focus on delivering improved financial performance.\"\n\nJordan and the rest of the board of directors have been under pressure from Elliot Investment Management. The investment company had built a significant shareholding in the airline, with the board responding by setting up a poison pill, which would dilute Elliot Investment Management's shareholding if it attempted to increase its stake in Southwest Airlines.\n\nRelated Southwest Airlines Issues Shareholders Rights Plan Responding To Elliott Activist Investor\n\nEssentially, Southwest Airlines has prepared a poison pill in case Elliot Investment Management attempts to acquire a significant stake in the airline\n\n7 Must-have changes\n\nHowever, Southwest Airlines, Elliot Investment Management, and executives from the Southwest Airlines Pilot Association (SWAPA) have all admitted that changes were needed at the airline, as it has been struggling financially.\n\nIn particular, the investment firm has blasted the airline's executives and its board for many things, including the fact that in the past 18 months, Southwest Airlines had issued eight guidance reductions.\n\nPhoto: Vincenzo Pace | Simple Flying\n\nElliot Investment Management called for a complete leadership change at the carrier with the plan 'Stronger Southwest,' and when the airline announced the addition of Rakesh Gangwal, an experienced airline executive with prior C-level roles at US Airways, Air France, United Airlines, and being the co-founder of IndiGo, the firm said that Gangwal would be \"supportive of Southwest's current leadership and status-quo approach [...].\"\n\nOn July 8, Elliot Investment Management continued pressuring the airline, publishing an open letter that said the feedback it had received was consistent with its perspective, once again reiterating that leadership changes were a must at Southwest Airlines.\n\nRelated SWAPA President Backs Call For Change As Elliot Responds To 'Poison Pill'\n\nSouthwest Airlines' pilots reiterated that whatever will happen in the next few months, changes will be coming to the airline and its business model.\n\n2 Return to profitability\n\nNevertheless, the airline's announcement about the changes to its seating policy coincided with the publication of its Q2 results, with Southwest Airlines returning to profitability after a net loss of $231 million in Q1.\n\nIn Q2, the airline's revenues were $7.4 billion, resulting in a net income of $367 million, with revenues growing 4.5% year-on-year (YoY). According to Southwest Airlines, this was another all-time quarterly record.\n\nCommenting on the quarterly results, Jordan said that they were impacted by external and internal factors, falling short of what the company believed it was capable of delivering.\n\nPhoto: Markus Mainka | Shutterstock\n\n\"Our goal is to restore industry-leading margins and historical levels of Shareholder returns through our comprehensive plan to deliver transformational commercial initiatives, improved operational efficiency, and capital allocation discipline.\"\n\nLooking forward, Southwest Airlines said that its revenue per available seat mile (RASM), available seat miles (ASM), and cost per ASM (excluding fuel) would flat to down 2%, up around 2%, and up 11% to 13%, respectively, in Q3.\n\nIts 2024 guidance, which includes ASMs growing by 4%, an operational fleet of 802 aircraft, and other metrics, has remained unchanged.\n\nRelated Southwest Airlines Posts Net Loss Of $231 Million In Q1 Against

It was part of a business model that produced decades of uninterrupted profits and democratized flying in the process. But Southwest executives said that the company needs to adapt to what today's customers want.\n\n\"This is the right change at the right time,\" Southwest Chief Executive Bob Jordan said in an interview.\n\nIt isn't clear when flying with assigned seats and premium rows will start, but Southwest said bookings for them are expected to begin next year. The exact timing of the changes depend on the airline gaining regulatory approval and retrofitting its planes.\n\nIt expects to share more details at an investor presentation in late September. Southwest also plans to operate red-eye flights for the first time starting next year.\n\nThe carrier has been facing challenges on a range of fronts. Its profit margins have lagged behind many rivals and pulled back from some new cities it entered as part of an ambitious expansion strategy.\n\nOther airlines are also grappling with too many empty seats on U.S. flights and weaker fares, but Southwest doesn't have the vast international network and high-end offerings that have offset those problems for rivals.\n\nThrough Wednesday its share price this year is down about 7.9%, compared with a 14% gain in the S&P 500.\n\nElliott Investment Management, an influential hedge fund that has amassed a $1.9 billion stake in the company, has criticized the airline for being slow to adapt to modern flying. Elliott wrote in a letter to Southwest's board that changes it has been contemplating are too little, too late, and that many investors have lost confidence in the airline's leaders.\n\nSouthwest said it started studying potential changes last fall, before Elliott in June disclosed its stake in the airline.\n\nJordan declined to estimate exactly how much extra revenue the airline's new initiatives will bring in, but said he expects it to be \"significantly north\" of the nearly $1 billion Southwest currently generates selling extras like those that allow passengers to board sooner.\n\nSouthwest's plan eases pressure on fliers to check in precisely 24 hours in advance or to pay extra to get a good spot in queues at airport gates.\n\nFans of the airline have said they loved open seating. When flights were emptier, they could often land a window or aisle seat. That is happening far less frequently though, as planes are more packed.\n\nThe airline said it surveyed thousands of customers to understand what they want and what they would be willing to pay for. It found that 80% favored assigned seats -- an overwhelming share that Jordan said took him by surprise. \"Our customers really, really, really want it,\" he said.\n\nAnd the carrier is betting it can bring in more fliers, including those who wouldn't have previously considered Southwest. As it makes a bigger push for corporate travelers, it has found road warriors have little interest in playing seating roulette.\n\nMany employees, tired of refereeing preflight seat disputes, want it too. The airline got more internal complaints when it ditched serving peanuts on flights than when it started discussing potential changes a few months ago, executives said.\n\nExtended legroom seats will eventually account for about a third of seats across Southwest's fleet, but executives say they are not planning on a true first-class cabin.\n\nRyan Green, the executive charged with leading the commercial transformation, said that since Southwest seats are already among the roomiest in economy cabins, it is possible to cede some space without making the experience uncomfortable for those who don't pay up. It isn't clear how much the option will cost passengers.\n\nCurrently, Southwest's boarding procedure involves sorting customers into three groups (A, B or C), assigning them a number, and calling for them to line up in order. Passengers who pay for boarding and check-in upgrades, have elite status or pay for pricier ticket options can improve their position.\n\nTo test out different boarding methods, Southwest enlisted employees along with their families to practice getting on and off planes over several days in Houston. The passengers were loaded up with carry-ons and strollers, and some used wheelchairs. They tried different boarding and assigned seating configurations to determine whether assigning seats would slow things down -- one reason the airline previously opted not to do it.\n\nThe carrier set up cameras to track passengers' movements. Some testers wore Google Glass devices so the airline could see the experience from their perspective -- how they searched out seat numbers and overhead bin space.\n\nSouthwest validated its findings with millions of computer simulations, and found that it could make the change without gumming up operations.\n\nJordan said he knows there may be a small, but vocal group of superfans who are skeptical as their beloved airline transforms.", "source": {"uri": "livemint.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "mint"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Airline", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Airline"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bob_Jordan_(businessman)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Bob Jordan (businessman)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Southwest_Chief", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Southwest Chief"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Activist_shareholder", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Activist shareholder"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Profit_margin", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Profit margin"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Business_model", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Business model"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elliott_Investment_Management", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Elliott Investment Management"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/S&P_500_Index", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "S&P 500 Index"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Queue_area", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Queue area"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Share_price", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Share price"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hedge_fund", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Hedge fund"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Airport", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Airport"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jordan", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Jordan"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Jordan"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Overhead_(business)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Overhead (business)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roulette", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Roulette"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google_Glass", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Google Glass"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peanut", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Peanut"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Check-in", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Check-in"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_simulation", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Computer simulation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wheelchair", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Wheelchair"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Houston", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Houston"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Houston"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Transportation", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Transportation", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Transportation_and_Logistics/Aviation", "label": "dmoz/Business/Transportation and Logistics/Aviation", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Travel/Transportation", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Travel/Transportation", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 95}], "image": "https://images.livemint.com/img/2024/07/25/600x338/im-984015_1721907965902_1721908072798.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9762572", "eventUri": "eng-9762572", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1450980392156862, "wgt": 180, "relevance": 1}

There's Still One Reason | Frommer's", "body": "Social media is so infected with liars and bad actors that we can't trust it even to tell us the sky is blue anymore.\n\nBut the minute Southwest Airlines announced that, after some 50 years, the carrier will do away with its open seating system, the online reaction seemed to repeat a certain point that rings true.\n\nYou might hear it said that open seating was the best thing about flying Southwest. The lack of assigned seating made it easier for families to sit together without paying too much more. All you had to do was check in 24 hours before departure and secure an early boarding group -- it was all about jostling for that A group.\n\nI personally found the boarding experience anxiety-inducing and dehumanizing, but millions of customers have felt it made Southwest easier and more affordable to use.\n\nNow Southwest has announced it will begin charging for seating assignments, and will deviate from its long-running system of seat equality to add seats with extra legroom, which will also come with an extra charge.\n\nLet's be honest. Southwest's no-class system had already deteriorated before today, eroded by cash grabs. The airline's \"EarlyBird\" check-in upcharge, available 36 hours before departure for $15 a person, was already infuriating customers who bought it, thinking the service would allow them to seat their entire families together, yet still finding themselves in group B.\n\n\"What's up?\" Denver TV host Jeff Schroeder asked Southwest on the air on July 16. \"What am I paying for? ... I'm paying to be average?\"\n\nNow, just like the other airlines, Southwest will charge you to access higher-quality versions of the same service. Southwest will also force you to shell out for seats, just like the other airlines do, except in Southwest's case premium service is highly unlikely to be much more than an afterthought.\n\nSouthwest has caved to the class system. Why would the airline change the central personality trait that sets it apart?\n\nYou know the answer. It's green and it fills bank accounts.\n\nThe people who built Southwest are no longer in charge. In early July 2024, activist fund managers at Elliot Investment Management took control of the airline.\n\nThe new puppeteers at Southwest care nothing for tried-and-true egalitarian passenger boarding systems, nor for the operational advantages they have been said to provide in helping Southwest board planes quickly and keep flying.\n\nTwenty years ago, Southwest was flying high on low-priced, negotiated fuel expenses and an aviation system that gave power to Southwest's focus on one-way domestic short hauls. But our fraught era has bedeviled the airline, dragging it below the profit line via a combo of inflation and antiquated systems.\n\nSouthwest's most recent earnings report, issued this week, showed a profit drop of 46%, all but forcing the airline's new puppet masters to take drastic measures.\n\nHours later, open seating was abandoned and the new seating fees were brought in to generate cash.\n\nBut there's still one major aspect of flying Southwest Airlines that sets it apart from its rivals.\n\nSouthwest still grants two free checked bags per passenger. While competitors charge $45 each way for luggage, Southwest's bag policy stands out and often makes its airfares the cheapest when you factor in all charges.\n\nSouthwest is strapped for easy cash, and bag fees represent big, fat, juicy, low-hanging fruit that could be plucked for desperately needed income. In 2022, U.S. airlines collected $6.8 billion in bag fees, double the amount from a decade earlier, and Southwest didn't reap that bounty.\n\nThe airline's operational meltdowns over the past few years have been the subject of sorrow, satire, and federal scrutiny, and the airline's executives have been scrambling to shore up business. In January, Southwest tried to ease its redemption program for the airline's most dedicated customers, and in the spring, Southwest departures finally began appearing on Google Flights, when third-party engines had previously been blocked.\n\nBut those moves weren't fast enough to turn profits around.\n\nIf Elliott is willing to sweep away the core democratic principles that made Southwest Airlines unique, how long do you think the free baggage allowance is going to last? Take advantage of the perk while you can.\n\nThe future of free checked bags at Southwest is now in doubt.\n\nThe change in boarding procedures also means the efficient turnaround of Southwest planes at the gate, a keystone in the aggressive operational schedule that once made the airline viable, is on the line.\n\nWhat isn't in doubt is that Wall Street types have finally caught up with the carrier, and just like JetBlue before it, Southwest is being forced to behave like all the other airlines, erasing the points of difference that fueled Southwest's rise in the first place.", "source": {"uri": "frommers.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "frommers.com"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Airline", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Airline"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Airport_check-in", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Airport check-in"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Southwest_Airlines", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Southwest Airlines"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Erosion", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Erosion"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amusement_park", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Amusement park"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Investment_management", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Investment management"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_media", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Social media"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seashell", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Seashell"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Puppeteer", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Puppeteer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_class", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Social class"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pay_television", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Pay television"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Egalitarianism", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Egalitarianism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aviation", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Aviation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Denver", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Denver"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Denver"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google_Flights", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Google Flights"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bounty_(reward)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Bounty (reward)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Puppet", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Puppet"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salvation", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Salvation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JetBlue", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "JetBlue"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Satire", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Satire"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fruit", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Fruit"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wall_Street", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Wall Street"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fat", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Fat"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Transportation", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Transportation", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Travel/Transportation", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Travel/Transportation", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Aviation/Multimedia", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Aviation/Multimedia", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 94}], "image": "https://www.frommers.com/system/media_items/attachments/000/866/554/s500/Southwest_Airlines_Shutterstock.jpg?1611588340", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9762572", "eventUri": "eng-9762572", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-07-16", "textStart": 1474, "textEnd": 1481}], "sentiment": 0.1294117647058823, "wgt": 179, "relevance": 1}

The announcement comes amid pressure from an activist investor seeking changes in the company's leadership and operating strategy, reported the Wall Street Journal.\n\nThe shift will involve assigned seats with some having extra legroom, marking a significant shift for Southwest, as the model has contributed to the airline's long-standing profitability and democratization of air travel.Southwest Chief Executive Bob Jordan believes that this change is necessary to meet the evolving preferences of customers. The exact timing for the implementation of assigned seats and premium rows is yet to be determined, but bookings for these options are expected to commence next year, pending regulatory approval and the retrofitting of planes. \"This is the right change at the right time,\" said Jordan.\n\nDespite achieving record quarterly operating revenue, Southwest reported a 46% decrease in second-quarter profit compared to the previous year. The airline acknowledged that it sold many summer tickets too early, resulting in the loss of lucrative last-minute bookings. However, the profit still surpassed analysts' expectations. The company's shares experienced a decline of 3.8% in premarket trading on Thursday, following a 7.9% drop year-to-date, in contrast to a 14% gain in the S&P 500.\n\nElliott Investment Management, a prominent hedge fund with a substantial stake in Southwest, has criticized the airline for its slow adaptation to modern flying practices. In a letter to the airline's board, Elliott expressed that the proposed changes are insufficient and overdue, and that many investors have lost faith in the company's leadership.\n\nSouthwest's plan aims to alleviate the pressure on passengers to check in precisely 24 hours in advance or pay extra for a favorable spot in the boarding queue. While open seating has been appreciated by the airline's fans, especially when flights were less crowded, this is becoming less common as planes are now more packed. A survey conducted by the airline revealed that 80% of customers preferred assigned seats. Surprised by the results, chief executive Jordan said, \"Our customers really, really, really want it.\"\n\nThe airline is optimistic that these changes will attract more passengers, including those who may not have previously considered Southwest. As the company targets more corporate travelers, it has observed that frequent flyers have little interest in unpredictable seating arrangements. Many Southwest employees also support the change, with executives noting that the airline received more internal complaints when it stopped serving peanuts on flights than when it began discussing these potential changes.\n\nTo test various boarding methods, Southwest conducted trials in Houston, to ensure that the changes does\"not compromise the airline's operational efficiency\", enlisting employees and their families to practice boarding and deplaning over several days. The airline set up cameras to monitor movements and equipped some testers with Google Glass devices to gain a first-person perspective on the process. The findings were confirmed through millions of computer simulations, leading Southwest to conclude that it could implement the change without disrupting operations.\n\nJordan acknowledged that there might be a small but vocal group of loyal customers who are skeptical about the transformation. However, he remains confident that the airline will be able to win them over.\n\nApart from the shift in seating policy, Southwest Airlines is also introducing red-eye flights, which means late-night or overnight flights. Beginning in February of the upcoming year, Southwest Airlines will be launching overnight flights on five initial routes. These routes include Las Vegas to Baltimore and Orlando, Los Angeles to Baltimore and Nashville, and Phoenix to Baltimore. These changes are also aimed to increase revenue according to the airlines.\n\nAt TOI World Desk, our dedicated team of seasoned journalists and passionate writers tirelessly sifts through the vast tapestry of global events to bring you the latest news and diverse perspectives round the clock.

While they has seen airline revenue shoot up, as people cram planes profits have fallen.\n\nCEO Bob Jordan noted the longstanding tradition was \"part of Southwest Airlines since our inception,\" reported the New York Post.\n\nIt had been in place for 53 years since the airline was formed in 1971 in Dallas.\n\nCurrently, Southwest passengers are assigned a boarding code at check-in which relates to where they stand in the queue at the gate. People then board in that order. Once on the jet, flyers then choose where to sit from whatever seats remain.\n\nPeople with disabilities are also given priority. In the US that has led to the \"Jetway Jesus\" meme.\n\nThis is the perception that there are long queues of people in wheelchairs at Southwest gates who board first and so get the prime choice of seating.\n\nHowever some flyers have claimed - not always fairly - that a number of these passengers then miraculously don't need a wheelchair when they leave the plane, as if they have been heeled by a messiah on the jet way.\n\n\"Moving to assigned seating and offering premium leg room options will be a transformational change that cuts across almost all aspects of the company,\" said Mr Jordan.\n\nSouthwest justified the move from survey data that showed 80 per cent of its current customers and 86 per cent of potential customers preferred having assigned seats.\n\n\"By moving to an assigned seating model, Southwest expects to broaden its appeal and attract more flying from its current and future customers,\" said Mr Jordan.\n\nSouthwest has also announced it will offer red eye flights across the US.\n\nTravelling through the night from the west to east coasts - from San Francisco to New York for instance - is common in the US due to the time zones and large land mass. It's similar to overnight flights offered from Perth to the east coast.\n\nBut Southwest, almost uniquely among its rivals, has never flown scheduled trips that land after 11pm California time due to IT and staffing issues.\n\nSouthwest's first overnight flights will launch on Valentine's Day 2025 on five routes: Las Vegas to Baltimore and Orlando; Los Angeles to Baltimore and Nashville; and

Bob Jordan, Southwest's president and CEO, blamed the weak quarterly performance on \"both external and internal factors\" and said the company is \"taking urgent and deliberate steps\" to improve margins.\n\nThose steps include getting rid of the airline's long-standing open seating plan, which has given the customers the ability to choose any available seat when they board for 50 years.\n\n\"As we announced this morning, our implementation of assigned and premium seating is part of an ongoing and comprehensive upgrade to the Customer Experience, one that research shows customers overwhelmingly prefer,\" Jordan said in a statement.\n\nRead more: Southwest Airlines is under new FAA scrutiny after a series of safety issues\n\nThe airline carried out more than eight million simulation-based boarding trials, and found that 80% of Southwest customers and 86% of potential customers prefer assigned seating over the airline's previous free-for-all approach. Southwest also said the results showed that when a customer opts to fly with a competitor airline, open seating is cited as the No. 1 reason for the change.\n\nOther changes include premium seating with extra legroom and overnight flights, the airline said. The changes are part of Southwest's \"modernization efforts,\" which in past years have included the addition of in-flight WiFi, charging ports, and larger overhead bins.\n\nDespite the announcement, Southwest stock fell 6% in pre-market trading Thursday.\n\nThe weak results were not unexpected. Late last month, the company adjusted its guidance for the quarter and said it's \"intensely focused on improving its financial results.\" After reporting a $231 million loss in the first quarter of the year, Southwest similarly took immediate action, including layoffs and eliminating service to handful of airports.

The airline also plans to start overnight flights, starting in February.Southwest executives have said for years that they were studying such changes and hinted in April that it was seriously considering assigning seats and offering pricier seats with more legroom. The airline currently puts customers in one of three boarding groups and assigns a number, setting off a mad dash to check in a day before the flight. Customers can get earlier boarding though if they pay for a higher-priced ticket, they'll get a better boarding slot.When travelers choose a competitor over Southwest, the airline found in its research that its open seating model was the No. 1 reason for that choice, the carrier said in a release that outlined the changes. It also said 80% of its own customers prefer an assigned seat.\"Although our unique open seating model has been a part of Southwest Airlines since our inception, our thoughtful and extensive research makes it clear this is the right choice -- at the right time -- for our Customers, our People, and our Shareholders,\" CEO Bob Jordan said in a news release Thursday.The airline is under even more pressure now to segment its product like other airlines after activist investor Elliott Investment Management disclosed in June a nearly $2 billion stake in the airline and called for new leadership as the airline underperformed competitors.\"We will adapt as our customers' needs adapt,\" Jordan said at an industry event last month.Southwest said it expects about a third of the seats on its Boeing 737s will offer \"extended legroom, in line with that offered by industry peers on narrowbody aircraft.\" The Federal Aviation Administration would need to approve the cabin layouts, the airline added.The Dallas-based airline had prided itself and raked in steady profits for most of its more than five decades of flying on its simple business model. Jordan said last month that not assigning seats was easier to offer when planes weren't so full.Analysts criticized Southwest for moving too slowly. Rival carriers offer a host of options to upsell customers like extra legroom seats, premium economy or business class. Other airlines, however, like Delta, United and American, four years ago took a cue from Southwest and ended flight-change fees for most tickets.Southwest will provide more details about the upcoming changes at an investor day at the end of September.Read more CNBC airline newsSouthwest to get rid of open seating, offer extra legroom in biggest shift in its historyBoeing's missteps have cost it billions.

The new policies, announced Thursday, will make flying Southwest look and feel remarkably different for customers.\n\nThe new policies will affect how customers select seats and board planes. Southwest passengers, including longtime fans of the open seating policy, will also now be able to choose different types of seats for a price, including those with more legroom. These changes could affect ticket costs across the board, according to experts, although Southwest has not addressed pricing, or indicated that regular seat costs will change.\n\nSome experts are cheering the move, saying it's an improvement for both passengers and the airline.\n\n\"Southwest's decision to start assigning seats and plan to add extra-legroom seats prove an old dog can learn new tricks,\" Henry Harteveldt, president of Atmosphere Research Group, told CBS News. \"It will make their flights more orderly and comfortable. And it should also improve the airline's bottom line as well.\"\n\nSouthwest will begin selling tickets with assigned seats beginning in 2025. The airline will reveal additional details around changes to the flight boarding process in September.\n\nHere are three ways flying Southwest could change.\n\nSouthwest is ending its open seating policy, in which customers find a cabin seat on a first-come, first-serve basis. When the changes go into effect next year, customers will purchase tickets with assigned seating, eliminating some of the stress associated with the current boarding process.\n\n\"It's a pretty big change for Southwest, which always had an open seating system, and you had to run into the cabin and try to find the seat you want,\" Clint Henderson, managing editor of The Points Guy, told CBS MoneyWatch.\n\nHenderson said this turned off some business travelers like himself from choosing to fly Southwest, and he predicted the change could attract a new crop of customers to the airline.\n\n\"Many business travelers don't want to fight for a seat and deal with the drama that sometimes entails,\" Henderson said.\n\nTensions can run high on airplanes too, with testy passengers quibbling over limited and sometimes shared real estate.\n\n\"Since the pandemic, airline passengers may be less cordial and less amicable,\" said airline customer experience analyst Marbue Brown. \"There are certainly benefits to environments where there is no ambiguity about who owns a seat.\"\n\nIn addition to assigned seats, Southwest will introduce premium seating, offering passengers extended legroom on one-third of a cabin's seats.\n\nSouthwest already lets customers pay to be first in line to board aircraft, \"but this is a much bigger change now, with premium seats available for purchase,\" Going.com's Keyes said.\n\nThe airline is likely responding to travelers' penchant for more premium travel experiences following the pandemic, according to Keyes. \"The demand is for premium economy, business class and better seats, which Southwest doesn't have to offer,\" he said.\n\nSouthwest's seats already offer more legroom than traditional carriers', which has been a selling point for the airline. They come with 32 inches of space, versus the industry standard of 30-31 inches. It's possible Southwest's new cabin configuration could shrink its current standard of 32 inches of space, some experts said.\n\n\"They haven't announced the new cabin design, but the most likely outcome is we're going to see that 32 inches of legroom to start to shrink for main cabin, and for it to be more like 31 or 30,\" Scott Keyes, founder of Going.com, told CBS MoneyWatch. \"That's normal for people who are used to flying American or United, but cramped for people who fly Southwest.\"\n\nThe new cabin configurations could drive up ticket prices across the board because Southwest's aircraft might contain fewer number of total seats, industry analysts said. On the other hand, the dramatic policy changes could be price-neutral, depending on how Southwest redesigns its plane cabins.\n\n\"Some folks will pay more for extra legroom, and, based on how you reconfigure planes, you might not have to raise prices on other seats,\" Brown said.\n\nWhat remains to be seen is whether Southwest will introduce a bare-bones, basic economy-type offering.\n\nCurrently, all tickets come with free checked bags and free changes. \"But might they start to offer an economy package that includes more restrictions on baggage? That's something we'll have to wait and see,\" Keyes said.", "source": {"uri": "cbsnews.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "CBS News"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Airline", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Airline"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Henderson,_Nevada", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Henderson, Nevada"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Henderson, Nevada"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CBS_News", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "CBS News"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Low-cost_carrier", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Low-cost carrier"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atmosphere", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Atmosphere"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CBS_MoneyWatch", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "CBS MoneyWatch"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Real_estate", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Real estate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Airplane", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Airplane"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flight", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Flight"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Premium_economy_class", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Premium economy class"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Business_class", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Business class"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brown_University", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Brown University"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Transportation", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Transportation", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Travel/Transportation", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Travel/Transportation", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Aviation/Simulation", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Aviation/Simulation", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Travel/Accessories", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Travel/Accessories", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 90}], "image": "https://assets1.cbsnewsstatic.com/hub/i/r/2024/07/25/064b7c62-d206-41e3-bf63-45bb44d25529/thumbnail/1200x630/1ba233bf90e2af40e80fba4c0d33d3a9/gettyimages-2051578400.jpg?v=5501038cbc281520ff9fdc308faab7dc", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9762572", "eventUri": "eng-9762572", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1607843137254903, "wgt": 176, "relevance": 1}

Southwest discovered that preferences have changed over the years and the vast majority of travelers now want to know where they are sitting before they get to the airport.\n\nSouthwest's unusual boarding process started as a fast way to load passengers and limit the time that planes and crews spend sitting idly on the ground, not making money. It helped the airline operate more efficiently and even squeeze a few more flights into the daily schedule.\n\nPeople are also reading...

In the beginning, the first 30 to check in were put in the coveted \"A\" boarding group, guaranteeing them a window or aisle seat. Dawdlers landed in \"B,\" which was still OK, or \"C,\" which would often result in a middle seat.\n\nThe system became less democratic over time as Southwest let people pay extra to guarantee a spot near the front of the line. Despite that, many Southwest loyalists still love open seating. The airline thinks they will adapt.\n\n\"I know there are going to be customers who say, 'I want to stay with open seating.' It's a minority,\" Southwest CEO Robert Jordan told CNBC, \"but we had the same thing when we switched from plastic boarding passes. We had the same thing when we took peanuts out of the cabin. I'm convinced we can win them over.\"\n\nThe airline said surveys showed that 80% of its customers -- and 86% of \"potential\" customers -- want an assigned seat. Jordan said open seating was the top reason that travelers cited for choosing another airline over Southwest.\n\nSome Southwest passengers reacted with sadness and disappointment to news that open seating is going away.\n\n\"Hearing that announcement today, I was like, no, this is my favorite part of Southwest,\" said Lindsey Magness, who works in college athletics in Oklahoma City.\n\nMagness said that with open seating, she can try for a window seat or, depending on her mood, an aisle. And assigned seating doesn't always work either. Magness said American Airlines seated her away from her husband on their honeymoon trip earlier this summer.\n\nBrandon Bowser of Odenton, Maryland, said he flies on different airlines based on which one has the best deal, but he has found Southwest's open boarding to be faster and less complicated than other airlines.\n\n\"The convenience that comes with being able to pick your own seat is what sets Southwest apart and makes them sort of a preferred airline,\" he said. \"A lot of my friends swear by Southwest, that's all they will fly, and they are completely irate about this decision.\"\n\nAt Chicago Midway airport, Kimberly King was happy to learn of the change. She was at a check-in kiosk with her four children for a flight home to California.\n\n\"I used to fly United a lot and I liked the assigned seats, especially with kids, kind of expecting and knowing where we were going to be,\" King said. \"The only reason really why I continue to fly Southwest is for the free bags.\"\n\nSouthwest still lets passengers check two bags for free. It's been a centerpiece of the airline's advertising campaigns for years. CEO Jordan said Southwest has no plans to end bags-fly-free \"at this point.\"\n\nThere are drawbacks to Southwest boarding. It's hard to get a good spot in line without paying an extra fee. Southwest executives said 60% of passengers check in the first 30 seconds. Those who miss the rush fear there won't be room in the overhead bins for their carry-on bag. Late boarders can struggle to see an open seat anywhere, and start roaming up and down the aisle -- Southwest calls them \"spinners.\"\n\nThere are a number of tricks that passengers use to game the system.\n\nListen now and subscribe: Apple Podcasts | Google Podcasts | Spotify | RSS Feed | SoundStack | All Of Our Podcasts\n\nSome take advantage of early boarding for people who need extra time. Others ignore the age limit (6 or under) for children in families that are allowed to board right after the \"A\" group. Once on the plane, some passengers hold choice seats for mates who are far behind them in line.\n\nPhotos appear occasionally on social media of an unusually large number of people in wheelchairs at Southwest gates. They get to board early.\n\n\"It's certainly one of the things that anger people even if it doesn't have a material impact on them,\" said Brett Snyder, a travel agent and author of the Cranky Flier blog. \"In some cases those are people who have absolutely legitimate reasons. In other cases, it's the 'Jetway Jesus' phenomenon.\"\n\nThat's a reference to recoveries so miraculous that the disability causing the person to need a wheelchair to reach the gate is cured during flight, and they walk off the plane like everybody else.\n\nSnyder doubts that fans of open seating will abandon Southwest.\n\n\"Those people will still fly Southwest,\" he said. \"They may grumble about it, but there's no one else they can go to that has open seating.\"\n\nIn addition to the boarding change, Southwest also plans to convert about one-third of the seats on its planes to premium seating with more legroom, matching a practice that is standard among other large U.S. carriers.\n\nThe airline's newest schedule also includes a few redeye flights -- a first for Southwest.\n\nThe overnight flights will start in mid-February on nonstop routes including Las Vegas to Baltimore and Orlando; Los Angeles to Baltimore and Nashville; and Phoenix to Baltimore. More routes will be added over time, the airline said.\n\nThe changes come as Southwest is under pressure from Elliott Investment Management. The hedge fund argues that the airline lags rivals in financial performance and has failed to change with the times. It wants to replace Jordan and Chairman Gary Kelly.\n\nSouthwest also faces increased scrutiny from the Federal Aviation Administration after a series of worrisome flights, including one that dove within 400 feet of the ocean off Hawaii, two that flew at extremely low altitudes while still miles from landing at airports in Oklahoma and Florida, and another that was discovered to have rudder-area damage after an unusual \"Dutch roll\" wiggle during a flight.\n\nSouthwest announced the seating move and other changes on the same day that both it and American Airlines reported a steep drop in second-quarter profit despite higher revenue. Airlines are struggling with higher costs and reduced pricing power, especially on flights within the United States, as the industry adds flights faster than the growth in travel demand.\n\nSouthwest, based in Dallas, said its second-quarter profit fell 46% from a year earlier, to $367 million, as higher costs for labor, fuel and other expenses outstripped an increase in revenue. The results met Wall Street expectations.\n\nAmerican Airlines also reported a 46% drop in profit, to $717 million. CEO Robert Isom said the airline was held back by a sales strategy that it is now rolling back and by an oversupply of domestic flights.\n\nAmerican said its earnings per share in the third quarter will be break-even, well below Wall Street's expectation of 48 cents per share. American also cut its forecast of full-year earnings to between 70 cents and $1.30 per share, down from a previous prediction of $2.25 to $3.25 per share.\n\nShares of the leading U.S. airlines rose Thursday. Southwest Airlines Co. gained 5.5% and American Airlines Group Inc., based in Fort Worth, Texas, rose 4%. Delta, United, Alaska and JetBlue also gained.\n\nAssociated Press writer Wyatte Grantham-Philips in New York and video journalist Teresa Crawford in Chicago contributed to this report.\n\nThis story has been updated to correct that King was interviewed at Chicago Midway airport, not O'Hare.\n\nCopyright 2024 The Associated Press.

The airline will reveal additional details around changes to the flight boarding process in September.\n\nHere are three ways flying Southwest could change.\n\nAssigned seats\n\nSouthwest is ending its open seating policy, in which customers find a cabin seat on a first-come, first-serve basis. When the changes go into effect next year, customers will purchase tickets with assigned seating, eliminating some of the stress associated with the current boarding process.\n\n\"It's a pretty big change for Southwest, which always had an open seating system, and you had to run into the cabin and try to find the seat you want,\" Clint Henderson, managing editor of The Points Guy, told CBS MoneyWatch.\n\nHenderson said this turned off some business travelers like himself from choosing to fly Southwest, and he predicted the change could attract a new crop of customers to the airline.\n\n\"Many business travelers don't want to fight for a seat and deal with the drama that sometimes entails,\" Henderson said.\n\nTensions can run high on airplanes too, with testy passengers quibbling over limited and sometimes shared real estate.\n\n\"Since the pandemic, airline passengers may be less cordial and less amicable,\" said airline customer experience analyst Marbue Brown. \"There are certainly benefits to environments where there is no ambiguity about who owns a seat.\"\n\nSome seats will have more leg room\n\nIn addition to assigned seats, Southwest will introduce premium seating, offering passengers extended legroom on one-third of a cabin's seats.\n\nSouthwest already lets customers pay to be first in line to board aircraft, \"but this is a much bigger change now, with premium seats available for purchase,\" Going.com's Keyes said.\n\nThe airline is likely responding to travelers' penchant for more premium travel experiences following the pandemic, according to Keyes. \"The demand is for premium economy, business class and better seats, which Southwest doesn't have to offer,\" he said.\n\nSouthwest's seats already offer more legroom than traditional carriers', which has been a selling point for the airline. They come with 32 inches of space, versus the industry standard of 30-31 inches. It's possible Southwest's new cabin configuration could shrink its current standard of 32 inches of space, some experts said.\n\n\"They haven't announced the new cabin design, but the most likely outcome is we're going to see that 32 inches of legroom to start to shrink for main cabin, and for it to be more like 31 or 30,\" Scott Keyes, founder of Going.com, told CBS MoneyWatch. \"That's normal for people who are used to flying American or United, but cramped for people who fly Southwest.\"\n\nPrice changes\n\nThe new cabin configurations could drive up ticket prices across the board because Southwest's aircraft might contain fewer number of total seats, industry analysts said. On the other hand, the dramatic policy changes could be price-neutral, depending on how Southwest redesigns its plane cabins.\n\n\"Some folks will pay more for extra legroom, and, based on how you reconfigure planes, you might not have to raise prices on other seats,\" Brown said.\n\nWhat remains to be seen is whether Southwest will introduce a bare-bones, basic economy-type offering.\n\nCurrently, all tickets come with free checked bags and free changes. \"But might they start to offer an economy package that includes more restrictions on baggage? That's something we'll have to wait and see,\" Keyes said.\n\nHydrothermal explosion sends water, rocks flying at Yellowstone National Park's Biscuit Basin\n\nWhat polls say about a Trump-Harris matchup", "source": {"uri": "yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Airline", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Airline"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Henderson,_Nevada", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Henderson, Nevada"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Henderson, Nevada"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CBS_News", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "CBS News"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Low-cost_carrier", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Low-cost carrier"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atmosphere", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Atmosphere"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CBS_MoneyWatch", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "CBS MoneyWatch"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brown_University", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Brown University"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Real_estate", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Real estate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Airplane", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Airplane"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flight", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Flight"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hydrothermal_explosion", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Hydrothermal explosion"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yellowstone_National_Park", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Yellowstone National Park"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Business_class", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Business class"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Transportation", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Transportation", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Travel/Transportation", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Travel/Transportation", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Aviation/Simulation", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Aviation/Simulation", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Travel/Accessories", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Travel/Accessories", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 90}], "image": "https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/MueDts8SRzdhRzpFbxw9zw--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyMDA7aD04MDA7Y2Y9d2VicA--/https://media.zenfs.com/en/cbs_news_897/69afe27c7162fcf1918e0f5ae2460be9", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9762572", "eventUri": "eng-9762572", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1607843137254903, "wgt": 174, "relevance": 1}

(NYSE: NYSE:LUV) has announced plans to introduce assigned seating and premium seating options on all flights, a significant shift from its longstanding open seating policy. This change is part of a broader strategy to enhance customer experience and increase shareholder value.\n\nAfter conducting extensive research, which indicated a strong customer preference for assigned seating, Southwest is preparing to revamp its seating arrangements. The data revealed that 80% of Southwest customers and 86% of potential customers favor an assigned seat. The open seating model, a cornerstone of Southwest's service for over 50 years, has been a point of contention for some customers, leading them to choose other airlines.\n\nThe premium seating will offer extended legroom, targeting roughly one-third of the seats on Southwest's fleet, aligning with competitors' offerings on similar aircraft. The company is also working on a cabin redesign that includes new RECARO seats, aiming to provide a more comfortable experience.\n\nIn addition to the seating changes, Southwest is expanding its operations to include redeye flights. Bookings for these overnight flights, starting on Valentine's Day 2025, are now open for select nonstop markets. This move towards 24-hour operations is expected to drive additional revenue and cost savings, aligning with the airline's three-year plan to optimize capacity without increasing aircraft capital deployment.\n\nRyan Green, previously Executive Vice President & Chief Commercial Officer, will lead these initiatives as the new Executive Vice President Commercial Transformation. Green's experience with customer trends and cabin transformation will be pivotal in rolling out these new features.\n\nThe company will provide more details, including product designs, cabin layout, and financial implications, during its Investor Day in late September. The transition to the new seating model will require Federal Aviation Administration approvals, with bookings anticipated to be available in 2025.\n\nSouthwest's leadership, including President, CEO, & Vice Chairman of the Board Bob Jordan and Executive Chairman of the Board Gary Kelly, expressed confidence in these strategic initiatives to meet evolving customer needs while staying true to Southwest's legacy.\n\nThis information is based on a press release statement from Southwest Airlines Co.\n\nIn other recent news, airlines such as American, Southwest, and Alaska Airlines have reported less-than-expected earnings despite a surge in summer travel demand. This is attributed to an oversupply of seats and increased operating expenses.\n\nTD Cowen expressed concerns over America's vulnerability to oversupplied markets and navigating a higher cost environment. Southwest also reduced its second-quarter revenue outlook, citing limited options for significant revenue performance improvement. European airlines are also grappling with similar challenges, with Ryanair (LON:0RYA)'s profits dropping significantly due to a fall in ticket prices.\n\nTD Cowen has revised Southwest Airlines' stock outlook, reducing the price target to $19.00 from the previous $26.00, while maintaining a Hold rating on the shares. This adjustment comes amid concerns over the airline's performance forecasts for the second quarter and second half of 2024.\n\nThe firm also expressed a cautious stance on Southwest's ability to significantly improve its Revenue per Available Seat Mile (RASM) and narrow the profit margin gap with its competitors.\n\nThe Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) is investigating a series of incidents involving Southwest Airlines related to low-altitude flights. These incidents have raised questions about operational safety and protocols within the airline. In response, Southwest Airlines has stated that it is working with the FAA to resolve any irregularities and emphasized safety as its utmost priority.\n\nLastly, Southwest Airlines has announced the appointment of Rakesh Gangwal, a seasoned aviation executive, to its Board of Directors. This move comes amidst Elliott Investment Management's call for leadership changes within the company, following Southwest's continued underperformance. In response, Southwest has implemented a \"poison pill\" strategy to prevent Elliott from increasing its stake beyond 12.5%.\n\nAs Southwest Airlines Co. (NYSE: LUV) embarks on a transformation of its seating policy and cabin experience, it's important to consider the company's financial health and market performance, which can be illuminated by key metrics and insights from InvestingPro.\n\nInvestingPro Tips indicate that Southwest holds more cash than debt on its balance sheet, which could provide the financial flexibility needed to implement the new seating arrangements and cabin redesigns. Additionally, while 9 analysts have revised their earnings downwards for the upcoming period, the company is still expected to be profitable this year and has been profitable over the last twelve months.\n\nFrom a financial standpoint, Southwest Airlines has a market capitalization of $15.92 billion and is trading at a high earnings multiple, with a P/E ratio of 40.47. The adjusted P/E ratio for the last twelve months as of Q1 2024 stands at 18.36, signaling investor confidence in future earnings potential. Moreover, the company's revenue growth has been positive, with a 7.6% increase over the last twelve months and a 10.92% quarterly revenue growth in Q1 2024.\n\nFor readers interested in deeper analysis and additional insights, there are more InvestingPro Tips available for Southwest Airlines at https://www.investing.com/pro/LUV.

Delays in Boeing deliveries and industry-wide pricing pressures have impacted earnings. The airline plans to introduce assigned seating, premium options, and overnight flights to enhance revenue. CEO Bob Jordan highlights a fundamental transformation aimed at financial recovery.\n\nSouthwest Airlines announced sweeping changes on Thursday, including plans to end open seating that has been the hallmark of its brand for decades as it faces investor pressure to improve results and shore up its share price. Earnings have been under pressure in recent quarters, partly because of delays in plane deliveries from Boeing, which have hit revenue and worsened cost pressures. Southwest is also facing pricing pressure as an industry-wide overcapacity in the domestic market has dampened airfares.\n\nBut Southwest's shares have lost about 30% of their value over the past two years, during a time when the broad-market S&P 500 has gained about 37%. Activist investor Elliott Investment Management is pushing for leadership changes, saying the company needs fresh perspectives to compete in the modern airline industry. It has warned of a proxy fight. Southwest CEO Bob Jordan said on Thursday that Elliott has not shown willingness to engage in any meaningful conversations, adding that the airline is taking steps to transform itself and hit its financial goals.\n\n\"We do see this as a fundamental transformation of Southwest Airlines,\" Jordan said on the company's earnings call. That includes the end of open seating that the company has been known for since the 1970s when it started operations, driven by its founder, Herb Kelleher.\n\nShares rose 6% at $28.31 in afternoon trade. While all U.S. carriers are facing pressure to discount fares due to an excess supply of seats in the domestic market, airlines like Delta and United are leaning on long-haul international flights and high-margin premium cabins to protect their profit.\n\nSouthwest currently doesn't offer these products, but said on Thursday that it now plans on offering seats with extra legroom on its airplanes. The company's research shows that 80% of its customers, and 86% of potential customers prefer an assigned seat. It also plans to offer premium, extended legroom seats, which will account for roughly one-third of seats across its fleet.\n\nThe company said the new cabin layout will require approvals from the U.S. Federal Aviation Administration and is expected to be available for bookings in 2025. U.S. carriers have been reporting strong demand for high-margin premium cabins. Alaska Airlines last week said it would add 1.3 million premium seats annually to its mainline fleet.\n\nThe company said adding premium seats will require little investment, without offering more details. It did not quantify the boost to its earnings and revenue, either. Southwest plans to share more details at its investor day in September. It will also start overnight flights in February.\n\n\"Southwest's announcement of revenue-enhancement initiatives, purporting to offer assigned seating, premium-seating options and redeye flights, comes more than a decade late,\" Elliott Investment said in a statement. Elliott also reiterated its call for a new leadership at the carrier.\n\nJordan said the company currently has no plans to start charging for bags, adding the airline's data shows that a no-bag fee policy is the number one reason customers choose it. Southwest said it was in discussions with Boeing about the negative financial impact it faces from delayed deliveries. It expects compensation in the form of price discounts.\n\nIt expects third-quarter unit revenue to be flat to down 2% year-on-year, while non-fuel operating costs are estimated to be up 11%-13%. TD Cowen analyst Thomas Fitzgerald said Southwest's outlook implies losses in the current quarter and breakeven in the fourth quarter.\n\nSouthwest's second-quarter adjusted profit came in at 58 cents per share, compared with analysts' average estimate of 51 cents per share, according to LSEG data.", "source": {"uri": "devdiscourse.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Devdiscourse"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Southwest_Airlines", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Southwest Airlines"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Airline", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Airline"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bob_Jordan_(businessman)", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Bob Jordan (businessman)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boeing", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Boeing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chief_executive_officer", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Chief executive officer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/S&P_500_Index", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "S&P 500 Index"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elliott_Investment_Management", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Elliott Investment Management"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proxy_fight", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Proxy fight"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Herb_Kelleher", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Herb Kelleher"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Delta_Air_Lines", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Delta Air Lines"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Airplane", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Airplane"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jordan", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Jordan"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Jordan"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alaska_Airlines", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Alaska Airlines"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Aviation_Administration", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Federal Aviation Administration"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_dollar", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "United States dollar"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Transportation", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Transportation", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Travel/Transportation", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Travel/Transportation", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Financial_Services/Leasing_Services", "label": "dmoz/Business/Financial Services/Leasing Services", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 82}], "image": "https://www.devdiscourse.com/remote.axd?https://devdiscourse.blob.core.windows.net/aiimagegallery/28_06_2024_12_36_39_4872119.png?width=920&format=jpeg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9762572", "eventUri": "eng-9762572", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.09019607843137256, "wgt": 172, "relevance": 1}

She was heading back to her home in Oswego after a nearly weeklong vacation in Tampa.\n\nThe 37-year-old was happy with her Southwest flight, namely the relatively cheap price and ability to bring two checked bags for free. But something that can cause a headache, she said, is not having a guarantee that her whole group can sit together.\n\nThis won't be a worry for much longer. The airline announced Thursday that it will start assigning seats and offering premium seating for customers seeking more legroom, a change some loyal travelers at Chicago's airports said they welcome -- if it doesn't raise ticket prices.\n\nAs the dominant airline at the Southwest Side airport, Southwest is used by many Chicagoans and visitors to the city. The airline has some service at O'Hare International Airport, although it moved to trim flights in April.\n\nThe airline said it changed its 50-year model in response to changing consumer preferences, with travelers booking longer flights and wanting an assigned seat. Surveys showed 80% of its customers, and 86% of potential customers preferred assigned seating, and the top reason passengers selected a different airline was Southwest's open seating policy, the company said in a statement. It hopes the moves will generate revenue and boost its financial performance.\n\nDuring Schuber's flight, she said she had to go to the back of the plane to find a spot to sit with her kids, an 8-, 5- and 2-year-old. While she's appreciative of Southwest's family boarding -- which allows two adults traveling with a child 6 years old or younger to board between the \"A\" and \"B\" group -- it would be nice to know where they are seated beforehand.\n\nWhen asked if she would take advantage of the new policy, she replied \"Oh yeah.\"\n\nHenry Harteveldt, an aviation industry analyst who said he's previously worked with Southwest, said it's a \"terrific move\" by the airline that will please many customers and attract new ones. It will \"take away all of the drama\" from open seating, which Harteveldt called \"boarding bingo.\"\n\nSouthwest's boarding process started as a way to quickly load passengers, limiting the time planes and crews spent sitting idly on the ground. In the beginning, the first 30 to check in were put in the coveted \"A\" boarding group, guaranteeing them a window or aisle seat. Dawdlers landed in \"B,\" which was still OK, or \"C,\" which would often result in a middle seat.\n\nWhile it helped the airline operate more efficiently and even squeeze a few more flights into the daily schedule, the system became less democratic over time as Southwest let people pay extra to guarantee a spot near the front of the line.\n\n\"Some people like the community that is built in the boarding lines, and open seating has been a hallmark of how Southwest has operated for more than 52 years,\" Harteveldt said. \"But no business stays the same in a 50-year-plus operating history, and this evolution of how Southwest is going to do business makes a lot of sense.\"\n\nLeena Saleh, 27, flew into Midway Thursday from Florida to visit family. She never particularly minded open-seating, but said it would be convenient to sit by her husband when she doesn't fly alone.\n\n\"I would definitely (select a seat) if it doesn't have any added money, like with some flights you can choose if you put money toward it,\" she said.\n\nAnn Gabriel, who is visiting Chicago from Columbus for her cousin's granddaughter's quincea\u00f1era, agreed. She said as long as the prices stay reasonable and she can check in early she's fine with the change.\n\n\"They have the free bags,\" the 75-year-old said. \"It's a little bit of a cattle call when you get on, but there's plenty of room.\"\n\nSouthwest also plans to sell premium seating with more legroom -- matching a practice that is standard among other large U.S. carriers -- and to offer redeye flights for the first time, starting Feb. 14, on nonstop routes including Las Vegas to Baltimore and Orlando; Los Angeles to Baltimore and Nashville; and Phoenix to Baltimore, with more routes added over time.\n\nExtra legroom options, in previously all-coach cabins, will help Southwest increase its competitiveness in the market, Harteveldt said, as airlines struggle with higher costs and reduced pricing power, especially on domestic flights. Harteveldt anticipates Southwest will leverage the new seat assignment model to promote its rewards program and credit card, offering loyal customers free or early access to top seats.\n\nSouthwest, based in Dallas, announced the changes on the same day both it and American Airlines reported a steep drop in second-quarter profit despite higher revenue. The airline is under pressure from Elliott Investment Management, which argues that the airline lags rivals in financial performance.\n\nHarteveldt pointed to the airline's decision to keep its two free checked bags policy, despite investor pressure, as an example of it balancing its financial gains and customer satisfaction.\n\n\"I think that Southwest does want to find ways to find a balance between improving its revenue, giving customers much more control over their journey, but also still being fair to customers,\" Harteveldt said. \"And so it remains this relatively egalitarian airline.\"", "source": {"uri": "chicagotribune.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Chicago Tribune"}, "authors": [{"uri": "rebecca_johnson@chicagotribune.com", "name": "Rebecca Johnson", "type":

There is currently no implementation date for the change, but it comes after months of speculation that open seating was on the chopping block.\n\nThe company is under pressure from both ends, with the three major carriers making significant profits from premium offerings, while budget carriers like Spirit and Frontier offer extremely low ticket prices while charging for add-ons. Investors have been pushing for the company to become more profitable. Southwest currently stands alone amongst major airlines for offering two complementary checked bags to all customers, and it doesn't charge for changed flights.\n\n\"Although our unique open-seating model has been a part of Southwest Airlines since our inception, our thoughtful and extensive research makes it clear this is the right choice -- at the right time -- for our customers, our people and our shareholders,\" CEO Bob Jordan said.", "source": {"uri": "mensjournal.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Men's Journal"}, "authors": [{"uri": "chris_mench@mensjournal.com", "name": "Chris Mench", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Southwest_Airlines", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Southwest Airlines"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Low-cost_carrier", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Low-cost carrier"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Airline", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Airline"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bob_Jordan_(businessman)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Bob Jordan (businessman)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Major_airlines_of_the_United_States", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Major airlines of the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shareholder", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Shareholder"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chief_executive_officer", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Chief executive officer"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Business/Business_Services/Customer_Management", "label": "dmoz/Business/Business Services/Customer Management", "wgt": 17}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Customer_Service/Software", "label": "dmoz/Business/Customer Service/Software", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Transportation_and_Logistics/Customs", "label": "dmoz/Business/Transportation and Logistics/Customs", "wgt": 16}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Customer_Service/Consulting", "label": "dmoz/Business/Customer Service/Consulting", "wgt": 18}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Management/Organizational_Change", "label": "dmoz/Business/Management/Organizational Change", "wgt": 21}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 91}], "image": "https://www.mensjournal.com/.image/ar_1.91%2Cc_fill%2Ccs_srgb%2Cfl_progressive%2Cg_faces:center%2Cq_auto:good%2Cw_1200/MjA4MTAxNDg5Nzg3MjgzMDg4/southwest-airlines-arrives-at-san-diego-international-airport.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9762572", "eventUri": "eng-9762572", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.05882352941176472, "wgt": 171, "relevance": 1}

Now What?", "body": "On Thursday, the airline announced it would eliminate a boarding process that allowed passengers to choose their seats. Many Southwest fans were not happy -- and expressed worry that more changes might be coming.\n\nOn Thursday, Southwest Airlines announced that its unique boarding system allowing passengers to choose their own seats would change to assigned seating. The carrier had been mulling the change for months, but the announcement still came as a shock to passengers, as the open-seating policy had been in place for more than 50 years and earned the airline ardent and loyal fans -- as well as plenty of detractors.\n\nWith open seating, passengers weren't assigned seats at purchase or upon check in, but instead received a boarding position -- a letter group and a number. At the gate, passengers would stand in line according to their boarding position, and then once on the plane, could choose any seat they wanted, first come, first served.\n\nAs word of the change quickly spread, dedicated Southwest travelers expressed strong emotional reactions on social media and the discussion forum on Southwest's website. Some, like Evan Bell, hope the carrier reverses the plan.\n\n\"I'm definitely discouraged from flying with Southwest,\" said Mr. Bell, of Indianapolis. \"I looked forward to flying with them, because I could sit anywhere.\"\n\nTo Mr. Bell and other passengers, the airline had little comfort: \"We know that assigned seating is not preferable for every customer,\" it responded repeatedly on X to worried posts. \"We're evolving to meet changing customer preferences, and our research clearly indicates a desire for assigned seating.\"\n\nTravelers also speculated online about when assigned seating would begin next year, how it would work with current expedited boarding offerings and what other changes could follow: Will the airline charge for assigned seats, putting it squarely in line with most other domestic airlines? And what about the two free checked bags that Southwest allots each traveler, another of the airline's idiosyncrasies. When other airlines are increasing baggage fees, will that appreciated perk disappear as well?\n\nOpen seating, which felt classless, was a hallmark of the Southwest flying experience\n\nOpen seating was a primary reason they remained loyal to Southwest, many travelers said, and the policy was a major differentiator from competing carriers.\n\n\"I liked open seating because it didn't classify people based on levels or cost, rather people could sit anywhere,\" said Mr. Bell, 27, who works in communication and marketing. The airline's decision felt, he said, like \"just another corporate money grab.\"\n\n\"Why do I have to pay for a seat? If I wanted that I would go to Delta, American or United,\" he continued. \"Flight tickets already cost a lot, so why nickel-and-dime folks more?\"\n\nSome travelers believe that the policy was more efficient than that of other airlines and shaved minutes off boarding.\n\nBut others remarked that the airline's open boarding had recently been on a steady decline, saying they saw other travelers engaging in bad or improper behavior, like saving seats for others and abusing expedited boarding policies.\n\nOne person posted on Reddit said they saw lines of more than a dozen people in wheelchairs waiting to board Southwest flights early. The poster alleged that upon arrival, some travelers seemed to no longer need the assistance.\n\n\"The flights to Vegas are miraculous,\" another person wrote. \"Half the plane is healed over the Rocky Mountains!\"\n\nFlexibility for business travelers\n\nThe flexibility provided by open boarding facilitated -- and eased -- last-minute work travel, one business traveler said.\n\nBefore moving to Cleveland in 2020, Michael Gerhart flew Southwest for years from Bradley International Airport in Hartford, Conn., reaching the airline's A-list status that granted same-day changes and priority boarding -- yes, even Southwest had tiers.\n\n\"I didn't have to pay more for preferred seating, and then have to justify it to my company's accountants, but had my choice of seating on any flight,\" said Mr. Gerhart, a 49-year-old industrial sales executive. \"I hate shuffling slowly through first class, and comfort class, then having to fight for baggage space on other airlines, unless I pay a load more. It's demeaning.\"\n\nComing soon: premium seating\n\nSouthwest has been struggling financially: The airline reported a loss of $231 million for the first quarter of this year, and cost-cutting measures in recent months included eliminating service to certain airports and reducing its flight schedule at others.\n\nThe policy changes are part of a broader effort \"to mitigate near-term revenue challenges and implement longer-term transformational initiatives,\" Bob Jordan, the airline's chief executive, said in a statement on Thursday announcing the airline's second quarter performance, which he said \"fell short.\"\n\nTimothy Sandefur, vice president for legal affairs at the libertarian think tank Goldwater Institute, said in a post on X that the airline had made a \"terrible decision.\"\n\n\"Trying to appeal to new customers by eliminating the things that make existing customers loyal seems unwise,\" he wrote.\n\nUnlike other airlines, Southwest doesn't charge for choosing a seat, and it's unclear if this will change when assigned seating begins next year. The carrier also announced on Thursday that it will begin offering premium seating with more legroom, a popular and potentially lucrative option sold by other airlines, in a bid to increase revenue.\n\nFollow New York Times Travel on Instagram and sign up for our weekly Travel Dispatch newsletter to get expert tips on traveling smarter and inspiration for your next vacation.

If you don't like it, fly on a different airline,\" one upset fan tweeted.\n\nSomeone else blatantly called the policy switch a \"terrible decision.\"\n\n\"It was literally the one reason I only flew Southwest. They've become just another airline now, as far as I'm concerned,\" another user lamented, while others worried about how the new change will impact Southwest's flight prices.\n\n\"Ugh that sucks. That means their flights are about to get more expensive,\" one person predicted.\n\nAnother disappointed X user wrote, \"Inexpensive flights are the whole point of flying SW. Assume assigned seats cost more and kind of defeat the purpose of flying SW. It's started to get to the point where you need early bird check in to avoid C anyway. Kind of a bummer.\"\n\nOthers, however, were in favor of the news, including those who were never fans of the open seating business model.\n\n\"But they really weren't that cheap.

Coming out of the pandemic, though, they've struggled. There are two basic reasons why.\n\nThey have several strategies to address their deficiencies. None of them address their fleet limitations, that don't allow them to serve smaller or farther-flung destinations. They've toyed around with partnerships and codeshares that would allow them to sell more destinations but that hasn't been part of the recent narrative.\n\nWhat the airline is doing is trying to get customers to spend more, in part by flying their current planes more and in part by shifts in their product. These are likely to offer mixed results.\n\nThis is a huge break for Southwest Airlines. I expected they would offer some premium seating, and that this would require assigning those seats, but that they would keep boarding groups for the rest of the cabin. That's not the direction they're going.\n\nCurrently Southwest sells Early Bird check-in, which means earlier boarding and better seats. They earn hundreds of millions of dollars from this product. And their most expensive Business Select fares come with the first 15 boarding slots on a flight. That's the reason to buy up. So monetizing seat assignments isn't all revenue upside. It's unclear how much it will contribute to the bottom line.\n\nHowever the airline recognizes that while their seating method is beloved by some, it also keeps many others away from choosing the airline. I don't like queueing half an hour before my flight. I'd prefer to board at my leisure and have my chosen seat.\n\nOn the other hand, though, the current seating strategy means that most seats are available when you board. On competitors, the best seats are often booked up weeks prior to travel. If you make last minute travel plans, or change your travel plans, you have a shot at a better seat on Southwest but often not on competitors.\n\nSouthwest's current boarding is also highly efficient, getting people queued and onto planes quickly. It supports their quicker turnaround times and in turn makes their aircraft utilization more efficient. That saves them money - the cost of several planes a year.\n\nAssigned seats will appeal to some, not others, and comes with real inefficiencies. So it's an open question how this plays out.\n\nOf course there are two other huge advantages seat assignments will bring,\n\nWith one simple change - assigned seating - you'll solve many of the problems that turn boarding a Southwest Airlines flight into an exercise in game theory.\n\nThe reason you want to board earlier and select your seat is to get a better seat. That may just mean an aisle seat, but it can also mean one nearer the front or one that offers more legroom.\n\nAnd for longer flights especially knowing you'll have enough space to open your laptop and work matters, or just not to feel squished.\n\nSouthwest hasn't been able to meet market demand for this. I'd certainly prefer extra legroom coach over non-extra legroom coach, either via my status or even paying (a reasonable price) for it.\n\nThis makes sense, and it requires some element of assigned seating or else early boarders would just take the best seats. Everyone would fake a wheelchair-requiring disability!\n\nWe don't yet know whether the premium seat product will come with other benefits, like free drinks or upgraded snacks?\n\nAdding premium seats means giving more space to some seats and that space has to come from somewhere. You can remove rows of seats, and potentially sell fewer tickets. Southwest could do that with their lower load factors, but trying to appease Wall Street that seems unlikely.\n\nCurrently Southwest and JetBlue offer the most space per passenger in regular coach of any airline, up to a couple more inches at every seat compared to Delta, United and American. They really do not promote this.\n\nThey also are introducing new seats that appear firmer and less padded. That offers the potential of some additional space in the cabin. There is a strong likelihood that premium seat space comes at the expense of space in the rest of the cabin.\n\nSouthwest Airlines is introducing redeye flying, and has added flights into its schedule starting in February such as\n\nLos Angeles - Baltimore at Southwest.com\n\nThis makes sense. First, they already have the planes, so the additional overnight flying is relatively inexpensive. They need to pay for crew and fuel, but they've added this flying into their labor contracts. Second, it allows connections and destination pairs that weren't previously possible. Southwest is big in Hawaii, but without redeye departures from Hawaii they're limited to mostly passengers between Hawaii and the West Coast. They can't fly passengers from Hawaii to Texas, for instance, without an overnight.\n\nIt's not a panacea, and this is likely to be lower-yield revenue overall on these flights. Cheap overnight seats could also compete down the fares they're able to get on other service. But it makes sense.\n\nSouthwest's core value proposition has been 'Transfarency' that they don't nickel and dime you. Before the majors went along, they had no change fees (but you do pay a difference in fare when changing flights). They don't charge for up to two 50 pound checked bags. Now their flight credits don't even expire.\n\nThe airline hasn't had a basic economy product - everyone has had access to the same fares regardless of the experience they wanted to buy. They didn't price discriminate between price-insensitive business travelers and price-sensitive leisure travelers. And they have used only incremental benefits of more expensive fare types to try to get customers to spend more.\n\nThere's been much discussion of the likelihood that they'll impose basic economy. They might even preserve free checked bags... but only one, rather than two. They could limit full-sized carry-ons like United does. They could make seats available for assignment only at check-in. And they could make fares non-changeable. Basic economy is an idea that's been pushed by activist investors who took a nearly $2 billion stake in the airline, and who are pushing for a change in leadership.\n\nThe best value benefit in travel is the Southwest Airlines Companion Pass. Regular flyers, or those earning substantial points through their co-brand credit card, can bring someone with them for just the cost of taxes. If there are two seats for sale, that second one is virtually free.\n\nAnd Southwest's elite members get to extend their earlier boarding privileges to their companion. That means they currently get the best seats for both passengers at no extra cost.\n\nIn a paid seating arrangement, where elites may not have access to all of the paid seating options free, what happens to companion seating? In other to sit together, and sit together in better seats, will the companion need to pay a seat fee? If so, the companion cost might go from just security taxes to security taxes plus the cost of preferred seating - making companion travel more costly, and the companion pass less valuable.\n\nTo offer elite benefits comparable to domestic competitors like American, United and Delta, elite members will need some access to complimentary assigned seats - perhaps not premium seats, at least until check-in if still available - but some seating benefit.\n\nAnd top elites should have access of some sort to premium seats, whether in advance or subject to availability at check-in. We don't know yet the extent to which this will be offered.\n\nSouthwest is currently offering elite status for sale through end of next year, and promoting an earlier boarding position, which people buy precisely to get the best seats. Surely they can't pull a bait-and-switch.\n\nWill Southwest still offer to sell earlier boarding? If they keep free checked bags for everyone, even basic economy, the only reason left to board early (since it doesn't gain seat choice) is overhead bin space but in general Southwest has less of a problem with that since passengers don't try to haul all their belongings on to save on bag fees.\n\nWe'll get some color during the Southwest Airlines earnings call today, but for the most part aren't likely to learn the answers to key questions at least until their Investor Day this fall and then closer to the launch of changes early next year.\n\nThey need to take care not to lose the value proposition that does still distinguish them, and for which the market continues to value their business at a higher multiple than competitors, even as they work to provide a product that more people want to buy and to pay more for. But they also need to address their inability to sell small town and long haul flights through partners in order to continue to grow.", "source": {"uri": "viewfromthewing.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "View from the Wing"}, "authors": [{"uri": "gary_leff@viewfromthewing.com", "name": "Gary Leff", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Southwest_Airlines", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Southwest Airlines"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Airline", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Airline"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hawaii", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Hawaii"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Hawaii"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Airport_check-in", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Airport check-in"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Codeshare_agreement", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Codeshare agreement"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Passenger_load_factor", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Passenger load factor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/West_Coast_of_the_United_States", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "West Coast of the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Game_theory", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Game theory"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Delta_Air_Lines", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Delta Air Lines"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JetBlue", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "JetBlue"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wall_Street", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Wall Street"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laptop", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Laptop"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disability", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Disability"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flight", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Flight"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los_Angeles", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Texas", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Texas"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Texas"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baltimore", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Baltimore"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Baltimore"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Price_discrimination", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Price discrimination"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Overhead_(business)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Overhead (business)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vacation", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Vacation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bait-and-switch", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Bait-and-switch"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Credit_card", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Credit card"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pound_sterling", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Pound sterling"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Major_League_Baseball", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Major League Baseball"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nickel", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Nickel"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Transportation", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Transportation", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Travel/Transportation", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Travel/Transportation", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Travel/Accessories", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Travel/Accessories", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 99}], "image": "https://viewfromthewing.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/20221130_120958.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9762572", "eventUri": "eng-9762572", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.06666666666666665, "wgt": 168, "relevance": 1}

That will go away and it will be replaced with assigned seating.\n\nIt's something Southwest has been known for more than 50 years, but company officials said after polling it's own customers and potential travelers aboard their airline, the choice was clear.\n\nSouthwest officials said 80% of their customers and 86% of potential customers prefer an assigned seat. The reaction from travelers across the nation has been mixed.\n\n\"Shock and awe to some extent, it probably doesn't matter in the grand scheme of things, but it's one of the things that seems like it defined Southwest,\" said Chris Spence, who travels with his wife and kids using Southwest.\n\n\"I actually kind of like that. I wonder it's going to change the prices. But there's something about knowing I'm going to be on the aisle or I'm going to be by the window, especially being tall,\" said Jeneine Welch, a Southwest flyer.\n\n\"I was livid, because the reason I fly with Southwest is because of their flexibility and the lack of assigned seating,\" said another traveler, Cynthia Reed.\n\nIn addition to the company's research, they said they did over eight million simulation-based boarding trials before making their decision.\n\nSouthwest will also offer a premium, extended legroom options, although pricing for any of the changes have not been determined yet. A spokesperson with Southwest told Denver7 more details on that would be released in September.\n\nIn a statement, President, CEO & Vice Chairman of Southwest's Board, Bob Jordan said:\n\n\"Moving to assigned seating and offering premium legroom options will be a transformational change that cuts across almost all aspects of the Company. Although our unique open seating model has been a part of Southwest Airlines since our inception, our thoughtful and extensive research makes it clear this is the right choice -- at the right time -- for our Customers, our People, and our Shareholders. We are excited to incorporate Customer and Employee feedback to design a unique experience that only Southwest can deliver. We have been building purposefully to this change as part of a comprehensive upgrade to the Southwest experience as we focus on Customer expectations - and it will unlock new sources of revenue consistent with our laser focus on delivering improved financial performance.\"\n\nPassengers Denver7 spoke with said another main draw to Southwest is their policy of allowing passengers to check two bags for free. That policy is remaining in place and is not changing.\n\nWith Southwest's open seating rule ending, Denver7 asked frequent travelers their advice on how handle the unique boarding experience.\n\n\"I think it's willing to be flexible, so I'm kind of happy with anything I've ridden on all parts of the plane,\" said Reed.\n\n\"Get it in your mind that you're going to have a seat, and it may not be exactly where you want, but you're going to have a seat, and just let it go,\" said Welch.\n\n\"Some people get a little touchy. This morning, there was a guy in line and I [had to ask], 'What's your number?' And he was like, 'This is it.' So I'm like, 'Okay then. I am in the right spot.' You know, people be people,\" explained Michelle Polson of handling confrontational customers who are unfamiliar with Southwest's boarding process.\n\nColoradans making a difference | Denver7 featured videos Denver nonprofit helping bridge Colorado labor shortage gap by teaching trade skills Denver City Council skeptical of Mayor Mike Johnston's affordable housing sales tax plan Unhealthy air quality has Coloradans concerned about short, long-term health impacts Chime Banking App refunds money to Aurora woman after scammer drains account Organizers hope to create a new Asian American Community Center in Centennial\n\nAt Denver7, we're committed to making a difference in our community.

Instead, the airline will offer assigned and \"premium\" seats with a revamped boarding model, the airline announced in a press release.\n\nSouthwest is calling the change \"part of an ongoing and comprehensive upgrade\" for customers. The company's President and CEO Bob Jordan added that research shows passengers \"overwhelmingly prefer\" an assigned-seat system like that used by other carriers.\n\nThe company said customers have been asking for such changes, noting that people often cite the airline's open seating as top reason they switch carriers.\n\n\"The research is clear and indicates that 80% of Southwest customers, and 86% of potential customers, prefer an assigned seat,\" said the airline in a statement. \"By moving to an assigned seating model, Southwest expects to broaden its appeal and attract more flying from its current and future customers.\"\n\nPeople had mixed reactions to the change. But let's be real, when you're traveling with family, that s**t is stressful -- especially if you're in a later boarding group. Southwest does offer Family Boarding between Group A and Group B, however, kids must be 6 years of age or younger to qualify.\n\nSeveral X (formally Twitter) users agree with this sentiment, noting that Southwest's out-of-the-box boarding practices are anxiety-inducing, especially when trying to grab a seat with your loved ones.\n\n\"Southwest Airlines used to be what we flew as a family. We stopped flying them because they tried separating my brother and I from our parents on multiple occasions,\" one user wrote after the news broke.\n\n\"American is significantly better than Southwest if you have a family. If you're flying alone it's fine, if you have a child or a wife it's pretty much unusable,\" another said.\n\nAnother user wrote in April 2024, \"I am flying Southwest today because it was the cheapest when I booked. This boarding process is ridiculous. As a solo traveler it kind of makes sense, but why would you ever do this with a partner or family? Is it really that worthwhile with the priority boarding I don't have?\"\n\nOthers were excited for the change, noting that since Southwest introduced the \"Early Bird\" special -- which allowed passengers to pay extra for a higher boarding number -- people had been abusing the system.\n\n\"The strategy I saw is that one person in a family would buy early boarding and save seats for their whole group. I used to enjoy southwest, but once everyone started doing things like this, you either had to pay for early boarding or get stuck with a bad seat,\" they wrote.\n\nSome people were peeved about the change, remarking the end of the Family Boarding process.\n\n\"Unfortunately, I think our family will be flying on something other than @SouthwestAir soon. We loved that the open seating meant that we could guarantee sitting together without paying extra. With that open seating coming to an end, how long until bags don't fly free?\" they asked.\n\nAnother user noted that without open seating, a guaranteed spot next to a friend might not be so easy to obtain.\n\n\"I'm actually disappointed in Southwest decision on assigned seating. I love picking my own seat. Can guarantee I sit with the person I'm traveling with,\" they wrote.\n\nSouthwest did not give details about when the changes will go into effect, but it said it would be discussed further in September.", "source": {"uri": "scarymommy.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Scary Mommy"}, "authors": [{"uri": "katie_garrity@scarymommy.com", "name": "Katie Garrity", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Airline", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Airline"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Southwest_Airlines", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Southwest Airlines"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bob_Jordan_(businessman)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Bob Jordan (businessman)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chief_executive_officer", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Chief executive officer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twitter", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Twitter"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intelsat_I", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Intelsat I"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gaming_the_system", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Gaming the system"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Home_and_Garden/Bathroom", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Home and Garden/Bathroom", "wgt": 16}, {"uri": "dmoz/Home/Family/Large_Families", "label": "dmoz/Home/Family/Large Families", "wgt": 17}, {"uri": "dmoz/Home/Family/Publications", "label": "dmoz/Home/Family/Publications", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Home/Family/Family_Resources_and_Support", "label": "dmoz/Home/Family/Family Resources and Support", "wgt": 18}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Management/Organizational_Change", "label": "dmoz/Business/Management/Organizational Change", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 63}], "image": "https://imgix.bustle.com/uploads/getty/2024/7/25/298bdc9a/orlando-florida-united-states.jpg?w=1200&h=630&fit=crop&crop=faces&fm=jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9762572", "eventUri": "eng-9762572", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.2078431372549019, "wgt": 167, "relevance": 1}

She'll check the kids in for the flight while he parks the car and brings out any heavy luggage. The ease of flying together as a family and the cheap airfares for six people have kept the Prosper-based family loyal Southwest customers for over 10 years, even before they had kids, she said.\n\nAdvertisementAdvertisement\n\nOn Thursday, Southwest announced it would do away with an over-50-year-old open seating policy that allowed passengers to choose wherever they'd like to sit, rather than pay for or be assigned to a seat on a flight, like Southwest's competitors. Southwest did not share further details on the rollout, but it plans to have more information for its investor day in late September.\n\nAviation News\n\nStay prepared.

Southwest has traditionally allowed families to board after its \"A Group\" to allow children to sit with their parents.\n\nBacon, 40, has three children with special needs. Because Bacon's children needed to travel to Houston from their home in Midland for doctor appointments, Southwest has provided cheaper airfares and frequent flight times for the four of them to get where they need to be.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nShe's been flying with Southwest since she was a child and has remained a loyal customer of the airline.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\"They really care about their passengers, and I can tell that everyone at Southwest really enjoys their job, because I fly different carriers and Southwest stands out at the top,\" Bacon said.\n\nWhen asked about family boarding, Southwest CEO Bob Jordan said there are still many details Southwest needs to work through. Greene added that almost 60% of Southwest customers are checked in within the first 30 seconds of the 24-hour check-in window and 75% are checked in within the first hour.\n\n\"If you're a busy family and you don't hit the check-in window right on the nose, that causes anxiety,\" Greene said. \"This is a way to solve a lot of those friction points the current open seating process has introduced.\"\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMarbue Brown, an airline customer experience analyst, called it a \"monumental\" change for the airline. Brown is the founder of The Customer Obsession Advantage, an organization that works to help companies achieve business results through \"customer obsession.\"\n\n\"The environment we're in now is not the same as it used to be 50 years ago when they put this policy in place,\" Brown said.\n\nHe said despite the change, the seating policy can be implemented in a \"customer-friendly\" way. He said the reputation of the airline has been built in a way that has created a \"special environment\" for travelers.\n\nBacon said she hopes Southwest will work out those details and communicate with families on how the policy will work. She hopes this won't change the happy memories she's made over the years with the airline, like the time a Southwest gate agent allowed her daughter to sing \"Happy Birthday\" to her over the PA system at Midland International Airport or friendly pilots allowing her children in the cockpit.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nGreg Kelminson, 40, of Richardson said he's been flying Southwest for most of his life, a lot within the last 15 years.

Now What?", "body": "On Thursday, Southwest Airlines announced that its unique boarding system allowing passengers to choose their own seats would change to assigned seating. The carrier had been mulling the change for months, but the announcement still came as a shock to passengers, as the open-seating policy had been in place for more than 50 years and earned the airline ardent and loyal fans -- as well as plenty of detractors.\n\nWith open seating, passengers weren't assigned seats at purchase or upon check in, but instead received a boarding position -- a letter group and a number. At the gate, passengers would stand in line according to their boarding position, and then once on the plane, could choose any seat they wanted, first come, first served.\n\nAs word of the change quickly spread, dedicated Southwest travelers expressed strong emotional reactions on social media and the discussion forum on Southwest's website. Some, like Evan Bell, hope the carrier reverses the plan.\n\n\"I'm definitely discouraged from flying with Southwest,\" said Mr. Bell, of Indianapolis. \"I looked forward to flying with them, because I could sit anywhere.\"\n\nTo Mr. Bell and other passengers, the airline had little comfort: \"We know that assigned seating is not preferable for every customer,\" it responded repeatedly on X to worried posts. \"We're evolving to meet changing customer preferences, and our research clearly indicates a desire for assigned seating.\"\n\nTravelers also speculated online about when assigned seating would begin next year, how it would work with current expedited boarding offerings and what other changes could follow: Will the airline charge for assigned seats, putting it squarely in line with most other domestic airlines? And what about the two free checked bags that Southwest allots each traveler, another of the airline's idiosyncrasies. When other airlines are increasing baggage fees, will that appreciated perk disappear as well?\n\nOpen seating was a primary reason they remained loyal to Southwest, many travelers said, and the policy was a major differentiator from competing carriers.\n\n\"I liked open seating because it didn't classify people based on levels or cost, rather people could sit anywhere,\" said Mr. Bell, 27, who works in communication and marketing. The airline's decision felt, he said, like \"just another corporate money grab.\"\n\n\"Why do I have to pay for a seat? If I wanted that I would go to Delta, American or United,\" he continued. \"Flight tickets already cost a lot, so why nickel-and-dime folks more?\"\n\nSome travelers believe that the policy was more efficient than that of other airlines and shaved minutes off boarding.\n\nBut others remarked that the airline's open boarding had recently been on a steady decline, saying they saw other travelers engaging in bad or improper behavior, like saving seats for others and abusing expedited boarding policies.\n\nOne person posted on Reddit said they saw lines of more than a dozen people in wheelchairs waiting to board Southwest flights early. The poster alleged that upon arrival, some travelers seemed to no longer need the assistance.\n\n\"The flights to Vegas are miraculous,\" another person wrote. \"Half the plane is healed over the Rocky Mountains!\"\n\nThe flexibility provided by open boarding facilitated -- and eased -- last-minute work travel, one business traveler said.\n\nBefore moving to Cleveland in 2020, Michael Gerhart flew Southwest for years from Bradley International Airport in Hartford, Conn., reaching the airline's A-list status that granted same-day changes and priority boarding -- yes, even Southwest had tiers.\n\n\"I didn't have to pay more for preferred seating, and then have to justify it to my company's accountants, but had my choice of seating on any flight,\" said Mr. Gerhart, a 49-year-old industrial sales executive. \"I hate shuffling slowly through first class, and comfort class, then having to fight for baggage space on other airlines, unless I pay a load more. It's demeaning.\"\n\nSouthwest has been struggling financially: The airline reported a loss of $231 million for the first quarter of this year, and cost-cutting measures in recent months included eliminating service to certain airports and reducing its flight schedule at others.\n\nThe policy changes are part of a broader effort \"to mitigate near-term revenue challenges and implement longer-term transformational initiatives,\" Bob Jordan, the airline's chief executive, said in a statement on Thursday announcing the airline's second quarter performance, which he said \"fell short.\"\n\nTimothy Sandefur, vice president for legal affairs at the libertarian think tank Goldwater Institute, said in a post on X that the airline had made a \"terrible decision.\"\n\n\"Trying to appeal to new customers by eliminating the things that make existing customers loyal seems unwise,\" he wrote.\n\nUnlike other airlines, Southwest doesn't charge for choosing a seat, and it's unclear if this will change when assigned seating begins next year. The carrier also announced on Thursday that it will begin offering premium seating with more legroom, a popular and potentially lucrative option sold by other airlines, in a bid to increase revenue.", "source": {"uri": "dnyuz.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "DNyuz"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Airline", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Airline"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Southwest_Airlines", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Southwest Airlines"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_media", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Social media"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indianapolis", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Indianapolis"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Indianapolis"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flight_International", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Flight International"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Delta_Air_Lines", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Delta Air Lines"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marketing", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Marketing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goldwater_Institute", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Goldwater Institute"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First_class_(aviation)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "First class (aviation)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bradley_International_Airport", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Bradley International Airport"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rocky_Mountains", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Rocky Mountains"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reddit", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Reddit"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Libertarianism", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Libertarianism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vice_President_of_the_United_States", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Vice President of the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Think_tank", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Think tank"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Airport", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Airport"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cleveland", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Cleveland"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Cleveland"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hartford,_Connecticut", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Hartford, Connecticut"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Hartford, Connecticut"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jordan", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Jordan"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Jordan"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Transportation", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Transportation", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Transportation_and_Logistics/Aviation", "label": "dmoz/Business/Transportation and Logistics/Aviation", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Travel/Transportation", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Travel/Transportation", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 86}], "image": "https://dnyuz.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Passengers-Loved-Southwest-Airlines-Open-Boarding-Now-What.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9762572", "eventUri": "eng-9762572", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.3019607843137255, "wgt": 163, "relevance": 1}

The moves could also generate revenue and boost financial performance.\n\nSouthwest made the announcement on the same day that both it and American Airlines reported a steep drop in second-quarter profit despite higher revenue.\n\nAirlines are struggling with higher costs and reduced pricing power, especially on flights within the United States, as the industry adds flights faster than the growth in travel demand.\n\nSouthwest, based in Dallas, said its second-quarter profit fell 46% from a year earlier, to $367 million, as higher costs for labor, fuel and other expenses outstripped an increase in revenue.

(Scripps News)\n\nSouthwest Airlines plans to drop its tradition of more than 50 years and start assigning seats and selling premium seating for customers who want more legroom.\n\nThe airline said Thursday that it has been studying seating options and is making the changes because passenger preferences have shifted. The moves could also generate revenue and boost financial performance.\n\nSouthwest made the announcement on the same day that both it and American Airlines reported a steep drop in second-quarter profit despite higher revenue.\n\nAirlines are struggling with higher costs and reduced pricing power, especially on flights within the United States, as the industry adds flights faster than the growth in travel demand.\n\nSouthwest, based in Dallas, said its second-quarter profit fell 46% from a year earlier, to $367 million, as higher costs for labor, fuel and other expenses outstripped an increase in revenue. The results met Wall Street expectations.\n\nPeople are also reading...

But, the airline said, preferences have \"evolved\" -- as more travelers take longer flights, they want an assigned seat.\n\nThe airline is said it will offer redeye flights for the first time.\n\nSouthwest said that its first overnight, redeye flights will land on Feb. 14, 2025 in nonstop markets that include Las Vegas to Baltimore and Orlando; Los Angeles to Baltimore and Nashville; and Phoenix to Baltimore. It plans to phase in additional redeye flights over time.\n\nAirfares are down, but baggage fees are up Low-cost airlines are reshaping how we pay for flights The rise of low-cost carriers How to navigate low-cost carrier fees\n\nCopyright 2024 The Associated Press.

The airline will offer assigned and premium seats and a revamped boarding model, it announced on Thursday.\n\nAdopting a system of \"assigned and premium seating is part of an ongoing and comprehensive upgrade\" for customers, Southwest President and CEO Bob Jordan said, adding that research shows passengers \"overwhelmingly prefer\" an assigned-seat system like that used by other carriers.\n\nIn another change, Southwest also said it would introduce redeye flights. It did not say when the new policies would be enacted.\n\nThe company unveiled the dramatic shifts in how it does business as it announced financial results for the second quarter, showing net income of $367 million on record operating revenues of $7.4 billion. In the previous quarter, Southwest lost $231 million. The airline has $11 billion in liquid funds, but it also has $8 billion in debt and is affected by the ongoing struggles at Boeing, its longtime partner.\n\n\"We are taking urgent and deliberate steps to mitigate near-term revenue challenges and implement longer-term transformational initiatives that are designed to drive meaningful top and bottom-line growth,\" Jordan said.\n\nThe Southwest CEO said in April that delivery delays of new planes from Boeing, which has been embroiled in regulators' concernsover safety issues, \"presents significant challenges for both 2024 and 2025.\"\n\nIn its update, Southwest said it received five Boeing 737-8 MAX planes in the second quarter while retiring seven older Boeing planes. Southwest had ordered 58 Boeing 737-8 MAX planes for 2024; it now expects to receive around 20 of the aircraft this year.\n\nSouthwest says it's carrying passengers in record numbers. But it's also retiring more aging aircraft than it can add this year: With the delivery delays from Boeing, the airline's fleet will fall from 817 planes at the end of the second quarter to roughly 802 at the end of 2024.", "source": {"uri": "npr.org", "dataType": "news", "title": "NPR"}, "authors": [{"uri": "bill_chappell@npr.org", "name": "Bill Chappell", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Airline", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Airline"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bob_Jordan_(businessman)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Bob Jordan (businessman)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Motto", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Motto"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Southwest_Airlines", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Southwest Airlines"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boeing", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Boeing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chief_executive_officer", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Chief executive officer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trade_name", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Trade name"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jordan", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Jordan"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Jordan"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Transportation", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Transportation", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Travel/Transportation", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Travel/Transportation", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Aviation/Multimedia", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Aviation/Multimedia", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 91}], "image": "https://npr.brightspotcdn.com/dims3/default/strip/false/crop/8256x4644+0+759/resize/1400/quality/100/format/jpeg/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fnpr-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F6e%2F3a%2F65714010421eb465777175340eeb%2Fgettyimages-1483116033.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9762572", "eventUri": "eng-9762572", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.03529411764705892, "wgt": 159, "relevance": 1}

Travelers at Pittsburgh International Airport said they have mixed feelings.\n\n\"I can get my seat when I go on,\" Farah Middleton, who lives in Pittsburgh, said.\n\nThis has remained the Southwest model for more than 50 years. You pick your seat on the plane and get the better choice, based on your boarding position and the earlier you check in.\n\nWhile Middleton doesn't mind it, others feel there's always a rush that comes with flying the airline.\n\n\"If I'm flying by myself, I don't really care, but if I'm with my family then I want to sit with them,\" Tomasso Valerio, who lives in Steubenville, Ohio, said.\n\nNow what's synonymous with the company is going away. Southwest will soon have assigned seats and will begin charging for premium seats with more legroom. It also will offer red-eye flights for the first time.\n\nThey're changes welcomed by many travelers like Nancy Steltzer, who lives in Morgantown.\n\n\"People like to have some sort of control over what and where they're going to sit and with who they're going to sit,\" Steltzer said.\n\nThe airline said it will broaden its appeal, citing research showing 80 percent of its customers and 86 percent of potential customers prefer assigned seating.

(Scripps News)\n\nSouthwest Airlines plans to drop its tradition of more than 50 years and start assigning seats and selling premium seating for customers who want more legroom.\n\nThe airline said Thursday that it has been studying seating options and is making the changes because passenger preferences have shifted. The moves could also generate revenue and boost financial performance.\n\nSouthwest made the announcement on the same day that both it and American Airlines reported a steep drop in second-quarter profit despite higher revenue.\n\nAirlines are struggling with higher costs and reduced pricing power, especially on flights within the United States, as the industry adds flights faster than the growth in travel demand.\n\nSouthwest, based in Dallas, said its second-quarter profit fell 46% from a year earlier, to $367 million, as higher costs for labor, fuel and other expenses outstripped an increase in revenue. The results met Wall Street expectations.\n\nPeople are also reading...

But, the airline said, preferences have \"evolved\" -- as more travelers take longer flights, they want an assigned seat.\n\nThe airline is said it will offer redeye flights for the first time.\n\nSouthwest said that its first overnight, redeye flights will land on Feb. 14, 2025 in nonstop markets that include Las Vegas to Baltimore and Orlando; Los Angeles to Baltimore and Nashville; and Phoenix to Baltimore.

Instead, it will begin assigning seats and offer premium, extra leg room seating.\n\nShares of the domestic carrier rose more than 5% in early trading.\n\nSouthwest CEO Bob Jordan said \"our implementation of assigned and premium seating is part of an ongoing and comprehensive upgrade to the Customer Experience, one that research shows Customers overwhelmingly prefer.\"\n\nThe low-fare airline has had a tradition of open seating for more than 50 years. Customers taking longer flights preferred assigned seats, according to Southwest.\n\nAirlines can also charge more for assigned and premium seating, enabling them to boost profits.\n\nBut CFRA equity analyst Zachary Warring didn't seem convinced the airline's declining margins would be helped by the seating change.\n\n\"The company announced the end of its open seating policy in a move to turn around its margin problem, but we believe may upset its customer base,\" Warring wrote on Thursday morning.\n\n\"We remain neutral on shares as we believe the U.S. consumer is showing signs of cracking while capacity remains elevated while LUV's multiple remains elevated,\" he added.\n\nThe changes come amid pressure from activist investor Elliott Management, who earlier this month warned of a proxy fight as it seeks a \"new, truly independent\" board of directors.\n\nSouthwest also announced it will add the introduction of overnight, redeye flights with the first routes starting on Valentine's Day in 2025.\n\nThe carrier also posted its quarterly results on Thursday. Adjusted earnings per share came in at $0.58 versus Wall Street estimates of $0.51. Revenue came in at $7.35 billion versus $7.33 billion expected by analysts.\n\nIncreased competition and higher labor costs have weighed on domestic carrier's profits.

In May, Southwest\n\nYears ago, when I first learned that the airline didn't do red-eyes, I was extremely surprised ... because aircrafts don't make money on the ground, which was the main reason Southwest didn't offer assigned seating. They wanted to turn the planes around as fast as possible and one way to do that was to have passengers choose any seat they wanted when they got on the plane, instead of trying to figure out where their assigned seat was located.\n\nAlmost all SWA travelers know that not all seats are created equal, which is why some will pay a premium ($30 to $80) to get Southwest Airlines Boarding Group A, so they can board the plane first, snag the exit row seats, bulkhead, or aisle or window seats closest to the front of the cabin, and be among the first to deplane.\n\nNot assigning seats was essentially a social experiment and it always brought out both the best and the worst in people. I met some nice people trying to find my place in line but have also seen the dirty tricks customers with no conscience would play to keep the seat beside them open. The worst trick I saw was when some passengers claimed they had an injury or medical condition that required them to be in a wheelchair so they could get a seat towards the front of the aircraft and not have to pay extra or worry about their bags not making it into the overhead bins.\n\nFlight attendants sometimes quip that they work miracle flights because passengers board with a wheelchair but walk off when they land. It was infuriating for travelers who paid extra or who had a legitimate handicap. The other trick some SWA passengers have played is having just one member of their family or party pay for Group A boarding and then they would save seats for the others. Some flight attendants would crack down on it but others wouldn't. Here are some of the other tricks.\n\nTaylor Swift told the graduates of NYU in her commencement speech a couple of years ago that even her and her mom used to play a funny trick back when she flew commercial. Others do the same, like this guy pretending he's about to throw up in a barf bag or the one below, pretending to be comforting a crying baby under a blanket.\n\nSouthwest's CEO, Bob Jordan, has been under fire because customers were getting sick and tired of the games and ruining the whole SWA experience. Then when a hedge fund, Elliott Management, bought a huge stake in the company, they were pushing for change to make more money and for Jordan to resign.\n\nWell, all those tricks are about to come to an end. Jordan had to cave to save his job and possibly the airline. According to a SWA press release, Jordan said, \"Although our unique open seating model has been a part of Southwest Airlines since our inception, our thoughtful and extensive research makes it clear this is the right choice -- at the right time -- for our Customers, our People, and our Shareholders. We are excited to incorporate Customer and Employee feedback to design a unique experience that only Southwest can deliver. We have been building purposefully to this change as part of a comprehensive upgrade to the Southwest experience as we focus on Customer expectations - and it will unlock new sources of revenue consistent with our laser focus on delivering improved financial performance.\"\n\nSouthwest also announced it is \"adding 24-hour operation capabilities with the introduction of overnight, redeye flights. Booking on initial routes is available today through Southwest.com, with the first overnight flights landing on Valentine's Day 2025 in five initial nonstop markets: Las Vegas to Baltimore and Orlando; Los Angeles to Baltimore and Nashville; and Phoenix to Baltimore. Southwest plans to phase in additional redeye flying in the carrier's coming schedules as part of its multi-year transformation to a 24-hour operation. Redeye flying, coupled with continued reductions in turn-time through new technologies and procedures, is expected to provide incremental revenue and cost savings, enabling Southwest to fund nearly all new capacity over the next three years without incremental aircraft capital deployment.\"\n\nAs you can imagine, some customers are not happy with the changes but I think it's great. I stopped flying SWA because they didn't assign seats. I didn't want to chance not getting a row without extra legroom so I can work. I don't mind spending more money to have that space.\n\nHow do you feel about these changes? Will they make you more or less likely to fly Southwest Airlines?

The band likes the open seating - they say if they check in on time they can all sit together, without paying for a seat like other airlines.\n\n\"Southwest has kind of always been different and unique in that way,\" Wiggins said.\n\nBut that is coming to an end - the airline is making the change to assigned seats after they said 80% of their customers prefer it. Wiggins is not part of the 80%.\n\n\"If you're going to be like every other airline, then we're going to choose another airline that maybe has better prices if you're not going to give us the convenience of the relaxed environment that we're used to,\" Wiggins said.\n\nThere will also be new red-eye flights and extra legroom for a price.\n\n\"I'm 5'2 so that's not for me, but I can see why people would,\" Southwest flyer Anna Love said.\n\nFor others - this all comes as good news.\n\n\"This was our first time flying Southwest and I loved it. My only complaint - like I told my husband - was I wish we could have chosen our seats.

The airline is grappling with revenue declines due to Boeing delivery delays and pricing pressures in the domestic market. Activist investor Elliott Investment Management is advocating for leadership changes to enhance competitiveness.\n\nSouthwest Airlines on Thursday announced sweeping changes, including plans to end open seating and offer seats with extra legroom on its airplanes as it faces pressure from an activist investor to improve financial results. The airline's earnings have been under pressure in recent quarters, partly because of delays in plane deliveries from Boeing, which have hit its revenue and worsened cost pressures. It is also facing pricing pressure as an industry-wide overcapacity in the domestic market has dampened airfares.\n\nThe outlook for the September quarter is not upbeat, either. It expects third-quarter unit revenue to be flat to down 2% year-on-year, while non-fuel operating costs are estimated to be up 11%-13%. TD Cowen analyst Thomas Fitzgerald said Southwest's outlook implies losses in the current quarter and breakeven in the fourth quarter.\n\nSouthwest's shares were up about 1.5% at $27.03 in morning trade. While all U.S. carriers are facing pressure to discount fares due to an excess supply of seats in the domestic market, airlines like Delta and United Airlines are leaning on long-haul international flights and high-margin premium cabins to protect their profit.\n\nSouthwest currently doesn't offer these products. Activist investor Elliott Investment Management is pushing for leadership changes, saying the company needs fresh perspectives to compete in the modern airline industry. It has warned of a proxy fight.\n\nSouthwest said its research shows that 80% of its customers, and 86% of potential customers prefer an assigned seat. It also has plans to offer premium, extended legroom seats, which will account roughly one-third of seats across its fleet.\n\nThe company said the new cabin layout will require approvals from the U.S. Federal Aviation Administration and is expected to be available for bookings in 2025. \"We are taking urgent and deliberate steps to mitigate near-term revenue challenges,\" Southwest CEO Bob Jordan said on Thursday.\n\nU.S. carriers have been reporting strong demand for high-margin premium cabins. Alaska Airlines last week said it would add 1.3 million premium seats annually to its mainline fleet. Southwest will also start overnight flights in February.\n\nThe company plans to share more details at its investor day in September. Southwest said it was in discussions with Boeing about the negative financial impact it faces from delayed deliveries. It expects compensation in the form of price discounts.\n\nIts second-quarter adjusted profit came in at 58 cents per share, compared with analysts' average estimate of 51 cents per share, according to LSEG data.", "source": {"uri": "devdiscourse.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Devdiscourse"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Southwest_Airlines", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Southwest Airlines"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boeing", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Boeing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elliott_Investment_Management", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Elliott Investment Management"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Airplane", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Airplane"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Airline", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Airline"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Delta_Air_Lines", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Delta Air Lines"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flight_length", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Flight length"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Airlines", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United Airlines"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proxy_fight", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Proxy fight"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alaska_Airlines", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Alaska Airlines"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Aviation_Administration", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Federal Aviation Administration"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_dollar", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "United States dollar"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chief_executive_officer", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Chief executive officer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jordan", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Jordan"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Jordan"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Transportation", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Transportation", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Travel/Transportation", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Travel/Transportation", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Financial_Services/Leasing_Services", "label": "dmoz/Business/Financial Services/Leasing Services", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 84}], "image": "https://www.devdiscourse.com/remote.axd?https://devdiscourse.blob.core.windows.net/aiimagegallery/28_06_2024_12_36_39_4872119.png?width=920&format=jpeg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9762572", "eventUri": "eng-9762572", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.07450980392156858, "wgt": 154, "relevance": 1}

Overnight flights are the focus of this article, with five routes seeing them in February 2025. More routes will have such services in March/April.\n\nMark the date: July 25, 2024. This was when Southwest revealed the end of 'open' seating in exchange for assigned seating. The considerable change, to be operational next year, is all about attracting more passengers and benefiting from their additional revenue. Like other carriers, it will also generate extra revenue by enabling passengers to pick particular seats and extra legroom options. Elsewhere, its first overnight flights have been loaded.\n\nWelcome to overnight flights\n\nSouthwest has not had red-eye flights in its 53-year history, so it has always been highly unusual in the US sky. Indeed, many other US carriers regularly fly overnight, such as American, Alaska Airways, Breeze, Delta, Frontier, Spirit, Sun Country, United, and so on. Southwest will join them in February 2025.\n\nImage: GCMap\n\nWhile start dates and the specific routes and flights are subject to change, searching Southwest's website indicates that the following are available to book as of July 25. Unsurprisingly, they're all longer services to/from some of its major airports that pass various time zones.\n\nLos Angeles-Baltimore: 21:30-05:20+1 (begins February 13) Las Vegas-Baltimore: 22:00-05:30+1 (begins February 13) Las Vegas-Orlando: 22:50-06:05+1 (begins February 13) Phoenix-Baltimore: 23:05-05:10+1 (begins February 13) Los Angeles-Nashville: 23:45-06:00+1 (begins February 13) Image: Southwest Why no overnight flights until now?\n\nWhile Southwest has not had overnight services, it has many departures from 05:00 and many extremely late (or early) arrivals past 01:00. As hard as it might be to appreciate, Southwest couldn't schedule overnight services until 2017 due to its old reservation system.\n\nShifting to a much newer system enabled it, but it has taken years to get to this point. While unconfirmed, it is believed that no contractual problems with pilots or cabin crew stood in the way.\n\nPhoto: Southwest\n\nAircraft on the ground at night enable routine maintenance, keeping things simple. However, this means that Southwest might be somewhat missing out on additional revenue opportunities, which the airline is now evidently keen to pursue, undoubtedly because of its new investor, Elliott Investment Management.\n\nIt should also enable higher aircraft productivity, a meaningful way to reduce seat-mile costs. Indeed, according to the US Department of Transportation Form 41 for Q1 2024, Southwest's block hours per aircraft per day averaged 9.82. It fell from 11.08 hours 30 years ago and 10.93 hours 20 years ago and is about the same as a decade ago.\n\nRelated Long & Short: Top US Airlines Ranked By Average Domestic Flight Length\n\nThis article examines the situation for 13 airlines with 94% of US domestic flights in July.\n\nA few overnight flights won't make much difference, but they are intriguing. Combined with Southwest's new seating policy, it suggests a significant change in mindset. What else will be next? Pay-for checked bags? However, that's an important differentiating factor from other carriers.", "source": {"uri": "simpleflying.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Simple Flying"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red-eye_flight", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Red-eye flight"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sun_Country_Airlines", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Sun Country Airlines"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Delta_Air_Lines", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Delta Air Lines"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Airport", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Airport"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flight", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Flight"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alaska", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Alaska"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Alaska"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elliott_Investment_Management", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Elliott Investment Management"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flight_International", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Flight International"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domestic_flight", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Domestic flight"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Department_of_Transportation", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "United States Department of Transportation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Available_seat_miles", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Available seat miles"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indian_reservation", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Indian reservation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Productivity", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Productivity"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flight_attendant", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Flight attendant"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Airline", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Airline"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Transportation", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Transportation", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Aviation", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Aviation", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Travel/Transportation", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Travel/Transportation", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 79}], "image": "https://static1.simpleflyingimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/southwest-737-night1-shutterstock_3675803.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9762572", "eventUri": "eng-9762572", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-07-25", "textStart": 1224, "textEnd": 1231}, {"amb": false, "date": "-02-13", "textStart": 1388, "textEnd": 1399, "freq": 5}], "sentiment": 0.2078431372549019, "wgt": 153, "relevance": 1}

(Scripps News)\n\nSouthwest Airlines plans to drop its tradition of more than 50 years and start assigning seats and selling premium seating for customers who want more legroom.\n\nThe airline said Thursday that it has been studying seating options and is making the changes because passenger preferences have shifted. The moves could also generate revenue and boost financial performance.\n\nSouthwest made the announcement on the same day that both it and American Airlines reported a steep drop in second-quarter profit despite higher revenue.\n\nAirlines are struggling with higher costs and reduced pricing power, especially on flights within the United States, as the industry adds flights faster than the growth in travel demand.\n\nSouthwest, based in Dallas, said its second-quarter profit fell 46% from a year earlier, to $367 million, as higher costs for labor, fuel and other expenses outstripped an increase in revenue. The results met Wall Street expectations.\n\nPeople are also reading...

But, the airline said, preferences have \"evolved\" -- as more travelers take longer flights, they want an assigned seat.\n\nThe airline is said it will offer redeye flights for the first time.\n\nSouthwest said that its first overnight, redeye flights will land on Feb. 14, 2025 in nonstop markets that include Las Vegas to Baltimore and Orlando; Los Angeles to Baltimore and Nashville; and Phoenix to Baltimore.

However, this policy is ending as the airline plans to introduce assigned seating. The change aims to boost revenue in response to worsening revenue challenges and mounting pressure from an activist investor demanding an overhaul of the airline's leadership and operating strategy.\n\nThe Wall Street Journal reports that Southwest's business model will undergo \"sweeping changes in a bid to broaden its appeal to passengers and boost revenue.\" These changes include ditching the free-for-all boarding policy for assigned seating with premium options and extra legroom.\n\n\"It isn't clear when flying with assigned seats and premium rows will start, but Southwest said bookings for them are expected to begin next year,\" WSJ wrote, adding, \"The exact timing of the changes depend on the airline gaining regulatory approval and retrofitting its planes.\"\n\nAdditional details about the policy shift will be provided to investors in late September. There's also a plan to operate red-eye flights, attracting overnight travelers starting next year.\n\nThe revenue challenges were highlighted in the company's second-quarter earnings report today, with a profit last quarter beating expectations. However, its forward guidance for revenue costs in the quarter was much worse than Wall Street's estimates.\n\n\"We are taking urgent and deliberate steps to mitigate near-term revenue challenges and implement longer-term transformational initiatives,\" CEO Bob Jordan said in a statement, quoted by Bloomberg, adding seat changes are a critical move to \"an ongoing and comprehensive upgrade\" to passenger accommodations.\n\nThe airline has faced several challenges, including fewer-than-expected aircraft deliveries from Boeing, a series of safety incidents that prompted a Federal Aviation Administration review this week, and slowing growth. As a result, its shares have fallen nearly 8% this year.\n\nLast month, Elliott Investment Management revealed a $1.9 billion stake in the carrier, calling for leadership to reverse years of underperformance and calling management \"stubborn unwillingness to evolve the company's strategy.\"\n\n\"Southwest's executive chairman and its CEO, who have spent a combined 74 years at the company, have presided over a period of severe underperformance, and they have demonstrated that they are not up to the task of modernizing Southwest,\" the activist said.\n\nSouthwest has said it will examine Elliott's proposed changes: \"The Southwest board of directors is confident in our CEO and management's ability to execute against the company's strategic plan.\"\n\nWhile Southwest was quick to act on reformatting its boarding policy, which could very well attract new customers, we doubt the airline will change the \"bags fly free\" policy - or face a boycott with customers.", "source": {"uri": "zerohedge.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Zero Hedge"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Wall_Street_Journal", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "The Wall Street Journal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Airline", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Airline"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Activist_shareholder", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Activist shareholder"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Southwest_Airlines", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Southwest Airlines"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Business_model", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Business model"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bob_Jordan_(businessman)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Bob Jordan (businessman)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wall_Street", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Wall Street"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chief_executive_officer", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Chief executive officer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elliott_Investment_Management", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Elliott Investment Management"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chairperson", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Chairperson"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bloomberg_L.P.", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Bloomberg L.P."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boycott", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Boycott"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Board_of_directors", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Board of directors"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boeing", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Boeing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Aviation_Administration", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Federal Aviation Administration"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Transportation", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Transportation", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Travel/Transportation", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Travel/Transportation", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Financial_Services/Leasing_Services", "label": "dmoz/Business/Financial Services/Leasing Services", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 89}], "image": "https://assets.zerohedge.com/s3fs-public/styles/16_9_max_700/public/2024-07/2024-07-25_08-00-48.png?itok=U7byYRMW", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9762572", "eventUri": "eng-9762572", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.02745098039215677, "wgt": 150, "relevance": 1}

Southwest said it continues to expect just 20 deliveries from Boeing this year -- less than half of what it had previously forecast.The airline is in the middle of an overhaul as pressure mounts from investors to do more to increase revenue.

They start a new service to Nashville, so they're really rocking and rolling,\" described Pascal Cohen.\n\nI met with Cohen, senior marketing manager for the airports at the Niagara Frontier Transportation Authority, to ask him about the Southwest switch.\n\n\"I think it's good news. I think a lot of people like to know where they're sitting and I think research has shown I mean, Southwest can tell you that directly to people want to know where they're sitting,\" Cohen responded.\n\n\"So, in the future, I'd probably pick a window, but for now doing the checkout and early to get the window seat,\" explained Tim Van Oss.\n\nVan Oss of Buffalo was heading to Nashville and always flies on Southwest because he prefers open seating.\n\n\"I don't really like the board in the group, so I just by the early check in so I don't have to deal with it,\" noted Van Oss.\n\nNo timeline yet for when this change begins, but Southwest expects to release more information in late September.", "source": {"uri": "wkbw.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "WKBW"}, "authors": [{"uri": "eileen_buckley@wkbw.com", "name": "Eileen Buckley", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Southwest_Airlines", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Southwest Airlines"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buffalo_Niagara_International_Airport", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Buffalo Niagara International Airport"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cheektowaga_(town),_New_York", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Cheektowaga (town), New York"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Holland,_New_York", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Holland, New York"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Holland, New York"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buffalo,_New_York", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Buffalo, New York"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Buffalo, New York"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Holland,_Michigan", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Holland, Michigan"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Holland, Michigan"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Carolina", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "South Carolina"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "South Carolina"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Niagara_Frontier_Transportation_Authority", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Niagara Frontier Transportation Authority"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Delta_Air_Lines", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Delta Air Lines"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JetBlue", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "JetBlue"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nashville,_Tennessee", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Nashville, Tennessee"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Nashville, Tennessee"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Airlines", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "American Airlines"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Las_Vegas", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Las Vegas"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Las Vegas"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phoenix,_Arizona", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Phoenix, Arizona"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Phoenix, Arizona"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oss", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Oss"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Oss"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Netherlands"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Business/Transportation_and_Logistics/Aviation", "label": "dmoz/Business/Transportation and Logistics/Aviation", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Travel/Transportation", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Travel/Transportation", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Advice", "label": "dmoz/Society/Advice", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Relationships", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Relationships", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 81}], "image": "https://ewscripps.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/017af05/2147483647/strip/true/crop/1280x672+0+24/resize/1200x630!/quality/90/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fewscripps-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F50%2Fad%2F124e06244d07934d4c4c965e8861%2Fwomentravel.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9762572", "eventUri": "eng-9762572", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1372549019607843, "wgt": 148, "relevance": 1}

They will sell you the qualifying points you need to earn elite benefits through December 31, 2025.\n\nSouthwest will sell you up to 35,000 qualifying points, which is the amount required for A-List status. And it's not cheap: up to $2,190.\n\nThis is unusual. Airlines frequently sell loyalty program members the qualifying points they need to make status at the end of the year, so that they can keep their status if they haven't flown enough. And the amounts aren't unusual. American Airlines earns tens of millions of dollars each year doing this.\n\nHowever it's early in the year - just past the halfway mark! - so this isn't taking the place of end of year mileage runs. It's straight up selling the status, seeking cash for the benefits. And it's going to mean more people clamoring for the earliest boarding positions.\n\nThere's a lot of discussion about Southwest Airlines moving to assigned seating as part of offering a new premium product, perhaps with extra legroom and blocked middle seats at the front of the cabin. I'm skeptical that they go entirely in this direction. Those premium seats may be blocked and assigned, but for everything else I think they keep traditional boarding order.\n\nThis offer is suggestive of why! They monetize Early Bird check-in, and they promote early boarding positions as the key benefit of what they are selling you today and that you'll receive through the end of next year. Sure, they could just take your money and not deliver the benefit, or refund your money.\n\nBut if they were to go with fully assigned seats, I don't see that happening before 2026.\n\nBoarding positions will be automatically reserved for you and the Passengers on your reservation 36 hours prior to the flight. You and Passengers on your reservation will still need to check in within 24 hours of scheduled departure to retrieve your boarding passes.\n\nI actually think Southwest's seating model is a core part of their value proposition and I wouldn't eliminate the cattle car boarding. On the one hand it does mean needing to line up half an hour prior to flight (I prefer to wait in a lounge, Southwest doesn't have those) but on the other hand it means that all the 'good seats' aren't pre-reserved by passengers booking weeks or months out. Last minute travelers still have a shot. That makes them attractive for a business traveler.\n\nAnd having status means you're much more likely to have that A boarding position (\"A-List\" status, get it?) and get a decent seat. Even if you change flights at the last minute you still get to board before the B group, along with families. That's not bad.\n\nI'm not sure it's worth the price. That depends how many Southwest trips you'll take. To me, the question is whether the price saves you enough in Business Select fares that come with the best boarding or in Early Bird check-in fees (they don't sell this on all flights). You'll have to decide for yourself.", "source": {"uri": "viewfromthewing.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "View from the Wing"}, "authors": [{"uri": "gary_leff@viewfromthewing.com", "name": "Gary Leff", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Southwest_Airlines", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Southwest Airlines"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Loyalty_program", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Loyalty program"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Airlines", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "American Airlines"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Airport_check-in", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Airport check-in"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indian_reservation", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Indian reservation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boarding_pass", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Boarding pass"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cattle", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Cattle"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Travel/Transportation", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Travel/Transportation", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Advice", "label": "dmoz/Society/Advice", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 76}], "image": "https://viewfromthewing.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/20221130_120719.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9762572", "eventUri": "eng-9762572", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-08-22", "textStart": 8, "textEnd": 17}], "sentiment": 0.09019607843137245, "wgt": 148, "relevance": 1}

Delta Air Lines reported a double-digit increase in revenue from its premium cabins in the second quarter, while sales in its main cabins remained flat.\n\nSouthwest, which lowered its second-quarter unit revenue forecast last month, is also facing pressure from activist investor Elliott Investment Management, which is pushing for a management and board overhaul.\n\nElliott took an about 11% stake in the carrier and has urged it to consider making commercial changes to its business model, including exploring revenue opportunities such as assigned seats, checked bag fees and premium products.\n\nHistorically, Southwest has shied away from these changes.\n\n\"We are taking urgent and deliberate steps to mitigate near-term revenue challenges...,\" Southwest CEO Bob Jordan said on Thursday.\n\nThe airline has also been hit hard by Boeing's jet delivery delays and is reeling from elevated operating expenses, including high aircraft maintenance costs, as it keeps older planes in the air.\n\nSouthwest said it was in discussions with Boeing about the negative financial impact it faces from the delayed deliveries.\n\nSouthwest reported total operating revenue of $7.35 billion in the quarter ended June 30, compared with Wall Street expectations of $7.32 billion.\n\n(Reporting by Shivansh Tiwary in Bengaluru; Editing by Pooja Desai)", "source": {"uri": "money.usnews.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "U.S. News & World Report"}, "authors": [{"uri": "reuters@money.usnews.com", "name": "Reuters", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Southwest_Airlines", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Southwest Airlines"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Airport_security", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Airport security"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_dollar", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States dollar"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reuters", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Reuters"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Delta_Air_Lines", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Delta Air Lines"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elliott_Investment_Management", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Elliott Investment Management"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aircraft_maintenance", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Aircraft maintenance"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jet_aircraft", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Jet aircraft"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wall_Street", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Wall Street"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boeing", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Boeing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chief_executive_officer", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Chief executive officer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Airline", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Airline"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bangalore", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Bangalore"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Bangalore"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jordan", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Jordan"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Jordan"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Business/Investing", "label": "dmoz/Business/Investing", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Business", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Business", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Transportation_and_Logistics/Aviation", "label": "dmoz/Business/Transportation and Logistics/Aviation", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Travel/Transportation", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Travel/Transportation", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Construction_and_Maintenance/Estimating", "label": "dmoz/Business/Construction and Maintenance/Estimating", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 82}], "image": "https://www.usnews.com/dims4/USNEWS/1ab8dd2/2147483647/thumbnail/970x647/quality/85/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.usnews.com%2Fcmsmedia%2F60%2F72a29d033605f36f820449d94b6bf9%2Ftag%3Areuters.com%2C2024%3Anewsml_LYNXMPEK6O0FF%3A12024-07-25T103543Z_1_LYNXMPEK6O0FF_RTROPTP_3_USA-FAA-AIR-TRAFFIC.JPG", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9762572", "eventUri": "eng-9762572", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-07-07", "textStart": 453, "textEnd": 459}, {"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-06-30", "textStart": 2209, "textEnd": 2216}], "sentiment": 0.411764705882353, "wgt": 146, "relevance": 1}

(Scripps News)\n\nSouthwest Airlines plans to drop its tradition of more than 50 years and start assigning seats and selling premium seating for customers who want more legroom.\n\nThe airline said Thursday that it has been studying seating options and is making the changes because passenger preferences have shifted. The moves could also generate revenue and boost financial performance.\n\nSouthwest made the announcement on the same day that both it and American Airlines reported a steep drop in second-quarter profit despite higher revenue.\n\nAirlines are struggling with higher costs and reduced pricing power, especially on flights within the United States, as the industry adds flights faster than the growth in travel demand.\n\nSouthwest, based in Dallas, said its second-quarter profit fell 46% from a year earlier, to $367 million, as higher costs for labor, fuel and other expenses outstripped an increase in revenue. The results met Wall Street expectations.\n\nPeople are also reading...

But, the airline said, preferences have \"evolved\" -- as more travelers take longer flights, they want an assigned seat.\n\nThe airline is said it will offer redeye flights for the first time.\n\nSouthwest said that its first overnight, redeye flights will land on Feb. 14, 2025 in nonstop markets that include Las Vegas to Baltimore and Orlando; Los Angeles to Baltimore and Nashville; and Phoenix to Baltimore. It plans to phase in additional redeye flights over time.\n\nAirfares are down, but baggage fees are up Low-cost airlines are reshaping how we pay for flights The rise of low-cost carriers How to navigate low-cost carrier fees\n\nCopyright 2024 The Associated Press.

It is also facing pricing pressure as an industry-wide overcapacity in the domestic market has dampened airfares.\n\nThe outlook for the September quarter is not upbeat, either. It expects third-quarter unit revenue to be flat to down 2% year-on-year, while non-fuel operating costs are estimated to be up 11%-13%.\n\nTD Cowen analyst Thomas Fitzgerald said Southwest's outlook implies losses in the current quarter and breakeven in the fourth quarter.\n\nSouthwest's shares were up about 1.5% at $27.03 in morning trade.\n\nWhile all U.S. carriers are facing pressure to discount fares due to an excess supply of seats in the domestic market, airlines like Delta and United Airlines are leaning on long-haul international flights and high-margin premium cabins to protect their profit.\n\nSouthwest currently doesn't offer these products.\n\nActivist investor Elliott Investment Management is pushing for leadership changes, saying the company needs fresh perspectives to compete in the modern airline industry. It has warned of a proxy fight.\n\nSouthwest said its research shows that 80% of its customers, and 86% of potential customers prefer an assigned seat.\n\nFeatured Local Savings\n\nIt also has plans to offer premium, extended legroom seats, which will account roughly one-third of seats across its fleet.\n\nThe company said the new cabin layout will require approvals from the U.S. Federal Aviation Administration and is expected to be available for bookings in 2025.\n\n\"We are taking urgent and deliberate steps to mitigate near-term revenue challenges,\" Southwest CEO Bob Jordan said on Thursday.\n\nU.S. carriers have been reporting strong demand for high-margin premium cabins. Alaska Airlines last week said it would add 1.3 million premium seats annually to its mainline fleet.\n\nSouthwest will also start overnight flights in February.\n\nThe company plans to share more details at its investor day in September.\n\nSouthwest said it was in discussions with Boeing about the negative financial impact it faces from delayed deliveries. It expects compensation in the form of price discounts.\n\nIts second-quarter adjusted profit came in at 58 cents per share, compared with analysts' average estimate of 51 cents per share, according to LSEG data.\n\n(Reporting by Rajesh Kumar Singh in Chicago and Shivansh Tiwary in Bengaluru; Editing by Pooja Desai and Nick Zieminski)\n\nCLICK HERE TO READ MORE FROM THE GAZETTE", "source": {"uri": "gazette.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Colorado Springs Gazette"}, "authors": [{"uri": "rajesh_kumar_singh@gazette.com", "name": "Rajesh Kumar Singh", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Southwest_Airlines", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Southwest Airlines"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boeing", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Boeing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Airplane", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Airplane"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elliott_Investment_Management", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Elliott Investment Management"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proxy_fight", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Proxy fight"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Delta_Air_Lines", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Delta Air Lines"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flight_length", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Flight length"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Airlines", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United Airlines"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Airline", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Airline"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alaska_Airlines", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Alaska Airlines"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wealth", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Wealth"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Aviation_Administration", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Federal Aviation Administration"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_dollar", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "United States dollar"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chief_executive_officer", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Chief executive officer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reuters", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Reuters"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chicago", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Chicago"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Chicago"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bangalore", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Bangalore"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Bangalore"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jordan", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Jordan"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Jordan"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Transportation", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Transportation", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Travel/Transportation", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Travel/Transportation", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Financial_Services/Leasing_Services", "label": "dmoz/Business/Financial Services/Leasing Services", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 74}], "image": "https://bloximages.newyork1.vip.townnews.com/gazette.com/content/tncms/assets/v3/editorial/b/bd/bbdd6aa8-6a3b-5af6-a291-75a8ce46ec76/66a28d276447f.image.jpg?crop=800%2C420%2C0%2C56&resize=438%2C230&order=crop%2Cresize", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9762572", "eventUri": "eng-9762572", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.01960784313725483, "wgt": 141, "relevance": 1}

The airline's robust cost management efforts, such as offering voluntary time off to employees, resulted in unit costs, excluding fuel, being better than expected. Additionally, Southwest plans to introduce assigned and premium seating, aligning with rising demand for premium travel options, evidenced by Delta Air Lines' double-digit increase in revenue from its premium cabins. This strategic pivot aims to capture new revenue streams, while the airline contends with activist investor Elliott Investment Management's push for management changes and new revenue opportunities.\n\nSouthwest Airlines' move towards assigned and premium seating marks a significant shift in its business model, aiming to tap into the higher revenue potential of premium travel amidst a summer travel surge. However, with domestic seat capacity surpassing demand, the competitive pressure on airfares could impact profitability. Investors should watch Southwest's ability to balance this new strategy with market dynamics and cost control, especially given the airline's discussions with Boeing over delayed jet deliveries and elevated operating expenses.\n\nThe bigger picture: Navigating revenue turbulence.\n\nSouthwest Airlines' latest results and strategic changes reflect broader trends in the aviation industry, where demand for premium seating is on the rise despite economic uncertainties. The airline's efforts to manage costs and innovate its service offerings could set a precedent for other low-cost carriers.

Economic growth showed a healthy uptick from the 1.4 percent rate seen the prior quarter.\n\nEarnings season, however, remains a concern for Wall Street. There was a huge earnings miss at Ford and profits at American Airlines slumped 46 percent.\n\nWatch More Videos:\n\nSticking with airlines...for the first time in its 50-year history, Southwest Airlines is ditching open seating.\n\nThe airline says \"The research is clear and indicates that 80% of Southwest Customers, and 86% of potential Customers, prefer an assigned seat. When a Customer elects to stop flying with Southwest and chooses a competitor, open seating is cited as the number one reason for the change.\"\n\nSouthwest is also shaking up the passenger experience in other ways. It is redesigning the inside of the plane to create premium seating with more legroom, which of course, means higher ticket prices. In addition, it will start flying \"red-eye\" overnight flights for the first time as well.\n\nThe changes come amid intense competition across the airline industry, with a glut of airline seats chasing increased demand. In its latest quarter, Southwest posted a 51 percent drop in profit.\n\nThat'll do it for your Daily Briefing.

These were, of course, done in an effort to prevent future terrorist attacks.\n\nA few years later, we began to see the rise of the low-cost carriers. Allegiant Air, JetBlue Airways, Breeze Airways, and Frontier, for example. While these airlines may not have had all of the complimentary amenities as the larger airlines, their ticket prices were significantly lower than many other airlines. Additionally, these airlines also frequently offered direct flights from smaller airports to in-demand destinations.

Economic growth showed a healthy uptick from the 1.4 percent rate seen the prior quarter.\n\nEarnings season, however, remains a concern for Wall Street.

When a Customer elects to stop flying with Southwest and chooses a competitor, open seating is cited as the number one reason for the change.\"\n\nSouthwest is also shaking up the passenger experience in other ways. It is redesigning the inside of the plane to create premium seating with more legroom, which of course, means higher ticket prices. In addition, it will start flying \"red-eye\" overnight flights for the first time as well.\n\nThe changes come amid intense competition across the airline industry, with a glut of airline seats chasing increased demand. In its latest quarter, Southwest posted a 51 percent drop in profit.\n\nThat'll do it for your Daily Briefing.

They're going to sell assigned seats. Somehow they think it makes sense to keep their current boarding process where passengers line up in advance - though of course nobody needs to do this anymore. There's no more incentive, since as long as they offer free bags (and therefore have plenty of overhead bin space) and your boarding order doesn't influence your seat choice you might as well board last.\n\nNonetheless, since they no longer even offer Early Bird Check-in on all flights, it'll be nice to have a seat pre-assigned. That will make the boarding process more civilized. And with one-third of seats extra legroom, there should be enough of those left to buy an aisle or group of seats together on most flights without doing so weeks in advance.\n\nThere's no surprise that this is just an extra legroom product and not a new first class cabin. They won't earn the same revenue premium as some of their peers. There are elements of the plan that'll increase revenue (paid seating) and some that will reduce revenue (no more need for paid Early Bird check-in, and less incentive to buy the highest Business Select fares).

(\"Elliott\"), today released the following statement from Partner John Pike and Portfolio Manager Bobby Xu regarding Southwest Airlines Co. (\"Southwest\" or the \"Company\") and its recent revenue enhancement initiatives:\n\nSouthwest's announcement of new revenue-enhancement initiatives, including assigned seating, premium-seating options, and redeye flights, is more than a decade overdue. This comes after a 50% decline in its share price over the past three years. The same leadership team responsible for this decline is now proposing these new measures, despite a history of failed attempts to improve performance, repeated operational missteps, and poor financial results.\n\nToday, Southwest finally acknowledged that the preferences of four out of five customers have gone unmet in recent years. These preferences have been well-known for some time, highlighting management's failure to address them.\n\nElliott has engaged in direct dialogue with Southwest's Board about the urgent changes needed at the Company. However, the recently announced initiatives by the current leadership appear to be mere attempts at self-preservation and lack credibility. \"Too little, too late\" is not a viable strategy.

Some residents were left amazed after 51-year-old Phats & Small singer turned political activist Ben Ofoedu turned up at their doors after joining the Conservatives on a campaign trail in Mid Buckinghamshire ahead of the General Election in July. Sporting a dashing navy blue suit jacket with a bright blue ribbon, a matching shirt, and a pair of casual jeans, the former vocalist appeared cheerful while handing out leaflets to the public alongside MP Greg Smith. It comes as the music star openly expressed his interest in politics and revealed in a recent interview that he hopes to run in the London Mayoral race after four years. He told The Sun: \"I have keenly followed politics for many years, including relationships with Boris Johnson and other politicians. I\u2019m now ready to start my political journey and training to eventually run for Mayor of London. He added: \"With Greg Smith\u2019s support, I\u2019m hoping this dream will become a reality. London needs fixing. It\u2019s my home and Sadiq Khan is a disaster.\" Ben was previously engaged to TV presenter Vanessa Feltz, with the couple having been together for 16 years before explosively parting ways over a year ago. However, the musician is now said to be in a relationship with his current girlfriend Precious Muir, who is 17 years his junior. Ben had previously took aim at his relationship with TV Vanessa, claiming that she had \"stolen the best years of my life\". He told Mail Online : \u201cI wasn't very clever with my last relationship. I didn't look at where the person was, and love was blinding me. I thought love conquers all but inevitably it doesn't. I gave myself to someone for a quarter of my life and ultimately I got nothing from it\u2026 it's absolutely heartbreaking.\" Adding: \"I met Vanessa when I was 34 and I lived 17 years in her life and it was all what she wanted. So now I'm with Precious I feel 34 again and like I have got back my life. I have the same aspirations I had at 34.\" VPreviously, Vanessa took to Instagram on 5 February 2023 to confirm she and Ben had parted ways, with the star sharing a video message for her fans. She said: \"Well I haven't been on Instagram for three weeks and that's because my relationship with Ben is over after 16 years. I honestly didn't know what to say on Instagram but now it's clear that it's over and I really do feel that once the trust in a relationship is gone, you can't really get it back. \"And so I just wanted to say that obviously I feel incredibly sad and I am pretty disappointed and shocked and all those horrible things but also full of resolve. I am not going to let this defeat me.\" Vanessa went on: \"I'm so glad to be living longer than my mum did. She died at 57 and, if the Lord spares me, I'm going to be 61 next month. So, I'm very, very grateful to be alive and I want to carry on feeling that way and I want to celebrate. I want to find fun and laughter anywhere I can and I know it's not going to be easy, but I'm absolutely determined to do it.\" Follow Mirror Celebs on TikTok, Snapchat , Instagram , Twitter , Facebook , YouTube and Threads.", "summary": "Former Phats &amp; Small singer Ben Ofoedu surprised fans by turning up on their doorsteps to campaign for the Conservatives", "url": "https://www.mirror.co.uk/3am/celebrity-news/vanessa-feltzs-ex-ben-ofoedu-32988960", "image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article32989208.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/1_Ghostbusters-Afterlife-Gala-Screening-At-The-Ham-Yard-Hotel-London.jpg", "video": null, "publish_date": "2024-06-08 15:24:29", "author": "Ayaan Ali,Ayaan-Ali", "authors": ["Ayaan Ali", "Ayaan-Ali"], "language": "en", "catgory": "politics", "source_country": "GB", "sentiment": -0.123}

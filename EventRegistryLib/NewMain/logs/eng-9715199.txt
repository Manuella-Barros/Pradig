They responded to the scene along with the fire department's dive team and Lebanon and Hartford fire departments. Fish and Game and the State Police Marine Patrol also assisted.\n\nUtilizing underwater cameras, the recovery team located Jang's body at 7:25 p.m. submerged about 65 feet from the riverbank, according to officials.\n\nAs of Monday, the cause of Jang's death remained officially undetermined and awaits findings from the state Medical Examiner's Office.\n\nHanover police said a preliminary investigation indicates no foul play is suspected.\n\nHowever, Hanover Police Chief Charlie Dennis said that police are investigating whether Jang's death may be linked to fraternity \"hazing,\" based on tips received by police.\n\n\"The autopsy will give us a lot more information about\" the manner and cause of death, Dennis told the Valley News on Monday.\n\nHe said that police received \"multiple\" emails that allege \"hazing or something like that may be involved.\"\n\n\"We're encouraging anyone with any information to reach out to us ... to help us soon as we work through this investigation,\" Dennis said.\n\nAccording to the college's website, \"Dartmouth's definition of hazing ... includes the following activities if they occur as part of initiation or admission into an organization, group or team, or are required for continued membership in an organization, group or team:\n\n\u25a0The consumption of alcohol, drugs, or other substances;\n\n\u25a0Removing, damaging or destroying property;\n\n\u25a0Behavior that disrupts College or community activities;\n\n\u25a0Violating any Standard of Conduct or College policy.\"\n\n\"We're looking whether this was an official event or not ... (he) was there with some of his brothers of his fraternity,\" Dennis said on Monday. \"But we're still unsure at this point if it was a sanctioned, official event or not.\"\n\nJang, a biomedical engineering major who had been class valedictorian at his high school in Delaware, was a member of the Beta Alpha Omega fraternity, according to a notice about Jang's death to the Dartmouth community from Dean of the College Scott Brown.\n\n\"Won wholeheartedly embraced opportunities at Dartmouth to pursue his academic and personal passions. He served as a project manager at the DALI Lab, was a research assistant at Thayer, and participated in the TuckLAB entrepreneurship program,\" Brown wrote. \"He supported his peers and found fast friendships as an international student mentor for the Office of Pluralism and Leadership ... (and) enthusiastically took part in the Dartmouth community.\"\n\nThe Valley News also received an anonymous email on Monday alleging what the sender described as the circumstances that preceded Jang's death.\n\nDennis said the email to the Valley News was similar in content to the reports received by police.\n\nA Dartmouth spokeswoman, when informed that police are investigating possible hazing related to the incident, did not address the allegation but said \"the entire Dartmouth community mourns the tragic loss this weekend of one of our students.\"\n\n\"We are supporting the student's family, friends and loved ones in every way possible, providing extensive grief counseling and working closely with local authorities to help their investigation into the circumstances,\" the spokeswoman said via email.\n\nAn email to the Beta Alpha Omega fraternity was not immediately returned on Monday afternoon.\n\nAlthough normally seen as bucolic and calm, there have been numerous instances over the years of both Dartmouth students and visitors to Hanover losing their lives in the Connecticut River.\n\nJang's death Saturday is the second death in as many months and the third in two years involving a Dartmouth student in the Connecticut River.\n\nIn May, the body of a 26-year-old female graduate student from China who was reported to be suffering from a mental health crisis was found in the river near Windsor after she was reported missing by friends. The manner and cause of the student's death has not been released, although police said they found no reason to suspect foul play.\n\nIn 2022, a 24-year-old Dartmouth graduate who was attending his pandemic-delayed college graduation ceremony died after his severely injured body was recovered from the rocky embankment under Ledyard Bridge.\n\nThe circumstances that led the alumnus to fall on the rocks was never explained other than described by a friend at the time as a \"freak accident.\"\n\nA 21-year-old AmeriCorps volunteer from Alaska doing work in New Hampshire drowned when he went for a swim in the river near Cornish in 2016.\n\nAnd in 2013, the brother of a Dartmouth student from Ghana drowned in the river when he jumped from a rope swing on the Norwich side. Alcohol was determined not to have been a factor in the victim's drowning and the cause was ascribed to an inability to swim.\n\nOther Connecticut River fatalities that have occurred over the years include a 20-year-old Dartmouth student who died in 1991 in an accidental drowning in which alcohol was ruled a contributing factor.", "source": {"uri": "vtdigger.org", "dataType": "news", "title":

investigate whether alcohol or hazing played a role in the death of a Dartmouth student over the weekend\n\n\"It is accurate to say the suspensions come following events this weekend, but I cannot say more right now about pending internal and police investigations,\" Jana Barnello, director of media relations and strategic communications, said in an email Wednesday.\n\n\"At the time of the incident, Beta Alpha Omega was on alcohol probation following a fall, winter and spring term suspension,\" Barnello wrote. \"Alpha Phi was placed on alcohol probation during the fall 2023 term, and then returned to good standing.\"\n\nThe deceased student, Won Jang, 20, of Middletown, Delaware, was member of Beta Alpha Omega, according to Dartmouth.\n\nJang was last seen about 9:30 p.m. Saturday

college that indicated alcohol may be involved or hazing may be involved,\" Hanover Police Chief Charlie Dennis said Monday.\n\n\"Certainly, we will look into that aspect, too,\" Dennis said.\n\nA person answering the phone at Alpha Phi declined to comment and referred a reporter to the national chapter, which didn't immediately respond.\n\nBeta Alpha Omega representatives couldn't be reached immediately.\n\nSearchers using an underwater camera found Jang's body at around 7:25 p.m. Sunday in the Connecticut River, not far from the dock, authorities said.\n\nJang couldn't swim and his body was located about 65 feet from shore in water that was around 20 feet deep, Dennis said.\n\nDartmouth personnel \"are working closely with the Hanover Police Department, which is leading the investigation,\" Barnello said.\n\n\"The entire Dartmouth community is grieving over the tragic loss of Won Jang,\" she said. \"Our counseling team has been by the family's side since Monday, and Dartmouth is providing every possible support it can to Won's parents, family and friends.\"", "source": {"uri": "unionleader.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "UnionLeader.com"}, "authors": [{"uri":

The Ivy League school has suspended the 20-year-old's Greek organization, as well as a sorority.\n\nWon Jang, a member of Beta Alpha Omega, had last been seen by friends around 9:30 p.m., Saturday, at an informal social gathering at docks near the Dartmouth boathouse on the Connecticut River, the New Hampshire Fish and Game Department said in a news release.\n\nWhen he didn't show up for an event the next day, authorities were notified, the agency said. Items found near the dock indicated Jang hadn't left the river area, which authorities searched while divers checked the water.\n\nAbout 3 1/2 hours after Jang was reported missing, his body was found in the Connecticut River by an underwater camera not far from the dock where he last was seen, the department said.\n\nWhile a cause of death remains unclear, the school forwarded to the nearby Hanover Police Department anonymous emails indicating hazing or alcohol may have contributed to Jang's death, Hanover Police Chief Charlie Dennis said during a Monday news conference.\n\n\"Certainly this is a tragic event,\" he said, asking anyone with information to come forward to help with the investigation. Hanover Police did not immediately reply to CNN's request for more information about the case.\n\nJang had been a member of Dartmouth's chapter of Beta Alpha Omega, according to the college and his profile on the fraternity's website, which has been taken down. As Hanover police investigate his death, Dartmouth suspended the Beta Alpha Omega fraternity, along with the Alpha Phi sorority, college spokesperson Morgan Kelly told CNN on Wednesday. Kelly would not say what role the fraternity or sorority played relative to the investigation into Jang's death.\n\n\"We aren't able to provide details on an ongoing investigation, but we can say that at the time of the incident, Beta Alpha Omega was on alcohol probation following a fall-, winter- and spring-term suspension. Alpha Phi was placed on alcohol probation during the fall 2023 term and then returned to good standing,\" Kelly added.\n\nBeta Alpha Omega's local chapter and Alpha Phi's national organization did not immediately respond to CNN's requests for comment.\n\nJang's death and the police probe follow a spate of hazing deaths in recent years on or near US college campuses that have led variously to suspensions, expulsions, criminal charges and scrutiny of university oversight of fraternities and sororities.\n\nSeventy-three percent of students in US fraternities and sororities experienced what they called some form of hazing at least once, according to a University of Maine study released in 2008, the most recent available for such research.\n\nJang's death comes nearly two months after another Dartmouth student's body was found in the Connecticut River after she was reported missing, CNN affiliate WMUR reported. Their deaths do not appear to be connected.\n\nJang had been studying biomedical engineering and economics at Dartmouth and worked part-time at the school's DALI Lab, a startup-like experiential learning program where students work in teams of designers and developers, according to his LinkedIn profile.\n\n\"Won wholeheartedly embraced opportunities at Dartmouth to pursue his academic and personal passions,\" Dean Scott C. Brown wrote on a site memorializing school community members who have died.\n\n\"We are in contact with Won's family and have expressed our sincere condolences at this most difficult time,\" he continued.\n\nKledian Marinaj, a friend of Jang who recently had been trying to make plans to grab a meal with him, was upset by his death, he told CNN affiliate WMUR.\n\n\"Won was always an amazing guy,\" Marinaj said. \"I don't think there was ever a time when I didn't see him with a smile on his face.\"\n\nJang had been his high school valedictorian in Middletown, Delaware, according to his LinkedIn profile and YouTube recording of the graduation ceremony. During an introduction to his speech at commencement, he was praised by an administrator for his wit, humility and motivation.\n\nCNN's Amanda Musa contributed to this report.\n\nThe-CNN-Wire\n\n\u2122 & \u00a9 2024 Cable News Network, Inc., a Warner Bros.

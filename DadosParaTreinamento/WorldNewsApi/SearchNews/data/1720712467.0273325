This year's competition has been a thriller and it is both Limerick and Clare who again meet in the final, their third year in a row. Despite Limerick's dominance, the games between the two sides have been close with last year's final decided by a single point while this year's round robin game ended up as a come-from-behind three-point victory for Limerick. And the All-Ireland champions seem to be motoring yet again as they finished top of the group standings and are looking in fine form as they look to make history and win five in a row. Today's game takes place at Semple Stadium in Thurles with throw-in set for 4pm. Check out our live updates below, courtesy of the Irish Mirror.

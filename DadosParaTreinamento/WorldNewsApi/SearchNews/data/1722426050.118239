{"id": 243269740, "title": "International Day Of The Tropics", "text": "June 29th is International Day of the Tropics. It is a day set aside to celebrate tropical nations and its citizens. It is also a day to raise awareness about the various chal-lenges facing the tropical nations. On this day we are celebrating the natural resources and extraordi-nary diversity of the Tropics. To start with, who are the Tropics? Why are they called Tropics? Which areas of the earth are referred to as the tropical zones? What is special about the Tropics? What are the challeng-es facing the Tropics? Above all, what are the economic benefits of the Tropical zones? According to the United Na-tions, \u201cThe Tropics are a region of the Earth, roughly defined as the area between the tropic of Cancer and the tropic of Capri-corn. Tropical locations are typ-ically warm. They experience little seasonal change in day-to-day temperature. An important feature of the Tropics is the prev-alence of rain in the moist inner regions near the equator.\u201d Hence, the tropics are regions of Earth that lie roughly in the middle of the globe. They account for 36 percent of the Earth\u2019s land-mass. This region is warm all year round. The temperature in the Tropics ranges from 77 to 82 degrees F. The Tropics get a lot of sun and only have two seasons: the wet season and dry season. The tropics include the Equator and parts of North America, South America, Africa, Asia, and Australia. There are many fruits that grow in warm tropical climates or equatorial areas. Tropical fruit includes mango, orange, papaya, pineapple, and sapodilla, Dragon fruit, Passion fruit, Rambutan, Acai, Guava, Lychee, mango-steen, jackfruit, Coconut, Coffee, etc. Tropical fruits are fruits that are grown in hot and humid re-gions known as the Tropic Can-cer and Tropic Capricorn. They are found in most of the tropical and subtropical areas of Asia, Africa, Central America, South America, the Caribbean, and Oce-ania. Some of the Tropical Foods includes Rice Salad, Potato Salad, Coconut Rice, Grilled Chicken, Fried Rice, Bean Salad, Corn Sal-ad, pounded Yam, Cassava meal, Corn meal, Strawberry salad, Poke\u2014Hawaii, Manapua\u2014Ha-waii, Haupia\u2014Hawaii, Posole\u2014 Mexico, Tacos de Papa\u2014Mexico, Tres Leche Cake and Arroz con Leche\u2014Costa Rica, etc. The Tropical nations enjoys the following benefits: greatest diversity of plants and animals, The greatest diversity of cultures, Tropics are growing richer quick-ly, Tropical zones are growing trade and investment, Climate change will have huge impacts in the Tropics, The tropics drive the global climate, Solar energy strive, it\u2019s where most of the peo-ple will be, it\u2019s where most of the children are. The tropical regions are fac-ing a lot of challenges such as urbanisation, climate change, deforestation, logging and demo-graphic changes. Commenting On the challenges facing Trop-ics, the United Nations declares, \u201cTropical nations have made significant progress but face a variety of challenges that de-mand focused attention across a range of development indicators and data in order to achieve sus-tainable development. By 2050, the region will host most of the world\u2019s people and two-thirds of its children. Consistent with the higher levels of poverty, more people experience undernourish-ment in the Tropics than in the rest of the world. The proportion of the urban population living in slum conditions is higher in the Tropics than in the rest of the World.\u201d Imagine! As we celebrate International Day of the Tropics, we should take into cognisance some of the challenges facing tropical nations, especially the issue of poverty and underdevelopment. To erad-icate poverty, all hands must be on deck. And so, happy International Day of the Tropics!", "summary": "<div style=\"margin-bottom:20px;\"><img width=\"1808\" height=\"1080\" src=\"https://independent.ng/wp-content/uploads/rev.-fr.-damian-adizie-15.png\" class=\"attachment-post-thumbnail size-post-thumbnail wp-post-image\" alt=\"\" decoding=\"async\" fetchpriority=\"high\" srcset=\"https://independent.ng/wp-content/uploads/rev.-fr.-damian-adizie-15.png 1808w, https://independent.ng/wp-content/uploads/rev.-fr.-damian-adizie-15-300x179.png 300w, https://independent.ng/wp-content/uploads/rev.-fr.-damian-adizie-15-1024x612.png 1024w, https://independent.ng/wp-content/uploads/rev.-fr.-damian-adizie-15-768x459.png 768w, https://independent.ng/wp-content/uploads/rev.-fr.-damian-adizie-15-1536x918.png 1536w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1808px) 100vw, 1808px\" /></div>June 29th is International Day of the Tropics.

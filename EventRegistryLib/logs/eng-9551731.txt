Now, as a father of three, the actor says his kids are one of his biggest considerations when choosing new roles.\n\nThe Mother of the Bride star sat down with Num\u00e9ro Netherlands ahead of the release of the Netflix movie and discussed his decades-long career, future projects and how he always puts his family first.\n\nMore from The Hollywood Reporter\n\n\"I would say, a lot of material, especially over the past five to eight years since my son was born, I choose because I think one of the last things you really want is for your kids to be berated in school for what their parents are doing,\" Murray told the publication. \"I don't want my kids going to school, being freshmen in high school, and Dad's butt posted all over their locker. That's not fair to them, so making decisions for that has been great.\"\n\nThe Gilmore Girls actor explained that he works with his wife, Sarah Roemer, to keep everything grounded and peaceful for their family. And while he loves his job, he stressed that it's just a job and the most important thing to him is to be around for his kids.\n\n\"I'm making sure that I'm there every day, that we travel together as a pack, so we don't break up the pack when we travel,\" he said. \"When we are in Nova Scotia filming Sullivan's Crossing, we're all there. I get to work, and I get to go home and play with the babies. Now, is this extra work for me to throw on top, so I can't be solely focused on Sullivan's Crossing? Yeah, but that just means I need to better place my time and figure out how do I manage this all?\"\n\nThe Riverdale actor shared that he goes to work and then goes home to spend time playing with his kids, before focusing on more work once he's put them to bed. When he has weekend trips for autograph signing, they all go together.\n\n\"It's important that they're here, because I don't believe in breaking up the pack to the point where they're like 'Oh, dad's on another trip,'\" he noted. \"And for me, I wouldn't trade this for anything, no matter the amount of success, it doesn't matter. It trumps all of that.\"\n\nElsewhere in the profile, Murray opened up about future projects he has on the horizon. There are two, however, that he did not address but would be particularly excited to revisit.\n\nIn a conversation with Entertainment Tonight at the Mother of the Bride premiere on Thursday, the House of Wax actor noted he'd love to get A Cinderella Story sequel going and be a part of the upcoming Freaky Friday 2.\n\nWhile there has been no talk of returning to San Fernando Valley for the Hilary Duff-starring rom-com, Murray shared that his daughter saw the film recently and encouraged him to make another one. He said that he would gladly reprise his role as Austin Ames if there ever were to be A Cinderella Story sequel.\n\n\"Here you go, Hil. From me to you, let's do it,\" Murray told the publication, calling to the actress who played Sam. He even has a possible idea for the script, adding, \"I think, as we know, things don't always work out so I think they went their separate ways, and we bring them back now, post splits from their significant others, into a new Cinderella story.\"\n\nThere may not be plans for a second Cinderella Story, but there is another Freaky Friday in the works with Lindsay Lohan and Jamie Lee Curtis reprising their roles. While there have been no announcements that any other castmembers will be returning for the sequel, Murray would love to play Jake again.\n\n\"How great would that be? To bring Jake back? It's one of those things where [it was] such a big part of my life,\" he said, noting one of the reasons why he wanted to be a part of Mother of the Bride was to reunite with Freaky Friday director Mark Waters. \"When Mark called, and I got to talk to Mark, and I said, 'Mark, we're gonna get the band back together. Let's go.'\"\n\nMother of the Bride sees Murray portray Lucas opposite Brooke Shields' Lana and Benjamin Bratt's Will, two exes thrown together years after a devastating breakup when their kids from other relationships share they're getting married.", "source": {"uri": "yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo"}, "authors": [{"uri": "christy_pina@yahoo.com", "name": "Christy Pi\u00f1a", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chad_Michael_Murray", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Chad Michael Murray"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A_Cinderella_Story_(film_series)", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "A Cinderella Story (film series)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sullivan's_Crossing_(TV_series)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Sullivan's Crossing (TV series)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Freaky_Friday", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Freaky Friday"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/One_Tree_Hill_(TV_series)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "One Tree Hill (TV series)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gilmore_Girls", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Gilmore Girls"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Hollywood_Reporter", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "The Hollywood Reporter"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Netflix", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Netflix"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Netherlands", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Netherlands"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Netherlands"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Riverdale_(American_TV_series)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Riverdale (American TV series)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sarah_Roemer", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Sarah Roemer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sequel", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Sequel"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nova_Scotia", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Nova Scotia"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Nova Scotia"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Canada"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Romantic_comedy", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Romantic comedy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Benjamin_Bratt", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Benjamin Bratt"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cinderella_(sports)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Cinderella (sports)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jamie_Lee_Curtis", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Jamie Lee Curtis"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/San_Fernando_Valley", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "San Fernando Valley"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brooke_Shields", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Brooke Shields"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cinderella", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Cinderella"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Entertainment_Tonight", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Entertainment Tonight"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lindsay_Lohan", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Lindsay Lohan"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Austin,_Texas", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Austin, Texas"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Austin, Texas"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Home/Family", "label": "dmoz/Home/Family", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Online_Writing/Fiction", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Online Writing/Fiction", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Performing_Arts/Acting", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Performing Arts/Acting", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "dmoz/Home/Family/Parenting", "label": "dmoz/Home/Family/Parenting", "wgt": 17}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Work/Work_and_Family", "label": "dmoz/Society/Work/Work and Family", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/O1ccfVXsORyoO31Aptdjmg--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyMDA7aD02NzY-/https://media.zenfs.com/en/the_hollywood_reporter_217/8a259384019e66adbcd0077248dbc0ec", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9551731", "eventUri": "eng-9551731", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.02745098039215677, "wgt": 171, "relevance": 1}

All about Sarah Roemer", "body": "An actor herself, Roemer has an impressive resume under her belt, but she remains largely a mystery to many of Murray's fans -- who, by the way, will be delighted to know he's co-starring in a new Netflix romantic comedy, \"Mother of the Bride,\" which hits the streamer this weekend.\n\nRead on to learn more about the woman who captured the heart of the enduring heartthrob, from the first time she met her future husband to becoming a mom of three.\n\nBorn on Aug. 28, 1984, Roemer hails from San Diego, California.\n\nHer birthdate makes her a Virgo, the same star sign as Murray, though he is three years older than Roemer.\n\nThe 39-year-old kicked off her professional career as a model -- and like so many origin modeling stories, it was a job that picked her, instead of the other way around.\n\n\"When I was 15, before school in the morning, I was at a 7-Eleven drinking coffee and the owner of my modelling agency came up to me,\" she recalled in a 2007 interview with The Courier Mail. \"And that's how that happened.\"\n\nIn 2006, she made the move from modeling to acting, with a role in \"Wristcutters: A Love Story.\" The jump to the screen began with a strikingly similar random meeting.\n\n\"I was at a coffee shop and my manager came up to me and that's how I started acting,\" she explained to the same publication.\n\nSince then, Roemer has starred in a number of big- and small-screen releases, including \"Disturbia\" (2007), \"Falling Up\" (2009), \"Hawaii Five-0\" (2011) and \"Survive the Game\" (2021).\n\nIn 2013, the two met on the set of \"Chosen,\" the Crackle original action series in which they both had roles.\n\nThe show ran for two seasons, which was apparently plenty of time for Roemer and Murray to fall for each other.\n\nWhile dating, Roemer and Murray kept their private life just that.\n\nIn fact, the public didn't even learn of the actors' September 2014 nuptials until months after their wedding, with Murray sharing the happy secret with E! News in January 2015.\n\nTheir \"I do's\" marked the second marriage for Murray and first for Roemer.\n\nTying the knot wasn't the only surprise that popped that day. According to another E! News report, a source confirmed that the newlyweds were also expecting their first child together.\n\nThey welcomed a son into the world later that year. In 2017, the couple expanded their family with their first daughter, and in 2023, they added another little girl to their brood.\n\nThe couple has not revealed the names of their children.\n\nIn a Mother's Day tribute Murray shared to Instagram in 2022, he raved about his partner's greatest role yet: Mom.\n\n\"Wifo- The world has been lighter & brighter since the day you entered it,\" he wrote. \"You've extended that light through our little pack. For me, growing up with single father most of my life, I never truly knew the importance of a mother until I had the honor of watching you carry this family on your back from that moment our son was born:) Your heart lights our world.

Of course, the One Tree Hill alum thinks about normal things like hours and salary and (re)location, but he's also expanded his list since becoming a dad.\n\nMurray shares three kids whose names have not been shared -- an 8-year-old son, a 6-year-old daughter, and a 9-month-old daughter -- with wife Sarah Roemer, and he told Num\u00e9ro that \"the last thing\" a parent wants is for their kids to be \"berated\" at school for their parents' actions. And so roles that require nudity are now a no-go.\n\n\"I don't want my kids going to school, being freshmen in high school, and Dad's butt posted all over their locker. That's not fair to them, so making decisions for that has been great.\"\n\nWelp, I guess that's fair. At that rate, Murray probably won't be stripping down for nearly two decades, when his littlest kiddo is out of high school and clear of lockers.\n\nUnfortunately, the A Cinderella Story star has good reason to be concerned. Supermodel Christy Turlington spoke last month about her reaction when her son's peers shared her naked photo. At one of her 18-year-old's high school basketball games, the opposing team passed around the picture as an infuriating (and messed-up!) heckling tactic.\n\n\"I was surprised it hadn't happened sooner,\" she told Harper's Bazaar. \"But at the same time, I was like, 'This is so rude!' ... All I wanted to do was disappear.\"\n\nMurray is simply trying to avoid one of those moments.\n\nThe self-proclaimed \"family guy\" went on to tell Num\u00e9ro that his family often travels with him when he has to film on location -- or even if he just goes on a weekend-long autograph signing. \"It's important that they're here because I don't believe in breaking up the pack to the point where they're like, 'Oh, dad's on another trip.'

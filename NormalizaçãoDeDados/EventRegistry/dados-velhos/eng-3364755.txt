photos during closing arguments to a jury being asked to decide if four men should go to prison for decades for displaying assault-style weapons to stop federal agents from rounding up anti-government figure Cliven Bundy's cattle in April 2014.\n\nAssistant U.S. Attorney Nadia Ahmed said Tuesday that Scott Drexler, Ricky Lovelien, Eric Parker and Steven Stewart had firearms, not flags or signs, at the confrontation near the rural Nevada town of Bunkerville.\n\nAttorneys for the four men will summarize their defenses before the jury in Las Vegas begins deliberating on 10 conspiracy, weapon,

trial next year.\n\nTrial is nearing an end in Las Vegas for four men accused of wielding assault-style weapons during a protest to stop federal agents from rounding up cattle belonging to rancher and anti-government figure Cliven Bundy in April 2014.\n\nAfter four weeks of testimony, closing arguments are scheduled Tuesday in U.S. District Court for the retrial of Scott Drexler, Ricky Lovelien, Eric Parker and Steven Stewart.\n\nA jury in April found two other co-defendants guilty of some charges, but failed to reach verdicts for the four.\n\nEach faces 11 conspiracy, weapon, assault on a

They resume deliberations on Wednesday. Each defendant could face decades in prison if convicted.\n\nMyhre and attorneys for Drexler, Parker and Stewart, all of Idaho, each declined outside court to comment.\n\nAttorney Shawn Perez, representing Ricky Lovelien of Montana and Oklahoma, said he didn't think the government proved its case, so he felt no closing argument was needed.\n\nDefense teams balking at summarizing their cases echoed the refusal in April 2016 of two of Bundy's adult sons and three other defendants to enter pleas following their arrests in the case. They said they didn't recognize authority of the government to prosecute them. A magistrate judge entered not-guilty pleas for them.\n\nA first trial for the four current defendants ended with a hung jury in April. That jury found two other defendants guilty of some charges.\n\nThe jury on Tuesday heard a three-hour recitation by prosecutor Nadia Ahmed of the charges, retrial evidence and instructions from the judge.\n\nAhmed relied heavily on photos and videos showing each defendant carrying an assault-style weapon during the protest to stop a roundup of Bundy family cattle from public rangeland in a vast Gold Butte area that has since been made a national monument.\n\nOne photo showed the four men standing in a row atop a freeway overpass next to a sign declaring the West had been won.\n\nParker and Drexler were each photographed earlier, prone on the pavement of the Interstate 15 overpass, sighting their rifles through seams in a concrete roadside barrier toward the federal agents in a dry riverbed below.\n\n\"They did it. They helped each other do it.

In a prior trial, a jury failed to reach verdicts for the four.\n\nIn the first trial, defense attorneys argued their clients were exercising constitutionally protected speech and gun rights. They also argued that the defendants feared for their safety and the safety of protesters when they brought weapons.\n\nIn an order before the start of the July retrial, Navarro ruled that defense attorneys would not be able to present evidence that their clients acted in self-defense or in the defense of others against law enforcement officers carrying out two court orders.\n\n(Reporting by John L.

They resume deliberations on Wednesday. Each defendant could face decades in prison if convicted.\n\nMyhre and attorneys for Drexler, Parker and Stewart, all of Idaho, each declined outside court to comment.\n\nAttorney Shawn Perez, representing Ricky Lovelien of Montana and Oklahoma, said he didn't think the government proved its case, so he felt no closing argument was needed.\n\nDefense teams balking at summarizing their cases echoed the refusal in April 2016 of two of Bundy's adult sons and three other defendants to enter pleas following their arrests in the case. They said they didn't recognize authority of the government to prosecute them. A magistrate judge entered not-guilty pleas for them.\n\nA first trial for the four current defendants ended with a hung jury in April. That jury found two other defendants guilty of some charges.\n\nThe jury on Tuesday heard a three-hour recitation by prosecutor Nadia Ahmed of the charges, retrial evidence and instructions from the judge.\n\nAhmed relied heavily on photos and videos showing each defendant carrying an assault-style weapon during the protest to stop a roundup of Bundy family cattle from public rangeland in a vast Gold Butte area that has since been made a national monument.\n\nOne photo showed the four men standing in a row atop a freeway overpass next to a sign declaring the West had been won.\n\nParker and Drexler were each photographed earlier, prone on the pavement of the Interstate 15 overpass, sighting their rifles through seams in a concrete roadside barrier toward the federal agents in a dry riverbed below.\n\n\"They did it. They helped each other do it. They agreed with each other to do it,\" Ahmed said, accusing the defendants of conspiring with Cliven Bundy, his sons and other alleged organizers to thwart agents' efforts to carry out lawful federal court orders.\n\nProving conspiracy is crucial for prosecutors ahead of a next trial, expected later this year, for the Bundy family patriarch, his two eldest sons and two other defendants.

In a prior trial, a jury failed to reach verdicts for the four.\n\nIn the first trial, defense attorneys argued their clients were exercising constitutionally protected speech and gun rights. They also argued that the defendants feared for their safety and the safety of protesters when they brought weapons.\n\nIn an order before the start of the July retrial, Navarro ruled that defense attorneys would not be able to present evidence that their clients acted in self-defense or in the defense of others against law enforcement officers carrying out two court orders.", "date": "2017-08-16", "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Law/Services", "wgt": 100, "id": 319, "label": "dmoz/Society/Law/Services"}], "concepts": [{"location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "type": "loc", "id": "233"}, {"location": {"country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}, "type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Bunkerville"}}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bunkerville,_Nevada", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Bunkerville"}, "type": "loc", "id": "230975"}, {"location": {"country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}, "type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Las Vegas"}}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Las_Vegas", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Las Vegas"}, "type": "loc", "id": "231028"}, {"location": {"country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}, "type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Nevada"}}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nevada", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Nevada"}, "type": "loc", "id": "231057"}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Law", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "302557", "label": {"eng": "Law"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reuters", "type": "org", "score": 1, "id": "302588", "label": {"eng": "Reuters"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prosecutor", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "303289", "label": {"eng": "Prosecutor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Defendant", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "id": "303294", "label": {"eng": "Defendant"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_government_of_the_United_States", "type": "org", "score": 5, "id": "303299", "label": {"eng": "Federal government of the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Court", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "id": "303560", "label": {"eng": "Court"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lawyer", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "304357", "label": {"eng": "Lawyer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weapon", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "304755", "label": {"eng": "Weapon"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_district_court", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "305154", "label": {"eng": "United States district court"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extortion", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "305499", "label": {"eng": "Extortion"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Attorney", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "id": "305504", "label": {"eng": "United States Attorney"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trial", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "id": "305859", "label": {"eng": "Trial"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Firearm", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "305964", "label": {"eng": "Firearm"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First_Amendment_to_the_United_States_Constitution", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "id": "306001", "label": {"eng": "First Amendment to the United States Constitution"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cattle", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "id": "306149", "label": {"eng": "Cattle"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Militia", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "id": "310583", "label": {"eng": "Militia"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Right-wing_politics", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "id": "311241", "label": {"eng": "Right-wing politics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jury", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "id": "311403", "label": {"eng": "Jury"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Livestock", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "id": "313147", "label": {"eng": "Livestock"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Right_to_keep_and_bear_arms", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "id": "314624", "label": {"eng": "Right to keep and bear arms"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grazing", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "id": "318902", "label": {"eng": "Grazing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_judiciary_of_the_United_States", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "id": "320313", "label": {"eng": "Federal judiciary of the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bureau_of_Land_Management", "type": "org", "score": 2, "id": "327768", "label": {"eng": "Bureau of Land Management"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Park_Service", "type": "org", "score": 2, "id": "330699", "label": {"eng": "National Park Service"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eric_Parker_(American_football)", "type": "person", "score": 3, "id": "883834", "label": {"eng": "Eric Parker (American football)"}}]}

Scott Drexler, all of Idaho, and Richard Lovelien of Oklahoma are accused of conspiracy, extortion, assault and obstruction for helping rancher Cliven Bundy fend off a government roundup of his cattle in what became known as the Battle of Bunkerville.\n\nThe Bundy Ranch standoff is one of the most high-profile land-use cases in modern Western history, pitting cattle ranchers, anti-government protesters and militia members against the Bureau of Land Management.\n\nFor decades, the BLM repeatedly ordered Bundy to remove his cattle from federal lands and in 2014 obtained a court order to seize his cattle as payment for more than $1 million in unpaid grazing fees.\n\nHundreds of supporters from every state in the union, including members of several militia groups, converged on his ranch about 70 miles north of Las Vegas.\n\nNavarro's rulings, aimed at trying to avoid jury nullification, have severely limited defense arguments.\n\nNavarro has barred defendants from discussing why they traveled thousands of miles to join protesters at the Bundy Ranch. She will not allow them to testify about perceived abuses by federal authorities during the cattle roundup that might have motivated them to participate.\n\nNavarro also has restricted defendants from raising constitutional arguments, or mounting any defense based on their First Amendment rights to free speech and their Second Amendment rights to bear arms. In her rulings, Navarro has said those are not applicable arguments in the case.\n\nFederal officials, however, do not face the same restrictions. To show defendants were part of a conspiracy, they have referenced events that happened months, or years, after the standoff.\n\nDefense lawyers called for a mistrial Monday and accused prosecutors of wrongly depriving Parker of his right to testify in a way that irreparably damaged the case.\n\nProsecutors shot back with a motion calling for sanctions against three of the defendants and their lawyers, accusing them of repeatedly violating court orders by introducing prohibited information and attempting to derail the trial through jury nullification.\n\nNavarro rejected the mistrial and refused to impose sanctions. She did, however, agree to instruct jurors to treat Parker's testimony as if it never happened.\n\nThat meant jurors only heard from a single defendant.\n\nFour defense witnesses were permitted to testify via Skype last week, but the jury was not allowed to hear what they said.\n\nNavarro ruled the witnesses, who were at the standoff, failed to establish grounds for self-defense claims sought by defendants.\n\nOn Monday, Drexler took the stand and delivered the only defense testimony jurors were allowed to hear.\n\nDrexler testified even though he brought weapons to the standoff, he had no intention of threatening or assaulting law-enforcement officers.\n\n\"My intent was to disappear and not be a threat to any person in the wash,\" he said.\n\nDrexler admitted bringing an AR-15, a .45 handgun and 250 rounds of ammunition to Bunkerville. On cross-examination, prosecutors sought to show he intended to intimidate authorities and force them to \"act more civil.\"\n\nA jury in April deadlocked on charges against the four men. It convicted two other defendants on multiple counts. But the jury could not agree on conspiracy charges -- a key component of the government's case -- against any of the six.\n\nThree trials are scheduled for 17 defendants who are being prosecuted based on their levels of culpability in the standoff. Although defendants in the first trial are considered the least culpable, all face the same charges and could spend the rest of their lives in prison.\n\nThe second trial will include Cliven Bundy and his sons, Ammon and Ryan Bundy, who are considered ringleaders.\n\nREAD MORE:\n\nAs jury weighs Bundy Ranch standoff, Carol Bundy awaits her husband's fate\n\nWhat made Ammon Bundy go from AZ

Smith\n\nLAS VEGAS (Reuters) - Jurors at a federal court in Nevada began deliberations on Tuesday in the retrial of four men accused of numerous charges for acting as gunmen in the 2014 standoff led by renegade rancher Cliven Bundy against federal authorities.\n\nU.S. prosecutors said the four defendants - Scott Drexler, Ricky Lovelien, Eric Parker and Steven Stewart - committed crimes including conspiracy, assault on a federal officer, extortion and weapons law violations when they traveled to Nevada with firearms to participate in a plan to halt the cattle roundup.\n\nDefense attorneys for the four, angered by U.S. District Judge Gloria Navarro's pretrial ruling limiting evidence in the case, offered no closing arguments.\n\nA jury decision was not likely on Tuesday.\n\nThe uprising at Bundy's ranch near Bunkerville, Nevada, 75 miles (120 km) northeast of Las Vegas, grew out of a dispute in which federal agents seized Bundy's cattle over his refusal to pay fees required for grazing his livestock on government land.\n\nThe standoff became a flashpoint in long-simmering tensions over federal ownership of vast tracts of public lands in the West and a rallying point for right-wing militants who challenge the U.S. government's authority in the region.\n\nAssistant U.S. Attorney Nadia Ahmed said in closing arguments that the defendants acted in concert with other militia members to threaten and intimidate U.S. Bureau of Land Management and National Park Service officers.\n\nIf convicted, the defendants face a minimum of 57 years in prison. In a prior trial, a jury failed to reach verdicts for the four.\n\nIn the first trial, defense attorneys argued their clients were exercising constitutionally protected speech and gun rights. They also argued that the defendants feared for their safety and the safety of protesters when they brought weapons.\n\nIn an order before the start of the July retrial, Navarro ruled that defense attorneys would not be able to present evidence that their clients acted in self-defense or in the defense of others against law enforcement officers carrying out two court orders.\n\n(Reporting by John L.

Standing in solidarity with her husband, Eric \"Black Hat Man\" Parker, Andrea was gagged and handcuffed in front of the Federal Courthouse in Las Vegas, NV, as supporters of the Tier 3 Bundy trial defendants wait outside for a verdict. They brought in the mock jail cell from the original Camp Liberty for the protest...the placement of the cell was approved by the Department of Homeland Security. The Las Vegas Metro PD came down, 9 LEOs to one woman, gagged and handcuffed behind her back. The group complied under duress, and the cell was removed, effectively shutting down the rest of that day's planned protest.\n\nSo there ya go, another example of the right hand not knowing what the left hand is doing. The group got permission to set up the mock jail cell in support of Eric Parker and the other 3 defendants in front of the Federal Court House, while they await a verdict on the re-trial of the Tier 3 Bundy et all current 4 defendants. The supporters wouldn't have gone to all the time and work to haul the mock jail cell in from Pahrump if they didn't know they could set it up. But nooooooooo. No free speech on We The People's property for YOU!\n\nSo does this mean Las Vegas Metro PD trumps the Department of Homeland Security on Federal property? Craziness. Daily court updates posted on this video's channel.\n\nIdaho Political Prisoner Foundation, Inc posted - Today is a huge day for five (5) Political Prisoners. Eric Parker, Steve Stewart, Scott Drexler, and Rick Lovelien wait for a jury to deliberate after they all decided not to do closing arguments to reinforce to the jury just how much the Government is hiding. If we receive anything but acquittals, we will quickly solicit funds to make sure that they have what they need the moment they step back into Pahrump. With any luck though, we'll be figuring out how to get them all home.\n\nAlso, Darryl Thorn has a status hearing today where there is a chance that his pretrial release could be revoked, which would leave him remanded to custody until sentencing. Darryl has bent over backward to comply with all restrictions placed upon him. He is looking at up to 15 years. We are hoping, of course, that the Court recognizes his effort and allows him to continue to live and work prior to sentencing this fall. The FOUNDATION has a one-week disbursement of funds available to go on to his books the moment we know his inmate ID number; however, if the outcome of this hearing is not favorable, we will solicit more funds to help him get started right away.\n\nLiberty has always been a risky proposition... where others could not, or would not stand, a few hundred did. Now, to make an example, the Government will stop at nothing to levy devastating consequences that will absolutely ruin lives. If it helps you to look at it this way... supporting Political Prisoners supports the resolve of the American People to live free. The Government's criminalization of natural rights shouldn't even be a talking point, but it is.

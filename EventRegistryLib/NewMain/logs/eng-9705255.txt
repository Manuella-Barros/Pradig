It led to a seismic shift within the Democratic Party regarding confidence in the president's ability to beat Trump and lead the country. The voters are convinced that Biden is too old, with brutal numbers to that effect: 72 percent think he's too old to run for president. Biden is heading for a massive defeat on Election Day, but it's still early.\n\nTrump allowed Democratic Party infighting and whining to carry on for days, and it was effective. The Democrats were doing the heavy lifting in undercutting their nominee. However, a new video of Trump golfing shows the former president opening his mouth about his decisive win over Biden, where he claims he got Biden to quit the race. He also said that he's unafraid of Kamala Harris, calling her pathetic (via Daily Beast):\n\nDonald Trump has delivered a brutal assessment of Joe Biden's performance against him in last week's presidential debate, calling the president a \"broken-down pile of crap\" teetering on the verge of \"quitting the race\" in a video provided by a source to The Daily Beast.\n\n\"He just quit, you know -- he's quitting the race,\" Trump says, sitting in a golf cart. \"I got him out of the -- and that means we have Kamala.\"\n\nIt was not immediately clear where or when exactly the footage had been covertly filmed.\n\nIn the video, the former president asks the person holding the camera what they thought of his own debate performance.

After announcing that the president is quitting and handing the baton to Kamala, Trump continues, \"I think she's gonna be better\" as an opponent.\n\n\"She's so bad. She's so pathetic,\" he says, plucking at his gloves.\n\nFirst, let's wait to see how this video was obtained. Also, did Trump mean Biden is physically stepping aside or mentally checked out of this race? The president was described as humiliated in the days following his drubbing from Trump. Frankly, both are possible: Biden's mental limitations are acute, while his poll numbers have prominent Democrats trying to stage a 21st-century rendition of Julius Caesar.\n\nDid Trump know he was being recorded during this exchange? There is no way that Biden, with the few brain cells he has left, would kowtow and surrender like this, especially if he knew the reaction from his rival. That's why he's clinging like grim death to his candidacy, reinforced by his psychopathic, power-hungry wife, Jill, and crack cocaine-addicted and money-grubbing son, Hunter. Trump knows the Left is out to get him, and he should react accordingly.\n\nBefore driving off, he did say they're going to report that he's probably quitting -- probably being the operative word. Again, we don't know when this was shot. As of today, Biden is still the Democratic Party nominee. That aside, I also agree with everything Trump said about Kamala and Joe.\n\nShe is pathetic, and Biden is an \"old, broken down pile of crap.\"\n\nThe animosity between these two men is notable and long-standing.\n\nWe'll keep you posted. The quality of the video isn't good. Is it a cheap fake?\n\nOnly kidding...only kidding. I would say that maybe this could shift focus away from Biden's issues. Still, with the abysmal polling numbers he has, especially on the cognitive health questions, it's unlikely Trump on a golf course cursing out his opponent will overtake the news cycle. Too many Democrats are still melting down, which adds more to the intrigue about Biden replacement theory. Trump knows this drama, too. Maybe an intentional leak?\n\nYou never know with this guy, and I'm not saying that's a bad thing.", "source": {"uri": "townhall.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Townhall"}, "authors": [{"uri": "matt_vespa@townhall.com", "name": "Matt Vespa", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kamala_Harris", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Kamala Harris"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Biden", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Democratic Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Daily_Beast", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "The Daily Beast"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Election_Day_(United_States)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Election Day (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golf", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Golf"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baton_(law_enforcement)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Baton (law enforcement)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golf_cart", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Golf cart"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_presidential_debates", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United States presidential debates"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hunter_Biden", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Hunter Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golf_course", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Golf course"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drama", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Drama"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Julius_Caesar", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Julius Caesar"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychopathy", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Psychopathy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brain", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Brain"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Advice", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Advice", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Advice", "label": "dmoz/Society/Advice", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 89}], "image": "https://media.townhall.com/cdn/hodl/2024/179/d97b7100-8237-40d9-8e5c-600e1d4f29d0.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9705255", "eventUri": "eng-9705255", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.003921568627450966, "wgt": 207, "relevance": 1}

It is unclear where or when the footage was filmed or if Trump was aware that he was being recorded.\n\nIn the video, the presumed Republican presidential candidate can be heard remarking on his clash with Biden at a campaign debate last week, in which the president gave a wobbly performance, sparking calls for him to step aside in favor of a different Democratic contender.\n\nThe footage begins with Trump asking \"How did I do with the debate the other night?\" to which a person is heard saying he was \"fantastic,\" as the former president hands some dollars to one of a group of people talking to him.\n\n\"We kicked that old, broken-down pile of crap.

I'm not leaving. I'm in this race to the end,\" Biden said in an email blast by his campaign, urging supporters to \"pitch in a few bucks\" to help defeat Trump in the November 5 presidential election.\n\nAsked Wednesday if Biden was considering stepping down, White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre said: \"Absolutely not.\"\n\nIn his debate with Trump last Thursday, Biden mumbled under his breath, lost his train of thought at times and, at one point, talked of beating Medicare. The president has said that he was tired after two foreign trips and the White House has said he had a cold.\n\nBut Biden is under increasing pressure, including from some of his closest allies. Some donors have called for him to step aside, and other Democrats are openly worrying that he is not equipped to beat Trump in November.\n\nThere are 25 Democratic members of the House of Representatives preparing to call for Biden to step aside if he seems shaky in the coming days, according to one House Democratic aide.", "source": {"uri": "timesofisrael.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "timesofisrael.com"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kamala_Harris", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Kamala Harris"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Biden", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Daily_Beast", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "The Daily Beast"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vice_President_of_the_United_States", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Vice President of the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Democratic Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republican_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Republican Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Karine_Jean-Pierre", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Karine Jean-Pierre"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2016_United_States_presidential_election", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "2016 United States presidential election"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/President_of_the_People's_Republic_of_China", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "President of the People's Republic of China"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medicare_(United_States)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Medicare (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_House_Press_Secretary", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "White House Press Secretary"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_House_of_Representatives", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "United States House of Representatives"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vladimir_Putin", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Vladimir Putin"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_House", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "White House"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Business/Business_Services/AudioVisual", "label": "dmoz/Business/Business Services/AudioVisual", "wgt": 7}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Telecommunications/Call_Centers", "label": "dmoz/Business/Telecommunications/Call Centers", "wgt": 7}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Video", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Video", "wgt": 7}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Fitness/Advice_and_Guides", "label": "dmoz/Health/Fitness/Advice and Guides", "wgt": 9}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Gambling/Craps", "label": "dmoz/Games/Gambling/Craps", "wgt": 9}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 93}], "image": "https://static.timesofisrael.com/www/uploads/2024/07/vlcsnap-2024-07-04-15h24m58s532-copy.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9705255", "eventUri": "eng-9705255", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "date": "-11-05", "textStart": 2100, "textEnd": 2110}], "sentiment": -0.05882352941176472, "wgt": 199, "relevance": 1}

In a leaked video (watch it below) obtained by the Daily Beast, Donald Trump goes in on Biden, referring to him as a \"broken-down pile of crap\" and suggesting that the 81-year-old president will soon drop out of the 2024 race.\n\nThe footage shows Trump, 78, seated in a golf cart alongside his son Barron Trump, offering his analysis of the current political landscape and his potential opponent. The clip begins with Trump, visibly holding a wad of cash, engaging a group of individuals off-camera.\n\n\"How did I do with the debate the other night?\" Trump inquired. The off-camera audience responded with praise for his debate performance, prompting Trump to shift his focus to an aggressive critique of Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris.\n\n\"We kicked that old, broken down pile of crap,\" Trump declared to the group around his golf cart. \"He's a bad guy,\" he added about Biden.\n\nDespite concerns regarding his debate performance and his ability to secure a win against Trump in the coming November election, Biden has maintained his stance on staying in the race. Undeterred by Biden's assurance, Trump continued his verbal assault: \"He just quit, you know -- he's quitting the race,\" Trump predicted with confidence. \"I got him out -- and that means we have Kamala.\"\n\nTurning his attention to the vice president, Trump expressed his harsh disapproval. \"I think she's going to be better,\" he stated before succinctly criticizing Kamala Harris as \"pathetic\" and \"so f-king bad.\" He further questioned Biden's leadership capabilities in handling international matters, particularly in dealings with Russian President Vladimir Putin and Chinese President Xi Jinping. \"Can you imagine that guy dealing with Putin? And the president of China -- who's a fierce person. He's a fierce man, very tough guy,\" Trump commented.\n\nThe video concludes with Trump emphasizing Biden's potential resignation, labeled as probable by recent announcements he referenced. \"They just announced he 's probably quitting. Just keep knocking him out, huh?\" Trump said before driving off.\n\nDetails about the specific location or date of the video's recording remain unknown. When contacted for comment, the Trump campaign directed inquiries to an earlier statement titled \"Total Collapse of the Democrat Party.\" Campaign officials Chris LaCivita and Susie Wiles issued a strongly-worded release attacking both President Biden and Vice President Harris.\n\n\"Every Democrat who is calling on Crooked Joe Biden to quit was once a supporter of Biden and his failed policies that lead to extreme inflation, an open border, and chaos at home and abroad,\" LaCivita and Wiles asserted. They went on to accuse Democrats, the mainstream media, and what they termed \"the swamp\" of colluding to conceal the truth about Biden's fitness for office. \"Joe Biden is weak, failed, dishonest, and not fit for the White House,\" they continued. \"Every one of them has lied about Joe Biden's cognitive state and supported his disastrous policies over the past four years, especially Cackling Copilot Kamala Harris.\"\n\nThe statement concluded with a bold prediction: \"President Trump will beat any Democrat on November 5th because he has a proven record and an agenda to Make America Great Again.\"\n\nDespite Trump's aggressive rhetoric, President Biden has steadfastly vowed to continue his campaign. However, he faces growing scrutiny from Democratic elected officials, donors, and strategists urging him to reconsider his re-election bid in light of his recent debate performance and declining poll numbers. The video leak has done little to change Biden's public stance, but it intensifies the already heated atmosphere surrounding the 2024 presidential race.", "source": {"uri": "eurweb.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "EURweb"}, "authors": [{"uri": "fisher_jack@eurweb.com", "name": "Fisher Jack", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kamala_Harris", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Kamala Harris"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Biden", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/President_of_the_People's_Republic_of_China", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "President of the People's Republic of China"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Daily_Beast", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "The Daily Beast"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vladimir_Putin", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Vladimir Putin"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xi_Jinping", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Xi Jinping"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vice_President_of_the_United_States", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Vice President of the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Democratic Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assault", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Assault"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russia", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Russia"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Russia"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Susie_Wiles", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Susie Wiles"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump_2016_presidential_campaign", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump 2016 presidential campaign"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Make_America_Great_Again", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Make America Great Again"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chris_LaCivita", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Chris LaCivita"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mainstream_media", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Mainstream media"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inflation", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Inflation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_House", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "White House"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Campaigns_and_Elections", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Campaigns and Elections", "wgt": 6}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Video", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Video", "wgt": 7}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Fitness/Advice_and_Guides", "label": "dmoz/Health/Fitness/Advice and Guides", "wgt": 8}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Activism/Video", "label": "dmoz/Society/Activism/Video", "wgt": 7}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Gambling/Craps", "label": "dmoz/Games/Gambling/Craps", "wgt": 7}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 92}], "image": "https://eurweb.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Donald-Trump-and-Baron-Trump-in-golf-cart-via-X-screenshot1.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9705255", "eventUri": "eng-9705255", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "date": "-11-05", "textStart": 3288, "textEnd": 3300}], "sentiment": -0.1686274509803921, "wgt": 199, "relevance": 1}

That's all that matters. It's not where you start it's where you finish. My Gawd. We don't need another week like this one, ever -- or at least for a very and I mean very long time. The Debate From Hell was last Thursday. It did not go well and rather than just let it be one negative indicator, the fallout was allowed to ride roughshod over the entire Biden-Harris campaign, to the extent of causing Joe Biden to ponder whether he should drop out of the race. Now, as I clearly stated here and on more than one occasion this past week, I don't believe that President Biden was ever of a mind to quit. But the \"old age\" mantra got going and certainly he had to listen to those thoughts and decide what to do. That he did and as of Wednesday night, as the nation gets ready to celebrate her 248th birthday, Biden is in it to stay.\n\nThe reason things got nerve wracking was because a few Democrats were shuffling up to the plate and calling for Biden to step down. That ship sailed long ago. We are on the voyage that we're on. That voyage is Biden v. Trump. And for anybody to even consider that Joe Biden should step aside at this point is suicidal. It's now July. You don't decide to switch candidates 90 days out from an election.\n\nFDR was in office and he was in a wheelchair. FDR died in office. Hopefully we won't see that, but if we should witness such a thing, then at least the will of the American people will have been done and not the will of a handful of hysterical Democrats who always, and I mean freaking all-ways, do this. There is always some insane last minute panic. There is always some fraction of the party that wants to snatch defeat from the jaws of victory. All effing ways. It is one of the things that makes me despair to be a Democrat from time to time, it is so baked into our cake. And take a look at this. The account is owned by an avid Trump supporter. Apparently the idea was for Trump to claim that he had forced Biden out and look all powerful in doing so.\n\nIn the video, the former president asks the person holding the camera what they thought of his own debate performance. As he's told he did \"fantastic\" and \"amazing,\" Trump blusters on flatly, \"Look at that old, broken down pile of crap.\n\n\"It's a bad guy,\" he says, seemingly referring to Biden. After announcing that the president is quitting and handing the baton to Kamala Harris, Trump continues, \"I think she's gonna be better\" as an opponent.\n\n\"She's so bad. She's so pathetic,\" he adds, plucking at his gloves, then appears to say, \"She's so fucking bad.\"\n\nTrump then switches back to Biden, asking, \"Can you imagine that guy dealing with Putin? And the president of China -- who's a fierce person. He's a fierce man, very tough guy. And they see him.\"\n\nBefore driving off, the former president reiterates, \"But they just announced he's probably quitting. Just keep knocking him out, huh?\"\n\nReached for comment on Wednesday evening, Trump campaign spokesperson Stephen Cheung directed The Daily Beast to a statement issued earlier in the day on the \"total collapse\" of the Democratic Party.\n\n\"Every Democrat who is calling on Crooked Joe Biden to quit was once a supporter of Biden and his failed policies that lead to extreme inflation, an open border, and chaos at home and abroad,\" reads the statement, attributed to campaign advisors Chris LaCivita and Susie Wiles.\n\n\"Make no mistake that Democrats, the main stream media, and the swamp colluded to hide the truth from the American public - Joe Biden is weak, failed, dishonest, and not fit for the White House,\" it continues. \"Every one of them has lied about Joe Biden's cognitive state and supported his disastrous policies over the past four years, especially Cackling Copilot Kamala Harris.\"\n\nOne political party has totally collapsed in this country, but it is not the Democrats. I'm not so sure that Team Trump was wise to leak this. I don't think their fat, lazy candidate oozing out of his golf cart and uttering vulgarities about the other side is quite the selling point that they think that it is. All this is doing is reinforcing negative attitudes towards Trump.\n\nIn this piece, he's off golfing, as always, and doing nothing to build anything better. He's just trashing his adversaries. This isn't playing out as all powerful, it's playing out as Trump being lazy and detached, while Biden is actually out there involved in the game.", "source": {"uri": "politizoom.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "PolitiZoom"}, "authors": [{"uri": "ursula_faw@politizoom.com", "name": "Ursula Faw", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Biden", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Democratic Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Franklin_D._Roosevelt", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Franklin D.

He just quit, you know? He's quitting the race.

One news source has reported that, \"everyone is freaking the f**k out\".\n\nMedia reports in the US have suggested as many as 25 Democratic members of Congress are ready to call on the President to drop out of the race.\n\n\"He has to be honest with himself,\" Democratic Representative Mike Quigley of Illinois told CNN on Tuesday.\n\n\"It's his decision. I just want him to appreciate at this time just how much it impacts, not just his race, but all the other races coming in November.\"\n\nLeaked internal polling earlier this week suggested Democrats are on track for an election bloodbath after Mr Biden's support in key battleground states plummeted following the disastrous debate.\n\nThe polling, which also tested a number of possible Democratic replacements in a hypothetical match-up against Mr Trump, showed Ms Harris with a slightly higher favourability rating than Mr Biden at 41 per cent to 38 per cent, and a lower unfavorability rating at 52 per cent to 60 per cent.", "source": {"uri": "news.com.au", "dataType": "news", "title": "News.com.au"}, "authors": [{"uri": "frank_chung@news.com.au", "name": "Frank Chung", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kamala_Harris", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Kamala Harris"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Biden", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Democratic Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Daily_Beast", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "The Daily Beast"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vice_President_of_the_United_States", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Vice President of the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_House", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "White House"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump_2016_presidential_campaign", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump 2016 presidential campaign"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/President_of_the_People's_Republic_of_China", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "President of the People's Republic of China"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vladimir_Putin", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Vladimir Putin"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inflation", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Inflation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Race_and_ethnicity_in_the_United_States_census", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Race and ethnicity in the United States census"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Karine_Jean-Pierre", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Karine Jean-Pierre"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Make_America_Great_Again", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Make America Great Again"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mike_Quigley_(politician)", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Mike Quigley (politician)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_House_Press_Secretary", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "White House Press Secretary"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swing_state", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Swing state"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_House_of_Representatives", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "United States House of Representatives"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CNN", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "CNN"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Congress", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "United States Congress"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_New_York_Times", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "The New York Times"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Illinois", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Illinois"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Illinois"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Equestrian/Racing", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Equestrian/Racing", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Motorsports", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Motorsports", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Motorsports/Auto_Racing", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Motorsports/Auto Racing", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Health/Substance_Abuse", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Health/Substance Abuse", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Motorsports/Snowmobile_Racing", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Motorsports/Snowmobile Racing", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 98}], "image": "https://content.api.news/v3/images/bin/c43f37cf4e85cc743a7372e9c3f0b16a", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9705255", "eventUri": "eng-9705255", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "date": "-11-05", "textStart": 2133, "textEnd": 2145}], "sentiment": -0.1450980392156863, "wgt": 187, "relevance": 1}

As he's told he did \"fantastic\" and \"amazing,\" Trump blusters on flatly, \"Look at that old, broken down pile of crap.\n\n\"It's a bad guy,\" he says, seemingly referring to Biden. After announcing that the president is quitting and handing the baton to Kamala, Trump continues, \"I think she's gonna be better\" as an opponent.\n\n\"She's so bad. She's so pathetic,\" he says, plucking at his gloves.\n\nThere have been conflicting reports about Biden's intentions. The New York Times reported that Biden is considering dropping out of the race, but the White House disputes that report. Post-debate polling has also been mixed, with some polls showing Biden performing better against Trump than Democratic alternatives and some showing Biden performing worse. None of the polls show any Democratic alternative polling better than Trump, save for Michelle Obama, who has repeatedly said she has no intention of running.\n\n\"Make no mistake that Democrats, the mainstream media, and the swamp colluded to hide the truth from the American public -- Joe Biden is weak, failed, dishonest, and not fit for the White House,\" Trump campaign advisers Chris LaCivita and Susie Wiles said in a statement. \"Every one of them has lied about Joe Biden's cognitive state and supported his disastrous policies over the past four years, especially Cackling Copilot Kamala Harris.\"\n\nRelated: Joe Biden Gives the Worst Excuse for His Terrible Debate Performance\n\nWhile Democrats are freaking out about the election and would like to see a different candidate put forward, switching candidates at this stage of the election is politically risky and would be a legal nightmare for the Democratic Party.\n\nAccording to an internal Democratic poll that was leaked this week, Biden's debate performance has severely impacted his campaign. Biden's support is declining in key battleground states. In Colorado, where Biden led by 3.7 points before the debate, his lead has shrunk to just 1.9 points. In Minnesota, Biden's margin dropped from 2.4 points to a mere 0.4 points, and in Maine, it decreased from 2.2 points to just 0.2 points. Biden's narrow leads in New Mexico and Virginia have also turned into small deficits post-debate.

As he is told that he did something fantastic and amazing, Trump continues to boast: \"Look at this old piece of crap in ruins.\"\n\n\"He's a bad guy,\" he said, apparently referring to Biden. After announcing that the president was resigning and handing over to Kamala Harris, Trump continued: \"I think she'll be a better opponent.\"\n\nShe's so bad.

Keep knocking him out, huh?\"\n\nReached for comment Wednesday evening, Trump campaign spokesman Stephen Cheung referred The Daily Beast to a statement released earlier in the day about the total collapse of the Democratic Party.\n\nEvery Democrat who is calling on corrupt Joe Biden to resign was once a supporter of Biden and his failed policies that lead to extreme inflation, an open border and chaos at home and abroad, reads the statement, attributed to campaign advisers Chris LaCivita and Susie Wiles.\n\nMake no mistake, the Democrats, the mainstream media, and the swamp have colluded to hide the truth from the American public: Joe Biden is weak, a failure, dishonest, and unworthy of the White House, he continued. Each of them has lied about Joe Biden's cognitive state and supported his disastrous policies over the past four years, especially the sneering co-pilot Kamala Harris.\n\nThe statement ends by announcing that Trump will beat any Democrat on November 5 because he has a proven track record and is focused on making America great again.\n\nA White House spokesperson referred The Daily Beast to the Biden campaign, which issued a statement firing back at Trump later Wednesday night.\n\nNo, Donald, the campaign said. What's wrong is disenfranchising women, what's wrong is losing an election and encouraging a mob to storm the Capitol, what's wrong is assaulting women, what's wrong is not paying your taxes, what's wrong is wanting our economy to fail...\n\nThe anaphora continued at length, with the campaign continuing to castigate Trump for, among other things, his hair and his golf game, committing 34 felonies, wanting to be a dictator from day one and campaigning on a platform of vengeance and retribution before asking what is best for our country.\n\nThank you for allowing us to clarify this point for you, he concluded.\n\nBiden's camp has denied that he is resigning, with White House spokeswoman Karine Jean-Pierre telling reporters Wednesday that the president was not considering that possibility at all.\n\nStill, he told key allies behind closed doors that he knew his performance in the coming days would be crucial if he had any hope of salvaging his campaign, according to The New York Times. (A Biden campaign spokesman vigorously denied the report, calling the Times story false.)\n\nThe president was scheduled to meet with 24 Democratic governors at the White House Wednesday night to try to allay their concerns. He is also scheduled to travel to Pennsylvania and Wisconsin in the coming days.\n\nHe knows that if he has two more events like that, he'll be in a different place by the end of the week, a Biden ally told the Times, referring to his flawless performance in last Thursday's debate.\n\nSharing the stage with Trump for the first time since 2020, Biden wandered and hesitated throughout the debate, issuing inconsistencies and at one point arguing with the presumptive Republican nominee over golf handicaps.\n\nThese events have prompted the release of several new polls reflecting growing concern that Biden will not be able to beat Trump in November, much less lead the country for four more years.\n\nA Reuters/Ipsos poll found one in three Democrats think he should resign, while a CNN poll found voters preferred Trump to Biden by six percentage points, 49% to 43%. Both polls were released Tuesday.\n\nBy Wednesday, at least two Capitol Democrats, Rep. Ral Grijalva (Ariz.) and Rep. Lloyd Doggett (Texas), had publicly called on Biden to step down. A number of major Biden donors have also expressed doubts about his viability as a candidate.\n\nAs concerns about Biden's mental and physical acuity mount, the conversation has turned to his number two, Vice President Kamala Harris, with a growing contingent of fans -- the so-called KHive -- who are wryly and earnestly spreading her gospel online.\n\nPost-debate polls reflect a similar momentum in Harris' favor, with the Reuters survey showing 81% of Democrats polled have a favorable view of Harris, compared to 78% for Biden. The CNN poll showed the vice president closing the gap with Trump, trailing him 47% to 45%, a result within the margin of error.\n\nThe vice president, for her part, has taken up Biden's cause, defending him publicly and privately since the debate. On Wednesday, she reportedly told her team: \"We will not back down. We will follow the lead of our president.\"\n\nWhat Are The Main Benefits Of Comparing Car Insurance Quotes Online", "source": {"uri": "exbulletin.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "ExBulletin"},

In 2016, a now infamous hot-mic moment surfaced in which he said he would grab women \"by the p----\".\n\nSarafina Chitika, a spokesperson for the Biden-Harris campaign, listed 21 reasons on social media arguing that Mr Trump was the one who was \"bad\".\n\nHer list ranged from \"taking away women's rights\" and \"assaulting women\" to the former president's bankruptcy and felony charges, \"not paying your taxes\", \"telling people to inject bleach\" and the \"constant lying\".\n\nShe added: \"What is bad is your golf game\".\n\nRepublicans launch attack ads against Kamala Harris\n\nThe release of the Trump video came as Republicans launched a campaign attacking the vice president who emerged in polls and in betting markets as a favourite to replace Mr Biden as the Democrats' nominee.\n\nMs Harris also had backing on Wednesday from influential Democrats including congressman Jim Clydburn who said he would support her if Mr Biden stood aside.\n\nIn one advertisement released this week, Republicans poke fun at Ms Harris and question her competency.\n\nOne advert reads: \"This November: Vote Republican. Stop Kamala.\"\n\nAnother ad relentlessly mocks Ms Harris's less than catchy slogan: \"What will be, unburdened by what has been.\"\n\nMs Harris has only ever publicly expressed loyalty to Mr Biden.\n\nAfter meeting the president for lunch on Wednesday, she told CBS News: \"Look, Joe Biden is our nominee.

In the video, provided by a source to the Daily Beast, the former president asks the person holding the camera what they thought of his own debate performance.

And they see him.\"\n\nBefore driving off, the former president reiterates, \"But they just announced he's probably quitting. Just keep knocking him out, huh?\"\n\nBut on his social media platform Truth Social on Thursday Trump did not focus on what he said about the Democratic ticket for the 2024 election, but wrote on all capitals, \"END TAX ON TIPS,\" because much of the action in the video was him unrolling two notes from a roll and handing them off-camera to-presumably-his caddy.\n\nTrump has been pushing the idea as an attempt to appeal to blue collar workers and particularly to Black and younger voters. His aides think that it could appeal to a group which polls suggest is less enthusiastic about the Democrats, and Biden in particular, than has historically been the case.\n\nHe was applauded at a rally of his supporters in Las Vegas, Nevada, last month when he mentioned it, although his rallies are not known to be places where he gets a poor reaction. The most recent time he gave it prominence, however, was at a summit of CEOs in Washington D.C., when it was reported that it caused laughter around the room.\n\nHis campaign has not spelled out exactly how it would work. Workers who earn tips, including those in restaurants and other parts of the service sector, are required to report them in their tax returns. Tax is then calculated in the same way as regular income taxes.\n\nTrump's retreat from the limelight during the Democratic crisis has been an unusual display of discipline for the former president. On Wednesday evening, his campaign spokesperson Stephen Cheung declined to issue a statement on the video and directed The Daily Beast to a statement issued earlier in the day on the \"total collapse\" of the Democratic Party which was attributed to campaign advisers Chris LaCivita and Susie Wiles.\n\nThe lengthy statement included a claim about \"Democrats, the mainstream media, and the swamp\" alleging, \"Every one of them has lied about Joe Biden's cognitive state and supported his disastrous policies over the past four years, especially Cackling Copilot Kamala Harris.\"\n\nA White House spokesperson referred The Daily Beast to Biden's campaign team, which issued a statement clapping back at Trump later on Wednesday night at similar length.\n\n\"No, Donald,\" the campaign said. \"What is bad is taking away women's rights, what is bad is losing an election and encouraging a violent mob to attack the Capitol, what is bad is assaulting women, what is bad is not paying your taxes, what is bad is rooting for our economy to fail...\"\n\nThe campaign went on to ding Trump for, among other things like his hair and golf game, \"committing 34 felonies,\" \"wanting to make yourself a dictator on day one,\" and \"running on a platform of your revenge and retribution ahead of what is best for our country.\n\n\"Thanks for letting us clear that up for you,\" it concluded.",

Just keep knocking him out...,\" Trump adds as he drives off.\n\nAs it stands, it is not yet clear when and where this video was covertly filmed.\n\nBiden vs Trump\n\nIn a highly charged debate last Thursday, Biden and Trump criticised each other's records and conduct. The early timing of this debate, hosted at CNN headquarters in Atlanta, underscored the deep-seated divisions in America following the contentious 2020 election.\n\nThe candidates, Biden at 81 and Trump at 78, skipped the customary handshake as they took their places at the podiums. The debate, conducted without a live audience, featured muted microphones to ensure orderly exchanges. Biden, reportedly battling a cold, delivered prepared remarks, reminding viewers of Trump's legal issues, suggesting he might become the first convicted felon to seek the presidency.\n\nBiden criticised Trump, pointing out his civil penalties and personal scandals, including accusations of sexual misconduct and an affair with a porn star. \"Think of all the civil penalties you have. How many billions of dollars do you owe in civil penalties for molesting a woman in public,\" Biden said, adding, \"You have the morals of an alley cat.\"\n\nTrump, leveraging his experience from rallies and reality TV, confidently listed his grievances against Biden's tenure. He lamented the current state of the nation, claiming that America had lost its global respect under Biden's leadership.\n\nWhen inflation was discussed, Biden criticised Trump's handling of the presidency, particularly during the pandemic, and mocked Trump's controversial suggestion to use bleach as a treatment for COVID-19. Biden remarked, \"We got to take a look at what I was left when I became president.\"\n\nTrump defended his presidency, asserting he had overseen \"the greatest economy in the history of our country,\" and claimed other nations envied the U.S. under his administration. Biden dismissed this, stating, \"The greatest economy in the world? He's the only one who thinks that.\"\n\nIn one of the debate's most personal moments, Biden referenced allegations that Trump had called fallen soldiers \"suckers\" and \"losers.\" He spoke of his late son Beau, an Iraq War veteran, saying, \"My son was not a loser, was not a sucker. You're the sucker. You're the loser.\" Trump denied these claims and repeatedly accused Biden of incoherence.\n\nThis debate vividly reflected the ongoing polarisation in American politics and set the stage for a fiercely contested election season.\n\nWho won?\n\nHowever, after the debate, many raised questions about Biden's ability to run the government as President for a second term. Even the Democrats, as reported, were alarmed by Biden's \"inability\" to speak coherently and clearly to take on his rival. Analysts and political commentators, describing the outcome of the first presidential debate between Trump and Biden, wrote that although Trump did not win, Biden lost the debate.", "source": {"uri": "freepressjournal.in", "dataType": "news", "title": "Free Press Journal"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Biden", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CNN", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "CNN"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2020_United_States_presidential_election", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "2020 United States presidential election"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kamala_Harris", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Kamala Harris"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/President_of_the_People's_Republic_of_China", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "President of the People's Republic of China"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vladimir_Putin", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Vladimir Putin"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atlanta", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Atlanta, Georgia"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Atlanta, Georgia"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golf", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Golf"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2020_United_States_presidential_debates", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "2020 United States presidential debates"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Felony", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Felony"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Political_polarization", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Political polarization"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coronavirus", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Coronavirus"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iraq_War", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Iraq War"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Politics_of_the_United_States", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Politics of the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Democratic Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Child_sexual_abuse", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Child sexual abuse"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inflation", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Inflation"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Warfare_and_Conflict", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Warfare and Conflict", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Advice", "label": "dmoz/Society/Advice", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 93}], "image": "https://media.assettype.com/freepressjournal/2024-07/b516fe8c-c4ec-44f9-91fc-a67125f6db24/Untitled_design__51_.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9705255", "eventUri": "eng-9705255", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.2392156862745098, "wgt": 162, "relevance": 1}

In 2016, a now infamous hot-mic moment surfaced in which he said he would grab women \"by the p----\".\n\nSarafina Chitika, a spokesperson for the Biden-Harris campaign, listed 21 reasons on social media arguing that Mr Trump was the one who was \"bad\".\n\nHer list ranged from \"taking away women's rights\" and \"assaulting women\" to the former president's bankruptcy and felony charges, \"not paying your taxes\", \"telling people to inject bleach\" and the \"constant lying\".\n\nShe added: \"What is bad is your golf game\".\n\nThe released of the Trump video came as Republicans launched a campaign attacking the vice president who emerged in polls and in betting markets as a favourite to replace Mr Biden as the Democrats' nominee.\n\nMs Harris also had backing on Wednesday from influential Democrats including congressman Jim Clydburn who said he would support her if Mr Biden stood aside.\n\nIn one advertisement released this week, Republicans poke fun at Ms Harris and question her competency.\n\nOne advert reads: \"This November: Vote Republican. Stop Kamala.\"\n\nAnother ad relentlessly mocks Mrs Harris's less than catchy slogan: \"What will be, unburdened by what has been.\"\n\nMs Harris has only ever publicly expressed loyalty to Mr Biden.\n\nAfter meeting the president for lunch on Wednesday, she told CBS News: \"Look, Joe Biden is our nominee. We beat Trump once, and we're going to beat him again, period.\"", "source": {"uri": "ca.news.yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kamala_Harris", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Kamala Harris"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Biden", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golf", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Golf"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vice_President_of_the_United_States", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Vice President of the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democracy", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Democracy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republican_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Republican Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/African_Americans", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "African Americans"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asian_Americans", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Asian Americans"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Profanity", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Profanity"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Democratic Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CBS_News", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "CBS News"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Women's_rights", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Women's rights"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Felony", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Felony"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_House_of_Representatives", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "United States House of Representatives"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_media", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Social media"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Parties/Costumes", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Parties/Costumes", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 90}], "image": "https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/CqJKrA3CGK68Pgm7f9Aoww--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyMDA7aD03NTA7Y2Y9d2VicA--/https://media.zenfs.com/en/the_telegraph_818/6872faad1ffdf074b646c09c2aa6de21", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9705255", "eventUri": "eng-9705255", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.2627450980392156, "wgt": 159, "relevance": 1}

Almost immediately after that, the president gave a speech where he claimed he is not dropping out and he expressed his confidence in beating Donald Trump. But hours after that, the former president was recorded at a golf course talking about his rival and seemingly confirming he is dropping out. As he gave other golfers the news, he also said Kamala Harris is the one who will replace him if he drops out of the race. This seemed like a confirmation of what's happening, but is it?\n\nDuring the video recorded by another golfer, the former president also goes on a rant criticizing Kamala Harris and saying she is not prepared to deal with other heads of state like Vladimir Putin or Xi Jinping. This is what he told people at the golf course: \"How did I do with the debate the other night? I kicked that old, broken down pile of c**p. He's quitting the race. And that means you have Kamala.

Kennedy Jr. He is the one who should've been on the ballot at the Democratic Party but the corporations who run the country are completely against RFK.

During the televised clash hosted by CNN on June 27, a number of viewers stated that Biden sounded hoarse and lacked energ. A Biden aide told Newsweek that the president was battling a cold during the debate.\n\nHolding a handful of cash in the clip, Donald Trump asked a group of people who were not visible on camera: \"How did I do with the debate the other night?\"\n\nAfter they responded that he was \"fantastic\" and \"amazing,\" the former president handed out the cash before referring to Biden as an \"old broken down pile of crap.\"\n\n\"He just quit you know. He's quitting the race.

He's a fierce man, a very tough guy.\"\n\nHowever, it's possible he said \"gal\" not \"guy,\" in which case he would have been referring to Harris.\n\n\"They just announced he's probably quitting,\" the former star of The Apprentice then added, definitely referring to Biden, before driving off.\n\nThroughout the clip, which appeared to have been secretly recorded, Barron Trump was seen listening while sitting in silence.\n\nThis video contains strong language.\n\nThe Trump-Harris team issued a statement condemning Donald Trump's comments.\n\n\"The American people have already seen low after low from Donald Trump,\" read the statement. \"They have seen again and again his disrespect for women, his disdain for Black Americans, and his complete disregard for our democracy and our democratic norms.\n\n\"Today, Donald Trump, while golfing and avoiding the campaign trail, hit a new rock bottom: caught on tape saying that Vice President Harris, who made history as the first Black and first Asian-American woman elected to the office, is 'pathetic' and 'so f***ing bad.'\"\n\nNewsweek has contacted a representative of Donald Trump via email for comment.\n\nTaking to his Truth Social platform in the early hours of Thursday morning, Donald Trump shared the same video clip, alongside the caption: \"NO TAX ON TIPS!\"\n\nBarron Trump has kept a relatively low profile, mainly appearing silently by his family's side at campaign events.

To give him his dues, though, it turns out that the Donald Trump we see slurring his way through speeches at his MAGA rallies and presidential debates is 100% the Donald you get if you meet him in person, too.\n\nJust a week after he tragically put in a more forceful performance at the first debate than paleolithic president Joe Biden, a candid video of Trump recorded on his beloved golf course reveals his honest thoughts on Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris. For any other politician, this would be wholly shocking, but given that the cheating Cheeto tends to attack his opponent's character on every day that ends in a Y it's less of a big deal. Even so, the brazen lies Trump tells even in one-on-one conversations will leave you agog.\n\nA couple of the orange-hued hatemonger's supporters chatted with Trump while he was in a golf cart with his youngest son, Barron. As he tips the men, who presumably work at the course, Trump shamelessly fishes for compliments by asking them what they thought about his debate performance. \"Look at that old broken-down pile of crap,\" Donald says, obviously referring to President Biden. \"He's quitting, you know. He's quitting the race... I got him out of the race.\"\n\nJust in case you still don't automatically treat anything that comes out of Trump's mouth as fiction, let's clarify: no, Biden is not \"quitting the race.\" While it's true that many think the president should step aside to let someone else take over the Democratic candidacy, there has been no such official announcement. So when he tells these men that \"they've just announced he's probably quitting\" Trump is indeed talking out of another orifice that is not his mouth.\n\nAccording to Diaper Don, \"that means we have Kamala,\" insinuating that Kamala Harris is set to replace Biden in the race (which isn't necessarily what would happen if he did drop out, anyway). Breaking the habit of a lifetime, Trump initially compliments Harris, saying \"I think she's gonna be better.\" Displaying the kind of focused mind we've seen in action before when he rambled about that time he was on a boat with a snake, a battery, and a shark, Trump then does a complete 180-degree turn, however. \"She's so bad. She's so pathetic,\" he suddenly says. \"She's so f****ing bad.\"\n\nThe Daily Beast originally broke this video, but it's since been co-opted by Trump loyalists (see above) who have praised Barron for his body language in the clip. \"He's also mirroring his Dad's body movements,\" reads one reply. \"We are observing the future being made.\"\n\nWell, that's not sinister at all.

I'm in this race to the end.\"\n\nHowever, the president's polling numbers have slipped and US media reported he's told an ally that his performances in the next week are vital - a claim denied by the White House.\n\nOn Tuesday, Mr Biden said he had nearly fallen asleep during the TV debate due to a recent hectic travel schedule.\n\nBut his stumbling performance, in which he gave muddled answers and spoke with a weak voice, reportedly caused panic in the Democratic Party and sparked speculation about whether it would try to replace him.\n\nQuestions over his mental acuity have escalated in recent months after he appeared to freeze during several public appearances.\n\nMr Biden's nomination to go up against Trump is set to be rubberstamped at the party's convention in August and the only realistic way he could be replaced is if he decided himself to step down.\n\nIf he did quit, Kamala Harris would likely be a contender - while California governor Gavin Newsom and Michigan governor Gretchen Whitmer are also being tipped.\n\nThe exact process of how they might be chosen is unclear.\n\nFor now, President Biden is publicly showing no signs of stepping back and held a virtual meeting with 24 governors on Wednesday to try to reassure them he's up to the job.\n\nRead more:\n\nIs the first lady counselling Joe to stay in the race?\n\nWho is California governor who could replace Biden?\n\nThe governors of Maryland, Minnesota and New York told reporters afterwards that they still supported him.\n\nHowever, a few Democrats have now come out and urged him to withdraw, including Arizona representative Raul Grijalva and Seth Moulton from Massachusetts.\n\n\"The unfortunate reality is that the status quo will likely deliver us President Trump,\" Mr Moulton said in a statement. \"President Biden is not going to get younger.\"\n\nThe co-founder of Netflix, Reed Hastings, a major party donor, has also urged Mr Biden to call it a day and pressure could become overwhelming if more big backers follow suit.\n\nAll eyes are now on the president's performance in an interview with ABC News on Friday, which will be scrutinised for any more fumbles or listlessness.", "source": {"uri": "news.sky.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Sky News"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kamala_Harris", "type": "person", "score":

She's so bad, she's so pathetic, she's so fucking bad.\"\n\nIn a patronising sneer, Trump added: \"Can you imagine that girl dealing with Putin and the president of China who is a very fierce person?\"\n\nLast Thursday Biden, 81, and Trump, 78, faced off in the first televised CNN debate - incredibly early for the November presidential election.\n\nIt appeared to be a gamble taken by the White House camp - which may not have paid off.\n\nMembers of Biden's own Democrat party dubbed it an \"unmitigated disaster\", \"a meltdown\", and \"a slow-motion car crash\".\n\nThe White House came out in defence of the president and said he was suffering from a cold and a sore throat during the debate.\n\nHis voice from the off was hushed and he often stumbled over certain answers or lost his train of thought entirely.\n\nIt was a far cry from the concise speaking Biden who battled Trump during the presidential debates of 2020.\n\nDespite repeated calls from politicians and even US media outlets, Biden has doubled down on his plans to stay until the bitter end.\n\nThis week he insisted: \"Let me say this as clearly as I possibly can, as simply and straightforward as I can: I am running.\n\n\"Let me say this as clearly as I possibly can, as simply and straightforward as I can: I am running.\"\n\nBiden conveyed this message to a group of Democratic associates, including some who made their way to Washington D.C. for an urgent meeting regarding the public relations dilemma resulting from Biden's stuttering presentations, as detailed by NBC.\n\nEven First Lady Jill Biden maintained that her husband would not withdraw from his position, expressing this sentiment to Vogue during discussions held at Camp David, where the president's family had convened for crucial deliberations.\n\nWhite House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre also reassured the media that Biden is \"clear-eyed and staying in the race.\"\n\nWhen pressed on whether he would step aside, Jean-Pierre insisted, \"Absolutely not.\"\n\nBiden did admit to voters in North Carolina that he struggles to debate the way he used to, just a day after his televised faux pas.\n\nThe president said he doesn't \"speak as smoothly\", \"debate as well\" or \"walk as easy\" as he used to.", "source": {"uri": "internewscast.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Internewscast Journal"}, "authors": [],

The video, which has been widely circulated on social media, captures Trump in his element, surrounded by supporters and delivering his trademark unfiltered commentary on the current state of American politics.\n\nThe video begins with Trump sitting in a golf cart, surrounded by a group of fans and supporters. As he prepares to tee off, he turns to the camera and launches into a scathing tirade against Biden and Harris. \"You know, folks, I've been watching these two clowns for a while now,\" Trump begins, his voice dripping with disdain. \"Biden is a broken-down pile of crap, and Harris is just so bad, it's embarrassing.\"\n\nTrump goes on to mock Biden's recent debate performance, claiming that the president is \"quitting the race\" and that Harris will soon be the Democratic nominee. \"She's so pathetic, it's unbelievable,\" Trump says, shaking his head in disbelief. \"I mean, can you imagine her dealing with Putin or Xi Jinping? It would be a disaster.\"\n\nThroughout the video, Trump's supporters can be heard cheering and laughing in the background, clearly enjoying the former president's no-holds-barred commentary. At one point, Trump even pauses to sign autographs and pose for selfies with his fans, all while continuing to disparage Biden and Harris.\n\nThe video has been met with widespread praise from Trump's base, with many conservatives hailing it as a much-needed dose of truth in an era of political correctness and media bias. \"Finally, someone who's not afraid to speak the truth about these two clowns,\" one Twitter user wrote. \"Trump is a breath of fresh air in a world full of hot air.\"\n\nHowever, the video has also drawn criticism from Democrats and liberal commentators, who have accused Trump of being divisive and disrespectful. \"This kind of language is unbecoming of a former president,\" one Democratic strategist told CNN. \"It's clear that Trump is more interested in scoring political points than in working to bring the country together.\"\n\nDespite the controversy, the video has only served to further energize Trump's base, many of whom see the former president as a fearless truth-teller who is unafraid to call out the failings of the Biden administration. \"Trump is the only one who can save this country from the disaster that Biden and Harris are creating,\" one supporter wrote on Twitter. \"We need him back in the White House now more than ever.\"", "source": {"uri": "thebeltwayreport.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Beltway Report"}, "authors": [{"uri": "jack_crane@thebeltwayreport.com", "name": "Jack Crane", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kamala_Harris", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Kamala Harris"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Biden", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golf", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Golf"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Politics_of_the_United_States", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Politics of the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Democratic Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Internet"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_media", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Social media"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xi_Jinping", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Xi Jinping"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vladimir_Putin", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Vladimir Putin"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Selfie", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Selfie"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Presidency_of_Joe_Biden", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Presidency of Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Media_bias", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Media bias"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liberalism", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Liberalism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conservatism", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Conservatism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CNN", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "CNN"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_House", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "White House"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Political_correctness", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Political correctness"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twitter", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Twitter"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Pranks", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Pranks", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 88}], "image": "https://thebeltwayreport.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/leaked-Trump-videohas-liberals-losing-their-mind-flipping-their-shit.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9705255", "eventUri": "eng-9705255", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.1215686274509804, "wgt": 144, "relevance": 1}

I got him out,\" Trump says in the footage, published late Wednesday. He then disparages Harris, who sources say would likely take over from Biden as the Democratic presidential candidate if he were to pull out, saying, \"She's so bad, she's so pathetic, she's just so fucking bad.\"\n\nBiden, 81, told his campaign on Wednesday that he was still running. His campaign fired back at Trump, 78, in a statement.\n\n\"No, Donald. What is bad is taking away women's rights; What is bad is losing an election and encouraging a violent mob to attack the Capitol; What is bad is assaulting women; What is bad is not paying your taxes,\" spokesperson Sarafina Chitika said.\n\nTrump's campaign stood by his words, with co-campaign manager Chris LaCivita responding on X: \"Nothing in this video is incorrect.\"\n\nReuters verified the location of the video as Trump National Golf Club in Bedminster, New Jersey.

Watching old Joe last week (and since) has been like watching a long row of dumpster fires being hit by a series of runaway train wrecks.\n\nOn Wednesday, Team Trump released a statement (written by campaign staffers Chris LaCivita and Susie Wiles) regarding Biden's (lack of) cognitive ability and the Democratic Party's malfeasance in keeping it as under wraps as they could.\n\n\"Every Democrat who is calling on Crooked Joe Biden to quit was once a supporter of Biden and his failed policies that lead to extreme inflation, an open border, and chaos at home and abroad. Make no mistake that Democrats, the main stream media, and the swamp colluded to hide the truth from the American public - Joe Biden is weak, failed, dishonest, and not fit for the White House. Every one of them has lied about Joe Biden's cognitive state and supported his disastrous policies over the past four years, especially Cackling Copilot Kamala Harris.\n\nPresident Trump will beat any Democrat on November 5th because he has a proven record and an agenda to Make America Great Again.\"\n\nThat's a typical Trump statement, right down to the \"Cackling Copilot Kamala Harris\" bit.\n\nSee Related: Wow: Texas Rep. Wesley Hunt Tells Insane Story of Trump Threatening Taliban Leaders to Their Faces\n\nBiden Will Try to Prove He's Not Catatonic in an Extended Interview With George Stephanopoulos\n\nThere are, buried in the usual Trumpspeak, some important points.\n\nFirst: Yes, once the debate was over and Joe Biden's mental and physical deterioration couldn't be hidden anymore, the knives came out. Democrats are running from the Biden campaign and the Biden administration like rats leaving a sinking ship, with the notable exception of the Cackling Copilot, who is busily consulting with decorators for plans to remodel the Oval Office.\n\nSecond: Yes, the legacy media was complicit in covering up Joe Biden's deterioration. This is near-criminal collusion -- it is essentially fraud -- perpetrated on the people by the overwhelmingly leftist media. Fortunately, the internet has resulted in an explosion of alternatives, and now you have excellent sites like RedState (and our sister sites of the Townhall group) to balance the Democrat activists that staff the old media.\n\nThird: Yes, Joe Biden is weak, failed, and dishonest. He would not be fit for the presidency even if he were not dishonest; he could have been as incorruptible as Cato and as dedicated to republican principles as Cincinnatus and would still be unfit for the presidency due to his mental decline. However, he is not, and never has been, anything but dishonest in word and deed and weak in principles. At his best, he was never more than mediocre; now, his weakness is a threat to national security.\n\nSo Trump's statement, a post-debate assessment that has the typical Trump flair, makes some perfectly apt points.\n\nWe are four months away from the election. The momentum is in Trump's favor. The polling is swinging farther in Trump's direction. But the GOP, if they want to win, had damn well better be prepared to sprint to the finish, because the long knives that are out now for Joe Biden's reelection wishes will be turned back in Trump's direction as soon as this post-debate problem is decided, one way or the other.", "source": {"uri": "redstate.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Redstate"}, "authors": [{"uri": "ward_clark@redstate.com", "name": "Ward Clark", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Biden", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Democratic Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Susie_Wiles", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Susie Wiles"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2020_United_States_presidential_debates", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "2020 United States presidential debates"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump_2016_presidential_campaign", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump 2016 presidential campaign"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chris_LaCivita", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Chris LaCivita"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kamala_Harris", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Kamala Harris"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inflation", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Inflation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wesley_Hunt", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Wesley Hunt"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Presidency_of_Joe_Biden", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Presidency of Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Biden_2020_presidential_campaign", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Joe Biden 2020 presidential campaign"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Make_America_Great_Again", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Make America Great Again"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coming_out", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Coming out"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Stephanopoulos", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "George Stephanopoulos"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taliban", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Taliban"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_House", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "White House"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Texas", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Texas"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Texas"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republicanism_in_the_United_States", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Republicanism in the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cato_Institute", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Cato Institute"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RedState", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "RedState"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oval_Office", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Oval Office"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_security", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "National security"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fraud", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Fraud"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Left-wing_politics", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Left-wing politics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Internet"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Advice", "label": "dmoz/Society/Advice", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Activism/Strategies", "label": "dmoz/Society/Activism/Strategies", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Democracy", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Democracy", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 95}], "image": "https://media.townhall.com/cdn/hodl/2024/149/c0693c33-d904-41e3-9a7b-1ecfd7aca8e2.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9705255", "eventUri": "eng-9705255", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "date": "-11-05", "textStart": 1285, "textEnd": 1297}], "sentiment": -0.003921568627450966, "wgt": 141, "relevance": 1}

I kicked that old, broken down pile of c**p. He's quitting the race\", a suggestion Democrats have refuted this week.\n\nHe then took a swing at Harris as Biden's potential Democratic successor, branding her \"so f****g bad\", and further commented on her being \"pathetic\". The footage also indicated Barron Trump sitting next to Trump on the golf cart.\n\nREAD MORE: Donald Trump seeks to overturn hush money conviction after SCOTUS immunity ruling\n\nElsewhere, during a phone call with campaign staff on Wednesday, President Biden allegedly stated to his team, \"No one is pushing me out.\" This bold declaration comes amidst whispers that top-tier members of his party are attempting to replace him as presidential nominee as he campaigns for reelection this November.\n\nA campaign aide shedding light on the specifics of the telephone conversation, sought anonymity when speaking to The Associated Press, whilst three insiders disclosed to the news agency that both the president and Vice President Kamala Harris made unexpected drop-ins during another phone call on the same day with the Democratic National Committee.\n\n\"I am running. I am the leader of the Democratic Party. No one is pushing me out,\" declared the top aide, sharing the defiant message on X. The subsequent call with the Democratic National Committee was described as a morale-boosting session, emphasising the high stakes of the election.\n\nDuring this call, committee members urged Biden to stand by his post-debate assertion from last Thursday's calamitous face-off with former president and Republican Donald Trump, where he vowed to bounce back after being savagely taken down by his opponent.\n\nThe exposed remarks are part of a broader strategy by the president and his inner circle as they engage in a full-blown damage limitation exercise, aiming to secure the loyalty of crucial supporters who appeared to abandon him following his debate debacle - a performance that saw him occasionally become paralysed on stage, speaking in a fragile, feeble tone.\n\nInside sources suggest that Democrats have been largely dissatisfied with the justifications provided by Biden and White House officials for his debate showing, including claims that he was unwell. These rationalisations have reportedly ignited considerable irritation within the party ranks, with many wishing Biden had addressed the numerous concerns about his underwhelming debate presence more decisively and promptly.\n\nTrump's swagger may be bolstered by the rescheduling of his sentencing, following a delay due to the recent Supreme Court verdict granting him absolute immunity for actions taken during his presidency. The fresh sentencing date is now set tantalisingly close to the November election.\n\nThis comes after the Republican National Convention, which is likely to confirm Trump as the GOP's presidential nominee. The new date penned in for Trump's sentencing is Sept. 18, but Judge Juan Mechan has indicated this could change, stating it will stand \"if such is still necessary\" given the uncertainty following the Supreme Court's decisive 6-3 decision on Monday.", "source": {"uri": "mirror.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "Mirror"}, "authors": [{"uri": "abigail_o_leary@mirror.co.uk", "name": "Abigail O'Leary", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kamala_Harris", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Kamala Harris"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Biden", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Democratic Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golf", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Golf"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swing_(politics)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Swing (politics)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golf_course", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Golf course"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vice_President_of_the_United_States", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Vice President of the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_National_Committee", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Democratic National Committee"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Legal_immunity", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Legal immunity"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Telephone", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Telephone"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supreme_Court_of_the_United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Supreme Court of the United States"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Associated_Press", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Associated Press"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republican_National_Convention", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Republican National Convention"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_House", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "White House"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republican_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Republican Party (United States)"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Activism/Strategies", "label": "dmoz/Society/Activism/Strategies", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Niche/Politics", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Niche/Politics", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Democracy", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Democracy", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 96}], "image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/news/us-news/article33165533.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_top-pic-template-1.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9705255", "eventUri": "eng-9705255", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "date": "-09-18", "textStart": 3436, "textEnd": 3444}], "sentiment": -0.0980392156862745, "wgt": 128, "relevance": 1}

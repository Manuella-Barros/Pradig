The survival of civilians in Gaza depends on it,\" added Benoit, MSF's executive director in the US.\n\nHer statement came after the Israeli army on Tuesday seized control of the Palestinian side of the Rafah crossing on the border with Egypt, a vital route for humanitarian aid into the besieged territory.\n\nThis followed evacuation orders issued by the Israeli army for Palestinians in eastern Rafah, a move widely seen as a prelude to a long-feared attack on the city, home to some 1.5 million displaced Palestinians.\n\nBenoit underlined that people currently taking refuge in Rafah have been displaced \"time and again by the war and are living in tents and makeshift shelters that can barely withstand the elements, let alone bombs and airstrikes.\"\n\nShe also highlighted Rafah's role as a \"major hub of health care services and humanitarian assistance\" in the Gaza Strip.

She expressed concern that the ongoing offensive would severely damage the already-fragile health system in the region. She noted that hospitals are at risk of being inaccessible or destroyed, as seen in the north.\n\n\"For seven months, we have witnessed the indiscriminate killing of civilians, attacks on aid workers -- including our own staff -- the destruction of medical facilities, and the obstruction of lifesaving assistance.

Speaking to reporters in Melbourne, Albanese said that his government has communicated its opposition to the ground offensive in Rafah, a city in southern Gaza. He voiced concern over the civilian population in Rafah, most of whom were displaced after Israel's bombing of Gaza.\n\n\"They [Palestinian civilians] were told to move from the northern part of Gaza, they were told to move south. You then have a very crowded population, and you also have a crowded population that is not clear where they are supposed to go, given the destruction that's occurred to housing in other parts of Gaza,\" said Albanese. \"So, we are very concerned about that. And my government's position is very clear, and it's been a long-standing position of the Australian Government to support a two-state solution.\"\n\nOn Wednesday, Australian Foreign Minister Penny Wong also added her voice to the growing opposition to the Israeli ground offensive in Rafah, warning that the impact of the operation will be \"devastating.\" She said that her country has been clear about its objections to a major Israeli ground offensive in Rafah. \"We have reiterated this to Israel again today [Wednesday].\"\n\nThe Israeli army seized control of the Palestinian side of the Rafah crossing on the border with Egypt on Tuesday, a vital route for humanitarian aid into the besieged territory.\n\nREAD: Israel attacks Spanish minister who spoke about genocide in Gaza\n\nThis came a day after the army issued immediate evacuation orders for Palestinians in eastern Rafah, which is where more than 1.5 million displaced Palestinians have taken refuge from the war launched by Israel in October, ostensibly to destroy the Palestinian resistance movement, Hamas, after its 7 October attack on southern Israel. Although around 1,200 Israelis were killed on that day, many were actually killed by Israel Defence Forces tanks and helicopters, not Hamas fighters, according to reports in Israeli media. Just over 250 hostages were taken back to Gaza.\n\nThe occupation state's subsequent military offensive has to-date killed 35,000 Palestinians, most of them children and women, and wounded 70,000 more. An estimated 8-10,000 Palestinians are missing, presumed dead, under the rubble of their homes destroyed by Israel.\n\nMore than seven months into the Israeli war, vast swathes of Gaza lie in ruins, pushing 85 per cent of the enclave's population into internal displacement amid a crippling blockade of food, clean water and medicine, the UN has pointed out.\n\nThe occupation state stands accused of genocide at the International Court of Justice, which it denies. An interim ruling in January ordered Tel Aviv to stop genocidal acts and take measures to guarantee that humanitarian assistance is provided to civilians in Gaza. South Africa, which took the apartheid state to the ICJ, has since claimed that Israel is ignoring the court's ruling.", "source": {"uri": "middleeastmonitor.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Middle

The survival of civilians in Gaza depends on it,\" added Benoit, MSF's executive director in the US.\n\nHer statement came after the Israeli army on Tuesday seized control of the Palestinian side of the Rafah crossing on the border with Egypt, a vital route for humanitarian aid into the besieged territory.\n\nThis followed evacuation orders issued by the Israeli army for Palestinians in eastern Rafah, a move widely seen as a prelude to a long-feared attack on the city, home to some 1.5 million displaced Palestinians.\n\nBenoit underlined that people currently taking refuge in Rafah have been displaced \"time and again by the war and are living in tents and makeshift shelters that can barely withstand the elements, let alone bombs and airstrikes.\"\n\nShe also highlighted Rafah's role as a \"major hub of health care services and humanitarian assistance\" in the Gaza Strip. The city is also crucial for humanitarian assistance deliveries, given the crossing with Egypt, she added.\n\n\"Attacking this area means cutting off the lifelines of people who've lost everything. Our humanitarian staff and patients are terrified,\" she said.\n\nIsrael has waged an unrelenting offensive on the Gaza Strip since a cross-border attack by Hamas last Oct. 7 which killed some 1,200 people.\n\nMore than 34,800 Palestinians have since been killed in Gaza, the vast majority of whom have been women and children, and 78,400 others injured, according to Palestinian health authorities.\n\nOver seven months into the Israeli war, vast swathes of Gaza lay in ruins, pushing 85% of the enclave's population into internal displacement amid a crippling blockade of food, clean water, and medicine, according to the UN.\n\nIsrael stands accused of genocide at the International Court of Justice. An interim ruling in January said it is \"plausible\" that Israel is committing genocide in Gaza and ordered Tel Aviv to stop such acts and take measures to guarantee that humanitarian assistance is provided to civilians in Gaza.\n\nBenoit's statement called for immediate action to halt Israel's plans for a ground invasion of Rafah. She highlighted the grave danger posed to the trapped population in Rafah and emphasized that further military escalation would exacerbate the already fragile humanitarian situation.\n\nShe stressed the responsibility of the US, as a major supporter of Israel, to ensure that its assistance does not contribute to violations of international humanitarian law. She expressed concern that the ongoing offensive would severely damage the already-fragile health system in the region. She noted that hospitals are at risk of being inaccessible or destroyed, as seen in the north.\n\n\"For seven months, we have witnessed the indiscriminate killing of civilians, attacks on aid workers -- including our own staff -- the destruction of medical facilities, and the obstruction of lifesaving assistance. We cannot imagine what a further escalation of this conflict would mean for people who have already suffered so much in this war without rules,\" she said.", "source": {"uri": "aa.com.tr", "dataType": "news", "title": "Anadolu Ajans\u0131"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palestinians", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Palestinians"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/M\u00e9decins_Sans_Fronti\u00e8res", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "M\u00e9decins Sans Fronti\u00e8res"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israel_Defense_Forces", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Israel Defense Forces"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Humanitarian_aid", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Humanitarian aid"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gaza_Strip", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Gaza Strip"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Gaza Strip"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Palestine"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rafah", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Rafah"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Rafah"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Palestine"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israel", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Israel"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Israel"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rafah_Border_Crossing", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Rafah Border Crossing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ceasefire", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Ceasefire"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_humanitarian_law", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "International humanitarian law"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internally_displaced_person", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Internally displaced person"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Egypt", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Egypt"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Egypt"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palestinian_refugees", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Palestinian refugees"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hamas", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Hamas"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genocide", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Genocide"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Airstrike", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Airstrike"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blockade", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Blockade"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Court_of_Justice", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "International Court of Justice"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enclave_and_exclave", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Enclave and exclave"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Nations", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "United Nations"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tel_Aviv", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Tel Aviv"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Tel Aviv"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Israel"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Warfare_and_Conflict", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Warfare and Conflict", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Nationalism", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Nationalism", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 85}], "image": "https://cdnuploads.aa.com.tr/uploads/Contents/2024/05/08/thumbs_b_c_ab8f800d88e3735920b376d4dfd3f6ba.jpg?v=231558", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9550032", "eventUri": "eng-9550032", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "date": "-10-07", "textStart": 1846, "textEnd": 1852}], "sentiment": -0.1058823529411764, "wgt": 179, "relevance": 1}

We hope that they will do what they've said to us about what they're going to do in Rafah, which is something of limited scale, scope, size and duration with respect to the crossing down there. It's important right now that we see that operation come to a close soon, and that we get that crossing back open,\" he added.\n\nThe crossing between Gaza and Egypt is one of two that Israel has closed in recent days. Israel closed it on Tuesday after its forces seized the Rafah border crossing.\n\nThe State Department had said the other crossing, Kerem Shalom, which links Israel to southern Gaza, would be opened by Wednesday after it was shuttered following a Hamas rocket attack nearby Sunday.\n\nKirby said the US believes Kerem Shalom is \"technically open,\" but humanitarian aid deliveries have yet to resume through the crucial entry point.\n\n\"We're still trying to get the ground truth on that. That's concerning. We want to see that flow continue right away,\" he added.\n\nIsrael has pounded the Gaza Strip in retaliation for a Hamas-led attack in October, which killed less than 1,200 people.\n\nMore than 34,900 Palestinians have since been killed in Gaza, the vast majority of whom have been women and children. Over 78,500 others have been injured, according to Palestinian health authorities. Thousands remain missing.\n\nSeven months into the Israeli war, vast swathes of Gaza lay in ruins, pushing 85% of the enclave's population into internal displacement amid a crippling blockade of food, clean water and medicine, according to the UN. Most of the displaced have sought refuge in Rafah following earlier Israeli evacuation orders.\n\nIsrael is accused of genocide at the International Court of Justice.\n\nAn interim ruling in January said it is \"plausible\" that Tel Aviv is committing genocide in the coastal enclave, and ordered Tel Aviv to stop such acts and take measures to guarantee that humanitarian assistance is provided to civilians. -", "source": {"uri": "en.haberler.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Haberler.com"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

When asked about her remarks in a press briefing yesterday, US State Department Spokesperson Matthew Miller said 'those comments are absolutely deplorable and senior members of the Israeli government should refrain from making them.'\n\nA member of the Knesset (Israel's parliament) threatened, on Thursday, to use \"imprecise missiles\" in the war on the Gaza Strip in response to a US pause on arms transfer to Tel Aviv, Anadolu Agency reports.\n\n\"The US is not threatening to give us precise missiles. Oh yeah? Well, I got news for the US. We have imprecise missiles, and we have the right to defend ourselves,\" Tally Gotlive, a member of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's Likud Party, told Israeli Channel 7.\n\n\"So, maybe instead of using a precise missile and take down a specific room, or a specific building, I'll use my imprecise missiles, and I'll just destroy ten buildings. That's what I'll do.\"\n\nThe far-right Knesset member claimed that Israel has the right to defend itself, and \"will use what we possess\".\n\nBiden said in an interview on CNN on Wednesday that he had paused arms transfer to Israel over its offensive on Rafah, where some 1.5 million displaced Palestinians have sheltered from Israel's ongoing war on the Gaza Strip.\n\nREAD: Offensive in Rafah will not lead to release of hostages, warns ex-Israel PM\n\n\"I made it clear that if they go into Rafah - they haven't gone in Rafah yet - if they go into Rafah, I'm not supplying the weapons that have been used historically to deal with Rafah, to deal with the cities - that deal with that problem,\" Biden said.\n\nHis decision has triggered a storm of anger inside Israel, with several government officials opening fire on the US President.\n\nBiden acknowledged that US weapons have been used to kill civilians in Gaza.\n\nThe US President added that Israel's actions in Rafah, so far, have yet to cross any \"red lines\" that would prompt him to overhaul his Gaza policy.\n\nIsrael has killed more than 34,900 people and injured 78,500 others in a brutal offensive on the Gaza Strip following a Hamas attack that claimed nearly 1,200 people on 7 October, 2023.\n\nHowever, since then, it has been revealed by Haaretz that helicopters and tanks of the Israeli army had, in fact, killed many of the 1,139 soldiers and civilians claimed by Israel to have been killed by the Palestinian Resistance.\n\nOver seven months into the Israeli war, vast swathes of Gaza lay in ruins, pushing 85 per cent of the enclave's population into internal displacement amid a crippling blockade of food, clean water and medicine, according to the UN.\n\nIsrael stands accused of genocide at the

We are working together to strengthen the mental health of the population,\" WHO Regional Director for Europe Hans Kluge told Anadolu.\n\nEveryone in the world, particularly the youth, has been in lockdown during the COVID-19 pandemic, which has affected the mental health of the people, Kluge said.\n\nHe said anxiety and sleeping problems were a common problem in youth which have to be addressed.\n\n\"The latest data from the EU shows that one out of six people in the EU has some distress, anxiety, and sleeping problems,\" he said, highlighting that in certain countries, even the youngest children spend approximately six hours a day in front of screens.\n\nHe said they are exposed to all kinds of \"unregulated advertising or violence\" or sometimes a picture symbolizing \"a perfect body\" that triggers their anxiety.\n\n\"The youth is anxious about the climate. They know that the world is heating up everywhere. There are wars between Russia and Ukraine, and Israel and Gaza. The people are busy with that. We are living in what I call a 'permacrisis.'

Of course, a very basic need is food. This is very important,\" he said.\n\nThe WHO is trying to do whatever it can, also helping to evacuate children with cancer from Gaza, he added.\n\nHe added that Turkish first lady Emine Erdogan and Turkish Health Minister Fahrettin Koca immediately accepted the request for help in evacuating 20 children with cancer from Gaza.\n\nHe said Belgium and Spain also started to assist in the evacuation of the children.\n\n\"WHO advocates for a cease-fire, not to attack hospitals because this is a big issue. At the same time, all hostages have to be returned and while they are in captivity, they must have to access medical care. The principle of WHO is health for all, we cannot politicize health,\" he added.\n\nIsrael has pounded the Gaza Strip in retaliation for an Oct. 7 attack by the Palestinian group Hamas which killed about 1,200 people.\n\nMore than 34,900 Palestinians have since been killed in Gaza, mostly women and children, and 78,100 others injured, according to Palestinian health authorities.\n\nOver seven months into the Israeli war, vast swathes of Gaza lay in ruins, pushing 85% of the enclave's population into internal displacement amid a crippling blockade of food, clean water and medicine, according to the UN.\n\nIsrael stands accused of genocide at the International Court of Justice.

Now I do understand the concern of many people. Because usually, it takes about 10 years to develop a new vaccine. During the COVID-19 pandemic, after one and a half years, not one but up to four vaccines were developed already,\" he said.\n\nHe added that those vaccines were developed based on a certain platform of technology that was already there.\n\nWarning about the fake news, and anti-vaccination movement, he said he spoke with people who do not want to be vaccinated although they are not anti-vaxxers.\n\n\"They are people who have legitimate concerns. The right information did not reach them,\" he said, adding that people could rely on \"trusted messengers in the community\" who have the trust of the community to explain that vaccines save

Among them were those who had been dreaming of having a baby for 20-30 years.\"\n\n\"Some had started the embryo transfer process, and some had even determined the gender of their babies. The dreams of these people were shattered due to Israeli attacks. Long and painful operations, their efforts, their money went to waste, their lives were ruined,\" he added.\n\nMohammed al-Sharefi, an IVF specialist at the center, stressed families seeking IVF treatment bear a significant financial cost.\n\n\"Being a center where we also perform high-cost embryo transfer operations, in addition to embryo and sperm freezing laboratories, our work is quite delicate and important. In vitro fertilization operations are very costly. Families who cannot have babies naturally have to pay large amounts to realize their dreams.\"\n\nMuna el-Arabi, who had previously had two daughters through IVF, spoke of her shattered dreams of having a son, as Israeli attacks prevented her from undergoing further treatment.\n\n\"My husband and I dreamt of having a son after two daughters,\" she said.\n\n\u00e2\u20ac\"\u00e2\u20ac\"\u00e2\u20ac\"\u00e2\u20ac\"\u00e2\u20ac\"\u00e2\u20ac\"\u00e2\u20ac\"- Incessant bombings\n\nIsrael has pounded the Gaza Strip in retaliation for an Oct. 7 attack by the Palestinian group Hamas which killed about 1,200 people.\n\nMore than 34,900 Palestinians have since been killed in Gaza, mostly women and children, and 78,100 others injured, according to Palestinian health authorities.\n\nOver seven months into the Israeli war, vast swathes of Gaza lay in ruins, pushing 85% of the enclave's population into internal displacement amid a crippling blockade of food, clean water and medicine, according to the UN.\n\nIsrael stands accused of genocide at the International Court of Justice.

We are working together to strengthen the mental health of the population,\" WHO Regional Director for Europe Hans Kluge told Anadolu.\n\nEveryone in the world, particularly the youth, has been in lockdown during the COVID-19 pandemic, which has affected the mental health of the people, Kluge said.\n\nHe said anxiety and sleeping problems were a common problem in youth which have to be addressed.\n\n\"The latest data from the EU shows that one out of six people in the EU has some distress, anxiety, and sleeping problems,\" he said, highlighting that in certain countries, even the youngest children spend approximately six hours a day in front of screens.\n\nHe said they are exposed to all kinds of \"unregulated advertising or violence\" or sometimes a picture symbolizing \"a perfect body\" that triggers their anxiety.\n\n\"The youth is anxious about the climate. They know that the world is heating up everywhere. There are wars between Russia and Ukraine, and Israel and Gaza. The people are busy with that. We are living in what I call a 'permacrisis.' There is a permanent crisis and for people, this impacts the mental status,\" he added.\n\n'Peace, permanent cease-fire in Gaza is the most important medicine'\n\nRegarding the Israeli attacks in Gaza, Kluge said: \"What we need most urgent is peace.\"\n\n\"Peace and a permanent cease-fire is the most important medicine because when there is a war and hospitals are being destroyed, of course, there is a breeding ground for infectious diseases, for mental diseases. Of course, a very basic need is food. This is very important,\" he said.\n\nThe WHO is trying to do whatever it can, also helping to evacuate children with cancer from Gaza, he added.\n\nHe added that Turkish first lady Emine Erdogan and Turkish Health Minister Fahrettin Koca immediately accepted the request for help in evacuating 20 children with cancer from Gaza.\n\nHe said Belgium and Spain also started to assist in the evacuation of the children.\n\n\"WHO advocates for a cease-fire, not to attack hospitals because this is a big issue. At the same time, all hostages have to be returned and while they are in captivity, they must have to access medical care. The principle of WHO is health for all, we cannot politicize health,\" he added.\n\nIsrael has pounded the Gaza Strip in retaliation for an Oct. 7 attack by the Palestinian group Hamas which killed about 1,200 people.\n\nMore than 34,900 Palestinians have since been killed in Gaza, mostly women and children, and 78,100 others injured, according to Palestinian health authorities.\n\nOver seven months into the Israeli war, vast swathes of Gaza lay in ruins, pushing 85% of the enclave's population into internal displacement amid a crippling blockade of food, clean water and medicine, according to the UN.\n\nIsrael stands accused of genocide at the International Court of Justice. An interim ruling in January said it is \"plausible\" that Israel is committing genocide in Gaza and ordered Tel Aviv to stop such acts and take measures to guarantee that humanitarian assistance is provided to civilians in Gaza.\n\nRelations with T\u00fcrkiye\n\nOn the WHO's relations with T\u00fcrkiye, Kluge said T\u00fcrkiye has the largest number of WHO offices in the whole region.\n\n\"We have the country office in Ankara, we have the WHO European Center on Preparedness for Natural Disasters office. We have an office in Gaziantep which is providing a lot of humanitarian assistance to the people in northwestern Syria,\" he said, adding that they have a strong solid collaboration with T\u00fcrkiye.\n\n\"T\u00fcrkiye has a lot of experience. We worked day to day, day and night together when the tragic earthquake happened about a year ago for surveillance and training of health workers...,\" he said.\n\nSpeculations on COVID-19 vaccines\n\nRegarding the COVID-19 vaccines, he reassured all the people that there is a very rigid procedures to certify a certain vaccine which has to undergo strict regulatory procedures looking at the effectiveness, looking at toxicity, and looking at side effects.\n\n\"Whenever WHO is certifying a vaccine, it is to be considered safe and effective. Now I do understand the concern of many people. Because usually, it takes about 10 years to develop a new vaccine. During the COVID-19 pandemic, after one and a half years, not one but up to four vaccines were developed already,\" he said.\n\nHe added that those vaccines were developed based on a certain platform of technology that was already there.\n\nWarning about the fake news, and anti-vaccination movement, he said he spoke with people who do not want to be vaccinated although they are not anti-vaxxers.\n\n\"They are people who have legitimate concerns. The right information did not reach them,\" he said, adding that people could rely on \"trusted messengers in the community\" who have the trust of the community to explain that vaccines save lives.",

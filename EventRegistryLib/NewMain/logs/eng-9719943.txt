(Hong Ki-won/Yonhap via AP)\n\nSeoul, South Korea -- A union representing tens of thousands of workers at Samsung Electronics in South Korea said Wednesday it would extend a three-day strike indefinitely in a bid to force management to negotiate.\n\nThe strike is the biggest labour action in the tech giant's history and steps up pressure on the chipmaker's management, who last week predicted a huge second-quarter operating profit increase.\n\n\"(We) declare a second indefinite general strike from July 10, after learning that the management has no willingness to talk,\" the National Samsung Electronics Union said in a statement.\n\nREAD: South Korea Samsung workers start strike, says union chief\n\nMore than 5,000 members stopped working Monday for what was meant to be a three-day strike, part of a long-running battle over pay and benefits.\n\nThe move follows a one-day walkout in June, the first such collective action at the company, which went decades without unionisation.\n\nThe union has more than 30,000 members -- more than a fifth of the company's total workforce.\n\nSamsung told AFP Wednesday that the strike would not affect production.\n\n\"Samsung Electronics will ensure no disruptions occur in the production lines,\" a spokesperson told AFP.\n\n\"The company remains committed to engaging in good faith negotiations with the union.\"\n\nBut the union said it had confirmed \"clear disruption in production,\" and added that the longer the strike went on \"the more the management will suffer.\"\n\n\"Eventually, they will kneel and come to the negotiation table. We are confident of victory,\" it added in a statement.\n\nREAD: Samsung Electronics forecasts major Q2 profit jump\n\nThe union blamed Samsung management for \"obstructing\" the strike, saying they did not appear willing to engage in dialogue.\n\nIt urged more workers to participate, including \"those who are still hesitant\".\n\n\"Your determination is needed to advance our goals and victory. Let us unite our strength to protect our rights and create a better future.\"\n\nAvoiding unions\n\nThe union has been locked in negotiations with management since January, but the two sides have failed to narrow differences.\n\nWorkers have rejected the offer of a 5.1 percent pay hike, with the union having previously outlined demands including improvements to annual leave and transparent performance-based bonuses.\n\nThe impact of the strike \"depends on various factors, (such as) duration of the strike, accordingly lost days of production and recoup strategy,\" Neil Shah, research vice president at Counterpoint Research told AFP.\n\nHe added that it was also important \"how Samsung management has prepared knowing this could happen and already have simulated the solutions to solve this quickly\".\n\nSamsung Electronics managed to avoid having its employees unionise for almost 50 years -- sometimes adopting ferocious tactics, according to critics -- while rising to become the world's largest smartphone and semiconductor manufacturer.\n\nCompany founder Lee Byung-chul, who died in 1987, was adamantly opposed to unions, saying he would never allow them \"until I have dirt over my eyes\".\n\nThe first effective labour union at Samsung Electronics was formed in 2019.\n\nSoon after, Lee Jae-yong, the founder's grandson and current chairman of Samsung Electronics, declared an end to the firm's no-union principle in 2020.\n\nSamsung's labour policy \"failed to meet the demands of changing times,\" Lee, then Samsung's vice-chairman, said.\n\nThe firm is the flagship subsidiary of South Korean giant Samsung Group, by far the largest of the family-controlled conglomerates that dominate business in Asia's fourth-largest economy.\n\nIt is the world's largest memory chip maker and accounts for a significant chunk of global output of the high-end chips.\n\nSamsung recently predicted a more than 15-fold increase in its on-year second-quarter operating profits, thanks to growing demand for generative AI.", "source": {"uri": "business.inquirer.net", "dataType": "news", "title": "Inquirer"}, "authors": [{"uri":

We are confident of victory,\" it added in a statement, urging more workers to participate.\n\n- 'No impact' -\n\nSamsung Electronics is the world's largest memory chipmaker and accounts for a significant chunk of global output of the high-end chips used in generative AI.\n\nBut as semiconductor factories are highly automated with low demand for actual manpower, it is likely the strike will not have a major impact, Avril Wu, an analyst at Taipei-based research group TrendForce, told AFP.\n\n\"Even if the strike is extended, the current assessment is that there will still be no significant impact,\" Wu said.\n\nThe union has been locked in negotiations with management since January, but the two sides have failed to narrow differences.\n\nThe union's demands, newly released on Wednesday, include a 5.6 percent pay raise for all members, transparent performance-based bonuses, compensation for financial losses incurred due to the strike and a guaranteed day off on the union's founding day.\n\nWhether the strike hits production \"depends on various factors, (such as) duration of the strike, accordingly lost days of production and recoup strategy\", said Neil Shah, research vice president at Counterpoint Research.\n\nHe added that it was also important \"how Samsung management has prepared knowing this could happen and already have simulated the solutions to solve this quickly\".\n\nSamsung Electronics managed to avoid having its employees unionise for almost 50 years -- sometimes adopting ferocious tactics, according to critics -- while rising to become the world's largest smartphone and semiconductor manufacturer.\n\nCompany founder Lee Byung-chul, who died in 1987, was adamantly opposed to unions, saying he would never allow them \"until I have dirt over my eyes\".\n\nThe first effective labour union at Samsung Electronics was formed in 2019.\n\nSoon after, Lee Jae-yong, the founder's grandson and current chairman of Samsung Electronics, declared an end to the firm's no-union principle in 2020.\n\nSamsung's labour policy \"failed to meet the demands of changing times\", Lee, then Samsung's vice-chairman, said.\n\nThe firm is the flagship subsidiary of South Korean giant Samsung Group, by far the largest of the family-controlled conglomerates that dominate business in Asia's fourth-largest economy.\n\nSamsung recently predicted a more than 15-fold increase in its on-year second-quarter operating profits, thanks to growing demand for generative AI.", "source": {"uri": "urdupoint.com", "dataType": "news", "title":

Samsung will have other things on its mind today than the Unpacked event. An issue over better pay and benefits has led to the Samsung Electronics division's largest union declaring an indefinite strike, extending what was supposed to be three days of industrial action.\n\nIt was reported in May that Samsung Electronics was facing something it had never dealt with during the company's 55-year history: a worker strike. Representatives from the National Samsung Electronics Union (NSEU), which has more than 30,000 members, called for the action after talks over wage increases broke down.\n\nA three-day general strike began on Monday (July 8), with thousands of workers protesting outside of Samsung's chipmaking facilities south of Seoul. Wednesday was supposed to be the last day, but the union said management had shown no intention of holding talks over its demands. As such, the union has declared a second strike that starts today and will last \"indefinitely.\"\n\nThe NSEU said around 6,500 workers have taken part in the strike so far. It is calling for more of its members to join in the action.\n\n\"Management has no intention of dialogue,\" the union said in a statement on its website. \"We have clearly identified line production disruptions and the company will regret this decision.\"\n\nTo try and attract more participants, the union said it will hold advertising campaigns at cafeterias inside chipmaking plants producing 8-inch wafers and high bandwidth memory (HBM) chips, which are in high demand due to the AI boom.\n\nThe union had demanded a 6.5% pay rise, an additional day of annual leave, and a bonus linked to the company's earnings. It has since revised those demands to a 3.5% increase in base salary and, instead of the extra day's annual leave, a day off to mark the union's founding. It also wants the rank-and-file workers and executives to have an equal bonus system.\n\nUnion vice-president Lee Hyun-kuk told Reuters that management had offered a 3% pay rise, adding, \"We haven't spoken to management since we started the strike on Monday.\"\n\nAny disruption to Samsung Electronics' production comes at a bad time for the South Korean giant. AI-related demand has seen Samsung estimate that its Q2 operating profits will jump 1,452% compared to a year ago. The company is also revealing the new Galaxy Z Fold 6 and Z Flip 6 foldable devices, along with several other new products, today.", "source": {"uri": "techspot.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "TechSpot"}, "authors": [{"uri": "rob_thubron@techspot.com", "name": "Rob Thubron", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Samsung_Electronics", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Samsung Electronics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strike_action", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Strike action"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/High_Bandwidth_Memory", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "High Bandwidth Memory"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Samsung", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Samsung"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seoul", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Seoul"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Seoul"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "South Korea"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wafer_(electronics)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Wafer (electronics)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advertising_campaign", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Advertising campaign"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Samsung_Galaxy", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Samsung Galaxy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Artificial intelligence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reuters", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Reuters"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Korea", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "South Korea"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "South Korea"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Business", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Business", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Work/Labor_Movement", "label": "dmoz/Society/Work/Labor Movement", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Opportunities/Opposing_Views", "label": "dmoz/Business/Opportunities/Opposing Views", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Labor", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Labor", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Technology", "label": "news/Technology", "wgt": 76}], "image": "https://www.techspot.com/images2/news/bigimage/2019/11/2019-11-11-image.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9719943", "eventUri": "eng-9719943", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-07-08", "textStart": 756, "textEnd": 762}], "sentiment": -0.01960784313725494, "wgt": 189, "relevance": 1}

(Yonhap)\n\nSamsung Electronics' largest labor union announced Wednesday an indefinite extension of their ongoing strike, claiming that their collective actions could cause potential disruptions in production at one of the world's leading chip manufacturing sites.\n\nThe announcement followed a three-day strike, which ended without any engagement from management.\n\n\"We declare a second round of strikes for an indefinite period as we have confirmed that management doesn't have the will to talk with us after the first round,\" the National Samsung Electronics Union said in a statement Wednesday.\n\nThe union demanded a pay raise and bonus by staging its first-ever strike on Monday for three days. It initially planned to hold a second round on July 15 but decided to go on an indefinite strike.\n\nThe union claimed that over 6,000 members have expressed willingness to participate in the strike. Of the total, more than 5,000 members will come from the critical semiconductor division, it added.\n\nSeveral rounds of talks since January have failed to resolve differences as the union demanded a one-day vacation for all employees and significant salary raises for the 855 members who did not sign the 2024 salary negotiation agreement. They also demand more paid leave, a day-off for all employees and compensation for economic losses incurred during unpaid strikes.\n\nThe union claims to represent 31,000 members or approximately 24 percent of Samsung Electronics' total workforce of about 125,000. Their collective actions would inevitably cause production disruptions, they said, adding that semiconductor factories, though operated by automated systems, require manpower for equipment and quality inspection.\n\n\"We confirmed that production of chips was disrupted during the first round of strikes, and the management will regret this.\"\n\nSamsung, meanwhile, denied the union's threat of production disruptions and said that production lines are operating normally. The company has prepared to prevent production disruptions due to the strike, it added.\n\nShin Se-don, an honorary professor of economics at Sookmyung Women's University, said the strike's impact is likely minimal, noting that the management seems to be in no rush to resolve the dispute. He, however, predicts the dispute will ultimately end in a compromise.\n\n\"The management (seems to) believe that if it responds to the union's demands easily, it could set a precedent for similar actions in the future. But I think both sides will reach a compromise soon.\"\n\nBut the case highlights emerging challenges for Samsung Electronics as the world's largest memory chip maker faces labor struggles that it has not experienced for more than 50 years, according to Hwang Yong-sik, a professor from Sejong University College of Business and Economics. Such an action could potentially impact its corporate culture that values hierarchy and top-down leadership, he added.\n\n\"Because Samsung traditionally has been a non-union company and a leading global corporation in South Korea at the same time, this case makes a significant challenge,\" he said.\n\n\"As the actions are taking place amid intense global competition in the semiconductor, electronics, and mobile markets, this strike poses a definite risk to Samsung Electronics' organizational culture and global competitiveness.\"", "source": {"uri": "koreaherald.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Korea Herald"}, "authors": [{"uri": "lee_jaeeun@koreaherald.com", "name": "Lee Jaeeun", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Samsung_Electronics", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Samsung Electronics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strike_action", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Strike action"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yonhap_News_Agency", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Yonhap News Agency"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Semiconductor", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Semiconductor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trade_union", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Trade union"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hwaseong,_Gyeonggi", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Hwaseong, Gyeonggi"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Hwaseong, Gyeonggi"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "South Korea"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seoul", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Seoul"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Seoul"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "South Korea"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sookmyung_Women's_University", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Sookmyung Women's University"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sejong_University", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Sejong University"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Semiconductor_memory", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Semiconductor memory"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electronics", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Electronics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economics", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Economics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Corporation", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Corporation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Korea", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "South Korea"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "South Korea"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Work", "label": "dmoz/Society/Work", "wgt": 20}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Work/Labor_Movement", "label": "dmoz/Society/Work/Labor Movement", "wgt": 23}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Electronics_and_Electrical/Components", "label": "dmoz/Business/Electronics and Electrical/Components", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Electronics_and_Electrical/Wholesale_and_Distribution", "label": "dmoz/Business/Electronics and Electrical/Wholesale and Distribution", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Work/Labor-Management_Relations", "label": "dmoz/Society/Work/Labor-Management Relations", "wgt": 21}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 72}], "image": "https://res.heraldm.com/content/image/2024/07/10/20240710050567_0.jpg?1", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9719943", "eventUri": "eng-9719943", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-07-15", "textStart": 894, "textEnd": 901}], "sentiment": -0.207843137254902, "wgt": 186, "relevance": 1}

The union held training sessions on Tuesday and Wednesday.\n\nThe officials also said a former union leader at Hyundai Motor, an auto giant with 60 per cent of workers in South Korea unionized, was sharing history and experience of their strikes.\n\nHyundai and its South Korean union reached a tentative wage deal this week, potentially avoiding a strike.\n\nAnalysts said it would be difficult to verify whether the strike has disrupted Samsung's production unless the union provides details of wafers and processes impacted.\n\nThe union said it has revised demands to include a 3.5 per cent increase in base salary and, instead of an extra day's annual leave, a day off to mark the union's founding. Lee said the management previously offered a 3 per cent rise in base salary but the union wants more to better reflect inflation.\n\nIt also wants equality in the bonus system between rank-and-file workers and executives.\n\nLee Kyungmook, a business professor at Seoul National University, said the union's strike might not get broad support among workers because there's little incentive left for them as any disruption would directly impact their wages.\n\n\"If their company can't make money because production lines aren't operating, the amount of bonus will be significantly cut. Then the strike won't be able to gain momentum,\" Lee said.", "source": {"uri": "theglobeandmail.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Globe and Mail"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Samsung_Electronics", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Samsung Electronics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strike_action", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Strike action"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Korea", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "South Korea"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "South Korea"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_National_(Abu_Dhabi)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "The National (Abu Dhabi)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Semiconductor", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Semiconductor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Samsung", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Samsung"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Artificial intelligence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/High_Bandwidth_Memory", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "High Bandwidth Memory"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/KOSPI", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "KOSPI"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyundai_Motor_Company", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Hyundai Motor Company"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wafer_(electronics)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Wafer (electronics)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vice_President_of_the_United_States", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Vice President of the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advertising", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Advertising"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/YouTube", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "YouTube"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seoul_National_University", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Seoul National University"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trade_union", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Trade union"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inflation", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Inflation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reuters", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Reuters"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Business", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Business", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Work/Labor_Movement", "label": "dmoz/Society/Work/Labor Movement", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Opportunities/Opposing_Views", "label": "dmoz/Business/Opportunities/Opposing Views", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Labor", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Labor", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Work/Labor-Management_Relations", "label": "dmoz/Society/Work/Labor-Management Relations", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Technology", "label": "news/Technology", "wgt": 71}], "image": "https://www.theglobeandmail.com/resizer/v2/WGNSUKREGZEIXBBYFRPWFSYDAY.jpg?auth=1f83019a8a2baa8212b0f9acc09dd7a601e64170c6acf53ed1f1f820442297df&width=560&quality=80", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9719943", "eventUri": "eng-9719943", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.003921568627450966, "wgt": 185, "relevance": 1}

A historic shortage of computer chips during the Covid pandemic was followed by falling demand last year as consumer appetite for electronics remained weak because of global economic uncertainty.\n\nBut things are looking up for the company because of the AI boom.\n\nIt is hopeful about a resurgence in demand for mobile devices this year, particularly with the rollout of new products, such as AI-powered smartphones. Samsung Electronics said last week that it estimates a more than 15-fold rise in its second-quarter operating profit, as compared to the same time previous year.\n\nThe workers want this optimism reflected in their pay. \"The company is not treating the employees properly,\" said Woomok on Monday.\n\n\"Even though the operating profit is high, the company has been saying it's in a crisis situation for over 10 years, and employees are increasingly dissatisfied with the lack of performance bonus increases,\" he added.\n\nThe-CNN-Wire\n\n\u2122 & \u00a9 2024 Cable News Network, Inc., a Warner Bros.

The decision was made in the face of intransigence by Samsung management, who according to the NSEU showed no indication that they were prepared to even hold talks.\n\nAbout 20% of NSEU members went on strike on Monday, demanding better pay and holiday allowances. It was the latest in a recent line of stoppages. Unions rules and expectatons in South Korea are different to those in the UK, and the strike wasn't mandatory. Nonetheless, the number of workers choosing to strike was higher than the union or Samsung expected.\n\n\"We are doing this out of desperation that it can't be done if not now,\" said NSEU leader Son Woo-mok at a rally outside Samsung's headquarters earlier this week. \"We will continue to struggle until the company changes.\"\n\nThe NSEU represents around a quarter of Samsung workers overall and said that despite that fact that all of the, did not strike, it had disrupted production - a claim that Samsung disputed:\n\n\"Samsung Electronics will ensure no disruptions occur in the production lines. The company remains committed to engaging in good faith negotiations with the union,\" the firm told BBC News.\n\nThe standoff comes after Samsung reported some very strong second quarter financial results last week. The company posted a more than 15-fold increase to Won10.4tn ($7.5bn) in April to June operating profit, fuelled by strong demand for high-end D-RAM chips used in AI chipsets as well as storage chips.\n\nAlthough Samsung shares received a boost on its Q2 results, investors remain uneasy about its position in comparison to other AI chip manufacturers such as SK Hynix and Nvidia.\n\nSamsung doesn't have the best reputation for harmonious industrial relations. The company only agreed to recognise unions in 2020, and union membership has been ticking up ever since.

However, while DRAM, flash memory, and other chips are ranking in the money, thousands of workers are going on an indefinite strike and independent research predicts that its worldwide market share in chip manufacturing will tumble from 31% to just 9% by 2032.\n\nIt's fair to say that Samsung Electronics, the chip manufacturing and electronics division of the Samsung Group, is going through some mixed fortunes of late. AI's insatiable appetite for high-end RAM and flash memory chips has pushed prices by as much as 20% in the second quarter of the financial year (via Reuters).\n\nAlthough that growth has subsided, it still resulted in Samsung predicting a 23% increase in revenue and a staggering 1470% rise in operating profits compared to a year ago. That colossal gain in profits is mostly down to Samsung cancelling a writedown of its older chip inventory, as demand for those has suddenly increased, raising their value considerably.\n\nBut while the money is clearly rolling in on the back of the AI boom, all is not well at Samsung. The NSEU (National Samsung Electronics Union) has just concluded a three day strike (as reported by the BBC), demanding better pay and benefits, but it's already called for another strike to start today -- except this one is to be indefinite.\n\nWith approximately 30,000 members in the union, it would only require a small percentage of them to go on strike to have a noticeable impact on Samsung's productivity, though the company has told the BBC that \"no disruptions [will] occur in the production lines.\"\n\nAt a conference discussing South Korea's national strategy for semiconductors (via X-user Harukaze5719), Samsung's vice president of global research, Ian Jae, bemoaned the lack of government support for chip manufacturing, compared to that implemented by the United States, Japan, and the EU.\n\nCiting examples such as financial incentives, subsidies, and even the harshness of penalties for people breaking laws on technology leaks, Jae also drew attention to some independent research on how the global production share of high-end chips (i.e. sub-10 nm) will change in the coming years.\n\nBy 2032, Jae claimed that the US will have 28% of the share, the EU and Japan will have 6% and 5% respectively, and Korea will drop from its current 31% market share to just 9%. If you're wondering where the other half is, that's almost certainly going to be TMSC, in Taiwan.\n\nIts chip foundries are currently second only to TSMC but while Samsung Electronics's so-called DS segment is its second biggest source of revenue, its operating profits have been somewhat dire of late.\n\nEven the recent boost in fortunes is unlikely to calm nerves, as Samsung's HMB (High Memory Bandwidth) RAM chips have reportedly failed to meet Nvidia's requirements to be used in its Blackwell AI processors and there's no concrete indication that any of the major fabless companies (AMD, Nvidia, and Qualcomm) are looking to use Samsung foundries to manufacture their top-end chips.\n\nEven if Samsung gets the government support it wants and manages to allay the concerns of its workers' union, the drive to transfer as much of the supply chain from Asia to the US and Europe as possible means that it's highly unlikely to maintain its 30% share of the chip industry. But Samsung is clearly going to do everything in its power to still be the second-largest chip manufacturer by the end of the decade.", "source": {"uri": "pcgamer.com", "dataType": "news", "title":

Newsis\n\nBy Park Jae-hyuk\n\nAround 60,000 members of the Korean Metal Workers' Union (KMWU) under the Korean Confederation of Trade Unions (KCTU) went on an eight-hour strike, Wednesday, causing setbacks in the production of cars, ships and steel products at manufacturing plants across the country.\n\nThe collective action was a protest against the Yoon Suk Yeol administration's business-friendly policies, with a central goal of supporting the passage of a revision bill to the labor-friendly Trade Union and Labor Relations Adjustment Act. Dubbed the \"yellow envelope bill\" and led by the main opposition Democratic Party of Korea, the bill seeks to make it illegal for management to demand compensation from workers for damages incurred from illegal strikes.\n\n\"We will not give up protecting the basic human rights of all workers, including those who are subcontracted, indirectly employed and migrants,\" the KMWU said in a statement. \"Unless the management and the government change their minds, we will go on the second and third rounds of general strikes.\"\n\nThe Hyundai Motor union, which is the largest organization under the KMWU, did not join the general strike, as the carmaker's labor and management reached a tentative agreement on wages and other welfare benefits earlier this week.\n\nHowever, unionized workers at Hyundai Motor's subcontractors joined the strike, leading to a suspension of the carmaker's production lines in Ulsan due to a disrupted supply of automotive components. Additionally, leaders from the Hyundai Motor union attended the KMWU's massive rally in Seoul, Wednesday.\n\nKia, the sister company of Hyundai Motor, suffered a setback in car production at its Gwangju factory, as subcontracted workers joined the general strike.\n\nUnionized workers at GM Korea, who stopped working since Monday, also joined the KMWU's collective action. They plan to continue their strike until Thursday.\n\nHanwha Ocean's union, which secured the legal right to strike, left the company's shipyard, Wednesday.\n\nUnionized workers at HD Hyundai Heavy Industries supported the KMWU's protest, although they have yet to secure the legal right to strike. They plan to vote on a plan for their collective action between July 22 and 24.\n\nIn the steelmaking sector, unionized workers at Hyundai Steel's Dangjin plant in South Chungcheong Province joined the strike.\n\nBusiness groups urged the government to take stern measures against the KMWU's action, which they view is politically motivated and unrelated to wages or other labor issues.\n\n\"The KMWU's strike is an illegal political strike aimed at law revisions and the impeachment of the president,\" the Korea Enterprises Federation said in a statement, Tuesday. \"Businesspeople are seriously worried about the KMWU's repeated illegal strikes, which undermine the rule of law.\"\n\nRead MoreHD Hyundai, Hanwha, Samsung face intensifying disputes with shipyard workersCompanies to face stricter regulations after opposition bloc's landslide win\n\nOn the day of the KMWU's strike, the National Samsung Electronics Union (NSEU), which is the largest among the tech firm's multiple unions, declared an \"indefinite general strike,\" as its three-day strike came to an end.\n\nThe NSEU initially planned to start staging another five-day strike on July 15, but the union changed its plan, citing management's refusal to communicate.\n\nAlthough the NSEU is currently part of the Federation of Korean Trade Unions (FKTU), the KMWU has supported the first-ever strike at Samsung Electronics in an apparent effort to attract the conglomerate's union to the KCTU, which is known for being more militant than the FKTU.", "source": {"uri": "koreatimes.co.kr", "dataType": "news",

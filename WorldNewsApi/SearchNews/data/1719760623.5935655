{"id": 225008568, "title": "S&amp;P raises India outlook to positive from stable, retains sovereign ratings at BBB-", "text": "Continued policy stability, deepening economic reforms and high infrastructure investment will sustain long-term growth prospects for India, S&P Global Ratings said on Wednesday as it revised up its outlook for India to \u2018positive\u2019 from \u2018stable\u2019, while retaining 'BBB-/A-3' sovereign credit ratings. S&P said it may raise the ratings if India's fiscal deficits narrow meaningfully such that the net change in general government debt falls below 7 per cent of GDP on a structural basis. India's weak fiscal settings had always been the most vulnerable part of its sovereign ratings profile, S&P said, adding that with economic recovery now well on track, the government is again able to depict a more concrete, albeit gradual, path to fiscal consolidation. \u201cThe protracted rise in public investment in infrastructure will lift economic growth dynamism that, combined with fiscal adjustments, could alleviate India's weak public finances,\u201d it said. S&P projects the general government deficit, which includes fiscal deficits of states and Centre, to slowly decline to 6.8 per cent by financial year 2027-28 from 7.9 per cent of the GDP in 2024-2025. India\u2019s ratings could also improve if there is a sustained and substantial improvement in the central bank's monetary policy effectiveness and credibility, such that inflation is managed at a durably lower rate over time, it said. Regardless of the outcome of Lok Sabha elections, S&P expects broad continuity in economic reforms and fiscal policies. \u201cIndia's robust economic expansion is having a constructive impact on its credit metrics. We expect sound economic fundamentals to underpin the growth momentum over the next two to three years,\u201d it said. An increasing share of the government spending is going to infrastructure and this will ease bottlenecks to put the country on a higher growth trajectory, it said. It cautioned about persistent elevated fiscal deficits, a large debt stock and interest burden, but noted that the government is prioritising ongoing consolidation efforts. S&P said the Indian economy has staged a remarkable comeback from the COVID-19 pandemic, with real GDP growth estimated to have averaged 8.1 per cent annually in the past three years, the highest in the Asia-Pacific region. In the medium term, the growth dynamics are expected to continue to play out, with GDP expanding close to 7.0 per cent annually over the next three years. This is likely to have a moderating effect on the government debt-to-GDP ratio despite still-wide fiscal deficits, it said. \u201cModi administration has increasingly shifted budget allocation to infrastructure spending. Capital expenditure is scheduled to increase to Rs 11 trillion, or about 3.4 per cent of GDP in the financial year 2024- 2025. This is almost 4.5x from a decade before. We believe the improvements in infrastructure and connectivity in India will remove chokepoints, which are hindering long-term economic growth,\u201d it said. Continued policy stability, deepening economic reforms, and high infrastructure investment will sustain long-term growth prospects. In addition, \u201ccautious fiscal and monetary policy that diminishes the government's elevated debt and interest burden while bolstering economic resilience, could lead to a higher rating over the next 24 months\u201d, it said. S&P, however, cautioned that there could be a downside revision to India's outlook to stable if there is an erosion of political commitment to maintain sustainable public finances, which signifies a weakening of the country's institutional capacity. \u201cIf current account deficits widen materially to weaken India's external position such that the country becomes a narrow net external debtor, we could also revise the outlook to stable,\u201d it added.", "summary": "", "url": "https://indianexpress.com/article/business/sp-india-outlook-positive-sovereign-ratings-9359452/", "image": "https://images.indianexpress.com/2024/05/Untitled-2024-05-29T175042.310.jpeg", "video": null, "publish_date": "2024-05-29 12:22:21", "author": "Aanchal Magazine", "authors": ["Aanchal Magazine"], "language": "en", "source_country": "in", "sentiment": 0.079}

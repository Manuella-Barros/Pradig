With the loss of Will Harris to the New Orleans Saints this week, that has prompted questions about compensatory draft picks in 2025.\n\nEssentially, compensatory draft picks are awarded based on losses in the previous year's free agency. They can be offset by what a team gained in free agency, and the league has layered in an element attached to losing a minority hire to a coaching or general manager position with another team to award compensatory picks. If/when defensive coordinator Aaron Glenn gets a head coaching job, or assistant general manager Ray Agnew gets a general manager job elsewhere, the Lions will receive compensatory picks for losing them.\n\nThe last time the Lions had compensatory draft picks was in 2022, and they took safety Kerby Joseph, tight end James Mitchell and edge rusher James Houston with those picks. They were shut out of the compensatory pick formula in 2023 and this year.\n\nBased on what we've seen, losing Harris wasn't likely to impact the Lions in the compensatory pick formula for 2025. But being that he signed on May 1, the ship has sailed on that anyway.\n\nOver The Cap does a nice job projecting compensatory draft picks, and NFL.com recently came out with a piece outline compensatory picks for 2025.\n\nUsing Over The Cap'schart, here's how the Lions came out.\n\nQualifying free agents lost: OG Jonah Jackson, DB C.J Gardner-Johnson, WR Josh Reynolds\n\nQualifying free agents gained: EDGE Marcus Davenport, DT DJ Reader, OG Kevin Zeitler, CB Amik Robertson\n\nAs seen, gaining four and losing three qualifying free agents means the Lions won't get any compensatory picks in the 2025 draft. That's the back-end cost of signing notable players. Getting three compensatory picks in 2022 was a direct reflection of not doing much in the first year of free agency under a new regime in 2021.\n\nWhile it might be nice to have an extra draft pick or two, not having any in three straight drafts (barring losing Glenn and/or Agnew before next April) is as much a reflection of the Lions becoming a good team as anything else is.", "source": {"uri": "sidelionreport.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "SideLion Report"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Draft_(sports)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Draft (sports)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_manager", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "General manager"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_agent", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Free agent"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Will_Harris_(baseball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Will Harris (baseball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Detroit_Lions", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Detroit Lions"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Orleans_Saints", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "New Orleans Saints"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kerby_Joseph", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Kerby Joseph"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guard_(gridiron_football)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Guard (gridiron football)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ray_Agnew", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Ray Agnew"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aaron_Glenn", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Aaron Glenn"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Defensive_coordinator", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Defensive coordinator"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Houston", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Houston"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Houston"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amik_Robertson", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Amik Robertson"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Defensive_tackle", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Defensive tackle"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Josh_Reynolds_(American_football)", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Josh Reynolds (American football)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kevin_Zeitler", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Kevin Zeitler"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marcus_Davenport", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Marcus Davenport"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spiro_Agnew", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Spiro Agnew"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Defensive_back", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Defensive back"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wide_receiver", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Wide receiver"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cornerback", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Cornerback"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jackson,_Mississippi", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Jackson, Mississippi"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Jackson, Mississippi"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Professional", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Professional", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Cheerleading", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Cheerleading", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Pets/Free_Services", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Pets/Free Services", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Coaching", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Coaching", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 97}], "image": "https://images2.minutemediacdn.com/image/upload/c_crop,w_2000,h_1125,x_0,y_394/c_fill,w_1440,ar_16:9,f_auto,q_auto,g_auto/images/GettyImages/mmsport/53/01hx1z5qmgwhb99pd3ne.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9543812", "eventUri": "eng-9543812", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-05-01", "textStart": 1277, "textEnd": 1282}], "sentiment": 0.1137254901960785, "wgt": 211, "relevance": 1}

Las Vegas is projected to receive compensatory picks in the draft next season. The league considers many factors when determining the amount of compensatory picks teams will get each season.\n\nNFL Draft analyst Lance Zierlein explained the process in a recent NFL.com article where he projected every team's 2025 compensatory draft picks.\n\n\"The number of compensatory picks allotted each year is limited to the number of teams in the league (32), per the collective bargaining agreement,\" Zierlein said. \"However, compensatory picks are not divided up equally among the teams, and no team can receive more than four compensatory picks in a single year. To qualify for compensatory picks, teams must end up with more qualifying free agents lost than gained in a particular year.\"\n\nThe good news for the Raiders is the picks fall in rounds they have had much more success at drafting players in -- the third through seventh rounds of the draft.\n\n\"Teams are awarded compensatory draft picks between Rounds 3 and 7 of the draft based upon a league formula that takes into account a player's average salary per year (APY), snap count, and postseason awards,\" Zierlein said. \"While there is an expected level of compensation for a player based on the amount he has signed for, his playing time (or lack thereof) in the upcoming season could alter the expectation.\"\n\nZierlein projects the Raiders to receive two compensatory draft picks in next year's draft based on the additions and subtractions the Raiders have made this offseason. The Raiders could use as many picks as possible next season as they would be entering Year 2 under General Manager Tom Telesco and Coach Antonio Pierce.\n\nBased on his history elsewhere and the draft the Raiders recently had, Telesco has shown he can find serviceable additions in the later rounds of the draft. The compensatory picks could eventually pan out well for the Raiders.\n\n\"The losses of [Josh] Jacobs and [Bilal] Nichols end up being canceled out by the additions of [Christian] Wilkins and [Gardner] Minshew as qualifying free agents, while [Harrison] Bryant's contract cancels the loss of [Austin] Hooper,\" Zierlein said. \"That figures to leave the Raiders with two sixth-round selections based on the compensatory pick formula.\"\n\nEnsure you follow on X (Twitter) @HondoCarpenter and IG @HondoSr and never miss another breaking news story again.\n\nPlease let us know your thoughts when you like our Facebook page WHEN YOU CLICK RIGHT HERE.", "source": {"uri": "si.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Sports Illustrated"}, "authors": [{"uri": "ezekiel_trezevant_iv@si.com", "name": "Ezekiel Trezevant Iv", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Draft_(sports)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Draft (sports)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Las_Vegas_Raiders", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Las Vegas Raiders"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lance_Zierlein", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Lance Zierlein"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Collective_bargaining", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Collective bargaining"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Las_Vegas", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Las Vegas"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Las Vegas"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tom_Telesco", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Tom Telesco"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Major_League_Baseball_postseason", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Major League Baseball postseason"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_agent", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Free agent"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antonio_Pierce", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Antonio Pierce"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_manager", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "General manager"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christianity", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Christianity"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Instagram", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Instagram"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Facebook", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Facebook"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twitter", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Twitter"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Austin,_Texas", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Austin, Texas"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Austin, Texas"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Football/American", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Football/American", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Professional", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Professional", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Theme_Merchandise", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Theme Merchandise", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 54}], "image": "https://images2.minutemediacdn.com/image/upload/c_crop,w_8001,h_4500,x_0,y_0/images/ImagnImages/mmsport/si-temp/01hx5c20xh353r7ews3h", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9543812", "eventUri": "eng-9543812", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.2078431372549019, "wgt": 200, "relevance": 1}

The compensatory picks are given to help balance out the difference and can range from picks in the third round to the seventh round.\n\nWith that in mind, Lance Zierlein of NFL.com has attempted to predict how many compensatory picks each team will have next year, something that won't be official until the conclusion of the coming season, and Chargers fans will be happy with his thoughts.\n\nHe has the Chargers receiving three compensatory draft picks, one in the fifth round and two in the sixth.\n\nThe Chargers lost Austin Ekeler, Kenneth Murray, Gerald Everett, Austin Johnson and Michael Davis to free agency while signing cornerback Kristian Fulton and running back Gus Edwards.\n\nThough these would all be Day 3 picks in the 2025 NFL Draft, Chargers fans should be confident in a front office that just put together a spectacular draft class.\n\nThe team found Justin Eboigbe, Tarheeb Still, Cam Hart, Kimani Vidal, Brenden Rice and Cornelius Johnson with their Day 3 picks in this year's draft.", "source": {"uri": "sportingnews.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Sporting News"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_agent", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Free agent"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los_Angeles_Chargers", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles Chargers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Draft_(sports)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Draft (sports)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NFL_playoffs", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "NFL playoffs"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Davis_(defensive_back)", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Michael Davis (defensive back)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kenneth_Murray_(American_football)", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Kenneth Murray (American football)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Austin_Johnson_(defensive_lineman)", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Austin Johnson (defensive lineman)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rice_Owls_football", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Rice Owls football"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lance_Zierlein", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Lance Zierlein"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gerald_Everett", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Gerald Everett"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Austin_Ekeler", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Austin Ekeler"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cornerback", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Cornerback"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Paintball/Teams", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Paintball/Teams", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Robotics/Competitions", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Robotics/Competitions", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Airsoft/Teams", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Airsoft/Teams", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Paintball/Scenario", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Paintball/Scenario", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Theme_Merchandise", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Theme Merchandise", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 82}], "image": "https://ng-sportingnews.com/s3/files/styles/twitter_card_120x120/s3/2024-05/harbaugh.jpg?itok=8JOJonzT", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9543812", "eventUri": "eng-9543812", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.2549019607843137, "wgt": 194, "relevance": 1}

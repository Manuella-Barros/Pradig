Obviously, it's a little disappointing, especially for America, because we wanted to do it, we wanted to bring it home, we knew we had the speed to do it,\" Coleman told reporters. \"It just didn't happen, but we're human beings too.

They haven't medaled in the 4x100 relay since taking silver at the 2004 Athens Games. The team's last gold medal was at the 2000 Sydney Olympics.\n\nU.S. track star Noah Lyles, who won gold in the 100-meter dash and then contracted COVID-19 on Tuesday, did not take part in the men's relay final because of his illness. But with a stable of other capable sprinters, the U.S. shouldn't have needed Lyles to medal if the handoffs were clean.\n\n\"All of us are world class, and I expect all of us will be back on the team

The exchange was late and Bednarek had to nearly stop completely to accept the baton. By the time he received it, the U.S. team was out of position.\n\nThe team was later disqualified for running out of the zone because Coleman passed the baton outside of the handoff zone.\n\n\"Obviously we all are going to be hard on ourselves. And track and field is an individual sport so we do our own thing in sprinting. So when we come together as a team, that's the fun part of it. Obviously, it's a little disappointing, especially for America, because we wanted to do it, we wanted to bring it home, we knew we had the speed to do it,\" Coleman told reporters. \"It just didn't happen, but we're human beings too. We've been through ups and downs in life. This is another one of those times where we've got to just keep our heads down and keep pushing.\"\n\nMore: Sha'Carri Richardson, Gabby Thomas steer U.S. women to gold medal in 4x100 relay\n\nRegardless of the runners making up the U.S. men's team, it has notoriously struggled with baton exchanges at the Olympics. They haven't medaled in the 4x100 relay since taking silver at the 2004 Athens Games. The team's last gold medal was at the 2000 Sydney Olympics.\n\nU.S. track star Noah Lyles, who won gold in the 100-meter dash and then contracted COVID-19 on Tuesday, did not take part in the men's relay final because of his illness. But with a stable of other capable sprinters, the U.S. shouldn't have needed Lyles to medal if the handoffs were clean.\n\n\"All of us are world class, and I expect all of us will be back on the team in LA,\" Coleman said. \"I think on home soil, we'll be able to have the confidence to bring it on home.\"\n\nFollow USA TODAY Sports' Tyler Dragon on X @TheTylerDragon.\n\nThis article originally

America's bad luck in the men's 4\u00d7100 relay continues.\n\nA bad exchange between lead-off Christian Coleman and Kenny Bednarek doomed any chance they had of a medal, marking the fifth consecutive Olympics in which the U.S. missed the podium. Coleman collided with the back of Bednarek during their exchange. As a result, Bednarek, the silver medalist in the 200 on Thursday, took off from a complete stop.\n\nCanada, with a fast final leg from Andre De Grasse, took the gold. South Africa the silver. Great Britain the bronze.\n\nKyree King, the U.S. third leg, did his best to close the gap after the baton miscue. And 100-meter silver medalist Fred Kerley had a blistering 8.79-second anchor leg. But that only got the U.S. to seventh place. That's how far behind that first exchange put them.\n\nIt didn't matter anyway. After review, the United States was disqualified, as the Coleman-Bednarek exchange occurred outside the exchange zone.\n\nAmerica has not won an Olympic medal in the men's 4\u00d7100 relay since 2004, when Shawn Crawford, Justin Gatlin, Coby Miller and Maurice Greene won silver in Athens. Despite having the deepest well of talent, despite Jamaica being out, the Olympic struggles continued.\n\nThey arguably began with Noah Lyles getting COVID-19. He was the anchor leg in the 2023 World Championships, when Lyles, Kerley, Coleman and Brandon Carnes beat Italy and Jamaica. And with America's success in the 100 and 200 meters, winning two medals in each, they felt like a lock for the podium.\n\nBut with the United States in the men's 4\u00d7100 relay, things haven't gone right in 20 years.

But that didn't matter as a pass between Coleman and Bednarek was delayed when Bednarek appeared to leave early. The team was seventh across the finish line, was never a threat to challenge for a medal and was subsequently disqualified for the pass-zone violation.\n\nCanada, South Africa and Great Britain won the gold, silver and bronze, respectively.\n\nIt was a repeat of dubious recent history for the United States, which was kept out of medal contention thanks to foiled baton passes in 2008, 2016 and 2020.\n\nLyles failed in his attempt to complete the sprint double in the men's 100- and 200-meter races, sliding to bronze in the 200 Thursday and struggling to leave the stadium before saying he'd tested positive for COVID-19 on Tuesday.\n\nThe U.S. had a dynasty of sorts in the event from 1964 to 2000, winning seven golds and earning a silver in 1996.

Canada won a surprise gold in 37.50 seconds. South Africa took silver and Great Britain came away with bronze.\n\nThe race went wrong for the U.S. with a botched baton pass between the relay's first and second leg. As Coleman rounded the curve with the baton, Bednarek left far too early and then slowed to a halt in an effort to avoid a disqualification.\n\nIt was no use. By the time Coleman passed the baton to Bednarek while crashing into his back, they were already outside the exchange zone.\n\nThe best teamwork the U.S. relay team showed came when they talked with reporters after the race. They all spoke besides Bednarek in an effort to shield him from blame.\n\n\"We practiced a lot,\" Coleman said. \"Me and Kenny have been competitors but also teammates a few times. We felt really confident going out there. In the heat of the moment, it just didn't happen.\"\n\nWhen asked repeatedly to specify exactly went wrong, Coleman said, \"I'm not sure if you want me to point fingers or something like that. As a team, as a unit, we didn't get it done today.\"\n\nThe line of questions also annoyed Kerley, who interjected \"Y'all say the same s-- over and over.\"\n\nIt was no surprise that the U.S. struggled once again passing the baton. The names change every four years, but the story seldom does.\n\nAt the 2008 Olympics, the U.S. were cruising toward a spot in the 4x100 final when Darvis Patton bore down on Tyson Gay for the last changeover and a mix-up sent the baton tumbling to the rain-soaked track.\n\nFour years later, the U.S. finished second to Jamaica, only to be stripped of its silver medals as a result of Gay's doping case.\n\nIn 2016, the U.S. joined victorious Jamaica and second-place Japan on a victory lap only to learn it had been disqualified. A bungled baton pass between Mike Rodgers and Justin Gatlin occurred outside the designated zone.\n\nWorst of all was Tokyo. The favored Americans finished sixth in their preliminary heat and didn't qualify for the final largely because Kerley and Ronnie Baker botched the baton pass between the relay's second and third leg.\n\nAfter that failure, the legendary Carl Lewis called it a \"total embarrassment.\" Friday, he went even further.\n\n\"It is time to blow up the system,\" Lewis posted on X. \"This continues to be completely unacceptable. It is clear that EVERYONE at [USA Track & Field] is more concerned with relationships than winning. No athlete should step on the track and run another relay until this program is changed from top to bottom.\"\n\nThe latest failure to make the Olympic podium comes despite the U.S. boasting three of the 11 fastest 100 meters sprinters in the world this year.\n\nLyles had hoped this would be the night when he won his third gold medal in Paris and join Usain Bolt, Carl Lewis, Bobby Morrow and Jesse Owens as the only men's sprinters who have pulled off a sprint treble in a single Olympics. He likely would have run the third leg of the 4x100 for the U.S. because of his proficiency running the curve.\n\nThat plan crumbled when Lyles tested positive for COVID two days after winning the closest 100 meters in Olympic history. Lyles revealed that he had COVID after settling for bronze in the 200 on Thursday evening. Only a few hours later, he announced on Instagram that his Olympics were over.\n\n\"It is not the Olympics I dreamed of,\" Lyles wrote on Instagram, \" but it has left me with so much Joy in my heart. I hope everyone enjoyed the show.\"", "source": {"uri": "sports.yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo Sports"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

They have knack for doing just that.\n\nPARIS, France -- Team USA was disqualified in the men's 4x100-meter relay final in Paris, although the team wouldn't have medaled even without the DQ.\n\nDisastrous baton exchanges, disqualifications and a doping ban that took away a silver medal in 2012 has meant the men's relay team hasn't earned a medal in the event since 2004.\n\nThe curse continued in Paris.\n\nU.S. runner Christian Coleman struggled to hand the baton to teammate Kenneth Bednarek, running out of zone during the disastrous handoff. Coleman first ran into, then passed, Bednarek as they made their awkward exchange. After the race finished, judges determined they had passed out of zone.\n\nAn out of zone penalty occurs when a runner ending their stretch still has the baton when they exit the handoff zone where the next runner -- already beginning their sprint -- is supposed to accept the pass.\n\nIt's a serious misstep that meant an instant disqualification for the team, no matter their standing beforehand or after.\n\nAndre De Grasse put a bright mark on an otherwise disappointing Olympics by anchoring Canada to gold in a time of 37.50 seconds. It was the first medal in Paris for De Grasse, but his seventh overall. South Africa finished second and Britain third.\n\nThe U.S. team qualified for the finals Thursday, with the fastest time in the heats at 37.37 seconds. That time gave some hope that the quartet would be able to break the 20-year drought that hung over them.\n\nMany expected the lineup of Coleman, Fred Kerley, Kyree King and Courtney Lindsey, to change for the finals.\n\nHowever, Noah Lyles, the gold medalist in the 100 meters, had to bow out revealing after the 200-meter final he was diagnosed with COVID-19.\n\nThe disappointing end to the race comes minutes after Sha'Carri Richardson was able to come from behind in the women's 4x100 final to win gold for the U.S.", "source": {"uri": "9news.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "KUSA.com"}, "authors": [{"uri": "assets@9news.com", "name": "assets", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Relay_race", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Relay race"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/4_\u00d7_100_metres_relay", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "4 \u00d7 100 metres relay"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paris", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christian_Coleman", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Christian Coleman"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Noah_Lyles", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Noah Lyles"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Silver_medal", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Silver medal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gold_medal", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Gold medal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doping_in_sport", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Doping in sport"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canada", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Canada"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Canada"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kenny_Bednarek", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Kenny Bednarek"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sprint_(running)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Sprint (running)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kyree_King", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Kyree King"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sha'Carri_Richardson", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Sha'Carri Richardson"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andre_De_Grasse", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Andre De Grasse"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fred_Kerley", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Fred Kerley"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coronavirus", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Coronavirus"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/100_metres", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "100 metres"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Africa", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "South Africa"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "South Africa"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Kingdom", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Motorsports", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Motorsports", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Adventure_Racing", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Adventure Racing", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Motorsports/Snowmobile_Racing", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Motorsports/Snowmobile Racing", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Adventure_Racing/Teams", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Adventure Racing/Teams", "wgt": 18}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Motorsports/Boat_Racing", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Motorsports/Boat Racing", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 88}], "image": "https://media.9news.com/assets/CCT/images/ef3d5b58-17ad-4ca5-a700-28de850f68b1/20240809T180137/ef3d5b58-17ad-4ca5-a700-28de850f68b1_1140x641.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9805314", "eventUri": "eng-9805314", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.2470588235294118, "wgt": 177, "relevance": 1}

Fred Kerley, the 100-meter bronze medalist, was moved to the anchor leg, while 200-meter silver medalist Kenny Bednarek assumed Kerley's role on the second leg.\n\nFormer 100-meter world champion Christian Coleman had leadoff duties for the US, but his baton pass to Bednarek was a total mess. Bednarek left early and almost came to a full stop to receive the baton, with Coleman just about crashing into his back. By the time Bednarek had the baton in his hand, he was well out of the exchange zone, which is an automatic disqualification. Kyree King's pass to Fred Kerley was also clunky, but the damage was already done on the first exchange.\n\nMeanwhile, at the front of the pack, Canada pulled off a surprise gold medal victory from Lane 9 for their first Olympic title in this event since Donovan Bailey anchored them to a famous win over the Americans in Atlanta 1996. South Africa ran a continental record 37.57 for silver, while Great Britain scored a bronze medal over reigning Olympic champions Italy.\n\nWhile the USA men did win world titles in 2019 and 2023, their track record (pardon the pun) has been littered with DNFs and DQs over the past 30 years. The tally is now up to nine dating back to the 1995 World Championships in Sweden.\n\nThis doesn't even include retroactive disqualifications for the 2001 Worlds and 2012 Olympics for steroid failures, otherwise this total would be in double figures. It also leaves out bad baton exchanges that most likely cost them gold medals in the 2004 Olympics and 2022 World Championships, as well as a botched exchange in the Tokyo Olympics that didn't lead to a DQ or DNF but nevertheless saw them eliminated in the heats.\n\nEven without Lyles, this was by far the best chance for the United States to sweep the Olympic men's and women's 4x100m relay for the first time since Barcelona 1992. The women did their part and we got a tremendous meme out of it from Sha'Carri Richardson.

South Africa took silver and Great Britain the bronze.\n\nThe U.S. men's team entered the relay final as gold medal favorites, in theory, as the reigning world champions and fastest qualifiers. History, however, boded otherwise.\n\nSince 1995, the U.S. has suffered 11 baton errors resulting in disqualifications or bans, including most recently at the 2022 World Championships.\n\nLack of talent does not appear to be the problem.\n\nOn the eve of the race, Lewis foreshadowed the U.S. men's potential to crumble under the Olympic spotlight but shifted responsibility for any negative outcomes to the coaching staff.\n\n\"If @TeamUSA wins all relays tomorrow, you talk to the athletes. If something happens and they do not sweep. ONLY talk to the coaches,\" Lewis said in a post to X.\n\nThe team of Christian Coleman, Kenneth Bednarek, Kyree King and Fred Kerley finished seventh before the disqualification.\n\nColeman, who was part of the botched baton handoff, told reporters in Paris that the team \"had the speed\" to win, but couldn't put it together when it counted.\n\n\"It's a little disappointing, especially for America, because we wanted to bring it home,\" Coleman said. \"We knew we had the speed to do it ... but we are human beings, too. We've been through ups and downs in life. This is just another one of those times where we just got to keep our head down and just keep pushing.\"\n\nThey ran on a slick track, but the U.S. women's team braved even rainier conditions ahead of the men's final Friday and overcame a precarious baton bauble to clinch gold.\n\nWomen's 100-meter silver medalist Sha'Carri Richardson anchored the U.S. effort, earning her first Olympic gold. It's the U.S. women's 12th Olympic medal in the event and their win was an improvement on their second-place finish in Tokyo.\n\nNewly-minted men's 100-meter Olympic champion Noah Lyles was out of commission for the relay after testing positive for Covid Tuesday.\n\nHe won bronze in his signature event, the 200-meter, Thursday, despite his diagnosis, but was left gasping for air after the race and left the track in a wheelchair.\n\nLyles subsequently said his Paris Olympics had come to an end.\n\n\"I believe this will be the end of my 2024 Olympics,\" he said. \"It is not the Olympic I dreamed of but it has left me with so much Joy in my heart.\"", "source": {"uri": "nbcnews.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "NBC News"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Track_and_Field/Athletes", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Track and Field/Athletes", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Disabled/Mentally_Challenged", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Disabled/Mentally Challenged", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Olympics", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Olympics", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_nbcnews-fp-1024-512,f_auto,q_auto:best/rockcms/2024-08/240809-olympics-christian-coleman-kenneth-bednarek-baton-pass-se-444p-c7e842.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9805314", "eventUri": "eng-9805314", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.2156862745098038, "wgt": 168, "relevance": 1}

After the handoff was determined to be illegal, the seventh-place finish was rescinded and the U.S. was disqualified.\n\nIt's hard to imagine a worse outcome for a U.S. team that began the day as the favorite to win the race.\n\nThursday, the U.S. quartet of Christian Coleman, Fred Kerley, Kyree King, and Courtney Lindsey won the first heat with a time of 37.47 seconds. South Africa came in second (37.94) in the same heat. Great Britain also advanced to the final after finishing third, in 38.04 seconds.\n\nCanada, which won gold Friday, didn't even claim first in its own qualifying heat. Instead, it ran third with a time of 38.39, behind China (38.24) and France (38.34) in the second heat Thursday.\n\nThe tables turned Friday. Canada placed first with a time of 37.50. South Africa claimed the silver medal (37.57) and Great Britain won the bronze (37.61).\n\nWhat happened?\n\nNoah Lyles had been running the anchor leg for the U.S. before this week but missed Thursday's qualifying heat in order to run in the men's 200-meter final. Lyles claimed bronze in that race but afterward revealed he had been diagnosed with COVID-19.\n\nMore news: Noah Lyles Diagnosed With COVID-19 Prior to Winning 200M Bronze\n\nLyles gave a post-race interview Thursday in which he left the door open to running in Friday's 4-by-100-meter final. Later in the day, however, he announced he would not compete in any events for the remainder of the Olympics.\n\n\"I believe this will be the end of my 2024 Olympics,\" he wrote in a social media post.\n\nMore news: Noah Lyles Out of Men's 4x100 Relay After COVID-19 Diagnosis\n\nBednarek, who received the illegal handoff, didn't compete in Thursday's race either because he was also in the 200-meter final. Fred Kerley, who ran the second leg in qualifying on Thursday, ran the third leg in Friday's final.\n\nPerhaps the re-ordering of the runners contributed to the Americans' unfortunate mistake. In any event, Bednarek was clearly frustrated after the race as Coleman attempted to console him trackside.\n\nThis marks the fifth straight Olympics in which the U.S. has failed to medal in the men's 4-by-100 race.

Despite those advantages, disaster struck in a scene that has become all too familiar.\n\nThe U.S. mangled their first baton pass as Christian Coleman and Kenneth Bednarek couldn't get on the same page. The failed pass put the Americans far behind the field. Later they were disqualified as Bednarek exited the passing zone during that attempt.\n\nFailed exchanges have marred the U.S. team's chances at Olympic medals for years in something that has become the rule, not the exception.\n\nAt the 2020 Summer Olympics, the U.S. men failed to make the final due to a botched exchange.

No athlete should step on the track and run another relay until this program is changed from top to bottom.\"\n\nIn an interview last week with The Associated Press, Lewis suggested experts in the U.S. develop a relay manual and send it to every high school coach in the country.\n\n\"The issue has always been politics, has always been drama, has always been deception,\" Lewis said. \"If they can eliminate those things, there's no question they have the fastest team in the world.\"\n\nSome might blame the latest loss on the impact of the lineup shuffle.

The foursome got lucky, making up for lost ground after a poor baton handoff from Thomas to anchor leg Richardson.\n\n\"When we won as USA ladies it was an honor for all of us,\" Richardson, who won the silver medal in the 100-meter sprint earlier in the week. \"I remember trusting my third leg, trusting Gabby, knowing she was going to put that stick in my hand no matter what, and to leave my best on the track.\"\n\nGreat Britain, came in second, and Germany third.\n\nJamaica's team, who not so long ago stood as the U.S. team's stiffest competition, came in sixth. Three of their sprint superstars either missed or dropped out of the Paris Games due to injury.\n\nThe U.S. men fumble the handoff\n\nIn the men's race, the U.S. -- after initially placing fifth -- was disqualified after botching their first handoff, when Christian Coleman passed to Kenny Bednarek. Fred Kerley, as anchor, and Kyree King rounded out the team.\n\nA day ago, the team learned that it would have to run without its best asset, newly-minted 100-meter champion Noah Lyles. After finishing with bronze in his best event, the 200-meter sprint on Thursday, Lyles revealed that he had COVID-19.\n\nCanada won gold, South Africa took silver and Great Britain won bronze.\n\nU.S. men, clearly angered and frustrated by their performance, spoke briefly with reporters after the race. \"We had the mindset of no risk, no reward,\" King said. \"We went out there and went big and it didn't happen.\"\n\nAsked about the apparent mistiming of a key handoff, the men said they wouldn't talk about individual missteps that might have cost them the race.\n\nThe U.S. teams are notorious for fumbling relay handoffs. At the Tokyo Olympics three years ago, a Team USA handoff disqualification in the 4x400-meter mixed-gender relay almost cost the team a medal. Ultimately, the ruling was overturned, and the team took home bronze.\n\nAt the Rio de Janeiero Games in 2016, the women's 4x100-meter relay team successfully overturned a DQ after arguing that other runners forced a baton drop.", "source": {"uri": "gpb.org", "dataType": "news", "title": "Georgia Public Broadcasting"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gold_medal",

But despite the success of the women's team, it was a more-of-the-same result for the men's side.\n\nEven without Noah Lyles, who was out of the lineup due to Covid, the US entered the race as favorites. But over the past 20 years, they've had a knack for gagging away Olympic opportunities. The last time they captured a medal was in 2012, but that was later stripped for a doping violation.\n\nFor the most part, relays have looked a lot like Friday, with poor exchanges and disqualifications plaguing the team throughout the Olympic drought.\n\n2004 Athens: A bungled exchanges left the US men in silver behind Team GB.\n\n2008 Beijing: The US failed to advance beyond the heats after a dropped baton.\n\n2012 London: The US finished second and Jamaica, but were later disqualified for a doping offense.\n\n2016 Rio: The US were involved in another baton-passing mishap that eliminated the team in the heats.\n\n2021 Tokyo: A poor exchange kept the US from reaching the final.\n\nIn the world championships, results have been slight better. But not by much. Over that time, US Track and Field has faced accusations that it has not prioritized relays - and that the lineup has too often changed within a Games, harming the chemistry of the team. But the four-man squad for the final in Paris disputed that.\n\nRelated: Lyles wins 200m bronze before Covid diagnosis revealed as Tebogo takes gold\n\n\"We practised a lot,\" Coleman said after the race. \"Me and Kenny have been on the team a few times, and we felt really confident going out there. It's part of the sport. We wanted to do it, we wanted to bring it home, we knew we had the speed to do it but this is a risk-reward type of thing.\"\n\nLewis had earlier said that the coaches, not athletes, should be blamed if the US failed to sweep the relay finals.\n\n\"If Team USA wins all relays tomorrow,\" Lewis wrote the day before the finals. \"You talk to the athletes. If something happens and they do not sweep. ONLY talk to the coaches.\"\n\nThe coaching approach did appear to affect the women's team, who got across the line cleanly to take their 12th Olympic gold medal in the event. The men's team, as so often before, simply did not gel.", "source": {"uri": "sports.yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo Sports"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

Cushing Stadium. Mandatory Credit: Kirby Lee-USA TODAY Sports\n\nCarl Lewis certainly does not feel like singing the national anthem again after what he saw from the U.S. team in the men's 4\u00d7100 race on Friday.\n\nTeam USA was disqualified from the 4\u00d7100 relay at the Paris Olympics thanks to an ugly snafu in which sprinters Christian Coleman and Kenny Bednarek botched the baton pass between the first and second legs. The two teammates embarrassingly ran into each other during the handoff, resulting in the U.S. crossing the finish line seventh (which ultimately did not matter anyway because the baton disaster meant an automatic disqualification).\n\nYou can see the video of the massive blunder here.\n\nLewis, the legendary U.S. sprinter who won nine Olympic gold medals, went off on social media after the race.\n\n\"It is time to blow up the system,\" wrote Lewis on X. \"This continues to be completely unacceptable. It is clear that EVERYONE at [USA Track & Field] is more concerned with relationships than winning. No athlete should step on the track and run another relay until this program is changed from top to bottom.\"\n\nIt is easy to see where the 63-year-old Lewis, who won two Olympic golds as well as three World Championship golds in the 4\u00d7100 relay, is coming from. The United States men's team has now been unable to medal in the 4\u00d7100 relay for five consecutive Olympics, and it seems that they are the only major nation that continues to have these issues.\n\nAll of this sounds awfully familiar too since the U.S. men's team failed to qualify for the 4\u00d7100 relay final at the 2020 Tokyo Olympics due to another botched baton pass. After that blunder, Lewis also issued a similarly critical message to social media.", "source": {"uri": "larrybrownsports.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Larry Brown Sports"}, "authors": [{"uri": "darryn_albert@larrybrownsports.com", "name": "Darryn Albert", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Data_Communications/Frame_Relay", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Data Communications/Frame Relay", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Track_and_Field/Athletes", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Track and Field/Athletes", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Disabled/Mentally_Challenged", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Disabled/Mentally Challenged", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Olympics", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Olympics", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://larrybrownsports.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/carl-lewis.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9805314", "eventUri": "eng-9805314", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.02745098039215688, "wgt": 132, "relevance": 1}

They bobbled the baton in the first exchange and ultimately collided.\n\nThis led to their disqualification from the event, leaving United States fans shocked by the result.\n\nThe U.S. team was trending on social media after the race, with many fans bashing the execution of the Americans.\n\n\"Handoffs are important in relays.

South Africa was right behind Canada, clocking in at 37.57 seconds to earn a silver medal, while Great Britain finished the race at 37.61 seconds to earn bronze.\n\n\"I will never understand why our men's 4x100 relay team has issues every. single. olympics,\" one fan said.\n\n\"Time to take the 4x100 out of the Olympics...this can't happen, ever,\" said another fan.\n\nThis is now the fifth straight Summer Olympics that the men's 4x100m relay team will leave without having earned a medal.

Atiku made this disclosure while reacting to the widely held belief that the Tinubu came to his rescue following his rift with former President Olusegun Obasanjo that culminated in him contesting the presidential election on the platform of the defunct Action Congress, AC, in 2007. According to the 2023 PDP presidential candidate, without his support, Tinubu's political career could have ended as the governor of Lagos State. In a statement through his Media Adviser, Paul Ibe, the former Vice President said, \u201cVice President Kashim Shettima goofed when he claimed that former Vice President of Nigeria, Atiku Abubakar benefited from President Bola Tinubu\u2019s goodwill when he was being \u201cpersecuted\u201d in the PDP. \u201cTruth be told, it was Tinubu that actually benefited immensely from Atiku\u2019s goodwill. But for Atiku\u2019s support, hinged on his pro-democracy instincts and rule of law, Tinubu\u2019s tenure as governor of Lagos would have been rough with a wide possibility of termination of his political career. \u201cFor some time, and especially leading up to the 2023 election, there has been a deliberate attempt to distort the history of the politics of the early 4th Republic by ascribing the AC, the political platform that Atiku ran in 2007 as Tinubu\u2019s party. \u201cNothing can be further from the truth. Vice President Shettima, obviously carried away with the euphoria of the unveiling of his official residence as Vice President, repeated the same lie. \u201cShettima needs to be reminded that Atiku did not run under the Action Congress of Nigeria (ACN), but Action Congress (AC). AC came out of a coalition of ACD (Advance Congress of Democrats), formed by mainly PDM members and other associates and Tinubu\u2019s faction of AD.\u201d He added that Tinubu was not in a position to lend the platform to Atiku \u201cas erroneously being suggested, as he (Atiku) was nominated by all the delegates from all the states\". He went further to name the delegates to the primaries of the election that threw up the former Vice President as the party\u2019s presidential candidate to include Atiku Abubakar himself, Lawal Keita, Amb. Yahaya Kwande, Dr. Okwesilieze Nwodo, Alexis Anielo, Titi Ajanaku, former Governor Rasheed Ladoja, Chief Tom Ikimi, and Chief Dapo Sarumi. Others, he said, were Chief Sergeant Awuse, Alh. Lawan, Dr. Chris Ngige, Prof Ango Abdulahi, Dr Farouk Abdul Azeez, Chief Audu Ogbeh, Chief Ejiofor Onyia, and Dr. Iyorchia Ayu, among others.", "summary": "<img width=\"2160\" height=\"1441\" src=\"https://dailypost.ng/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/Collage-Maker-02-Nov-2022-07.44-PM.jpg\" class=\"webfeedsFeaturedVisual wp-post-image\" alt=\"\" style=\"display: block; margin: auto; margin-bottom: 5px;max-width: 100%;\" link_thumbnail=\"\" decoding=\"async\" fetchpriority=\"high\" srcset=\"https://dailypost.ng/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/Collage-Maker-02-Nov-2022-07.44-PM.jpg 2160w, https://dailypost.ng/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/Collage-Maker-02-Nov-2022-07.44-PM-300x200.jpg 300w, https://dailypost.ng/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/Collage-Maker-02-Nov-2022-07.44-PM-1024x683.jpg 1024w, https://dailypost.ng/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/Collage-Maker-02-Nov-2022-07.44-PM-1536x1025.jpg 1536w, https://dailypost.ng/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/Collage-Maker-02-Nov-2022-07.44-PM-2048x1366.jpg 2048w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 2160px) 100vw, 2160px\" /><p>Former Vice-President Atiku Abubakar has revealed how he saved President Bola Tinubu\u2019s political career.

{"id": 231347816, "title": "Inside one of the 'most complicated hostage rescue missions in history' that saved four captured Israelis", "text": "The four Israeli hostages saved from Hamas gained their freedom in one of the \u201cmost complicated hostage rescue missions in history,\u201d officials said. Noa Argamani, 25, Almog Meir Jan, 21, Andri Kozlov, 27, and Shlomi Ziv, 40, were saved during the \u201cSummer Seeds\u201d operation in Nuseirat, central Gaza on Saturday, Israeli writer Hen Mazzig explained on X. The hostages were being held above ground, in three-to-four story buildings in an area that was crowded with civilians, Mazzig added, citing the Israel Defense Forces. \u201cThe forces stormed the two separate targets where the hostages were held, with Noa held on the first floor and Andrey, Shlomi, and Almog on the third floor of another building, hundreds of meters apart,\u201d he said. Hamas supposedly pays Palestinian families in the Gaza Strip to keep the hostages in their homes, the Times of Israel\u2019s Mannie Fabian reported. The IDF soldiers used weapons that were specifically designed for the operation, according to Mazzig. There was a \u201cmajor gun battle\u201d at the home where the three male hostages were held, during which soldier Yamam officer Chief Inspector Arnon Zamora was wounded, Fabian wrote. Zamora later died from his injuries. One vehicle carrying three hostages away from the scene got stuck during the getaway, and had to be freed \u201cunder heavy fire,\u201d Mazzig said. Footage shared on X appeared to show the dramatic moment that rescue helicopters landed in broad daylight in order to bring the hostages to safety. Prior to the mission, there were concerns that if the IDF only stormed one building, Hamas would secret away the other hostages being held elsewhere, he added. The Israeli Air Force used intelligence gathered from the air over the last few days in order to ensure that the hostages could be rescued without the terrorist captors shooting them first. \u201cThe rescue took place under heavy fire, and during the disengagement, dozens of terrorists with RPGs and machine guns ran through the alleys towards the targets,\u201d Mezzig wrote. A number of \u201cuninvolved\u201d Gazan civilians were killed during the rescue, according to Fabien. Some IDF soldiers were also lightly injured, mostly from shrapnel. \u201cThe difference between success and failure in such an operation is a hair\u2019s breadth, and we relied on exceptional technology from the Intelligence and Shin Bet. Without ground activity and maneuvering in the Gazan area, it would not have been possible to succeed in such operations,\u201d the IDF statement read. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu addressed the public later on Saturday, saying that the operation was \u201cvery complex and dangerous.\u201d \u201cBut I approved it without hesitation because I trust the IDF, the Shin Bet, the Israel Police, the fighting heroes of the Shin Bet and the National Counter-Terrorism Unit,\u201d he insisted, according to Haaretz. The White House also commended the Israel Defense Force\u2019s \u201cdaring\u201d rescue in a formal statement issued Saturday morning. \u201cThe hostage release and ceasefire deal that is now on the table would secure the release of all the remaining hostages together with security assurances for Israel and relief for the innocent civilians in Gaza,\u201d the write-up added.", "summary": "Noa Argamani, 25, Almog Meir Jan, 21, Andri Kozlov, 27, and Shlomi Ziv, 40, were rescued during the \u201cSummer Seeds\u201d operation.", "url": "https://nypost.com/2024/06/08/world-news/inside-the-most-complicated-mission-that-saved-four-israeli-hostages/", "image": "https://nypost.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/06/newspress-collage-j3jg00vrw-1717865659193.jpg?quality=75&strip=all&1717851300&w=1200", "video": "https://cdn.jwplayer.com/videos/KjeCZxrA-RyIcpnTz.mp4", "publish_date": "2024-06-08 16:55:25", "author": "Olivia Land", "authors": ["Olivia Land"], "language": "en", "source_country": "us", "sentiment": -0.319}

Here's how it will work", "body": "WASHINGTON (AP) -- Leaders of the Group of Seven wealthy democracies have agreed to engineer a $50 billion loan to help Ukraine in its fight for survival that would use interest earned on profits from Russia's frozen central bank assets as collateral.\n\nDetails of the deal were still being hashed out as G7 leaders gathered for a summit in Italy, but the money could reach Kyiv before the end of the year. That's according to a French official who confirmed the agreement Wednesday ahead of a formal announcement at the summit. Here's how the plan would work:\n\nWHERE WOULD THE MONEY COME FROM?\n\nMost of the money would be provided in the form of a loan from the U.S. government that would be backed by windfall profits being earned on roughly $300 billion in immobilized Russian assets. The vast majority of the money is being held in European Union nations.\n\nA French official said that while the loan would be mostly U.S.-guaranteed, it could be \"topped up\" with European money or other national contributions.\n\nFor more than a year, officials from multiple countries have debated the legality of confiscating the money and sending it to Ukraine.\n\nThe U.S. and its allies immediately froze whatever Russian central bank assets they had access to when Moscow invaded Ukraine in 2022 -- basically, money being held in banks outside Russia.\n\nThe assets are immobilized and can't be accessed by Moscow -- but they still belong to Russia.\n\nWhile governments can generally freeze property or funds without difficulty, turning them into forfeited assets that can be used for the benefit of Ukraine requires an extra layer of judicial procedure, including a legal basis and adjudication in a court.\n\nSo the European Union instead has set aside the windfall profits being generated by the frozen assets. That pot of money is easier to access.\n\nSeparately, the U.S. earlier this year passed a law called the REPO Act -- short for the Rebuilding Economic Prosperity and Opportunity for Ukrainians Act -- that allows the Biden administration to seize $5 billion in Russian state assets located in the U.S. and use them for the benefit of Kyiv. That arrangement is still being worked out.\n\nHOW COULD THE LOAN BE USED -- AND HOW SOON?\n\nIt will be up to technical experts to work through the details.\n\nBut U.S. national security adviser Jake Sullivan said Wednesday that the goal is \"to provide the necessary resources to Ukraine now for its economic energy and other needs so that it's capable of having the resilience necessary to withstand Russia's continuing aggression.\"\n\nAnother goal is to get the money to Ukraine fast.\n\nThe French official, who was not authorized to be publicly named according to French presidential policy, said the details could be worked out \"very quickly and in any case, the $50 billion will be disbursed before the end of 2024.\"\n\nBeyond the costs of the war, the needs are great. The World Bank's latest damage assessment of Ukraine, released in February, estimates that costs for reconstruction and recovery of the nation stand at $486 billion over the next 10 years.\n\nThe move to unlock Russia's assets comes after there was a long delay by the U.S. Congress in approving military aid for Ukraine.\n\nAt an Atlantic Council event previewing the G7 summit, former U.S. Ambassador to Ukraine John Herbst said \"the fact that American funding is not quite reliable is a very important additional reason to go that route.\"\n\nWHO WOULD BE ON THE HOOK IN THE CASE OF A DEFAULT?\n\nIf Russia regained control of its frozen assets or if the immobilized funds weren't generating enough interest to pay back the loan, \"then the question of burden-sharing arises,\" according to the French official.\n\nWho would shoulder the burden is still to be worked out, the official said.\n\nMax Bergmann, director of the Europe, Russia and Eurasia Program at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, said last week that there were worries among European finance ministers that their countries \"will be left holding the bag if Ukraine

The vast majority of the money is being held in European Union nations.\n\nA French official said that while the loan would be mostly U.S.-guaranteed, it could be \"topped up\" with European money or other national contributions.\n\nThat's much harder to do.\n\nFor more than a year, officials from multiple countries have debated the legality of confiscating the money and sending it to Ukraine.\n\nPresident Joe Biden arrives on Air Force One at Brindisi International Airport, Wednesday, June 12, 2024, in Brindisi, Italy.

That pot of money is easier to access.\n\nSeparately, the U.S. earlier this year passed a law called the REPO Act - short for the Rebuilding Economic Prosperity and Opportunity for Ukrainians Act - that allows the Biden administration to seize $5 billion in Russian state assets located in the U.S. and use them for the benefit of Kyiv. That arrangement is still being worked out.\n\nIt will be up to technical experts to work through the details.\n\nBut U.S. national security adviser Jake Sullivan said Wednesday that the goal is \"to provide the necessary resources to Ukraine now for its economic energy and other needs so that it's capable of having the resilience necessary to withstand Russia's continuing aggression.\"\n\nAnother goal is to get the money to Ukraine fast.\n\nThe French official, who was not authorized to be publicly named according to French presidential policy, said the details could be worked out \"very quickly and in any case, the $50 billion will be disbursed before the end of 2024.\"\n\nBeyond the costs of the war, the needs are great.

Here's how it will work", "body": "WASHINGTON (AP) -- Leaders of the Group of Seven wealthy democracies have agreed to engineer a $50 billion loan to help Ukraine in its fight for survival that would use interest earned on profits from Russia's frozen central bank assets as collateral.\n\nDetails of the deal were still being hashed out as G7 leaders gathered for a summit in Italy, but the money could reach Kyiv before the end of the year. That's according to a French official who confirmed the agreement Wednesday ahead of a formal announcement at the summit. Here's how the plan would work:\n\n\u00d7\n\nAlready a Subscriber? Sign in You are logged in Switch accounts\n\nWHERE WOULD THE MONEY COME FROM?\n\nARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW\n\nMost of the money would be provided in the form of a loan from the U.S. government that would be backed by windfall profits being earned on roughly $300 billion in immobilized Russian assets. The vast majority of the money is being held in European Union nations.\n\nA French official said that while the loan would be mostly U.S.-guaranteed, it could be \"topped up\" with European money or other national contributions.\n\nWHY NOT JUST GIVE UKRAINE THE FROZEN ASSETS?\n\nThat's much harder to do.\n\nARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW\n\nFor more than a year, officials from multiple countries have debated the legality of confiscating the money and sending it to Ukraine.\n\nYou might be interested in Peterborough And Area News Dec 31, 1969 Peterborough And Area News Dec 31, 1969 ARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW\n\nThe U.S. and its allies immediately froze whatever Russian central bank assets they had access to when Moscow invaded Ukraine in 2022 -- basically, money being held in banks outside Russia.\n\nThe assets are immobilized and can't be accessed by Moscow -- but they still belong to Russia.\n\nWhile governments can generally freeze property or funds without difficulty, turning them into forfeited assets that can be used for the benefit of Ukraine requires an extra layer of judicial procedure, including a legal basis and adjudication in a court.\n\nSo the European Union instead has set aside the windfall profits being generated by the frozen assets. That pot of money is easier to access.\n\nSeparately, the U.S. earlier this year passed a law called the REPO Act -- short for the Rebuilding Economic Prosperity and Opportunity for Ukrainians Act -- that allows the Biden administration to seize $5 billion in Russian state assets located in the U.S. and use them for the benefit of Kyiv. That arrangement is still being worked out.\n\nHOW COULD THE LOAN BE USED -- AND HOW SOON?\n\nARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW\n\nIt will be up to technical experts to work through the details.\n\nBut U.S. national security adviser Jake Sullivan said Wednesday that the goal is \"to provide the necessary resources to Ukraine now for its economic energy and other needs so that it's capable of having the resilience necessary to withstand Russia's continuing aggression.\"\n\nAnother goal is to get the money to Ukraine fast.\n\nThe French official, who was not authorized to be publicly named according to French presidential policy, said the details could be worked out \"very quickly and in any case, the $50 billion will be disbursed before the end of 2024.\"\n\nBeyond the costs of the war, the needs are great. The World Bank's latest damage assessment of Ukraine, released in February, estimates that costs for reconstruction and recovery of the nation stand at $486 billion over the next 10 years.\n\nThe move to unlock Russia's assets comes after there was a long delay by the U.S. Congress in approving military aid for Ukraine.\n\nAt an Atlantic Council event previewing the G7 summit, former U.S. Ambassador to Ukraine John Herbst said \"the fact that American funding is not quite reliable is a very important additional reason to go that route.\"\n\nARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW\n\nWHO WOULD BE ON THE HOOK IN THE CASE OF A DEFAULT?\n\nIf Russia regained control of its frozen assets or if the immobilized funds weren't generating enough interest to pay back the loan, \"then the question of burden-sharing arises,\" according to the French official.\n\nWho would shoulder the burden is still to be worked out, the official said.\n\nMax Bergmann, director of the Europe, Russia and Eurasia Program at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, said last week that there were worries among European finance ministers that their countries \"will be left holding the bag if Ukraine

Here's how it will work.", "body": "WASHINGTON -- Leaders of the Group of Seven wealthy democracies have agreed to engineer a $50 billion loan to help Ukraine in its fight for survival. Interest earned on profits from Russia's frozen central bank assets would be used as collateral.\n\nDetails of the deal were being hashed out by G7 leaders at their summit in Italy. The money could reach Kyiv before the end of the year, according to U.S. and French officials.\n\nPresident Joe Biden told reporters at a news conference Thursday that the move was part of a \"historic agreement.\" Ukraine's president, Volodymyr Zelenskyy, said providing a loan through Russia's assets \"is a vital step forward in providing sustainable support for Ukraine in winning this war.\"\n\nHere's how the plan would work:\n\nMost of the money would be in the form of a loan mostly guaranteed by the U.S. government, backed by profits being earned on roughly $260 billion in immobilized Russian assets. The vast majority of that money is held in European Union nations.\n\nA French official said the loan could be \"topped up\" with European money or contributions from other countries.\n\nA U.S. official who spoke on the condition of anonymity to preview the agreement said the G7 leaders' official statement due out Friday will leave the door open to trying to confiscate the Russian assets entirely.\n\nThat's much harder to do.\n\nFor more than a year, officials from multiple countries have debated the legality of confiscating the money and sending it to Ukraine.\n\nThe U.S. and its allies immediately froze whatever Russian central bank assets they had access to when Moscow invaded Ukraine in 2022. That basically was money being held in banks outside Russia.\n\nThe assets are immobilized and cannot be accessed by Moscow, but they still belong to Russia.\n\nWhile governments can generally freeze property or funds without difficulty, turning them into forfeited assets that can be used for the benefit of Ukraine requires an extra layer of judicial procedure, including a legal basis and adjudication in a court.\n\nThe EU instead has set aside the profits being generated by the frozen assets. That pot of money is easier to access.\n\nSeparately, the U.S. this year passed a law called the REPO Act -- short for the Rebuilding Economic Prosperity and Opportunity for Ukrainians Act -- that allows the Biden administration to seize $5 billion in Russian state assets in the U.S. and use them for the benefit of Kyiv. That arrangement is being worked out.\n\nIt will be up to technical experts to work through the details.\n\nUkraine will be able to spend the money in several areas, including for military, economic and humanitarian needs and reconstruction, the U.S. official said.\n\nBiden's national security adviser, Jake Sullivan, said the goal is \"to provide the necessary resources to Ukraine now for its economic energy and other needs so that it's capable of having the resilience necessary to withstand Russia's continuing aggression.\"\n\nAnother goal is to get the money to Ukraine quickly.\n\nThe French official, who was not authorized to be publicly named according to French presidential policy, said the details could be worked out \"very quickly and in any case, the $50 billion will be disbursed before the end of 2024.\"\n\nBeyond the costs of the war, the needs are great.\n\nThe World Bank's latest damage assessment of Ukraine, released in February, estimates that costs for reconstruction and recovery of the nation stand at $486 billion over the next 10 years.\n\nThe move to unlock Russia's assets comes after there was a long delay in Washington by Congress in approving military aid for Ukraine.\n\nAt an Atlantic Council event previewing the G7 summit, a former U.S. ambassador to Ukraine, John Herbst, said \"the fact that American funding is not quite reliable is a very important additional reason to go that route.\"\n\nIf Russia regained control of its frozen assets or if the immobilized funds were not generating enough interest to pay back the loan, \"then the question of burden-sharing arises,\" according to the French official.\n\nMax Bergmann, director of the Europe, Russia and Eurasia Program at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, said last week that there were worries among European finance ministers that their countries \"will be left holding the bag if Ukraine defaults.\"\n\nSome nations are critical of the plan to seize Russian assets.\n\nChinese Embassy spokesman Liu Pengyu told The Associated Press that the U.S. is \"fueling the fight and inciting confrontation.\"\n\n\"We urge the U.S. to immediately stop slapping illegal unilateral sanctions and play a constructive role in ending the conflict and restoring peace.\"", "source": {"uri": "chicagotribune.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Chicago Tribune"}, "authors":

Here's How It Will Work", "body": "(AP) -- Leaders of the Group of Seven wealthy democracies have agreed to engineer a $50 billion loan to help Ukraine in its fight for survival. Interest earned on profits from Russia's frozen central bank assets would be used as collateral.\n\nDetails of the deal were being hashed out by G7 leaders at their summit in Italy. The money could reach Kyiv before the end of the year, according to U.S. and French officials.\n\nPresident Joe Biden told reporters at a news conference Thursday that the move was part of a \"historic agreement.\" Ukraine's president, Volodymyr Zelenskyy, said providing a loan through Russia's assets \"is a vital step forward in providing sustainable support for Ukraine in winning this war.\"\n\nHere's how the plan would work:\n\nMost of the money would be in the form of a loan mostly guaranteed by the U.S. government, backed by profits being earned on roughly $260 billion in immobilized Russian assets. The vast majority of that money is held in European Union nations.\n\nA French official said the loan could be \"topped up\" with European money or contributions from other countries.\n\nA U.S. official who spoke on the condition of anonymity to preview the agreement said the G7 leaders' official statement due out Friday will leave the door open to trying to confiscate the Russian assets entirely.\n\nThat's much harder to do.\n\nFor more than a year, officials from multiple countries have debated the legality of confiscating the money and sending it to Ukraine.\n\nThe U.S. and its allies immediately froze whatever Russian central bank assets they had access to when Moscow invaded Ukraine in 2022. That basically was money being held in banks outside Russia.\n\nThe assets are immobilized and cannot be accessed by Moscow, but they still belong to Russia.\n\nWhile governments can generally freeze property or funds without difficulty, turning them into forfeited assets that can be used for the benefit of Ukraine requires an extra layer of judicial procedure, including a legal basis and adjudication in a court.\n\nThe EU instead has set aside the profits being generated by the frozen assets. That pot of money is easier to access.\n\nSeparately, the U.S. this year passed a law called the REPO Act -- short for the Rebuilding Economic Prosperity and Opportunity for Ukrainians Act -- that allows the Biden administration to seize $5 billion in Russian state assets in the U.S. and use them for the benefit of Kyiv. That arrangement is being worked out.\n\nIt will be up to technical experts to work through the details.\n\nUkraine will be able to spend the money in several areas, including for military, economic and humanitarian needs and reconstruction, the U.S. official said.\n\nBiden's national security adviser, Jake Sullivan, said the goal is \"to provide the necessary resources to Ukraine now for its economic energy and other needs so that it's capable of having the resilience necessary to withstand Russia's continuing aggression.\"\n\nAnother goal is to get the money to Ukraine quickly.\n\nThe French official, who was not authorized to be publicly named according to French presidential policy, said the details could be worked out \"very quickly and in any case, the $50 billion will be disbursed before the end of 2024.\"\n\nBeyond the costs of the war, the needs are great.\n\nThe World Bank's latest damage assessment of Ukraine, released in February, estimates that costs for reconstruction and recovery of the nation stand at $486 billion over the next 10 years.\n\nThe move to unlock Russia's assets comes after there was a long delay in Washington by Congress in approving military aid for Ukraine.\n\nAt an Atlantic Council event previewing the G7 summit, a former U.S. ambassador to Ukraine, John Herbst, said \"the fact that American funding is not quite reliable is a very important additional reason to go that route.\"\n\nIf Russia regained control of its frozen assets or if the immobilized funds were not generating enough interest to pay back the loan, \"then the question of burden-sharing arises,\" according to the French official.\n\nMax Bergmann, director of the Europe, Russia and Eurasia Program at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, said last week that there were worries among European finance ministers that their countries \"will be left holding the bag if Ukraine defaults.\"\n\nSome nations are critical of the plan to seize Russian assets.\n\nChinese Embassy spokesman Liu Pengyu told The Associated Press that the U.S. is \"fueling the fight and inciting confrontation.\"\n\n\"We urge the U.S. to immediately stop slapping illegal unilateral sanctions and play a constructive role in ending the conflict and restoring peace.\"\n\n___\n\nAssociated Press writers Sylvie Corbet in Paris, Darlene Superville in Fasano, Italy, and

Here's How It Will Work", "body": "WASHINGTON -- Leaders of the Group of Seven wealthy democracies have agreed to engineer a $50 billion loan to help Ukraine in its fight for survival. Interest earned on profits from Russia's frozen central bank assets would be used as collateral.\n\nDetails of the deal were being hashed out by G7 leaders at their summit in Italy. The money could reach Kyiv before the end of the year, according to U.S. and French officials who confirmed the agreement before a formal announcement.\n\nHere's how the plan would work:\n\nMost of the money would be in the form of a loan mostly guaranteed by the U.S. government, backed by profits being earned on roughly $260 billion in immobilized Russian assets. The vast majority of that money is held in European Union nations.\n\nA French official said the loan could be \"topped up\" with European money or contributions from other countries.\n\nA U.S. official who spoke on the condition of anonymity to preview the agreement said the G7 leaders' official statement due out Friday will leave the door open to trying to confiscate the Russian assets entirely.\n\nRelated Story: Ukraine Says It Struck a Top Fighter Plane Deep Inside Russia\n\nThat's much harder to do.\n\nFor more than a year, officials from multiple countries have debated the legality of confiscating the money and sending it to Ukraine.\n\nThe U.S. and its allies immediately froze whatever Russian central bank assets they had access to when Moscow invaded Ukraine in 2022. That basically was money being held in banks outside Russia.\n\nThe assets are immobilized and cannot be accessed by Moscow, but they still belong to Russia.\n\nWhile governments can generally freeze property or funds without difficulty, turning them into forfeited assets that can be used for the benefit of Ukraine requires an extra layer of judicial procedure, including a legal basis and adjudication in a court.\n\nThe EU instead has set aside the profits being generated by the frozen assets. That pot of money is easier to access.\n\nSeparately, the U.S. this year passed a law called the REPO Act -- short for the Rebuilding Economic Prosperity and Opportunity for Ukrainians Act -- that allows the Biden administration to seize $5 billion in Russian state assets in the U.S. and use them for the benefit of Kyiv. That arrangement is being worked out.\n\nRelated Story: Biden Partially Lifts Ban on Ukraine Using US Arms in Strikes on Russian ...\n\nIt will be up to technical experts to work through the details.\n\nUkraine will be able to spend the money in several areas, including for military, economic and humanitarian needs and reconstruction, the U.S. official said.\n\nPresident Joe Biden's national security adviser, Jake Sullivan, said the goal is \"to provide the necessary resources to Ukraine now for its economic energy and other needs so that it's capable of having the resilience necessary to withstand Russia's continuing aggression.\"\n\nAnother goal is to get the money to Ukraine quickly.\n\nThe French official, who was not authorized to be publicly named according to French presidential policy, said the details could be worked out \"very quickly and in any case, the $50 billion will be disbursed before the end of 2024.\"\n\nBeyond the costs of the war, the needs are great.\n\nThe World Bank's latest damage assessment of Ukraine, released in February, estimates that costs for reconstruction and recovery of the nation stand at $486 billion over the next 10 years.\n\nThe move to unlock Russia's assets comes after there was a long delay in Washington by Congress in approving military aid for Ukraine.\n\nAt an Atlantic Council event previewing the G7 summit, a former U.S. ambassador to Ukraine, John Herbst, said \"the fact that American funding is not quite reliable is a very important additional reason to go that route.\"\n\nRelated Story: Ukraine Faces Its Worst Crisis Since the War Began: BBC's Jeremy Bowen\n\nIf Russia regained control of its frozen assets or if the immobilized funds were not generating enough interest to pay back the loan, \"then the question of burden-sharing arises,\" according to the French official.\n\nMax Bergmann, director of the Europe, Russia and Eurasia Program at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, said last week that there were worries among European finance ministers that their countries \"will be left holding the bag if Ukraine defaults.\"", "source": {"uri":

The Ukrainian leader will sign a new, long-term security accord with U.S. President Joe Biden on Thursday, as well as one with fellow G7 member Japan.\n\n\"There is a lot of work to be done, but I am sure that in these two days we will be able to have discussions that will lead to concrete and measurable results,\" Italian Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni told her G7 guests as their talks started in a luxury hotel resort in the southern region of Puglia.\n\nThe G7 plan for Ukraine is based on a multi-year loan using profits from some $300 billion of impounded Russian funds. The technical details will be finalised in the coming weeks, a G7 diplomatic source told Reuters. The source, who asked not to be named, said the additional funding would arrive by the end of this year.\n\nA senior U.S. official told Reuters that the United States had agreed to provide up to $50 billion itself, but that amount could decline significantly as other countries announced their participation.\n\nMost of the money would be in the form of a loan mostly guaranteed by the U.S. government, backed by profits being earned on roughly $300 billion in immobilized Russian assets. The vast majority of that money is held in European Union nations.\n\nA French official said the loan could be \"topped up\" with European money or contributions from other countries.\n\nA U.S. official who spoke on the condition of anonymity to preview the agreement said the G7 leaders' official statement due out Friday will leave the door open to trying to confiscate the Russian assets entirely.\n\nThat's much harder to do.\n\nFor more than a year, officials from multiple countries have debated the legality of confiscating the money and sending it to Ukraine.\n\nThe U.S. and its allies immediately froze whatever Russian central bank assets they had access to when Moscow invaded Ukraine in 2022. That basically was money being held in banks outside Russia.\n\nThe assets are immobilized and cannot be accessed by Moscow, but they still belong to Russia.\n\nWhile governments can generally freeze property or funds without difficulty, turning them into forfeited assets that can be used for the benefit of Ukraine requires an extra layer of judicial procedure, including a legal basis and adjudication in a court.\n\nThe EU instead has set aside the profits being generated by the frozen assets. That pot of money is easier to access.\n\nSeparately, the U.S. this year passed a law called the REPO Act -- short for the Rebuilding Economic Prosperity and Opportunity for Ukrainians Act -- that allows the Biden administration to seize $5 billion in Russian state assets in the U.S. and use them for the benefit of Kyiv. That arrangement is being worked out.\n\nIt will be up to technical experts to work through the details.\n\nThe U.S. official said there are certain jurisdictions that prefer to send their money to help with reconstruction and others that prefer to earmark funds for military support.\n\nPresident Joe Biden's national security adviser, Jake Sullivan, said the goal is \"to provide the necessary resources to Ukraine now for its economic energy and other needs so that it's capable of having the resilience necessary to withstand Russia's continuing aggression.\"\n\nAnother goal is to get the money to Ukraine quickly.\n\nThe French official, who was not authorized to be publicly named according to French presidential policy, said the details could be worked out \"very quickly and in any case, the $50 billion will be disbursed before the end of 2024.\"\n\nBeyond the costs of the war, the needs are great.\n\nThe World Bank's latest damage assessment of Ukraine , released in February, estimates that costs for reconstruction and recovery of the nation stand at $486 billion over the next 10 years.\n\nThe move to unlock Russia's assets comes after there was a long delay in Washington by Congress in approving military aid for Ukraine.\n\nAt an Atlantic Council event previewing the G7 summit, a former U.S. ambassador to Ukraine, John Herbst, said \"the fact that American funding is not quite reliable is a very important additional reason to go that route.\"\n\nIf Russia regained control of its frozen assets or if the immobilized funds were not generating enough interest to pay back the loan, \"then the question of burden-sharing arises,\" according to the French official.\n\nMax Bergmann, director of the Europe, Russia and Eurasia Program at the Center for Strategic and

Here's how it will work", "body": "WASHINGTON -- Leaders of the Group of Seven wealthy democracies have agreed to engineer a $50 billion loan to help Ukraine in its fight for survival. Interest earned on profits from Russia's frozen central bank assets would be used as collateral.\n\nPresident Biden puts on his sun glasses after watching a skydiving demo during the G7 world leaders summit at Borgo Egnazia, Italy, Thursday. Luca Bruno/Associated Press\n\nDetails of the deal were being hashed out by G7 leaders at their summit in Italy. The money could reach Kyiv before the end of the year, according to U.S. and French officials.\n\nPresident Biden told reporters at a news conference Thursday that the move was part of a \"historic agreement.\" Ukraine's president, Volodymyr Zelensky, said providing a loan through Russia's assets \"is a vital step forward in providing sustainable support for Ukraine in winning this war.\"\n\nRelated Biden and Zelensky sign security deal as Ukraine's leader questions how long the unity will last\n\nHere's how the plan would work:\n\nWHERE WOULD THE MONEY COME FROM?\n\nMost of the money would be in the form of a loan mostly guaranteed by the U.S. government, backed by profits being earned on roughly $260 billion in immobilized Russian assets. The vast majority of that money is held in European Union nations.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nA French official said the loan could be \"topped up\" with European money or contributions from other countries.\n\nA U.S. official who spoke on the condition of anonymity to preview the agreement said the G7 leaders' official statement due out Friday will leave the door open to trying to confiscate the Russian assets entirely.\n\nWHY NOT JUST GIVE UKRAINE FROZEN ASSETS?\n\nThat's much harder to do.\n\nFor more than a year, officials from multiple countries have debated the legality of confiscating the money and sending it to Ukraine.\n\nThe U.S. and its allies immediately froze whatever Russian central bank assets they had access to when Moscow invaded Ukraine in 2022. That basically was money being held in banks outside Russia.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe assets are immobilized and cannot be accessed by Moscow, but they still belong to Russia.\n\nWhile governments can generally freeze property or funds without difficulty, turning them into forfeited assets that can be used for the benefit of Ukraine requires an extra layer of judicial procedure, including a legal basis and adjudication in a court.\n\nThe EU instead has set aside the profits being generated by the frozen assets. That pot of money is easier to access.\n\nSeparately, the U.S. this year passed a law called the REPO Act - short for the Rebuilding Economic Prosperity and Opportunity for Ukrainians Act - that allows the Biden administration to seize $5 billion in Russian state assets in the U.S. and use them for the benefit of Kyiv. That arrangement is being worked out.\n\nHOW COULD THE LOAN BE USED AND HOW SOON?\n\nIt will be up to technical experts to work through the details.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nUkraine will be able to spend the money in several areas, including for military, economic and humanitarian needs and reconstruction, the U.S. official said.\n\nBiden's national security adviser, Jake Sullivan, said the goal is \"to provide the necessary resources to Ukraine now for its economic energy and other needs so that it's capable of having the resilience necessary to withstand Russia's continuing aggression.\"\n\nAnother goal is to get the money to Ukraine quickly.\n\nThe French official, who was not authorized to be publicly named according to French presidential policy, said the details could be worked out \"very quickly and in any case, the $50 billion will be disbursed before the end of 2024.\"\n\nBeyond the costs of the war, the needs are great.\n\nThe World Bank's latest damage assessment of Ukraine, released in February, estimates that costs for reconstruction and recovery of the nation stand at $486 billion over the next 10 years.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe move to unlock Russia's assets comes after there was a long delay in Washington by Congress in approving military aid for Ukraine.\n\nAt an Atlantic Council event previewing the G7 summit, a former U.S. ambassador to Ukraine, John Herbst, said \"the fact that American funding is not quite reliable is a very important additional reason to go that route.\"\n\nWho would be on the hook in the case of a default?\n\nIf Russia regained control of its frozen assets or if the immobilized funds were not generating enough interest to pay back the loan, \"then the question of burden-sharing arises,\" according to the French official.\n\nMax Bergmann, director of the Europe, Russia and Eurasia Program at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, said last week that there were worries among European finance ministers that their countries \"will be left holding the bag if Ukraine defaults.\"\n\nSome nations are critical of the plan to seize Russian assets.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nChinese Embassy spokesman Liu Pengyu told The Associated Press that the U.S. is \"fueling the fight and inciting confrontation.\"\n\n\"We urge the U.S. to immediately stop slapping illegal unilateral sanctions and play a constructive role in ending the conflict and restoring peace.\"\n\nAssociated Press writers Sylvie Corbet in Paris, Darlene Superville in Fasano, Italy, and Colleen Long aboard Air Force One en route to Italy contributed to this report.\n\nCopy the Story Link Related Headlines Biden and Zelensky sign security deal as Ukraine's leader questions how long the unity will last\n\nInvalid username/password.\n\nPlease check your email to confirm and complete your registration.\n\nCreate a commenting profile by providing an email address, password and display name.

(AP Photo/Alex Brandon)\n\nWhy not just give Ukraine the frozen assets?\n\nThat's much harder to do.\n\nFor more than a year, officials from multiple countries have debated the legality of confiscating the money and sending it to Ukraine.\n\nThe U.S. and its allies immediately froze whatever Russian central bank assets they had access to when Moscow invaded Ukraine in 2022. That basically was money being held in banks outside Russia.\n\nThe assets are immobilized and cannot be accessed by Moscow, but they still belong to Russia.\n\nWhile governments can generally freeze property or funds without difficulty, turning them into forfeited assets that can be used for the benefit of Ukraine requires an extra layer of judicial procedure, including a legal basis and adjudication in a court.\n\nThe EU instead has set aside the profits being generated by the frozen assets. That pot of money is easier to access.\n\nSeparately, the U.S. this year passed a law called the REPO Act -- short for the Rebuilding Economic Prosperity and Opportunity for Ukrainians Act -- that allows the Biden administration to seize $5 billion in Russian state assets in the U.S. and use them for the benefit of Kyiv. That arrangement is being worked out.\n\nFrom left, European Council President Charles Michel, German Chancellor Olaf Scholz, Canada's Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, French President Emmanuel Macron, Italian Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni, U.S. President Joe Biden, Japan's Prime Minister Fumio Kishida, Britain's Prime Minister Rishi Sunak and European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen participate in a working session at the G7, Thursday, June 13, 2024, in Borgo Egnazia, Italy. (AP Photo/Alex Brandon, Pool)\n\nHow could the loan be used and how soon?\n\nIt will be up to technical experts to work through the details.\n\nUkraine will be able to spend the money in several areas, including for military, economic and humanitarian needs and reconstruction, the U.S. official said.\n\nPresident Joe Biden's national security adviser, Jake Sullivan, said the goal is \"to provide the necessary resources to Ukraine now for its economic energy and other needs so that it's capable of having the resilience necessary to withstand Russia's continuing aggression.\"\n\nAnother goal is to get the money to Ukraine quickly.\n\nThe French official, who was not authorized to be publicly named according to French presidential policy, said the details could be worked out \"very quickly and in any case, the $50 billion will be disbursed before the end of 2024.\"\n\nBeyond the costs of the war, the needs are great.\n\nThe World Bank's latest damage assessment of Ukraine, released in February, estimates that costs for reconstruction and recovery of the nation stand at $486 billion over the next 10 years.\n\nThe move to unlock Russia's assets comes after there was a long delay in Washington by Congress in approving military aid for Ukraine.\n\nAt an Atlantic Council event previewing the G7 summit, a former U.S. ambassador to Ukraine, John Herbst, said \"the fact that American funding is not quite reliable is a very important additional reason to go that route.\"\n\nWho would be on the hook in the case of a default?\n\nIf Russia regained control of its frozen assets or if the immobilized funds were not generating enough interest to pay back the loan, \"then the question of burden-sharing arises,\" according to the French official.\n\nMax Bergmann, director of the Europe, Russia and Eurasia Program at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, said last week that there were worries among European finance ministers that their countries \"will be left holding the bag if Ukraine defaults.\"", "source": {"uri": "republicworld.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Republic World"}, "authors": [{"uri": "republic_world_digital@republicworld.com",

Topping that list are U.S. elections in November that could see the return of Republican Donald Trump to the presidency.\n\nTrump has been skeptical of providing additional military aid to Ukraine, at one point criticizing the \"endless flow of American treasure.\" He more recently has expressed openness to lending money instead and has said Ukraine's independence is important to the United States.\n\nThe U.S. and European countries have agreed to keep sanctioned Russian assets locked up until Moscow pays reparations for its invasion of Ukraine, a senior U.S. official said. That clears the way for leaders to announce the $50 billion loan package for Ukraine.\n\nThe highly anticipated agreement will leverage interest and income from more than $260 billion in frozen Russian assets, largely held in Europe, to secure a $50 billion loan from the U.S. and additional loans from other partners. Ukraine will receive the first payments sometime this year, but it will need time to use all the money, the official said. The official spoke on the condition of anonymity to preview the agreement, which will be included in the G7 leaders' communique on Friday.\n\nUkraine will be able to spend the money in several areas, including for military, economic, humanitarian and reconstruction needs, the official said.\n\nThe leaders' statement on Friday will also leave the door open to confiscating the Russian assets entirely, for which the allies have yet to secure the political will, largely citing legal and financial stability concerns.\n\nBiden was meeting later Thursday with Ukraine's Zelenskyy, their second meeting in as many weeks, to discuss a new bilateral security agreement between the U.S. and Ukraine, as the international group of wealthy democracies has been looking for new ways to bolster Ukraine's defenses against Russia. The two leaders planned a joint news conference afterward.\n\nThe agreement on how to use the frozen Russian assets to benefit Ukraine comes several months after the White House broke through a logjam in Congress that stalled approval of some $60 billion in U.S. aid for Ukraine. The delay gave Russia time to make up ground on the battlefield. Biden publicly apologized to Zelenskyy for the holdup when they met last week in France.\n\nBiden's national security adviser, Jake Sullivan, described the security pact as a \"real marker\" of the U.S. commitment to Ukraine, \"not just for this month and this year, but for the many years ahead.\"\n\nZelenskyy, on social media, said the document is \"unprecedented, as it should be for leaders who support Ukraine.\"\n\nSullivan said the agreement would not commit U.S. troops directly to Ukraine's defense against Russia's invasion. That is a red line drawn by Biden, who does not want to have the U.S. pulled into a direct conflict with nuclear-armed Moscow.\n\nThe security pact, which would remain in effect for 10 years, does not offer Ukraine any new money but includes a commitment by the U.S. to work with Congress on a source of sustainable funding for the future. Text of the agreement released by the White House also describes how the U.S. will coordinate with Ukraine and other U.S. allies and partners to make sure Ukraine has the military, intelligence and other means necessary to defend itself and deter Russian aggression.\n\nThe U.S. and Ukraine would also consult \"at the highest levels\" in the event of a future armed attack by Russia against Ukraine. Either side may terminate the agreement in writing with six months' notice, which means a future U.S. president, including Trump if elected in November, could cancel the arrangement.\n\nScores of countries and organizations are set to meet over the weekend in Switzerland to discuss peace for Ukraine. Biden is not scheduled to attend the summit, and that has disappointed Zelenskyy. Vice President Kamala Harris will represent the U.S. instead while the Democratic president attends a campaign fundraiser in Los Angeles.\n\nZelenskyy recently said the Swiss summit needs Biden's participation because other leaders value the U.S. viewpoint. He said Biden's absence \"will be only an applaud to Putin, a personal applaud to Putin.\"\n\nIt wasn't just Ukraine that occupied the allies' attention.\n\nBiden announced that Italy was joining a G7 initiative to provide development assistance to Africa, which is meant as a bulwark against growing Chinese influence on the continent. Biden said $60 billion mobilized by the U.S. and the G7 is proof \"democracies can deliver,\" as the U.S. and its allies warn that China's investments come attached with geopolitical and economic demands.\n\nThe annual summit opened Thursday in Italy's picturesque Puglia region in the south, with leaders meeting in private as they discussed the war in Gaza, support for Ukraine and other mutual concerns.\n\nThe informal grouping of industrialized democracies -- the U.S., Britain, Canada, France, German, Italy and Japan, plus European governing bodies -- meets annually. Italy holds the rotating presidency this year, and Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni is hosting her counterparts.\n\nThe trip is Biden's second outside the U.S. in as many weeks; he was in France last week for a state visit and ceremonies commemorating the 80th anniversary of the D-Day landings in World War II.\n\n-- -\n\nSuperville reported from Fasano, Italy.

Topping that list is the White House race in November that could see the return of Republican Donald Trump to the American presidency.\n\nTrump has been sceptical of providing additional military aid to Ukraine, at one point criticizing the \"endless flow of American treasure.\" He more recently has expressed openness to lending money instead and has said Ukraine's independence is important to the United States.\n\nThe US and European countries have agreed to keep sanctioned Russian assets locked up until Moscow pays reparations for its invasion of Ukraine, a senior US official said. That clears the way for leaders to announce the $50 billion loan package for Ukraine.\n\nThe highly anticipated agreement will leverage interest and income from more than $260 billion in frozen Russian assets, largely held in Europe, to secure a $50 billion loan from the US and additional loans from other partners. Ukraine will receive the first payments sometime this year, but it will need time to use all the money, the official said. The official spoke on the condition of anonymity to preview the agreement, which will be included in the G7 leaders' communique on Friday.\n\nUkraine will be able to spend the money in several areas, including for military, economic, humanitarian and reconstruction needs, the official said.\n\nThe leaders' statement on Friday will also leave the door open to confiscating the Russian assets entirely, for which the allies have yet to secure the political will, largely citing legal and financial stability concerns.\n\nBiden was meeting later Thursday with Ukraine's Zelenskyy, their second meeting in as many weeks, to discuss a new bilateral security agreement between the US and Ukraine, as the international group of wealthy democracies has been looking for new ways to bolster Ukraine's defences against Russia. The two leaders planned a joint news conference afterwards.\n\nThe agreement on how to use the frozen Russian assets to benefit Ukraine comes several months after the White House broke through a logjam in Congress that stalled approval of some $60 billion in U.S. aid for Ukraine. The delay gave Russia time to make up ground on the battlefield. Biden publicly apologized to Zelenskyy for the holdup when they met last week in France.\n\nBiden's national security adviser, Jake Sullivan, described the security pact as a \"real marker\" of the US commitment to Ukraine, \"not just for this month and this year, but for the many years ahead.\"\n\nZelenskyy, on social media, said the document is \"unprecedented, as it should be for leaders who support Ukraine.\"\n\nSullivan said the agreement would not commit US troops directly to Ukraine's defence against Russia's invasion. That is a red line drawn by Biden, who does not want to have the US pulled into a direct conflict with nuclear-armed Moscow.\n\nScores of countries and organizations are set to meet over the weekend in Switzerland to discuss peace for Ukraine. Biden is not scheduled to attend the summit, and that has disappointed Zelenskyy. Vice President Kamala Harris will represent the US instead while the Democratic president attends a campaign fundraiser in Los Angeles.\n\nZelenskyy recently said the Swiss summit needs Biden's participation because other leaders value the US viewpoint. He said Biden's absence \"will be only an applaud to Putin, a personal applaud to Putin.\"\n\nIt wasn't just Ukraine that occupied the allies' attention.\n\nBiden announced that Italy was joining a G7 initiative to provide development assistance to Africa, which is meant as a bulwark against growing Chinese influence on the continent. Biden said $60 billion mobilized by the US and the G7 is proof \"democracies can deliver,\" as the US and its allies warn that China's investments come attached with geopolitical and economic demands.\n\nThe annual summit opened Thursday in Italy's picturesque Puglia region in the south, with leaders meeting in private as they discussed the war in Gaza, support for Ukraine and other mutual concerns.\n\nThe informal grouping of industrialized democracies -- the US, Britain, Canada, France, Germany, Italy and Japan, plus European governing bodies -- meets annually. Italy holds the rotating presidency this year, and Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni is hosting her counterparts.\n\nThe trip is Biden's second outside the US in as many weeks; he was in France last week for a state visit and ceremonies commemorating the 80th anniversary of the D-Day landings in World War II.", "source": {"uri": "nationthailand.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Nation

The emotional Zelensky, dressed his customary green fatigues, embraced the Italian premier as she welcomed them among the olive trees of the luxury Boro Egnazia resort to discuss prospects for Ukraine. The pair were joined by leaders from Britain, France, Germany, Canada and Japan for two days of talks in southern Italy spanning a range of issues including Ukraine, the Middle East, climate change and Africa.\n\n'The Group of Seven in recent decades has assumed an irreplaceable role in the management of global crises, especially those that jeopardize our freedom and our democracy,' Meloni told an opening session as her counterparts arrived. As talks began, leaders announced their support for a huge new loan secured against future interest from some 300 billion euros (\u00a3253bn) of frozen Russian assets after months of gridlock - welcomed by Ukraine as a step in the right direction. The 300 billion figure has been floated for some time, though leaders in Europe had until recently shouldered much of the blame for not redirecting cash from frozen assets Ukraine's way. Agreement on $50bn is considered a significant step forward after months of gridlock, with leaders in Europe divided over how - and whether - to repurpose seized assets for Ukraine's benefit.\n\n'We have political agreement at the highest levels for this deal,' a senior Biden administration official said on condition of anonymity. 'And it is $50 billion this year that will be committed to Ukraine.' Germany's finance minister, Christian Lindner, also reacted positively to the announcement: 'Good news from the G7: another $50 billion for Ukraine.' He said it showed Russian President Vladimir Putin our 'unity, greatly helps Ukraine and relieves the burden on budgets' - but confirmed the details still needed working out. Rishi Sunak said a 50 billion US dollar support package for Ukraine that uses the profits of assets seized from Russia agreed by G7 countries is 'game-changing'.\n\n'What we're announcing is a game-changing package of support for Ukraine that will be funded from the G7, and it will be funded by the profits on the seized Russian assets,' the Prime Minister told reporters at the summit in Puglia. It will be up to technical experts to work out the exact details of how the money can be used and when, though it is expected to be spread between military, economics, humanitarian and rebuilding priorities. US President Joe Biden's national security adviser Jake Sullivan said the goal is 'to provide the necessary resources to Ukraine now for its economic energy and other needs so that it's capable of having the resilience necessary to withstand Russia's continuing aggression'.\n\nThe loan is seen as something of a middle-ground between directly handing Ukraine the assets and offering Kyiv interest accumulated on the 300 billion sum. But Ukraine nonetheless welcomed the decision as something to break the deadlock. 'Finally, we see the first step of fairness in making sure that the aggressor, and not the good people from countries that support us, are paying for Ukraine's victory,' said Kira Rudik, an opposition leader in Kyiv's parliament. 'We applaud this step. We hope that it is only the first of many more steps. And we will use this money wisely.' Zelensky, who was due to hold a joint press conference with Biden later Thursday, has meanwhile been engaged in a flurry of diplomacy aimed at boosting international support.\n\nHe spoke earlier this week in Berlin at a reconstruction conference and is set to join more than 90 countries and organizations this weekend for a peace summit in Switzerland. Zelensky said he would sign two more security agreements with Japan and the United States in Puglia. The reopening of the Russian offensive in Kharkiv, Ukraine's second largest city, has appeared to tip the balance for Western support in the last month, with donors allowing Ukraine to use their weapons against targets in Russia. Ukrainian officials in Kharkiv have said since that the green light has restored a degree of calm to the city.\n\nUkraine has also received substantial funding from the United States to help fend off the attack - only a matter of weeks since the $61bn lifeline passed at the end of April. Russia has, in turn, responded with threats against the West for the perceived escalation of the war. Putin has threatened 'densely populated territories in the West with 'grave consequences' for lending materiel support to Ukraine. Repurposing Russian funds to give to Ukraine is similarly not without controversy. Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov told reporters in December that Russia would challenge any confiscation in the courts.\n\n'If something is confiscated from us, we will look at what we will confiscate,' Peskov said. 'We will do this immediately.' In the wake of Putin's 2022 invasion of Ukraine, the United States and its allies prohibited transactions with Russia's central bank and finance ministry, blocking around $300 billion of sovereign Russian assets in the West. Like other central banks, the Russian central bank placed some of its gold and foreign exchange reserves in liquid assets such as major currencies, gold and government bonds. About half of those reserves were held in the West. The United States previously proposed that working groups from the Group of Seven (G7) major industrialized nations explore ways to seize that money. EU countries say they could generate between 2.5 and 3.0 billion euros per year for Kyiv from the profits on the interest.\n\nSpeaking in the House of Lords in April, David Cameron, the Foreign Secretary, suggested allied powers in the West were close to a breakthrough. He assured that there was an 'emerging consensus' between Western countries on how to use the assets, with the US endorsing a plan to borrow billions to send to Ukraine in loans against future interest on the Russian assets. Bill Browder, the CEO and co-founder of Hermitage Capital Management, told Radio 4 that issuing bonds on the future value of interest paid on the frozen assets was 'just overly complicating matters' and 'not the right approach'. Dismissing the legal controversy around the seizure of such assets explicitly for Ukraine, he added: 'I think it's a political issue. Should the UK taxpayers be forking out money to Ukraine before Putin forks out the money?

It's a win for President Biden, who has been pushing allies to agree to the deal, amid hesitation from some European countries.\n\nThe agreement will be formalized in the communique at the end of the summit.\n\nBut there are still key details of the plan the countries need to work out. The US is willing to make a loan of up to $50 billion, though it's unclear exactly how much the U.S. will end up lending. Other counties will pitch in to share the risk.\n\n\"We're going to move with urgency,\" a senior administration official said on a call with reporters.\n\nMORE: Biden, Zelenskyy to sign US-Ukraine security agreement at G7 summit\n\n\"Ukraine is still going to have a large financial need next year and beyond and this summit is our best chance to act collectively to close the gap... This agreement is a signal from the leading democracies of the world, that we're not going to fatigue and defending Ukraine's freedom and that Putin is not going to outlast us.\"\n\nOfficials said that while it will take time for the funds to be disbursed, they do expect the money to begin to be disbursed this calendar year.\n\nFunds will be used for military, budget, humanitarian, and reconstruction support.\n\nWhen asked by reporters about the risks associated with the loans, the senior administration official said that it can be thought of as a\"secured loan\" because of the interest that is generated from the Russian assets. The official added that there are scenarios in which the income stream \"may not flow,\" but noted that reparations could be a solution.\n\n\"How are we going to get repaid? Russia pays...the income comes from the interest stream on the immobilized asset,\" the official said. \"The principal is untouched for now, but we have full optionality to seize the principal later if the political will is there.\"\n\nThe official added that \"if there is a peace settlement, either the assets stay immobilized. And keep generating interest to repay the loans or Russia pays for the damage it's caused. Either way, there's a source of repayment.\"\n\nWhen I asked how the U.S. overcame pushback from some allies, the official said that the risks of this agreement outweighed the risk of Ukraine falling short on funding to counter Russia's offensive.\n\n\"What's the alternative? And if Ukraine was insufficiently financed, to win this war, what would be the chilling effect it would cause across Europe and the rest of the world? What would be the signal to autocrats that they can redraw borders by force? Those are the costs, I think we all agreed were unacceptable, and that's why we acted,\" the administration official said.\n\nG7 leaders agree to lend Ukraine $50 billion using frozen Russian assets originally appeared on abcnews.go.com", "source": {"uri": "aol.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Aol"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Summit_(meeting)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Summit (meeting)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ukraine", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Ukraine"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Ukraine"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russia", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Russia"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Russia"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Biden", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democracy", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Democracy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vladimir_Putin", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Vladimir Putin"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/War_reparations", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "War reparations"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Settlement_(litigation)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Settlement (litigation)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Europe", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Europe"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autocracy", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Autocracy"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Funds", "label": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Funds", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Financial_Services/Loans", "label": "dmoz/Business/Financial Services/Loans", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Financial_Services/College_Financing", "label": "dmoz/Business/Financial Services/College Financing", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Officiating", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Officiating", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Financial_Services/Commercial_Lending", "label": "dmoz/Business/Financial Services/Commercial Lending", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 70}], "image": "https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/n_5xhc2EZ2DI6ZDfG4S.Xg--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyMDA7aD02NzU-/https://media.zenfs.com/en/aol_abc_news_articles_665/a5c11396d653148a4ed3590cf6ab8a00", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9648176", "eventUri": "eng-9648176", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "date": "2013-06-", "textStart": 87, "textEnd": 94}], "sentiment": 0.2862745098039217, "wgt": 167, "relevance": 1}

The move clears the way for leaders to announce a $50 billion loan package for Kyiv at the Group of Seven summit, where President Joe Biden is set to sign a security agreement with Ukraine's Volodymyr Zelenskyy.\n\nThe highly anticipated agreement will leverage interest and income from the more than $260 billion in frozen Russian assets, largely held in Europe, to secure a $50 billion loan from the U.S. and additional loans from other partners. The first disbursements will be made this year, but it will take time for Ukraine to use all the money, the official said. The official spoke on the condition of anonymity to preview the agreement, which will be included in the G7 leaders' communique on Friday.\n\nUkraine will be able to spend the money in several areas, including for military, economic and humanitarian needs and reconstruction, the official said.\n\nThe leaders' statement will also leave the door open to confiscating the Russian assets entirely, for which the allies have yet to secure the political will, largely citing legal and financial stability concerns.\n\nBiden will meet on Thursday with Zelenskyy to discuss a bilateral security agreement between the U.S. and Ukraine, as the international group of wealthy democracies has been looking for new ways to bolster Ukraine's defenses against Russia. They planned a joint news conference afterward.\n\nThe agreement on how to use the frozen Russian assets to benefit Ukraine comes several months after the White House broke through a logjam in Congress that stalled approval of some $60 billion in U.S. aid for Ukraine. The delay gave Russia time to make up ground on the battlefield.\n\nEarlier Thursday, Biden's national security adviser, Jake Sullivan, described the security pact as a \"real marker\" of the U.S. commitment to Ukraine, \"not just for this month and this year, but for the many years ahead.\"\n\nZelenskyy, on social media, said the document is \"unprecedented, as it should be for leaders who support Ukraine.\"\n\nSullivan said the agreement would not commit U.S. troops directly to Ukraine's defense against Russia's invasion. That is a red line drawn by Biden, who does not want to have the U.S. pulled into a direct conflict with nuclear-armed Moscow.\n\nScores of countries and organizations are set to meet over the weekend in Switzerland to discuss peace for Ukraine. Biden is not scheduled to attend the summit, and that has disappointed Zelenskyy. Vice President Kamala Harris will represent the U.S. instead while the Democratic president attends a political event in Los Angeles to raise money for his reelection bid.\n\nZelenskyy recently said the summit needs Biden's participation because other leaders value the U.S. viewpoint. He said Biden's absence \"will be only an applaud to Putin, a personal applaud to Putin.\"\n\nThe G7 summit opened Thursday in Italy's picturesque Puglia region in the south with leaders meeting in private as they discussed the war in Gaza, support for Ukraine and other mutual concerns. Biden arrived late Wednesday.\n\nThe informal group of industrialized democracies -- the U.S., Britain, Canada, France, German, Italy and Japan, plus European governing bodies -- meets annually. Italy holds the rotating presidency this year, and Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni is hosting her counterparts.\n\nThe trip is Biden's second outside the U.S. in as many weeks; he was in France last week for a state visit and ceremonies commemorating the 80th anniversary of the D-Day landings in World War II.\n\nCopyright 2024 The Associated Press.

Topping that list is the White House race in November that could see the return of Republican Donald Trump to the American presidency.\n\nTrump has been sceptical of providing additional military aid to Ukraine, at one point criticising the \"endless flow of American treasure\".

Biden said USD 60 billion mobilised by the US and the G7 is proof \"democracies can deliver,\" as the US and its allies warn that China's investments come attached with geopolitical and economic demands.\n\nThe annual summit opened Thursday in Italy's picturesque Puglia region in the south, with leaders meeting in private as they discussed the war in Gaza, support for Ukraine and other mutual concerns.\n\nThe informal grouping of industrialised democracies -- the US, Britain, Canada, France, German, Italy and Japan, plus European governing bodies -- meets annually. Italy holds the rotating presidency this year, and Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni is hosting her counterparts.\n\nThe trip is Biden's second outside the US in as many weeks; he was in France last week for a state visit and ceremonies commemorating the 80th anniversary of the D-Day landings in World War II.

The $50 billion loan will be paid back with the interest income for 10 years or more or until Russia pays reparation.\n\nThe European Union in May had agreed on a less aggressive plan, which would provide Ukraine with the interest income as it is generated annually.\n\nOther G7 countries are expected to declare how much they're willing to provide to Ukraine. However, a senior administration official told reporters Thursday that the U.S. is willing to front the full $50 billion.

The bulk of the frozen money, $190 billion, is in Belgium, and much of the rest is in France and Germany.\n\nMuch is still unknown about the plan. However, the U.S. goal is to have a leaders' declaration at the end of the summit that lays out a \"framework that is not generic, that is quite specific in terms of what it would entail,\" White House national security adviser Jake Sullivan told VOA Wednesday.

G7 nations would give out loans to Ukraine that will be repaid using the profits generated by the roughly US$280 billion of blocked funds, most of which lie immobilised in Europe.\n\nThe deal is expected to generate critical support for Ukraine in the medium term and help cover its financing needs through 2025 and beyond. It's a strong signal of support for Ukraine and to Russian President Vladimir Putin that he cannot outwait the bloc in the conflict, a US official said.\n\nUnder the mechanics to be signed off in Italy, the US, European Union and other participants will each provide a loan to Ukraine with the proceeds generated by the assets over time used to pay that money back, said the people, who spoke on condition of anonymity.\n\nThe US official said the US$50 billion would be made up of a series of pledges - a \"loan syndicate\" - that are still being hashed out. The US contribution would be whatever is required to bring the total to US$50 billion, the official added.\n\nCanada is prepared to contribute C$5 billion (S$4.9 billion) in funding to the initiative, a Canadian government official said.\n\nThe loans will be structured differently on the basis of each participant's internal procedures and each will carry the risk of the loans they provide, should the frozen assets generate fewer profits than envisioned.\n\nThe final technical details will be ironed out after the summit, the people said. The aid could be used for supporting Ukraine's defence, economy and reconstruction. The specifics of the deal could change as the leaders meet on Thursday (Jun 13).\n\nFor the G7, this step sends a message to Russia that they are willing to stand by Ukraine for the long term as the war shows no signs of abating.\n\nThe proceeds from the frozen assets are estimated to be worth between 3 billion (S$4.4 billion) to 5 billion euros annually. The EU has already agreed to provide Ukraine the profits twice a year, but the US-led drive that was adopted frontloads the support, while also shielding the aid from political shifts across both sides of the Atlantic in a year of multiple elections.\n\nRepayment of the loan hinges on the assets remaining immobilised for long enough that their windfall profits can repay it, a process which will take several years. G7 leaders have repeatedly said the assets will stay blocked until Russia agrees to pay for Ukraine's reconstruction.\n\n\"I think we will have the major tentpoles of this decided, but some of the specifics left to be worked through by experts on a defined timetable,\" said US National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan on Thursday in Italy. \"That's how I anticipate this will all play out.\" BLOOMBERG", "source": {"uri": "businesstimes.com.sg", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Business Times"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_dollar", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "United States dollar"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ukraine", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Ukraine"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Ukraine"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russia", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Russia"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Russia"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Italy", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Italy"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Italy"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sovereignty", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Sovereignty"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Europe", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Europe"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canadian_dollar", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Canadian dollar"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Singapore_dollar", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Singapore dollar"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Government_of_Canada", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Government of Canada"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vladimir_Putin", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Vladimir Putin"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Union", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "European Union"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canada", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Canada"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Canada"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jake_Sullivan", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Jake Sullivan"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Security_Advisor_(United_States)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "National Security Advisor (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atlantic_Ocean", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Atlantic Ocean"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euro", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Euro"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Business/Financial_Services/Loans", "label": "dmoz/Business/Financial Services/Loans", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Business_Services/Physical_Asset_Management", "label": "dmoz/Business/Business Services/Physical Asset Management", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Financial_Services/College_Financing", "label": "dmoz/Business/Financial Services/College Financing", "wgt": 17}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Food_and_Related_Products/Frozen", "label": "dmoz/Business/Food and Related Products/Frozen", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Financial_Services/Commercial_Lending", "label": "dmoz/Business/Financial Services/Commercial Lending", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 80}], "image": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/businesstimes/a7209c73f117669622313b2ede3c76b8c1e48c43dc54632637f81af7e0d42210", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9648176", "eventUri": "eng-9648176", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-06-13", "textStart": 1984, "textEnd": 1990}], "sentiment": 0.3254901960784313, "wgt": 163, "relevance": 1}

The move clears the way for leaders to announce a $50 billion loan package for Kyiv at the Group of Seven summit, where President Joe Biden is set to sign a security agreement with Ukraine's Volodymyr Zelenskyy.\n\nThe highly anticipated agreement will leverage interest and income from the more than $260 billion in frozen Russian assets, largely held in Europe, to secure a $50 billion loan from the U.S. and additional loans from other partners. The first disbursements will be made this year, but it will take time for Ukraine to use all the money, the official said. The official spoke on the condition of anonymity to preview the agreement, which will be included in the G7 leaders' communique on Friday.\n\nUkraine will be able to spend the money in several areas, including for military, econom and humanitarian needs and reconstruction, the official said.\n\nThe leaders' statement will also leave the door open to confiscating the Russian assets entirely, for which the allies have yet to secure the political will, largely citing legal and financial stability concerns.\n\nBiden will meet on Thursday with Zelenskyy to discuss a bilateral security agreement between the U.S. and Ukraine, as the international group of wealthy democracies has been looking for new ways to bolster Ukraine's defenses against Russia. They planned a joint news conference afterward.\n\nThe agreement on how to use the frozen Russian assets to benefit Ukraine comes several months after the White House broke through a logjam in Congress that stalled approval of some $60 billion in U.S. aid for Ukraine. The delay gave Russia time to make up ground on the battlefield.\n\nEarlier Thursday, Biden's national security adviser, Jake Sullivan, described the security pact as a \"real marker\" of the U.S. commitment to Ukraine, \"not just for this month and this year, but for the many years ahead.\"\n\nZelenskyy, on social media, said the document is \"unprecedented, as it should be for leaders who support Ukraine.\"\n\nSullivan said the agreement would not commit U.S. troops directly to Ukraine's defense against Russia's invasion. That is a red line drawn by Biden, who does not want to have the U.S. pulled into a direct conflict with nuclear-armed Moscow.\n\nScores of countries and organizations are set to meet over the weekend in Switzerland to discuss peace for Ukraine. Biden is not scheduled to attend the summit, and that has disappointed Zelenskyy. Vice President Kamala Harris will represent the U.S. instead while the Democratic president attends a political event in Los Angeles to raise money for his reelection bid.\n\nZelenskyy recently said the summit needs Biden's participation because other leaders value the U.S. viewpoint. He said Biden's absence \"will be only an applaud to Putin, a personal applaud to Putin.\"\n\nThe G7 summit opened Thursday in Italy's picturesque Puglia region in the south with leaders meeting in private as they discussed the war in Gaza, support for Ukraine and other mutual concerns. Biden arrived late Wednesday.\n\nThe informal group of industrialized democracies -- the U.S., Britain, Canada, France, German, Italy and Japan, plus European governing bodies -- meets annually. Italy holds the rotating presidency this year, and Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni is hosting her counterparts.\n\nThe trip is Biden's second outside the U.S. in as many weeks; he was in France last week for a state visit and ceremonies commemorating the 80th anniversary of the D-Day landings in World War II.", "source": {"uri": "hosted.ap.org", "dataType": "news", "title": "Associated Press"},

The official spoke on the condition of anonymity to preview the agreement, which will be included in the G7 leaders' communique on Friday.\n\nThe leaders' statement will also leave the door open to confiscating the Russian assets entirely, for which the allies have yet to secure the political will, largely citing legal and financial stability concerns.\n\nBiden will meet on Thursday with Zelenskyy to discuss a bilateral security agreement between the US and Ukraine, as the international group of wealthy democracies has been looking for new ways to bolster Ukraine's defences against Russia.\n\nIt comes several months after the White House broke through a logjam in Congress that stalled approval of some USD 60 billion in US aid for Ukraine. The delay gave Russia time to make up ground on the battlefield.\n\nBiden's national security adviser, Jake Sullivan, described the pact as a \"real marker\" of the US commitment to Ukraine, \"not just for this month and this year, but for the many years ahead\".\n\nZelenskyy, on social media, said the document is \"unprecedented, as it should be for leaders who support Ukraine\".\n\nSullivan said the agreement would not commit US troops directly to Ukraine's defense against Russia's invasion.

The G7 and the EU have frozen around $325 billion of Russian assets, much of it frozen by Euroclear, an international deposit organization based in Belgium.\n\nEU countries say they could generate \u20ac2.5 to 3.0 billion a year for Kyiv from the profits on the interest. German Chancellor Olaf Scholz hailed the loan agreement as a \"historic step\" and a \"clear signal to the Russian president that he cannot simply sit this matter out.\" \"The basis has been created for Ukraine to be in a position to procure everything it needs... in the near future, in terms of weapons but also in terms of investment in reconstruction or in energy infrastructure,\" he said.\n\nZelensky, who was due to hold a joint press conference with Biden later Thursday, has been engaged in a flurry of diplomacy aimed at shoring up international support. He spoke earlier this week in Berlin at a reconstruction conference and is set to join more than 90 countries and organizations this weekend for a peace summit in Switzerland.\n\nIn Puglia on Thursday, he signed two more security agreements, with Japan and the United States.\n\nThe EU agreed earlier this year to help Kyiv using the profits from the interest on Russian central bank assets frozen by Western allies. But Washington has been pushing for more and faster help through a huge upfront loan, though it was not clear who would issue the money, and who would cover the risk.\n\nA senior Biden administration official said Thursday that the US was willing to provide up to $50 billion, but said its contribution could be \"significantly less\" as it would be a shared initiative. \"We will not be the only lenders. This will be a loan syndicate. We're going to share the risk, because we have a shared commitment to get this done,\" the official said on condition of anonymity. He would not say how much other G7 countries would contribute.\n\nThe United States did pledge long-term support for Ukraine on Thursday under a 10-year security deal being signed by Biden and Zelensky. \"Today, the United States is sending a powerful signal of our strong support for Ukraine now and into the future,\" said a US statement accompanying the security agreement, shortly before the signing ceremony at the G7 summit.\n\nThe agreement would see United States provide Ukraine with a range of military aid and training as it battles Russia's invasion, with Washington vowing to protect its ally \"now and into the future.\"\n\nThe deal, which is similar to one the United States has with Israel, commits Washington to train the Ukrainian military, provide defense equipment, carry out combined exercises and work together on defense industry cooperation. But unlike membership of the NATO alliance it does not commit the United States to send forces to defend Ukraine.", "source": {"uri": "lemonde.fr", "dataType": "news", "title": "Le Monde.fr"},

But the vast majority of the money is held in Europe, and EU leaders were hesitant to do that.\n\nInstead, the EU devised a separate plan to provide Ukraine with about $3 billion per year using the interest made by the Russian assets. Ukraine said that amount wasn't enough, and the US proposed the $50 billion loan.\n\n\"This has been something that the United States has put a lot of energy and effort into,\" National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan told reporters. \"We see proceeds from these assets as a valuable source of resources for Ukraine at a moment when Russia continues to brutalize the country, not just through military action on the front but through the attempted destruction of its energy grid and its economic vitality.\"\n\nRussia has made clear it would view either plan as the theft of its sovereign funds and is preparing to retaliate. Stealing the money makes reconciliation between Russia and the West even less likely since lifting sanctions would mean having to give assets back to Moscow that have already been spent.

The negotiations have been at the top of the agenda for the G7 leaders' summit in Puglia, Italy.\n\nWhen Russia invaded Ukraine in 2022, Western governments froze about $300 billion in Russian assets -- including money, securities, gold and bonds -- held mainly in banks in Europe.\n\nLeaders of the G7 economies have agreed to use the interest generated by the assets -- about $3 billion per year -- to help Ukraine.\n\nSome of the details are still being worked out. The United States and European countries have different proposals for distributing the money.\n\nScheherazade Rehman, a professor of international finance at George Washington University, explained it in simple terms.\n\n\"The Europeans would like to transfer them to Ukraine yearly or every two years, so spread it out. The Americans, however, want to find a way to get this money very quickly to Ukraine all at once,\" Rehman said.\n\nThe European proposal had been for about $3 billion a year go to Ukraine, and only interest from a certain part of the frozen Russian assets -- $190 billion held by a company called Euroclear in Belgium -- to be shared.\n\nThe U.S., on the other hand, wanted to give $60 billion to Ukraine up front, because Ukraine's need on the battlefield is dire. Officials had said the interest generated from the frozen Russian assets would go toward paying back that money.\n\nRehman said Washington has the weaker hand in the debate because only about $5 billion of the $300 billion in Russian assets are held in the United States -- and European nations are concerned about how they would be paid back for a big initial lump sum.\n\nThe agreement will likely be some sort of compromise between the European and U.S. proposals. But Rehman said recent elections in countries like France and Germany may also affect discussions.\n\n\"Europeans really have to get their act together at this G7 meeting because they're on shaky ground just because of the European parliamentary elections that just took place where the hard right has now got a historic toehold,\" she said.\n\n\"The Europeans are coming into this with very different footing than if this was 10 days ago.\"", "source": {"uri": "ctpublic.org", "dataType": "news", "title": "Connecticut Public"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ukraine", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Ukraine"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Ukraine"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russia", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Russia"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Russia"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russian_invasion_of_Ukraine", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Russian invasion of Ukraine"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Summit_(meeting)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Summit (meeting)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bond_(finance)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Bond (finance)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Europe", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Europe"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Security_(finance)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Security (finance)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gold", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Gold"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apulia", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Apulia"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Apulia"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Italy"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Washington_University", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "George Washington University"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Finance", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Finance"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euroclear", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Euroclear"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Parliament", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "European Parliament"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Washington,_D.C.", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Washington, D.C."}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Washington, D.C."}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/France", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "France"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Germany", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Germany"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Germany"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Belgium", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Belgium"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Belgium"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Government", "label": "dmoz/Society/Government", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Government/Multilateral", "label": "dmoz/Society/Government/Multilateral", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Martial_Arts/Russian", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Martial Arts/Russian", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Home/Personal_Finance/Unclaimed_Money", "label": "dmoz/Home/Personal Finance/Unclaimed Money", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Food_and_Related_Products/Frozen", "label": "dmoz/Business/Food and Related Products/Frozen", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 67}], "image": "https://npr.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/d309180/2147483647/strip/true/crop/3637x2046+0+341/resize/1200x675!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fnpr.brightspotcdn.com%2Fdims3%2Fdefault%2Fstrip%2Ffalse%2Fcrop%2F3637x2728%20455%200%2Fresize%2F3637x2728%21%2F%3Furl%3Dhttp%3A%2F%2Fnpr-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F42%2F21%2Fbf5c56f14c369d81030a597624c0%2Fgettyimages-2156623983.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9648176", "eventUri": "eng-9648176", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.2156862745098038, "wgt": 155, "relevance": 1}

In fact, we're standing together against this illegal aggression,\" the US president said at a joint press conference with Mr Zelensky, adding that the war had been a \"test for the world\" that the West had met.\n\nThe Ukrainian president hailed a \"historic day\" that would provide his country with sustainable support to win the war.\n\nRishi Sunak, the Prime Minister, said the loan would be \"game changing\" for Ukraine's ability to ward off Russian attacks.\n\n\"It's fantastic news, it's something that I personally and the UK have been leading on and championing for some time now,\" he said.\n\nThe deal came despite initial objections from Germany and Belgium, who had legal concerns about setting a precedent by using frozen assets to borrow.\n\nBerlin has been accused by some Western officials of hampering support for Ukraine in recent months, amid a row between politicians in the country's ruling coalition about spending public money on the war.\n\nBerlin was concerned that seizing the money could open it up to more lawsuits demanding reparations for Nazi crimes in the Second World War, The Telegraph understands.\n\nAround $220 billion of frozen Russian assets are held in the Belgian securities depository, Euroclear. Brussels had opposed interfering with the sum in any way for fear of undermining its banking sector.\n\nThe loan is the result of months of negotiation between G7 countries over how to use Russian assets frozen at the beginning of the war, most of which are in Europe.\n\nThe US had originally proposed to send the full $320 billion directly to Kyiv, but this was blocked by EU leaders over fears of legal repercussions from the Kremlin.\n\nA second version of the plan, proposed by the EU, would have transferred the $5 billion annual interest earned from the assets to Ukraine, while leaving the underlying capital untouched.\n\nThe compromise agreed on Thursday will use the profits to secure a loan that will ultimately be guaranteed by the US Treasury, officials said.\n\nUrsula von Der Leyen, the president of the European Commission, said that all members of the G7 would contribute to the loan but the extent of each country's participation was still to be worked out.\n\n'Forward leaning'\n\nA Foreign Office source said: \"It's always been the case that us and the US have been most forward leaning, needing to persuade the others.\"\n\nUS officials hope the loan plan will avoid a \"tantrum\" from Mr Zelensky at next month's Nato summit in Washington DC, where Ukraine is not expected to be offered a concrete timeline for joining the alliance.\n\nAt last year's summit in Lithuania, Nato allies agreed to \"extend an invitation to Ukraine to join the alliance when allies agree and conditions are met\". Mr Zelensky described the lack of a timeline as \"unprecedented and absurd\".\n\nIn Washington, Ukraine is set to be shown a \"well-lit bridge\" to membership, but no further assurances on when its request to join the alliance will be granted.\n\nThe announcement of the loan came as the UK announced new sanctions on a \"shadow fleet\" of Russian tankers that have been used to circumvent British and G7 restrictions on oil exports.\n\nIt follows months of concern about funding for Ukraine, which was held up in the US Congress until April amid objections from Republicans.\n\nMr Zelensky warned that without a major cash injection from the West he would be unable to fend off Russian missile attacks on civilians in cities this summer, nor retake territory lost since Vladimir Putin's invasion.\n\nCongress eventually approved a $61 billion package, but Western leaders have been exploring further funding options that could be used if Donald Trump wins this year's presidential election.\n\nMr Trump has signalled his opposition to spending US tax dollars on Ukraine, and told voters he would end the war \"in one day\" by pushing negotiations between Kyiv and Moscow.\n\nThe loan agreed on Thursday is expected to fund Ukraine's war effort into 2025. Mr Biden and Mr Zelensky separately agreed a 10-year funding guarantee for Ukraine designed to futureproof US support.\n\nMr Biden skipped a G7 dinner hosted by Sergio Mattarella, the Italian president, on Thursday night.

But we have full optionality to seize the principal later if the political will is there.\"\n\nUkrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy in a post on X had expressed hope that the asset deal would be finalized Thursday.\n\n\"The entire Ukrainian people, including our warriors, see that the G7 will always support Ukraine,\" he wrote. \"I am grateful to our partners for their belief in us and our victory.\"\n\nIn the run-up to the crucial summit, the G7 finance ministers held discussions about the legality of using some $300 billion worth of frozen assets kept in European accounts as collateral for providing a loan to Ukraine for reconstruction. France was believed to be the main holdout on the plan.\n\nPresident Biden mentioned before leaving France last week that he had reached an agreement with Mr. Macron on a plan to use the frozen Russian assets.\n\nFollowing his meetings with G7 leaders on June 13, President Biden will sign a 10-year bilateral security agreement with Mr. Zelenskyy, signifying a continuing U.S. commitment to support the war-torn country against Russian aggression.", "source": {"uri": "theepochtimes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "www.theepochtimes.com"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russia", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Russia"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Russia"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ukraine", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Ukraine"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Ukraine"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russian_invasion_of_Ukraine", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Russian invasion of Ukraine"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Presidency_of_Joe_Biden", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Presidency of Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apulia", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Apulia"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Apulia"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Italy"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/President_of_Ukraine", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "President of Ukraine"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ukrainians", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Ukrainians"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Volodymyr_Zelenskyy", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Volodymyr Zelenskyy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russo-Ukrainian_War", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Russo-Ukrainian War"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Summit_(meeting)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Summit (meeting)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emmanuel_Macron", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Emmanuel Macron"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Biden", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/France", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "France"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Business/Financial_Services/Loans", "label": "dmoz/Business/Financial Services/Loans", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Business_Services/Physical_Asset_Management", "label": "dmoz/Business/Business Services/Physical Asset Management", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Financial_Services/World_War_II_Dormant_Accounts", "label": "dmoz/Business/Financial Services/World War II Dormant Accounts", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Financial_Services/College_Financing", "label": "dmoz/Business/Financial Services/College Financing", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Food_and_Related_Products/Frozen", "label": "dmoz/Business/Food and Related Products/Frozen", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 75}], "image": "https://img.theepochtimes.com/assets/uploads/2024/06/13/id5668139-world-leaders-in-puglia-1080x720.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9648176", "eventUri": "eng-9648176", "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Apulia"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Italy"}}}, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-06-13", "textStart": 52, "textEnd": 59, "freq": 2}], "sentiment": 0.3176470588235294, "wgt": 153, "relevance": 1}

While just $3 billion in frozen funds is located in US banks, a much larger share, adding up to hundreds of billions of dollars, is located in banks in Europe.\n\nNegotiators have focused on a loan amount of about $50 billion.\n\nIt will take some time before Ukraine begins to receive this money, but the official said the effort would \"move with urgency\" and the commitment remains \"to be ready to disburse $50 billion this calendar year.\" If the loan is disbursed by the end of 2024, it would ensure the money got to Ukraine before a potential change in US presidents. Biden is facing off against former President Donald Trump in November's presidential election and Trump has refused to commit to sending additional funding to Ukraine.\n\nIn the United States, which has remained a crucial ally to Ukraine, promises of funding for defense systems and military weaponry are known to be difficult to fulfill. Earlier this year, the Republican-led Congress held up critically needed military funding for the war-torn country after Trump came out against a deal. That holdup carried with it real-world consequences to Ukraine's defense capabilities.\n\nThough the Senate would eventually pass a $95 billion aid package that included funding for Ukraine, Israel and Taiwan, Ukrainian officials have said that aid came too late for troops on the ground.\n\nThe agreement reached in Italy on Thursday would free up chests of funds in Europe that would not be hampered by further political bickering in the United States.\n\n\"The next steps are to enshrine the communiqu\u00e9 commitments with the EU 27, the full membership, then we need to write contracts between the lenders ... the recipient, which is Ukraine, and the intermediaries,\" the official said.\n\nFrom there, there will be an agreement on a disbursal schedule.\n\nShould a peace agreement be reached and the war end, there is also a plan in place: \"G7 leaders have committed that the assets will remain immobilized until Russia pays for the damages that's caused. So if there is a peace settlement, either the assets stay immobilized and keep generating interest to repay the loans, or Russia pays for the damage it's caused. Either way, there's a source of repayment.\"\n\nThis story has been updated with additional reporting.\n\nThe-CNN-Wire\n\n\u2122 & \u00a9 2024 Cable News Network, Inc., a Warner Bros.

President Joe Biden is expected to sign a significant security agreement with Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelenskyy at the summit.\n\nThis anticipated agreement will harness interest and income from more than USD 260 billion in frozen Russian assets, primarily held in Europe, to secure a USD 50 billion loan from the United States, along with additional loans from other partners.\n\n(This story has not been edited by Devdiscourse staff and is auto-generated from a syndicated feed.)", "source": {"uri": "devdiscourse.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Devdiscourse"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_dollar", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "United States dollar"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moscow", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Moscow"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Moscow"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Russia"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russia", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Russia"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Russia"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kyiv", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Kyiv"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ukraine", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Ukraine"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Ukraine"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russian_invasion_of_Ukraine", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Russian invasion of Ukraine"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Biden", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Volodymyr_Zelenskyy", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Volodymyr Zelenskyy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Europe", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Europe"}, "location": null}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Government/Multilateral", "label": "dmoz/Society/Government/Multilateral", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Financial_Services/Loans", "label": "dmoz/Business/Financial Services/Loans", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Business_Services/Physical_Asset_Management", "label": "dmoz/Business/Business Services/Physical Asset Management", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Financial_Services/World_War_II_Dormant_Accounts", "label": "dmoz/Business/Financial Services/World War II Dormant Accounts", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Financial_Services/College_Financing", "label": "dmoz/Business/Financial Services/College Financing", "wgt": 13}], "image": "https://www.devdiscourse.com/remote.axd?https://devdiscourse.blob.core.windows.net/aiimagegallery/13_06_2024_14_58_50_8210701.png?width=920&format=jpeg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9648176", "eventUri": "eng-9648176", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.4039215686274509, "wgt": 149, "relevance": 1}

That has opened up the possibility that other G7 countries could participate in the risk-sharing.\n\n\"This option... would send a strong message of international unity and cooperation to support Ukraine,\" European finance ministers said in early June in a preparatory document for a meeting.\n\nAlthough G7 member Japan's constitution prohibits it from financing the military spending of other countries, it is able to provide non-lethal equipment like anti-drone detection systems and mine extraction machines.\n\nWhat could go wrong?\n\nEU sanctions imposed on Russia, including the freezing of Russian assets, have to be renewed every six months by a unanimous vote at the Council of Europe.\n\nHungary's nationalist Prime Minister Viktor Orban, who has close ties to Putin, could block the renewal, particularly since Budapest will take over the rotating EU presidency in July.\n\nAnd critics have asked what would happen if peace was declared and the assets were unfrozen.\n\nG7 finance ministers said Moscow's assets \"will remain tied up until Russia pays for the damage it has caused to Ukraine,\" suggesting they could generate profits for a long time to come.\n\nConcerns have also been raised that third countries like China could reduce investments in the West for fear that assets could be seized.\n\nRussia is also threatening retaliation.\n\nPutin signed a decree in May authorising the confiscation in Russia of assets belonging to the United States or \"associated\" individuals.", "source": {"uri": "newindianexpress.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The New Indian

Others worry about an undermining of faith in Western banking institutions and the potential for legal backlash from Russia.\n\nHere's what to know about the assets, objections from Biden's European counterparts and why this is the new course of action:\n\nFollowing Russia's most recent invasion of Ukraine in 2022, the U.S. and its allies immediately froze whatever assets belonging to Moscow were left in Western banks. Out of about $300 billion, $5 billion was in the U.S., with the rest in Europe. The assets belong to the Russian Central Bank and were mostly in foreign currency, gold and government bonds.\n\nThe G7 leaders have spent nearly two years discussing the legality of taking the money and giving it to Ukraine as it still belongs to Moscow - even if Russian President Vladimir Putin's government can't access it.\n\nGovernments can generally freeze assets without issue, and the tactic has been used regularly to punish - or sanction - administrations and regimes that defy global norms. But converting such funds into assets that can be given away requires going through the legal system and getting a legal basis and adjudication in court.\n\nTo bypass this, the European Commission last month approved a plan to use earnings from funds held by Belgium-based securities depository Euroclear, which holds the vast majority of the Russian capital, to buy arms and ammunition to send to Ukraine. That action differed from the plan approved Thursday in how the money would be distributed and what it could be applied to. The G7 plan also brings the blessing of non-European members like Canada, Japan and the U.S.\n\nOn the U.S. side, the strategy of tapping into the money was authorized earlier this year by Congress with the passage of the Rebuilding Economic Prosperity and Opportunity for Ukrainians Act.\n\nThe measure, passed as part of a supplemental foreign aid bill that lingered in Congress before being approved earlier this year, authorizes Biden to take the frozen Russian assets sitting in U.S. financial institutions - the principal as well as the interest - and move them to a special fund designated for Ukraine. The exact process is still being determined.\n\nWhile most stakeholders agree that Ukraine aid must go out quickly, concerns from Biden's European counterparts over the amount of money distributed, how it will be used and its legality all threatened the plan.\n\nScheherazade Rehman, the director of the European Union Research Center and professor of international affairs and international business at George Washington University, says the European leaders were against Biden's plan on multiple fronts: that it might be legally questionable, that it would set a new precedent and that it could jeopardize stability for the financial markets.\n\nShe notes that several countries and global institutions - including France, Germany, Indonesia, Italy, Japan and Saudi Arabia as well as European Central Bank President Christine Lagarde think that confiscating the whole amount \"sets a very bad precedent - and it's actually a violation of sovereignty.\"\n\n\"They're afraid that it could lead to, legitimately, several issues: legal challenges from Russia or others, financial instability - which is a real possibility - and then possibly retaliatory seizures of Western assets abroad, less of a likely issue.\"\n\nWill Pomeranz, director of the Wilson Center's Kennan Institute, adds that several lawyers and bankers are concerned about taking the assets and essentially redistributing them to Ukraine because \"these assets were protected essentially when the Russians invested in these Western banks.\" He adds that it will affect whether other countries will want to invest in Western banks in the future.\n\nRehman says other leaders instead proposed a plan where every two years they would transfer a set amount of money instead of shifting it all at once in the form of the loan. She adds that the transfer of funds would continue for the next decade or however long the war lasts.\n\nOther leaders also did not want to use the entire amount of the assets but rather the funds that are sitting with Euroclear, she says, adding that the rest of the money is spread out and harder to access.\n\nWhen it comes to exactly what the money would go toward, Rehman says the bulk of it would fund military aid and a portion will pay for the reconstruction of Ukraine.\n\n\"What the European plan is saying is that 90% of the money will be used for buying arms for Ukraine and they'll do it through something called the EPF, which is a European peace facility. It's an EU institutional structure to finance military aid and other military missions,\" says Rehman. \"So they're going to funnel it to an official EU institution. The other remaining 10% will be used for reconstruction and what we call non lethal purchases.\"\n\nShe adds there is a split to satisfy countries like Ireland, Austria, Cyprus and Malta, which are all militarily neutral.\n\nThe potential plan has already angered Moscow, with officials seeing the freezing of the assets as theft. Should the plan be adopted, Russia has already threatened to retaliate.\n\nRussian foreign ministry spokesperson Maria Zakharova said Thursday during a news conference in Moscow that the plan \"will not lead the West to anything good.\"\n\nShe called the plan an \"illegal initiative\" that \"threatens to completely unbalance the financial system and create cataclysmic crises.\"\n\n\"There is enough European property and money in Russia ... and inevitable retaliatory measures will be extremely painful for Brussels,\" she added, referencing the EU capital.\n\nPomerantz says retaliation could take the form of Russia attempting to strip whatever Western assets that still remain in the country.\n\n\"The initial response will be in Western financial institutions, and we will just have to wait and see to what extent there is money left in the Russian Federation that Russia can redistribute or take hold of.\"\n\nAs Russian forces make advancements on the battlefield and Ukraine support is meeting an undercurrent of political resistance among hard-line Republicans in the U.S. and elsewhere, Western leaders have been left working against the clock to hammer out a plan.\n\nDomestically, Republicans aligned with former President Donald Trump have been outspoken in their opposition to providing Ukraine with what they describe as a blank check. His reelection could mean either an end or a dramatic reduction in U.S. aid. And some far-right parties in Europe, which gained in EU parliamentary elections, oppose additional assistance, also imperiling the future of the bloc's aid to Ukraine.\n\nWith this in mind, Pomerantz said the plan agreed to Thursday is \"much more palatable\" because \"the money is not coming from the West and Europe and the United States but is coming from assets that are actually in Western banks and Western financial institutions.\"\n\nHe says the arrangement will also send a message to Moscow that it will be held responsible and accountable for the damage it has done to Ukraine.\n\nRehman adds that the plan will maximize the impact of the revenue going to Ukraine \"not only in terms of actual money given for the war effort but also sending a signal to you saying we support you - and also sending a signal to Russia.\"\n\nShe adds that with the November election coming up and the possibility of Trump returning to the White House, it is clear that Biden is \"future-proofing\" or safeguarding Ukrainian aid for the years ahead.\n\nIn recent days, Biden has announced a hefty slate of new actions pledging U.S. support for Ukraine. He recently returned from a trip to France where support for the Eastern European country remained a top priority. Biden met with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy as a $225 million security assistance package was announced.\n\nBiden vowed that the U.S. is \"not going to walk away from you\" and publicly apologized for the months-long delay by Congress in approving additional support.\n\nBut perhaps most significantly, his administration was finalizing a 10-year pact to support Ukraine's defense - a bold, yet largely symbolic, move that could be undone by future presidents.\n\n\"This is an agreement on security and thus on the protection of human life. This is an agreement on cooperation and thus on how our nations will become stronger. This is an agreement on steps to guarantee sustainable peace and therefore it benefits everyone in the world,\" Zelenskyy said at a joint press conference with Biden.\n\nFor his part, Biden also doubled down on the lasting nature of U.S. support for Ukraine.\n\n\"We will say it again,\" he said. \"We're going to stand with Ukraine.\"", "source": {"uri": "usnews.com", "dataType": "news",

Earlier it was reported, that the G7 countries have agreed on a loan structure based on the size of their economies to provide about $50 billion in new aid package to Ukraine, using Russia's frozen assets.Under the mechanism to be signed during the G7 summit in Italy, the United States, the European Union and other participants will provide Ukraine with a loan, and the income received from the Russian assets over time will be used to return this money.At the same time, each G7 and EU member that provides loans to Kiev at the expense of the Russian assets will bear risks, the news agency added.Later in the day, the G7 member states finalized a provisional loan deal at the sherpa level, the Financial Times reported on Thursday, citing an agreed G7 statement.\"It's done.

However, the tone was already set. Once again, the group of the most advanced democracies is gearing up to take aim at Russia -- specifically Russian money.\n\nThe discussions would focus on using Russian assets to provide financial aid to Ukraine. Reports say the deal is done. Some last-minute details are still being finalised, but the US is confident of making an announcement during the G7 summit.\n\n\"We will announce new steps to unlock the value of the immobilised Russian sovereign assets to benefit Ukraine and to help them recover from the destruction that Putin's army has caused,\" said John Kirby, US National Security Council spokesperson.\n\nThis move could have wide-ranging implications for the global financial system, as it could undermine the world's trust in it.\n\nWhen Russia invaded Ukraine in 2022, they froze Russian government assets worth 280 billion dollars that were parked in the West, mostly in three countries -- Belgium, France, and Germany. The money is lying with the banks in the form of securities and cash. These assets have been frozen, which means Russia cannot access these funds.\n\nBut the money is lying in the bank and generating interest -- just like a fixed deposit in a bank. These assets could now be mobilised for Ukraine through a loan. The Americans have put forward a plan for this.\n\nAs per the plan, the G7 will extend Ukraine a $50 billion loan to be paid back over the years by the interest on the frozen Russian assets. Kyiv may not end up repaying it; the repayments could be financed through the earnings of the Russian assets. The interest generated by Russian government assets lying in the West. Every year, these assets could generate around 2.7 billion to 3.7 billion dollars in interest.\n\nEuropean leaders are calling this a solidarity package for Ukraine.\n\nThis plan has three benefits for the West:\n\nFirst, it ensures an uninterrupted flow of funds for Ukraine.\n\nSecond, Russia loses the profits. However, its core investment stays intact, but Moscow will lose the earnings from interest.\n\nThird, Russian assets will become bargaining chips for future negotiations with Moscow for potential peace talks.\n\nWhat can Russia do?\n\nBack in March, Russia threatened to sue the West. The Kremlin had said that if profits from its assets were diverted, all possible judicial mechanisms would be used.\n\nThe G7 bloc's lawyers say Russians can defend themselves in court, so there could be a legal face-off. But Valdimir Putin is going a step further. Last month, the Russian president signed a decree for $290 billion in US and allied assets. This gave the Russian state some new powers: if Moscow wants, it can simply seize any Western asset in Russia, including any properties, real estate, securities, and even Western stakes in American companies.\n\nThe Russian state could now step in and simply take them over. Moscow claims it has identified some assets already. Approximately $290 billion is owned by Western interests. So if the G7 goes ahead with its plan, Moscow will respond in kind. One can expect the face-off to escalate.\n\nThis faceoff sends a troubling signal to the rest of the world. The financial assets of sovereign nations are being weaponized. This is leading to unintended consequences.\n\nCentral banks around the world are feeling nervous, wondering if their assets held by western institutions will be frozen tomorrow. This is a clear vulnerability. So, they are turning to alternatives. Central banks are increasing their gold reserves, and they now prefer to hold them within their own borders.\n\nLast year, a survey came out that showed a clear shift. In 2020, 50 percent of the world's central banks held a part of their gold reserves at home, and by 2023, this number had shot up to 68 percent, and this number is likely to increase further to 74 percent by 2028.\n\nIndia's central bank, too, is part of this shift. Recently, India's RBI shifted around 100 metric tonnes of its gold from the UK back to India, which was a rare move.\n\nSince 1991, the RBI hasn't thought about executing such a transfer, but only now. As per reports, RBI has 822 metric tonnes of gold in its reserve, which is split almost evenly, with around 50 percent of it being stored abroad while the other half stays in India.\n\nThe Indian central bank said that it had the space to store the gold within the country, so it decided to use it without mentioning it. There was no mention of the geopolitical tensions. But that goes without saying.\n\nThese tensions are influencing the decisions of central banks around the world. Clearly, they are losing trust in the international banking system. The G7 may succeed in transferring Russian money to Ukraine, but it should be prepared for a blowback.", "source": {"uri": "firstpost.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Firstpost"}, "authors": [],

The loan is expected to be delivered by the end of 2024, which would ensure the money would get to Ukraine before a potential change in US presidents. President Joe Biden is facing off against former President Donald Trump in November's US presidential election and Trump has refused to commit to sending additional funding to Ukraine.\n\nWestern nations froze Russia's assets in bank accounts located within Europe and the US as part of a massive wave of sanctions enacted after Vladimir Putin ordered the invasion of Ukraine in 2022. Hundreds of billions of assets are frozen in Europe, with just a small amount - roughly $3 billion - located in banks in the US.\n\nThat led European officials to raise concerns that they could be on the hook if Ukraine failed to pay back the loan, the investments generated less profit, or the assets get delivered back to Russia as part of a peace deal.\n\nA senior US official says negotiators, who have continued working out final details in Brindisi, Italy, ahead of the G7 leaders' arrival, have structured the deal so that all countries participating share the risk.\n\n\"This loan will mostly be provided by the United States and will be supplemented by money from Europe,\" an \u00c9lys\u00e9e source told journalists at a briefing.\n\n\"Countries are still discussing how to partition the cost if the profits from Russian assets are not sufficient to cover the need,\" the French source added.\n\nThe source spoke on the condition of anonymity, citing professional norms in Europe.\n\n\"The $50 billion will be transferred before the end of 2024,\" the source said.\n\nUS national security adviser Jake Sullivan told reporters traveling with Biden to the summit that the discussions were moving toward a \"common understanding\" of how the loan would be structured, though multiple countries would participate and work out the technical details after the summit.\n\n\"I believe that we are making good progress in generating an outcome in which those proceeds from those frozen assets can be put to good use,\" Sullivan said.\n\nG7 countries began brainstorming ways to identify longer-term sources of funding for Ukraine in late 2023, as lawmakers delayed in greenlighting the White House's funding request. Amid doubts on future political and financial wherewithal to continue spending taxpayer money in Ukraine - and facing a calendar stacked with elections on both sides of the Atlantic - officials began zeroing in on the Russian money gathering dust and interest payments in accounts around the world.\n\nBeginning in early 2023, working groups led by Treasury, State and the National Security Council officials held three, two-hour meetings each week beginning at 7 a.m. ET to accommodate time differences around the world.\n\nBanks and clearing houses that hold and process the funds raised concerns that simply taking the money would open up companies and countries alike to lawsuits and retribution from Russia. Utilizing the profits generated while Russia has no access to the money was conceived as a workaround that satisfied international legal concerns.\n\n\"It's the difference between someone seizing your home and renting out your home,\" said Tim Adams, president and CEO of the Institute of International Finance.\n\nThe United States has provided $175 billion to Ukraine since Russia's invasion, a total that now surpasses the $171 billion in 2024 dollars that the US provided to the Marshall Plan to rebuild Europe after World War II. The European Union has delivered $107 billion in aid.\n\nThe World Bank estimates that Ukraine would need more than $500 billion to rebuild, a figure that climbs each day the war continues.\n\nCNN's Xiaofei Xu contributed to this report.\n\nThe-CNN-Wire\n\n\u2122 & \u00a9 2024 Cable News Network, Inc., a Warner Bros.

It's a win for President Joe Biden, who has been pushing allies to agree to the deal, amid hesitation from some European countries.\n\nThe agreement will be formalized in the communique at the end of the summit.\n\nBut there are still key details of the plan the countries need to work out. The U.S. is willing to make a loan of up to $50 billion, though it's unclear exactly how much the U.S. will end up lending. Other counties will pitch in to share the risk.\n\n\"We're going to move with urgency,\" a senior administration official said on a call with reporters.\n\n\"Ukraine is still going to have a large financial need next year and beyond and this summit is our best chance to act collectively to close the gap... This agreement is a signal from the leading democracies of the world, that we're not going to fatigue and defending Ukraine's freedom and that Putin is not going to outlast us,\" the official said.\n\nOfficials said that while it will take time for the funds to be disbursed, they do expect the money to begin to be disbursed this calendar year.\n\nFunds will be used for military, budget, humanitarian, and reconstruction support.\n\nWhen asked by reporters about the risks associated with the loans, the senior administration official said that it can be thought of as a \"secured loan\" because of the interest that is generated from the Russian assets.

Russia pays...the income comes from the interest stream on the immobilized asset,\" the official said. \"The principal is untouched for now, but we have full optionality to seize the principal later if the political will is there.\"\n\nThe official added that \"if there is a peace settlement, either the assets stay immobilized. And keep generating interest to repay the loans or Russia pays for the damage it's caused. Either way, there's a source of repayment.\"\n\nWhen asked how the U.S. overcame pushback from some allies, the official said that the risks of this agreement outweighed the risk of Ukraine falling short on funding to counter Russia's offensive.\n\n\"What's the alternative? And if Ukraine was insufficiently financed, to win this war, what would be the chilling effect it would cause across Europe and the rest of the world? What would be the signal to autocrats that they can redraw borders by force?

(AP Photo/Alex Brandon)BORGO EGNAZIA, Italy (AP) - The United States and European countries have agreed to lock up sanctioned Russian assets until Moscow pays reparations for its invasion of Ukraine, a senior U.S. official said Thursday. The move clears the way for leaders to announce a $50 billion loan package for Kyiv at the Group of Seven summit. The highly anticipated agreement will leverage interest and income from the more than $260 billion in frozen Russian assets, largely held in Europe, to secure a $50 billion loan from the U.S. and additional loans from other partners. The first disbursements will be made this year, but it will take time for Ukraine to use all the money, the official said. The official spoke on the condition of anonymity to preview the agreement, which will be included in the G7 leaders' communique on Friday.

Watch in the player above.\n\nThe highly anticipated agreement will leverage interest and income from the more than $260 billion in frozen Russian assets, largely held in Europe, to secure a $50 billion loan from the U.S. and additional loans from other partners. The first disbursements will be made this year, but it will take time for Ukraine to use all the money, the official said. The official spoke on the condition of anonymity to preview the agreement, which will be included in the G7 leaders' communique on Friday.\n\nThe leaders' statement will also leave the door open to confiscating the Russian assets entirely, for which the allies have yet to secure the political will, largely citing legal and financial stability concerns.\n\nBiden will meet on Thursday with Zelenskyy to discuss a bilateral security agreement between the U.S. and Ukraine, as the international group of wealthy democracies has been looking for new ways to bolster Ukraine's defenses against Russia.\n\nIt comes several months after the White House broke through a logjam in Congress that stalled approval of some $60 billion in U.S. aid for Ukraine. The delay gave Russia time to make up ground on the battlefield.\n\nBiden's national security adviser, Jake Sullivan, described the pact as a \"real marker\" of the U.S. commitment to Ukraine, \"not just for this month and this year, but for the many years ahead.\"\n\nZelenskyy, on social media, said the document is \"unprecedented, as it should be for leaders who support Ukraine.\"\n\nSullivan said the agreement would not commit U.S. troops directly to Ukraine's defense against Russia's invasion. That is a red line drawn by Biden, who does not want to have the U.S. pulled into a direct conflict with nuclear-armed Moscow.\n\nScores of countries and organizations are set to meet over the weekend in Switzerland to discuss peace for Ukraine. Biden is not scheduled to attend the summit, a decision that has disappointed Zelenskyy. Vice President Kamala Harris will represent the U.S. instead.\n\nZelenskyy recently said the summit needs Biden's participation because other leaders value the U.S. viewpoint.

The UN General Assembly, by a vote of 94-14, declared that Russia was responsible for the war and war reparations.

G7 Calls for War Crimes Trials and Reparations, F-16 Pilots Start Training, and Russia Is Invaded\n\nThe West Will Make Russia Pay to Rebuild Ukraine and This Is How That Will Happen\n\nThe G7 action is one of four asset confiscation plans in some stage of finalization.\n\nThe EU plan is the simplest.\n\nThe plan focuses on the interest earned on approximately $210 billion worth of Russian central bank assets currently frozen in EU member states, primarily at the Euroclear settlement house in Belgium. The principal would be left secure, but the estimated $3.2 billion annual interest would be transferred to a dedicated fund.\n\nAbout 90% would be allocated to support Ukraine's ongoing military effort against the Russian invasion. This could involve financing arms purchases, ammunition supplies, and potentially even training programs. The remaining 10% would be directed towards bolstering Ukraine's war-torn economy and reconstruction efforts. This could involve budgetary support or humanitarian aid programs. When the war ends this money would flow into reconstruction projects.\n\nThe EU plan only covers funds earned after February 15, 2024. Funds held on those accounts before February 15 will remain in escrow at Euroclear. There are still problems to be resolved. Putin's Mini-Mes in Slovakia and Hungary don't want to purchase weaponry or do much of anything. Ireland and Malta are constitutionally prohibited from buying arms for transfer to third parties.\n\nBACKGROUND: EU Will Use Frozen Russian Assets to Fund Ukraine's Defense and Russia Retaliates - RedState\n\nThe Rebuilding Economic Prosperity and Opportunity for Ukrainians Act (REPO Act) was introduced by Senators Jim Risch (R-Idaho) and Sheldon Whitehouse (D-R.I.) in conjunction with Representatives Michael McCaul (R-Texas) and Marcy Kaptur (D-Ohio).\n\nUnder the provisions of this bill, the president may confiscate Russian sovereign assets directly or indirectly owned by the Russian government, its central bank, or the Russian Direct Investment Fund. This money would go to a Ukraine Support Fund administered by the State Department through the US Agency for International Development. The funds would be used for reconstruction and humanitarian assistance.\n\nBACKGROUND:\n\nSenate Panel Votes to Sic the Repo Man on Frozen Russian Assets\n\nSad Faces in the Kremlin As the House Sends Ukraine Aid Package to Almost Certain Senate Approval - RedState\n\nThe UK plan isn't fully developed, but it may be the most aggressive and the simplest. The UK government will confiscate Russian assets worth about $29 billion in the UK. They will loan -- Trump should like this -- Ukraine the cash value of the assets using those assets as security. At the end of the war, Russia can pay reparations equal to the asset value to Ukraine...or the UK will liquidate them.\n\nThe US has proposed that the G7 pool the $280 billion in frozen Russian sovereign assets and use those as collateral to create $50 billion in bonds that are being called Freedom Bonds. These bonds would generate interest payments to the bondholders to the tune of about $4 billion per year from interest on the underlying assets. When the war draws to a close, Russia could redeem its assets by paying their value in reparations to Ukraine. If it refuses, the assets would be sold to redeem the bonds.\n\nBACKGROUND: EU Will Use Frozen Russian Assets to Fund Ukraine's Defense and Russia Retaliates - RedState\n\nThe fact that the G7 has agreed makes the EU plan much easier for everyone to move forward. Janet Yellen was one of the prime movers behind the G7 agreement, which means that we will start seeing the REPO Act take shape.\n\nTo bring Putin's War in Ukraine to a successful end, Russian material and financial assets must be put at risk, and Putin and his inner circle have to know they will feel the pain. This is just the first, easy hurdle that has to be crossed.", "source": {"uri": "redstate.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Redstate"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

The new loan comes at a crucial moment in the war, when Russia has the momentum on the battlefield.\n\nThe loan is expected to be repaid using interest earned on $300 billion in frozen Russian assets, which are mostly in a financial institution in Belgium. In our Opinion section, Janet Yellen, the U.S. treasury secretary, explained how the loan will work.\n\nPresident Biden also signed a 10-year security pact with Ukraine's government, to show a long-term U.S. commitment to the country. It's designed to be a bridge to Ukraine's membership in NATO. Japan signed a 10-year security agreement with Ukraine as well, which included a pledge of $4.5 billion.\n\nSeparately, NATO's defense chiefs gathered yesterday in Brussels to pledge additional weapons to Kyiv. They also met to prepare long-term military commitments to be announced next month at a summit in Washington.

G-7 nations would give out loans to Ukraine that will be repaid using the profits generated by the roughly $280 billion of blocked funds, most of which lie immobilized in Europe.\n\nThe deal is expected to generate critical support for Ukraine in the medium term and help cover its financing needs through 2025 and beyond.\n\nUnder the mechanics to be signed off in Italy, the US, European Union and other participants will each provide a loan to Ukraine with the proceeds generated by the assets over time used to pay that money back, said the people, who spoke on condition of anonymity.\n\nThe loans will be structured differently on the basis of each participant's internal procedures and each will carry the risk of the loans they provide, should the frozen assets generate fewer profits than envisioned.\n\nThe final technical details will be ironed out after the summit, the people said. The aid could be used for supporting Ukraine's defense, economy and reconstruction. The specifics of the deal could change when the leaders meet on Thursday.\n\nFor the G-7, this step sends a message to Russia that they are willing to stand by Ukraine for the long term as the war shows no signs of abating.\n\nThe proceeds from the frozen assets are estimated to be worth between \u20ac3 billion to \u20ac5 billion annually. The EU has already agreed to provide Ukraine the profits twice a year, but the US-led drive that was adopted frontloads the support, while also shielding the aid from political shifts across both sides of the Atlantic in a year of multiple elections.\n\nRepayment of the loan hinges on the assets remaining immobilized for long enough that their windfall profits can repay it, a process which will take several years. G-7 leaders have repeatedly said the assets will stay blocked until Russia agrees to pay for Ukraine's reconstruction.\n\n\"I think we will have the major tentpoles of this decided, but some of the specifics left to be worked through by experts on a defined timetable,\" said US National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan on Thursday in Italy. \"That's how I anticipate this will all play out.\"\n\n--With assistance from Jennifer Jacobs and Josh Wingrove.", "source": {"uri": "bnnbloomberg.ca", "dataType": "news", "title": "BNN"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ukraine", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Ukraine"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Ukraine"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Italy", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Italy"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Italy"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bloomberg_News", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Bloomberg News"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sovereignty", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Sovereignty"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Union", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "European Union"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Europe", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Europe"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russia", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Russia"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Russia"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euro", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Euro"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jake_Sullivan", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Jake Sullivan"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Security_Advisor_(United_States)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "National Security Advisor (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atlantic_Ocean", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Atlantic Ocean"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Business/Financial_Services/Loans", "label": "dmoz/Business/Financial Services/Loans", "wgt": 16}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Business_Services/Physical_Asset_Management", "label": "dmoz/Business/Business Services/Physical Asset Management", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Financial_Services/College_Financing", "label": "dmoz/Business/Financial Services/College Financing", "wgt": 18}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Food_and_Related_Products/Frozen", "label": "dmoz/Business/Food and Related Products/Frozen", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Financial_Services/Commercial_Lending", "label": "dmoz/Business/Financial Services/Commercial Lending", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 51}], "image": "http://www.bnnbloomberg.ca/img/tsn/logos/tsn-logo.png", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9648176", "eventUri": "eng-9648176", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.2705882352941176, "wgt": 132, "relevance": 1}

It's a win for President Biden, who has been pushing allies to agree to the deal, amid hesitation from some European countries.\n\nThe agreement will be formalized in the communique at the end of the summit.\n\nBut there are still key details of the plan the countries need to work out. The US is willing to make a loan of up to $50 billion, though it's unclear exactly how much the U.S. will end up lending. Other counties will pitch in to share the risk.\n\n\"We're going to move with urgency,\" a senior administration official said on a call with reporters.\n\n\"Ukraine is still going to have a large financial need next year and beyond and this summit is our best chance to act collectively to close the gap... This agreement is a signal from the leading democracies of the world, that we're not going to fatigue and defending Ukraine's freedom and that Putin is not going to outlast us.\"\n\nOfficials said that while it will take time for the funds to be disbursed, they do expect the money to begin to be disbursed this calendar year.\n\nFunds will be used for military, budget, humanitarian, and reconstruction support.\n\nWhen asked by reporters about the risks associated with the loans, the senior administration official said that it can be thought of as a\"secured loan\" because of the interest that is generated from the Russian assets. The official added that there are scenarios in which the income stream \"may not flow,\" but noted that reparations could be a solution.\n\n\"How are we going to get repaid? Russia pays...the income comes from the interest stream on the immobilized asset,\" the official said. \"The principal is untouched for now, but we have full optionality to seize the principal later if the political will is there.\"\n\nThe official added that \"if there is a peace settlement, either the assets stay immobilized. And keep generating interest to repay the loans or Russia pays for the damage it's caused. Either way, there's a source of repayment.\"\n\nWhen I asked how the U.S. overcame pushback from some allies, the official said that the risks of this agreement outweighed the risk of Ukraine falling short on funding to counter Russia's offensive.\n\n\"What's the alternative? And if Ukraine was insufficiently financed, to win this war, what would be the chilling effect it would cause across Europe and the rest of the world? What would be the signal to autocrats that they can redraw borders by force? Those are the costs, I think we all agreed were unacceptable, and that's why we acted,\" the administration official said.", "source": {"uri": "abcnews.go.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "ABC News"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Summit_(meeting)", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Summit (meeting)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ukraine", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Ukraine"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Ukraine"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Biden", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russia", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Russia"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Russia"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Humanitarianism", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Humanitarianism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democracy", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Democracy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vladimir_Putin", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Vladimir Putin"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/War_reparations", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "War reparations"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chilling_effect", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Chilling effect"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Settlement_(litigation)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Settlement (litigation)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Europe", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Europe"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autocracy", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Autocracy"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Funds", "label": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Funds", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Financial_Services/Loans", "label": "dmoz/Business/Financial Services/Loans", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Financial_Services/College_Financing", "label": "dmoz/Business/Financial Services/College Financing", "wgt": 16}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Officiating", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Officiating", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Financial_Services/Commercial_Lending", "label": "dmoz/Business/Financial Services/Commercial Lending", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 71}], "image": "https://i.abcnewsfe.com/a/f133e750-d869-4c72-bd7a-4a2d6427ccc4/g7-03-gty-ml-240613_1718283268559_hpMain_16x9.jpg?w=1600", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9648176", "eventUri": "eng-9648176", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.2470588235294118, "wgt": 111, "relevance": 1}

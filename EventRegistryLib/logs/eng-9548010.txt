They broke the tie with a coin toss.\n\nThe Las Vegas Raiders made some franchise-defining picks in the 2024 NFL Draft. The Raiders drafted sensational tight end Brock Bowers and versatile interior offensive lineman Jackson Powers-Johnson in the first two rounds, both of whom should start right away. However, one draft prospect recently explained how the Raiders could have easily had a very different start to the draft.\n\nOn a recent episode of The Next Round, Detroit Lions cornerback Terrion Arnold spoke about his NFL Draft experience. Arnold dropped several interesting details, including a twist of fate that almost made him a Las Vegas Raider.\n\n\"[Detroit] knew that the Raiders, there was a possibility that they took me,\" Arnold said. \"And actually the Raiders' coach they called me after the draft and they were like we actually had a coin toss between you and Brock Bowers. It landed on him.\"\n\nArnold was surprised to receive the news that his NFL landing spot essentially was decided by a coin toss.\n\nHe went on to explain how, after the Raiders passed on him, the Lions kept making calls and trying to trade up for him.\n\n\"After the Raiders passed, [Detroit thought] okay we have to get up there past Jacksonville,\" Arnold explained. \"Actually Brad he was like they were trying to trade all the way up to 15 or 16 to get me. I mean it's just one of those things where you go where you're wanted.\"\n\nIt appears that the Raiders were in a win-win situation because Terrion Arnold would have been an excellent pick at 13th overall. The Raiders are projected to start Nate Hobbs and Jack Jones at outside cornerback in 2024. Had Las Vegas drafted Arnold, they would have a new CB1 with high upside.\n\nPreviewing the 2024 Las Vegas Raiders offense: how will Raiders deploy Brock Bowers?\n\nCoin toss or no, Las Vegas is thrilled to have Brock Bowers as a centerpiece of their offense moving forward.\n\nThe question remains: how will they deploy Bowers?\n\nBowers is a rare talent at the tight end position. He dominated during his entire collegiate career, including during his rookie season at Georgia. Las Vegas must have been impressed that Bowers could walk into an SEC program and take over right away. He'll be asked to do something similar in Vegas, whose offense could use another major weapon.\n\nBowers is capable of lining up in-line as a traditional Y tight end, or flexing out into the slot and playing a big slot role. He also boasts blazing speed, which makes him dangerous as a pass catcher in either role.\n\nLas Vegas drafted Michael Mayer in the second round of the 2023 NFL Draft, which could make the decision somewhat easy. Mayer excels as a in-line tight end, which could push Bowers into the slot if both players are on the field at the same time. The team could also run a high volume of 12 personnel. This would allow Vegas to have all of their best offensive weapons on the field at the same time.\n\nRaiders fans can't wait to see what Bowers can do later this fall.", "source": {"uri": "clutchpoints.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "ClutchPoints"}, "authors": [{"uri": "ben_strauss@clutchpoints.com", "name": "Ben Strauss", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brock_Bowers", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Brock Bowers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Las_Vegas_Raiders", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Las Vegas Raiders"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coin_flipping", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Coin flipping"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Draft_(sports)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Draft (sports)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Las_Vegas", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Las Vegas"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Las Vegas"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lineman_(gridiron_football)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Lineman (gridiron football)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Detroit_Lions", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Detroit Lions"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cornerback", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Cornerback"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Detroit", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Detroit"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Detroit"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jackson,_Mississippi", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Jackson, Mississippi"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Jackson, Mississippi"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jacksonville,_Florida", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Jacksonville, Florida"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Jacksonville, Florida"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nate_Hobbs", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Nate Hobbs"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rookie", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Rookie"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Southeastern_Conference", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Southeastern Conference"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catcher", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Catcher"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Georgia_(U.S._state)", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Georgia (U.S. state)"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Georgia (U.S. state)"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Collecting/Coins", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Collecting/Coins", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Antiques_and_Collectibles/Coins", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Antiques and Collectibles/Coins", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/CAD_and_CAM/2D_Drafting", "label": "dmoz/Computers/CAD and CAM/2D Drafting", "wgt": 9}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Fantasy", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Fantasy", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/CAD_and_CAM/Associations", "label": "dmoz/Computers/CAD and CAM/Associations", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 93}], "image": "https://wp.clutchpoints.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/7379612130.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9548010", "eventUri": "eng-9548010", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.08235294117647052, "wgt": 225, "relevance": 1}

It wasn't that Brock Bowers wasn't a great prospect -- it was just the Raiders had other glaring needs on their offensive line, at cornerback, and even at quarterback.\n\nHowever, according to a recent report by ESPN's Jeremy Fowler, some NFL scouts believe the Raiders selected the best player in the entire draft -- even better than the Chicago Bears' selection of quarterback Caleb Williams and the Cardinals' selection of all-everything wideout Marvin Harrison, Jr.\n\nRelated: Las Vegas Raiders shock NFL Draft, select TE Brock Bowers in first round\n\n\"In fact, multiple NFL scouts told me that Bowers might have been the best overall player in the entire field, but positional needs pushed him out of the top 10,\" Fowler said, writing about results from the draft for all 32 NFL teams.\n\nBowers was considered a consensus Top 10 pick in the 2024 NFL Draft, but the record early run on quarterbacks saw him drop out of the top of the draft and into the Raider's hands. Even though some have criticized the Raiders for taking Bowers despite their other needs, even media members are coming around and praising Las Vegas for grabbing the game-changer.\n\n\"Well, the Raiders didn't land a quarterback,\" NFL.com's Nick Shook said. \"That's what happens when six of the top signal-callers are selected before Las Vegas' turn on the clock. That was a missed opportunity to me, dropping their grade slightly, but when it comes to consolation prizes, Brock Bowers might be the best possible outcome.\"\n\nShook graded the Las Vegas draft an \"A\" despite not finding their forever signal caller.\n\nIn a recent piece by Mike Sando in The Athletic, an anonymous NFL executive didn't pull punches when talking about the Bowers pick.\n\n\"I think they were stuck once Atlanta took (Michael) Penix and they were like, 'Oh, crap, we might not get a quarterback to fall to us,' and they scrambled and took that kid,\" the NFL executive told Sando. \"He is a good player but a luxury item. I don't like those kinds of picks unless you have everything else.\"\n\nBecause Raiders general manager Tom Telesco took the \"best player available\" approach in the first round, Bowers isn't a wasted, unneeded, or \"luxury pick.\" Because Bowers is nothing like a traditional pass-catching tight end, you could argue the Raiders made the right choice, considering their offense was 23rd in scoring last season. Bowers can line up all over the field, making him more of an offensive weapon than a tight end.\n\n\"But you get a chance to add just another dimension to the offensive, whether it's a tight end, hybrid receiver, whatever it is, you need more playmakers on that side of the ball,\" Telesco said after drafting Bowers. \"So, I think he's really going to help us there, and I feel like he's a high-level player in college; a true junior, he's 21 years old, so he's very young still, still developing. But he has some natural football skills, combined with some high-level athletic ability and speed, so yeah, I'm really happy to have him.\"\n\nSome people's inability to understand the Las Vegas' choice of Bowers is somewhat rooted in the team drafting former Notre Dame tight end Michael Mayer in the 2023 NFL Draft. Mayer showed great progress last year and is still a major part of the Raiders' offensive plans.\n\n\"And we love Michael Mayer, I love Michael Mayer, and he's a really good player,\" Telesco said after drafting Bowers. \"He's going to take another big jump this year.\"\n\nWhile some people are still critical of the pick, it's clear NFL scouts understand what a dynamic player the Raiders added to their offense. With an ascending defense and numerous additions on the offensive line, those critics who don't like the pick may be changing their tune after Bowers' first season in Las Vegas.", "source": {"uri": "sportsnaut.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Sportsnaut.com"}, "authors": [{"uri": "scott_gulbransen@sportsnaut.com", "name": "Scott Gulbransen", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brock_Bowers", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Brock Bowers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Las_Vegas_Raiders", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Las Vegas Raiders"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Draft_(sports)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Draft (sports)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quarterback", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Quarterback"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scout_(sport)", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Scout (sport)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Las_Vegas", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Las Vegas"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Las Vegas"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marvin_Harrison", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Marvin Harrison"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chicago_Bears", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Chicago Bears"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arizona_Cardinals", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Arizona Cardinals"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ESPN", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "ESPN"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cornerback", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Cornerback"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Georgia_(U.S._state)", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Georgia (U.S. state)"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Georgia (U.S. state)"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Athletic", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "The Athletic"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lineman_(gridiron_football)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Lineman (gridiron football)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Mayer_(director)", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Michael Mayer (director)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tom_Telesco", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Tom Telesco"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atlanta", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Atlanta, Georgia"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Atlanta, Georgia"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_manager", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "General manager"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Notre_Dame_Fighting_Irish_football", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Notre Dame Fighting Irish football"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_football", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "American football"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Ten-Pin", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Ten-Pin", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Instructors", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Instructors", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Candlepin", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Candlepin", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 97}], "image": "https://sportsnaut.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/NFL-Las-Vegas-Raiders-Brock-Bowers-Press-Conference-23120142.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9548010", "eventUri": "eng-9548010", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1372549019607843, "wgt": 223, "relevance": 1}

The way Arnold tells it, the team literally flipped a coin -- a story Las Vegas denied.\n\nArnold, who was selected 24th by the Detroit Lions, appeared as a guest on Tuesday's episode of the SEC-focused show The Next Round. He recounted his draft night experience and revealed that the Raiders told him that they had a \"coin toss\" between him and Bowers to make their selection.\n\n\"(The Lions) knew the Raiders, there was a possibility they took me,\" Arnold said. \"Actually, the Raiders' coach, they called me after the draft and they were like, 'We actually had a coin toss between you and Brock Bowers and landed on him.' I was like, 'Oh, wow.'\"\n\nDuring media availability on Wednesday, reporters asked assistant general manager Champ Kelly about the alleged coin flip and he said he \"can't confirm that, at all,\" per ESPN's Paul Gutierrez.\n\nWhich shouldn't come as a shock. If a professional football franchise really did decide a first-round draft choice with a coin flip, nobody involved would be particularly eager to tell the world about it. There's also a chance something got lost in translation here since calling tough decisions a \"coin flip\" is a well-used turn of phrase.\n\nRegardless of how they got there, the Raiders made a quality decision from the current vantage point. Bowers technically has some positional overlap with Las Vegas' 2023 second-round pick, Michael Mayers, but he's more viewed as an offensive weapon or pass catcher rather than a pure tight end.

According to Terrion Arnold, though, he was very close to hearing his name get called by the Raiders at that spot instead of Bowers.\n\nArnold ended up getting selected 24th overall by the Detroit Lions, but he recently claimed that Las Vegas let him know that they flipped a coin to decide between him and Bowers, and that the coin ended up telling them to choose Bowers. The Raiders front office quickly heard about this, and it led to assistant general manager Champ Kelly coming out with some interesting comments on Arnold's claim.\n\n\"I can't confirm that at all. Terrion is a good player. I'm excited to watch his career and watch him play. But we drafted Brock. And we're excited to get him here. And I don't think anyone else in our whole draft room felt any other way.\" - Champ Kelly, On3\n\nChamp Kelly not divulging Raiders draft plans\n\nA lot of fans were wondering what the Raiders were going to do with their first-round pick, and they ended up using it to draft the highly talented tight end in Bowers. It's clear that Bowers has a ton of potential, but considering all of the other areas of need on their roster, it was a somewhat surprising decision from Las Vegas' front office, especially after they drafted Michael Mayer in the second round of the 2023 draft.\n\nOne of the options that would have made more sense was Arnold. Their starting cornerback duo of Nate Hobbs and Jack Jones doesn't exactly inspire confidence, and he inadvertently ended up falling all the way down to the Lions after the Raiders passed on him. But conversely, Bowers fell further down the board than expected due to the insane run on quarterbacks in the first round.\n\nThat was a run the Raiders were expected to be a part of, but instead, they stood pat the 13th overall pick, and missed out on the top six passers in the draft. Arnold alleges that left the team with a coin flip between him and Bowers, but Kelly interestingly didn't confirm or deny that with these comments. Could that actually have been what the front office did to settle on picking Bowers?\n\nGiven all the research and analytics that go into making these picks, it almost seems too simple to be true, but maybe that was what the front office settled on. Regardless, Bowers is a Raider, and Arnold is a Lion, and he will probably enjoy playing for Detroit more than Las Vegas given how competitive the rest of their roster is. As for Bowers, he's going to have to hope someone can step up under center for the Raiders, or else it could be a long rookie campaign for him.", "source": {"uri": "clutchpoints.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "ClutchPoints"}, "authors": [{"uri": "owen_crisafulli@clutchpoints.com", "name": "Owen Crisafulli", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Champ_Kelly", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Champ Kelly"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brock_Bowers", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Brock Bowers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Draft_(sports)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Draft (sports)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coin_flipping", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Coin flipping"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_manager", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "General manager"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Las_Vegas_Raiders", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Las Vegas Raiders"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Detroit_Lions", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Detroit Lions"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Las_Vegas", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Las Vegas"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Las Vegas"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coming_out", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Coming out"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nate_Hobbs", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Nate Hobbs"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rookie", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Rookie"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quarterback", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Quarterback"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cornerback", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Cornerback"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Detroit", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Detroit"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Detroit"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Collecting/Coins", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Collecting/Coins", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Antiques_and_Collectibles/Coins", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Antiques and Collectibles/Coins", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/CAD_and_CAM/2D_Drafting", "label": "dmoz/Computers/CAD and CAM/2D Drafting", "wgt": 8}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Fantasy", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Fantasy", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/CAD_and_CAM/Associations", "label": "dmoz/Computers/CAD and CAM/Associations", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 82}], "image": "https://wp.clutchpoints.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/7383494526.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9548010", "eventUri": "eng-9548010", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.2156862745098038, "wgt": 218, "relevance": 1}

Specifically, who would the Las Vegas Raiders select at pick No. 13?\n\nThe Raiders were in the market for a quarterback, but there were no more first-round options, with six already off the board. So do you select the best tight end in the draft (Brock Bowers) or maybe the top cornerback (Terrion Arnold)? It was an Alabama versus Georgia kind of thing.\n\nSo flip that coin, right?\n\nArnold said the Lions knew that the Raiders could take him. \"And, actually, the Raiders coach, they called me after the draft,\" Arnold told The Next Round podcast. \"They were like, 'We actually had a coin toss between you and Brock Bowers. It landed on him.'\"\n\nBut now that two weeks have passed since the draft, there is some clarification coming out of Vegas. There likely were no coins used when the Raiders picked Bowers. Check that, the Raiders aren't going to admit the use of a coin.\n\n\"I can't confirm that at all,\" Raiders assistant general manager Champ Kelly told reporters this week. \"Terrion is a good player. I'm excited to watch his career and watch him play. But we drafted Brock. And we're excited to get him here. And I don't think anyone else in our whole draft room felt any other way.\"\n\nThe Raiders, with new head coach Antonio Pierce at the helm, used the 13th pick for Bowers, the former Georgia Bulldog. Their starting quarterback likely will be Gardner Minshew, whom they signed in free agency from the Colts. Or, the team could rely on Aidan O'Connell, the rookie who took over last year from failed Vegas QB experiment Jimmy Garoppolo. O'Connell was one of 11 rookie quarterbacks who started at least one game in the NFL in 2023.\n\nBut here's a safe assumption, Bowers likely will make the job easier for either quarterback.\n\nBowers \"position is tight end, but we saw him as a playmaker,\" Kelly said. \"He is going to be a fun piece to have. We'll see what defenses deploy against him when he is on the field.\"\n\nAs for Arnold, he ended up with the Lions and Dan Campbell, the team's charismatic coach. It took the Colts, with picked 15th, to finally snap the offensive streak of players in the first round. Indy selected UCLA's super pass rusher Laiatu Latu, the first defender chosen in the draft.\n\nMeanwhile, the Lions traded with the Cowboys for pick No. 24 in order to select Arnold, the lock-down corner from the Crimson Tide. Once Latu was off the board, six of the next nine players were defenders. Toledo's Quinyon Mitchell was the first DB off the board, with the Eagles taking him at No. 22. The Jaguars then traded up for LSU receiver Brian Thomas Jr and the Lions moved up five spots for Arnold. In the second round, Detroit went for another cornerback. This time it was Missouri's Ennis Rakestraw Jr.\n\nSo whether it was via coin flip or a gut feeling, both the Raiders and Lions probably selected the player they needed.

According to Arnold, the team made that decision based on a coin toss. The Raiders will now have to balance Bowers' playing time with incumbent tight end Michael Mayer, while Arnold landed with the Detroit Lions and is expected to boost their secondary.\n\nThe NFL Draft is notoriously a crapshoot, as \"can't-miss\" prospects routinely bust while 2022's Mr. Irrelevant (Brock Purdy) just led the San Francisco 49ers to the Super Bowl last season.\n\nAs such, there's no guidebook for the \"right way\" to draft prospects. Certain teams are better at it than others, but even the most consistent franchises only ever acquire two or three long-term starters in any one draft class.\n\nThe Las Vegas Raiders took that notion to heart this year, according to Detroit Lions' first-round pick Terrion Arnold. According to the former Alabama cornerback (via The Next Round Live podcast), Raiders' head coach Antonio Pierce called Arnold after the draft to inform him that the team made their selection based on a coin toss.\n\nThe Raiders ended up taking Georgia tight end Brock Bowers. Though the value was solid, many questioned the pick given that they already drafted Michael Mayer out of Notre Dame with the 35th overall pick in the 2023 NFL Draft.\n\nAs for Arnold, he ended up in a luxurious situation in Detroit, as the Lions made the NFC Championship Game last season for the first time since 1991. He should immediately slot in as an outside cornerback opposite trade acquisition Carlton Davis III.\n\nRelated 2024 NFL Draft Prospects: Terrion Arnold Scouting Report Terrion Arnold's athleticism and physicality make him an exciting cornerback prospect in this year's NFL Draft. Arnold \"Excited To Play For\" HC Dan Campbell Bowers appears to be superfluous addition to Raiders' roster\n\nArnold earned a Freshman All-American Award in 2022, his first ever year as a starter at the cornerback position. The next year, in 2023, Arnold won First Team All-American honors. His five interceptions in 2023 led the entire SEC, and landed him at sixth in the nation.\n\nPer GIVEMESPORT's scouting report on the former Crimson Tide defensive back: \"To put it as simply as possible, Terrion Arnold is a freak athlete. Importantly, Arnold is also strong for his frame, and has shown good technique. The combination of these three allows him to be used in different ways. He's athletic enough to play zone and cover a lot of space, yet also strong enough and confident enough in his technique to play press-man.\"\n\nTerrion Arnold Measurables\n\nCategory\n\nArnold\n\nHeight\n\n6'0\"\n\nWeight\n\n189 lbs\n\nArm Length\n\n31.6\"\n\nHand Size\n\n8.9\"\n\nVertical Jump\n\n37\"\n\n40-Yard Dash\n\n4.50\n\n10-Yard Split\n\n1.54\n\nBroad Jump\n\n10'9\"\n\nThe Lions were in desperate need of secondary help after releasing starting cornerback Cameron Sutton following his arrest stemming from an alleged domestic violence dispute earlier this offseason. Arnold should be a long-term asset for Dan Campbell's secondary, which already has one in former Alabama safety Brian Branch.\n\nAs for the Raiders, they too need a ton of help at cornerback, though they opted to go the \"best player available route\" when drafting Bowers. Though a coin toss may not be the most scientific means of drafting players, it's hard to argue with the quality of prospect they got in the former Bulldog.\n\nMany have compared Bowers to current Lions' tight end Sam LaPorta, who had one of the most impressive rookie tight end seasons of all time in 2023. The Raiders would simply be ecstatic if Bowers could come close to replicating the 86/889/10 receiving line LaPorta finished with last year.\n\nGIVEMESPORT Key Stat: Hope should be plentiful for the Brock Bowers-Michael Mayer pairing. The New England Patriots ranked top three in scoring over the three seasons in which Aaron Hernandez and Rob Gronkowski played together.\n\nThough only time will tell if the Raiders made the right call at No. 13 overall, at least the front office can pin the blame on a coin if Arnold proves to be better than Bowers.\n\nSource: The Next Round Live\n\nAll statistics courtesy of Pro Football

It wasn't surprising due to Bowers' ability as he was expected to be a top-10 pick.\n\nThe Raiders used an early second-round pick to draft tight end Michael Mayer just a year ago so it wasn't seen as a position of need. However, the team almost went in a very different direction. According to former Alabama cornerback Terrion Arnold, it literally came down to a coin flip between him and Bowers when Las Vegas was on the clock.\n\n\"The Raiders coach, they called me after the draft, and they were like 'We actually had a coin toss between you and Brock Bowers [and] it landed on him,'\" Arnold said during the May 7 episode of \"The Next Round.\"\n\nIt's unlikely the Raiders actually flipped a coin but it must've been a close decision. Cornerback was a much bigger position of need than tight end and many expected the team to get in that direction after all the top quarterbacks were off the board. Arnold ended up slipping to the 24th pick where he was drafted by the Detroit Lions.\n\nBowers was the No. 7 ranked played on Pro Football Focus' consensus draft board for 2024 while Arnold was No. 14. Bowers was almost universally ranked higher as a prospect. In terms of value, the Raiders made the right move by taking the former Georgia tight end.\n\nThat said, not a single defensive player was selected before Las Vegas picked at No. 13 and if they thought Arnold was the best defensive player in the draft, it would've been justifiable for them to take him.\n\nThe Raiders have yet to add a cornerback since the drafted ended but they could be waiting until after June 1 when they open up more salary cap space. While Arnold made more sense as a fit, it's hard to argue against the Raiders taking Bowers. He's considered one of the best tight end prospects ever and should be a serious impact player from Day 1. The last four times the Raiders used a first-round pick on a cornerback, they were all busts and never got a second contract with the team. They've done a very poor job drafting the position over the last two decades and ended up going with Bowers, who is less likely to struggle in the NFL.\n\nLas Vegas Raiders Still Need a CB\n\nThe Raiders waited until the fourth round to draft a cornerback when they selected Decamerion Richardson. He's unlikely to be ready to start as a rookie so the team needs to consider signing a veteran.\n\nLuckily, there are several good players still in free agency. Xavien Howard would make the most sense as he's worked with defensive coordinator Patrick Graham in the past. Adoree' Jackson also has experience with the coach. Stephon Gilmore would make sense, as well.\n\nThe Raiders weren't able to add a top cornerback in the draft but the abundance of good veteran free agents still available could've played a role.", "source": {"uri": "heavy.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Heavy"}, "authors": [{"uri": "austin_boyd@heavy.com", "name": "Austin Boyd", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brock_Bowers", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Brock Bowers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coin_flipping", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Coin flipping"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Draft_(sports)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Draft (sports)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cornerback", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Cornerback"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Las_Vegas_Raiders", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Las Vegas Raiders"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alabama_Crimson_Tide_football", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Alabama Crimson Tide football"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Las_Vegas", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Las Vegas"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Las Vegas"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pro_Football_Focus", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Pro Football Focus"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Georgia_Bulldogs_football", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Georgia Bulldogs football"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Detroit_Lions", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Detroit Lions"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quarterback", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Quarterback"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xavien_Howard", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Xavien Howard"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stephon_Gilmore", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Stephon Gilmore"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salary_cap", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Salary cap"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rookie", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Rookie"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Defensive_coordinator", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Defensive coordinator"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_agent", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Free agent"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jackson,_Mississippi", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Jackson, Mississippi"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Jackson, Mississippi"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Roads_and_Highways/Highway_Ends", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Roads and Highways/Highway Ends", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Locks", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Locks", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/CAD_and_CAM/2D_Drafting", "label": "dmoz/Computers/CAD and CAM/2D Drafting", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Fantasy", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Fantasy", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/CAD_and_CAM/Associations", "label": "dmoz/Computers/CAD and CAM/Associations", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://heavy.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/GettyImages-2150232920.jpg?quality=65&strip=all&w=780", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9548010", "eventUri": "eng-9548010", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-05-07", "textStart": 754, "textEnd": 759}, {"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-06-01", "textStart": 1707, "textEnd": 1713}], "sentiment": 0.08235294117647052, "wgt": 208, "relevance": 1}

With Antonio Pierce taking over as head coach and Tom Telesco in as the next general manager, the new era starts off with a whimper. Brock Bowers is a generational tight end talent, that can't be downplayed. But with how their current roster is set up, using the 13th overall pick on a TE is yet another misuse of a first-round selection by Raiders brass.\n\nOverall Situation & Supporting Cast\n\nIt goes without saying that this was one of the most questionable decisions in the first round, although the Falcons easily took the cake in this category. Brock Bowers was expected to enter a situation with a clearer shot at targets, instead of joining a team that already has a young TE.\n\nBowers will not only need to compete with second-year tight end Michael Mayer for targets, but he will also need to find his spot amongst Davante Adams and Jakobi Meyers, among others. And if that wasn't tough enough, the quarterback situation is between Aidan O'Connell and Gardner Minshew.\n\nWhile Josh Jacobs departed this offseason, which does open up some passing game work, the plan for Bowers to earn a consistent role in his rookie season is far from clear. The Raiders, smart to look to upgrade their passing weapons, went about their first shot at rebuilding this roster in a very poor way, and the ripple effect could last a few seasons.\n\nYear 1 Expectations\n\nMayer struggled in his rookie season, only hauling in 27 passes for 304 yards and two touchdowns across 14 games. While competition between him and Bowers likely knocks the ceilings of both players down a few pegs, it is likely that Bowers will see the most work of the two TEs.\n\nCould there be more two tight-end formations run this year? Absolutely, seeing as how their WR room is fairly devoid of talent outside of their two-deep chart. Both Mayer and Bowers will likely see a fair share of time in-line and split out, but expect to see Bowers command more looks in the receiving game.\n\nBad news for Brock Bowers - Minshew doesn't target his tight ends heavily, as seen by the low numbers from his time in Indianapolis last season. O'Connell isn't much better, so the two QBs vying for the starting spot in Vegas.\n\nEven with all of that being said, there is a reason that Pierce, Telesco, and the rest of the scouting department went with Bowers. Clearly, he will see the field a lot in his rookie season, so he should have decent-enough stats in his first season in the NFL.\n\n2024 Stat Projections - 54 receptions, 551 receiving yards, 6 TDs\n\nFantasy Football Impact\n\nThe tight end position is one of the toughest positions to draft well at when it comes to fantasy football. Obviously, this position takes on even more of importance in a tight-end premium (TEP) format, but Bowers is just another option added to the pool for you to consider.\n\nBowers shouldn't be drafted as a top-12 option this year, and even his case to be one of the first 15 TEs off the board is shaky. But draft capital is king in the NFL, so if you are drafted with a high draft pick, then a big role should be in store.\n\nWith that being said, tread lightly if you decide to utilize Brock Bowers this year for your redraft leagues. He is tough to predict at this point, and likely will have lots of ebbs and flows throughout his first season.\n\nFor dynasty purposes, Bowers is the clear TE1 in your rookie drafts, no questions asked. While a shaky landing spot may appear bad on paper for his first season, his spot with the Raiders has promise down the road, so he should be drafted as a premium rookie asset.\n\nThis grade isn't about talent, as Bowers is clearly one of the better tight ends to come out of the college ranks in the past five seasons. But at what point does a struggling team like the Raiders stop making the easy decisions difficult via the NFL Draft?\n\nEven dating back to the days of Al Davis when the Raiders would prioritize speed over talent, this franchise continuously fails to get out of their own way when it comes to roster development. And even with a new head coach and general manager in place, they continue to make the same personnel issues of previous leaderships.\n\nGranted, Bowers is a nice weapon for an offense that, outside of Adams, can struggle to move the ball in the passing game. But when you already have Mayer locked into the TE1 role on this team and plenty of question marks at QB, drafting Bowers becomes even more puzzling.\n\nBased on roster fit alone, drafting Bowers doesn't even earn the Raiders front office a passing grade, and many people feel this grade could justifiably be lower. The only thing saving Las Vegas here is the talent of Bowers -- otherwise, this looks to be a complete whiff.", "source": {"uri": "clutchpoints.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "ClutchPoints"}, "authors": [{"uri": "mike_johrendt@clutchpoints.com", "name": "Mike Johrendt", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brock_Bowers", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Brock Bowers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Draft_(sports)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Draft (sports)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rookie", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Rookie"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antonio_Pierce", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Antonio Pierce"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tom_Telesco", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Tom Telesco"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Las_Vegas_Raiders", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Las Vegas Raiders"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jakobi_Meyers", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Jakobi Meyers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gardner_Minshew", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Gardner Minshew"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Davante_Adams", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Davante Adams"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_manager", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "General manager"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Head_coach", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Head coach"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Touchdown", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Touchdown"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Josh_Jacobs", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Josh Jacobs"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scout_(sport)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Scout (sport)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wide_receiver", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Wide receiver"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quarterback", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Quarterback"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indianapolis", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Indianapolis"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Indianapolis"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reception_(gridiron_football)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Reception (gridiron football)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Al_Davis", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Al Davis"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_football", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "American football"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Las_Vegas", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Las Vegas"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Las Vegas"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Football/American", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Football/American", "wgt": 9}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Roads_and_Highways/Highway_Ends", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Roads and Highways/Highway Ends", "wgt": 8}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/CAD_and_CAM/2D_Drafting", "label": "dmoz/Computers/CAD and CAM/2D Drafting", "wgt": 9}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Fantasy", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Fantasy", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/CAD_and_CAM/Associations", "label": "dmoz/Computers/CAD and CAM/Associations", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 99}], "image": "https://wp.clutchpoints.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Grading-Brock-Bowers-landing-spot-1.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9548010", "eventUri": "eng-9548010", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.08235294117647052, "wgt": 206, "relevance": 1}

But if the Raiders literally flipped a coin to settle on their first-round pick -- and informed the player they didn't take that his fate was left to chance -- it would constitute one of the crazier sequence of events in draft history.\n\nThe Raiders have a new regime this year led by general manager Tom Telesco, who was fired in Dec. 2023 by the division-rival Los Angeles Chargers. Telesco joins head coach Antonio Pierce, who shed his interim label this offseason after taking over for Josh McDaniels in the middle of last season. General manager David Ziegler was fired at the same time as McDaniels.\n\nPierce was promoted from his role as the team's linebackers coach, and guided the team to a 5-4 record -- including a 63-21 win over the Chargers and an upset win over the eventual Super Bowl champion Kansas City Chiefs.\n\nWith Pierce and Telesco in tow, the Raiders are ready to turn over a new leaf after their failed McDaniels tenure.

Fellow cornerback prospect Quinyon Mitchell from Toledo was selected by the Philadelphia Eagles two picks before.\n\nThe Raiders are happy with Bowers, and Arnold is happy to have landed in Detroit.\n\nEnsure you follow on X (Twitter) @HondoCarpenter and IG @HondoSr and never miss another breaking news story again.\n\nPlease let us know your thoughts when you like our Facebook page WHEN YOU CLICK RIGHT HERE.", "source": {"uri": "si.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Sports Illustrated"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cornerback", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Cornerback"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brock_Bowers", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Brock Bowers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Las_Vegas_Raiders", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Las Vegas Raiders"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Detroit_Lions", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Detroit Lions"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coin_flipping", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Coin flipping"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_Alabama", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "University of Alabama"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/USA_Today", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "USA Today"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Las_Vegas", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Las Vegas"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Las Vegas"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alabama_Crimson_Tide_football", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Alabama Crimson Tide football"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Detroit", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Detroit"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Detroit"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Mackey_Award", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "John Mackey Award"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philadelphia_Eagles", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Philadelphia Eagles"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Defensive_back", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Defensive back"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dallas_Cowboys", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Dallas Cowboys"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quarterback", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Quarterback"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Facebook", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Facebook"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twitter", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Twitter"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toledo,_Ohio", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Toledo, Ohio"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Toledo, Ohio"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Relationships/Romance", "label": "dmoz/Society/Relationships/Romance", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Instructors", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Instructors", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 73}], "image": "https://images2.minutemediacdn.com/image/upload/c_crop,w_2400,h_1350,x_0,y_0/c_fill,w_1440,ar_16:9,f_auto,q_auto,g_auto/images/ImagnImages/mmsport/raiders_today/01hxcvrghvsez7w68p8q.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9548010", "eventUri": "eng-9548010", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.192156862745098, "wgt": 203, "relevance": 1}

Instead, the team \"settled\" for Georgia tight end Brock Bowers, and the Raiders seem pretty happy with that outcome.\n\n\"We ended up with one of the best weapons in the draft,\" an anonymous Raiders team source told ESPN reporter Jeremy Fowler about drafting Bowers. \"Extremely versatile player graded high by everyone.\"\n\n\"In fact, multiple NFL scouts told me that Bowers might have been the best overall player in the entire field, but positional needs pushed him out of the top 10,\" Fowler writes in his 2024 NFL Draft intel piece.\n\nThis isn't to say that the Raiders weren't interested in a QB. Fowler also reports that the Raiders \"explored trading for Jayden Daniels, but any attempts were futile due to Washington's stance that it wasn't dealing the No. 2 pick. Las Vegas also had interest in Michael Penix Jr., but most likely not in a trade up. He would have been considered at No. 13 or in a trade back. I heard from multiple people in Vegas that the team did not want to reach.\"\n\nNew head coach Antonio Pierce and general manager Tom Telesco stuck to their guns, though, and took the best player available when their initial plans fell through, and they should be commended for that.\n\nThat said, taking a tight end high in the first round is a risky proposition, and the Raiders now have to hope that Bowers proves to be an exception to this rule.\n\nBrock Bowers must buck the TEs in the NFL draft trend\n\nOver the last 30 years, NFL teams that have drafted a tight end at the top of the first round have fared much worse than teams that pick one up at the end of the first round or later.\n\nKyle Pitts (Atlanta Falcons), TJ Hockenson (Detroit Lions), Eric Ebron (Lions), Vernon Davis (San Francisco 49ers), Kellen Winslow (Cleveland Browns), Rickey Dudley (Oakland Raiders), and Kyle Brady (New York Jets) are the TEs drafted in the top 10 over the last three decades. While there are some decent players in there, none became superstars.\n\nOn the other hand, when you look at the Hall of Fame (in or soon to be) tight ends from this time frame you have Antonio Gates (undrafted), Rob Gronkowski (second round), Travis Kelce (third round), and Shannon Sharpe (seventh round). Last season's breakout tight end, Sam LaPorta, was also a second-round selection.\n\nThese historical comps don't doom Bowers. He wasn't a top-10 tight end, so he doesn't truly fall into that first group, and tight ends with the former Bulldogs' skillset and abilities are more valuable in the NFL than they have ever been in the past.\n\nAlso, if you want to take a more esoteric approach to believing that the 2024 No. 13 overall pick will be a successful selection for the Raiders, you can look at the one name left off of that Hall of Fame list above.\n\nTony Gonzalez is arguably the best tight end in NFL history. The former Cal football and basketball standout revolutionized the position and finished his career with the most receptions and receiving yards by a tight end. He is third and sixth in those categories, respectively, in NFL history.\n\nAnd where did the Falcons take Gonzalez in the 1997 NFL Draft? They grabbed him at 13.", "source": {"uri": "clutchpoints.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "ClutchPoints"}, "authors": [{"uri": "tim_crean@clutchpoints.com", "name": "Tim Crean", "type": "author",

GM Champ Kelly, Raiders Viewed Brock Bowers as an 'Offensive Weapon'", "body": "Dec 2, 2023; Atlanta, GA, USA; Georgia Bulldogs tight end Brock Bowers (19) takes the field before / Brett Davis-USA TODAY Sports\n\nThe Las Vegas Raiders acquired one of the best players in this year's NFL Draft when they selected former Georgia tight end Brock Bowers in the first round.\n\nBowers is a generational talent, having been the top tight end in college football over the last two seasons who was also part of back-to-back national title teams.\n\nWhen the Raiders took Bowers with that 13th overall pick, there were initial concerns due to the fact that Las Vegas already had a solid up-and-coming tight end in Michael Mayer, who happened to be the runner-up to the John Mackey Award that Bowers took home in 2022.\n\nIt seems, however, that there isn't a need for fans to focus too closely on the position.\n\nRaiders assistant general manager Champ Kelly discussed the role the club envisions for the Bowers when he addressed the media on Wednesday.\n\n\"He's a really good football player, was highly productive in college,\" Kelly said. \"His position is tight end, but we saw him as a playmaker and offensive weapon. There is, by no means, any pressure on him to come in and attain any numbers. We need him to come in, learn this system, get acclimated to this city, meet his teammates, learn how to work well with Michael Mayer and Harrison Bryant, Cole Fotheringham, Zach Gentry, and getting to know those guys and really learn the offense.\n\n\"But yeah, he's a fun piece to have because it's going to be interesting to see how defenses are going to deploy when he's on the football field.\"\n\nBowers was a two-time John Mackey Award winner at Georgia as the nation's best tight end. Most had projected Bowers to be off the board by the time the Raiders were up to pick at 13, but with the top-six quarterbacks in the draft all going prior to that point, Bowers would fall to a spot Las Vegas just couldn't pass up.\n\nAs Kelly said, there isn't pressure on the rookie tight end. Bowers proved long ago that he was ready to be a pro.\n\nBowers and the rest of the Raiders' 2024 draft class will begin rookie minicamp on Friday.\n\nEnsure you follow on X (Twitter) @HondoCarpenter and IG @HondoSr and never miss another breaking news story again.\n\nPlease let us know your thoughts when you like our Facebook page WHEN YOU CLICK RIGHT HERE.", "source": {"uri": "si.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Sports Illustrated"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brock_Bowers", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Brock Bowers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Las_Vegas_Raiders", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Las Vegas Raiders"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Mayer_(director)", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Michael Mayer (director)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Mackey_Award", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "John Mackey Award"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Georgia_Bulldogs_football", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Georgia Bulldogs football"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/College_football", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "College football"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Georgia_(U.S._state)", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Georgia (U.S. state)"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Georgia (U.S. state)"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atlanta", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Atlanta, Georgia"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Atlanta, Georgia"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_manager", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "General manager"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_football", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "American football"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Las_Vegas", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Las Vegas"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Las Vegas"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zach_Gentry", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Zach Gentry"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Draft_(sports)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Draft (sports)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rookie", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Rookie"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quarterback", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Quarterback"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Instagram", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Instagram"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Facebook", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Facebook"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twitter", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Twitter"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Football/American", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Football/American", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Advice", "label": "dmoz/Society/Advice", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Instructors", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Instructors", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 86}], "image": "https://images2.minutemediacdn.com/image/upload/c_crop,w_2771,h_1558,x_0,y_0/c_fill,w_1440,ar_16:9,f_auto,q_auto,g_auto/images/ImagnImages/mmsport/raiders_today/01hxff3kkxnj0qgvzxfe.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9548010", "eventUri": "eng-9548010", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.2078431372549019, "wgt": 186, "relevance": 1}

Therefore, the fantasy football world is knee-deep in dynasty rookie drafts.\n\nWhile the top few picks are easy this year, fantasy players have a difficult decision in the middle of the first round between Rome Odunze and Brock Bowers.\n\nShould fantasy players take the star wide receiver or high-upside tight end? Let's dive into it.\n\nOdunze was arguably the top wide receiver in college football last year. After returning to Washington for a final season, Odunze put up career highs in several categories, including receptions (92), receiving yards (1,640), and touchdowns (13). Furthermore, he led the Pac-12 in receptions and receiving yards while ranking second in touchdowns in 2023.\n\nThe former Washington star was the ninth overall pick by the Chicago Bears. Despite having DJ Moore and Keenan Allen on the roster, the Bears gave Caleb Williams one of the top wide receivers in the draft class. While some fantasy players hoped he would land in a more immediate fantasy-friendly situation, Odunze is set up for the long haul.\n\nBowers was the clear-cut No. 1 tight end in the draft class, ranking far and away ahead of anyone else. He had 56 receptions for 882 receiving yards and 13 touchdowns as a freshman for the National Champion Bulldogs in 2021. Despite defenses doing everything possible to slow him down, Bowers continued to put up massive numbers at Georgia.\n\nUnfortunately, the star tight end didn't land in an ideal fantasy situation. Bowers was the 13th overall pick in the NFL Draft by the Las Vegas Raiders. Last year, the Raiders spent an early second-round pick on Michael Mayer. Furthermore, Davante Adams and Jakobi Meyers had productive 2023 seasons in Las Vegas. While the landing spot is far from ideal, Bowers is too talented not to get on the field as a rookie.\n\nFantasy players should be happy drafting either player with their first-round rookie pick. However, there must be a winner in this debate. While both players are likely future NFL stars, I would take Odunze over Bowers.

Not only is he in the same tight ends room with a capable pass-catching tight end like Michael Mayer, the Raiders also have an impressive duo atop the wide receiver depth chart in Davante Adams and Jakobi Meyers.\n\nQuarterback play will also be a factor.

But there are also many factors that could limit his production to the point he finishes below that, which is more likely.\n\nClay's projection is fair and would amount to a successful rookie campaign for Bowers if he hits it.

It landed on him.' I was like, oh, wow.\"\n\nPresumably, Pierce was not speaking literally. More realistically, the Raiders' decision could have gone either way, but they ultimately tilted to Bowers. Then again, the Raiders have made some bizarre picks in the past, so maybe it can't be completely ruled out.\n\nArnold was viewed as one of the top defenders on the board, and he would have been the first one to go had the Raiders selected him.

Dynasty rookie drafts are underway. Some players left the NFL Draft with their fantasy value heading in the right direction. Unfortunately, other players saw their fantasy value take a significant hit. Let's look at six players whose fantasy football value is trending up or down following the NFL Draft.\n\nLet's dive into a few players that are trending up following the 2024 NFL Draft and others that are trending down.\n\nLas Vegas was one of a few teams heavily linked to drafting Michael Penix Jr. Unfortunately, the Raiders missed out on the quarterback run, as all six potential first-round quarterbacks went off the board in the top 12. While Minshew still needs to beat out Aidan O'Connell, he won't have to compete with a rookie for the starting role. Furthermore, Las Vegas improved its receiving core by drafting Brock Bowers with their first-round pick. Minshew has a significantly better receiving core than he did with the Indianapolis Colts last season.\n\nJaylen Wright (RB - MIA)\n\nThe Dolphins traded a 2025 third-round pick to the Philadelphia Eagles during the NFL Draft to select Wright in the fourth round, showing their significant desire for the running back. Anyone who pushes him down in their dynasty rookie rankings because of the landing spot is making a mistake. Raheem Mostert turns 33 in August, while De'Von Achane struggled to stay healthy last season. Wright is built perfectly for Miami's offense. While it might not happen until Week 8, expect the rookie to finish his first season fantasy relevant.\n\nGeorge Pickens (WR - PIT)\n\nMany called Pickens an offseason winner after the Steelers traded away Diontae Johnson. Instead of using an early draft pick on a wide receiver, Pittsburgh spent their top two selections to improve their offensive line. While they spent a third-round pick on Roman Wilson, he is the only offensive weapon the team drafted this year. Pickens was a top-20 wide receiver without Johnson in 2023 despite catching passes from Kenny Pickett. He has top-10 upside this year with Russell Wilson or Justin Fields under center.\n\nPenix was the surprise pick of the first round, going eighth overall to the Falcons after they signed Kirk Cousins to a massive contract in free agency. He is the only first-round quarterback unlikely to see the field in 2024. Furthermore, Atlanta can't get out of Cousins' contract until after the 2025 season. Whenever Penix takes over under center, he will have an impressive receiving core at his disposal. Unfortunately, fantasy players must carry him on their bench or taxi squad for a few years.\n\nJosh Jacobs (RB - GB)\n\nGreen Bay released Aaron Jones after signing Jacobs to a massive four-year contract in free agency. While they re-signed A.J. Dillon to a one-year deal, he isn't a threat to Jacobs' featured workload. However, third-round rookie MarShawn Lloyd is a significant threat. Head coach Matt LaFleur has already mentioned using Lloyd in the passing game. More importantly, Green Bay can get out of Jacobs' contract after the 2024 season with limited penalties. Lloyd could replace Jacobs as a rookie if the veteran struggles and he could become the featured guy in 2025.\n\nMichael Mayer (TE - LV)\n\nUnfortunately, Mayer is a double loser coming out of the NFL Draft. The Raiders were favorites to draft Michael Penix Jr. Instead, they missed the quarterback run, forcing them to roll with Aidan O'Connell and Gardner Minshew in 2024. More importantly, Las Vegas drafted Brock Bowers with their first-round pick. While Bowers and Mayer are different types of tight ends, the star rookie creates more competition for targets alongside Davante Adams and Jakobi Meyers. Any hope of Mayer having a sophomore-year breakout is gone.", "source": {"uri": "fantasypros.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "FantasyPros"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

According to Arnold, the Las Vegas Raiders nearly swiped him much earlier, only to instead take tight end Brock Bowers at No. 13 overall because of ... a coin toss.\n\n\"(The Lions) knew that the Raiders were a possibility,\" Arnold told \"The Next Round\" podcast this week. \"And actually the Raiders coach, they called me after the draft, and they were like, 'We actually had a coin toss between you and Brock Bowers. It landed on him.' I was like, 'Oh wow.'\"\n\nHowever, Raiders head coach Antonio Pierce said neither a coin flip nor phone call occurred.\n\n\"No call, and no coin flip,\" Pierce told ESPN's Ryan Clark. \"As soon as the last two QBs went off the board. We said Bowers all the way.\" Pierce also said the Bowers pick was decided before the Raiders were on the clock.\n\nPierce's account of what happened is in stark contract to what Arnold said transpired before the Raiders ultimately drafted Bowers.\n\nIs Arnold simply echoing a figure of speech? Or did the Raiders use a literal coin flip on draft night to make their choice?\n\nAt any rate, Bowers is in Las Vegas, Arnold is in Detroit and both rookies figure to have sizable roles for their respective teams in 2024. Arnold celebrated his Lions destination on draft night; while he was born and raised in Florida, he told the Motor City crowd after being drafted that Detroit had brought him \"home\" and \"right where I need to be.\"", "source": {"uri": "cbssports.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "CBS Sports"}, "authors": [{"uri": "cody_benjamin@cbssports.com", "name": "Cody Benjamin", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_Pierce", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Paul Pierce"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coin_flipping", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Coin flipping"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brock_Bowers", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Brock Bowers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Las_Vegas_Raiders", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Las Vegas Raiders"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Detroit_Lions", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Detroit Lions"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cornerback", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Cornerback"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alabama", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Alabama"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Alabama"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ryan_Clark_(American_football)", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Ryan Clark (American football)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antonio_Pierce", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Antonio Pierce"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Draft_(sports)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Draft (sports)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ESPN", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "ESPN"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Head_coach", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Head coach"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Las_Vegas", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Las Vegas"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Las Vegas"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Detroit", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Detroit"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Detroit"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Florida", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Florida"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Florida"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Collecting/Paper_Money", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Collecting/Paper Money", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Collecting/Coins", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Collecting/Coins", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Antiques_and_Collectibles/Coins", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Antiques and Collectibles/Coins", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Instructors", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Instructors", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Antiques_and_Collectibles/Paper_Money", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Antiques and Collectibles/Paper Money", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 86}], "image": "https://sportshub.cbsistatic.com/i/r/2024/05/09/cc7576a0-d665-498a-8955-2101132dd83c/thumbnail/1200x675/67fc41c26d417fb2ed88ed20d6f07260/pierce-g.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9548010", "eventUri": "eng-9548010", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.05098039215686279, "wgt": 452992955, "relevance": 2}], "totalResults": 42, "page": 1, "count": 1, "pages": 42}}}

Whether it\u2019s teenage annoyance about how strict their rules are, feeling like no matter how hard you try you\u2019ll never live up to their expectations, or feeling stressed about how long it takes for them to send a text. We\u2019ve all been there - it\u2019s normal to feel frustrated from time to time. But what happens when your parents\u2019 behaviour leaves your feeling \u2018alone\u2019 and like you have no support system in place? One woman has taken to Reddit to share how much her parents\u2019 thoughtless behaviour is affecting her. She began her post by explaining that her \u2018parents are phone zombies\u2019 and how she feels like it\u2019s \u2018ruining\u2019 their lives.

She said: \"Even their brains have rotted from their phone activity, they\u2019re constantly spewing out things they\u2019ve seen from people trying to fear monger online and they can\u2019t even tell what is true and what isn\u2019t. \u201cit takes years off my lifespan to try and have a conversation with my OWN PARENTS. it\u2019s embarrassing and i\u2019m SO F****** SICK OF THIS S***!!!\u201d Reddit users were quick to comment on the post, with some providing messages of comfort and support, while others shared advice for not letting her parents\u2019 behaviour impact her. One Reddit user wrote: \u201cOmg, I'm so sorry OP. I see my wife doing this to my kids sometimes and it makes me cringe. I'm not 100% innocent, but sometimes I have to quick respond to a work text so I tell them to hold the thought, send the text, and immediately tell them to continue. \u201cI totally understand your pain though because there are times I have to tell my wife and my coworker something 3 times before they even hear it. I may have one idea. Do you have a phone? Can you just record a little blip everytime you try to talk to them? Do that for a week and then make the whole thing a video so they can actually watch themselves ignore you. As a Dad that would totally get my attention.\u201d Read more: Sign up to Mirror US's SMS updates for the latest straight from the newsroom For all the latest on news, politics, sports, and showbiz from the USA, go to The Mirror US . A second added: \u201cI'm so sorry. It's hard when your parents can't be bothered to be present. You deserve better. You deserve parents who are interested in your life. Sending virtual hugs.\u201d While a third shared: \u201cMy dad is a gen x and is exactly like this. People always give the youth a hard time about this issue but never hold anyone older accountable for the same behavior.\u201d", "summary": "A frustrated user has taken to Reddit to reveal how \u2018sick\u2019 of their parents phone scrolling habits they are, explaining that they feel like they \u2018have no one to talk to\u2019 and their parents \u2018never listen\u2019", "url": "https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/us-news/my-gen-x-parents-phone-32992117", "image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article32991969.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_GettyImages-672158469.jpg", "video": null, "publish_date": "2024-06-09 14:31:33", "author": "Beth Mahoney,Beth-Mahoney", "authors": ["Beth Mahoney", "Beth-Mahoney"], "language": "en", "source_country": "GB", "sentiment": -0.644}

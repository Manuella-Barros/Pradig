{"id": 243339238, "title": "Angus community supercharges campaign against giant electricity substation on its doorstep", "text": "A community north of Dundee is powering up it fight against a massive substation connected to the north east\u2019s controversial 400kV \u2018super-pylons\u2019 project. Residents in Tealing fear the Angus village will be dominated by the multi-million pound development planned to take energy from upgraded line. The Kintore to Tealing project is part of SSEN Transmission\u2019s \u00a320 billion Pathway to 2030 plan. The energy giant wants to turn the north of Scotland into a \u201cclean energy powerhouse\u201d. But the pylons proposal has enraged folk living along the planned 70-mile route. New towers would average 57 metres in height. \u2018Mini Grangemouth\u2019 fears And Tealing residents say the substation required at the end of the line will industrialise the Sidlaws community. An existing substation was expanded to take renewable energy generated by the Seagreen windfarm off the Angus coast. SSEN wants to build the new Emmock facility for the 400kV OHL connection on a 220-acre organic farm. Stop Tealing Industrialisation Group has been formed to fight the plan. It was part of a community information event this week at which residents and local groups shared their concerns. Lorna Campbell of Tealing Development Trust said many still unaware of the scale of planned development. \u201cThey don\u2019t really understand the enormity of it. And others think it\u2019s already a given,\u201d she said. \u201cThe key message of all is that no one was against green energy. \u201cInfact most of those present and on the groups presenting have some sort of green energy around their own house, property etc. \u201cBut it is the way it is being projected onto the village. \u201cIt\u2019s going to be a mini Grangemouth in industrial terms.\u201d The substation bay itself will cover an area 685m by 285m \u2013 more than 25 football pitches. And locals say the plans could see more than 20,000 HGV movements during site construction. Graham Sutherland of STIG said there was already \u201cchaos\u201d on narrow local roads leading to the proposed site. Locals say access will not be taken off the A90 dual carriageway but instead use back routes north of Dundee. Lorna added: \u201cThis community evening was the first of many. \u201cIt is easy to see that the local community and those of the surrounding areas are beginning to join the dots. SSEN pledge continuing community consultation An SSEN Transmission spokesperson said: \u201cWe recognise the strength of feeling amongst some local communities, and as a stakeholder-led business community consultation is a crucial part of our project development process. \u201cWe have held four consultation events in relation to the Emmock 400kV Substation including our last public events that took place over 5-6 June, and we continue to assess all feedback received as we aim to mitigate the impact of the project as much as possible. \u201cWe will continue to engage with the local community as part of the project development process, and plan to meet with Tealing Community Council ahead of submitting planning applications later this year.\u201d", "summary": "Tealing residents say the scale of the Emmock project linked to SSEN's controversial 400kV 'super-pylons' project will destroy the area.", "url": "https://www.thecourier.co.uk/fp/news/angus-mearns/5025585/tealing-substation-industrialisation-fears/", "image": "https://www.thecourier.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/12/2024/06/10016714_3128461-23ozsow93.jpg", "video": null, "publish_date": "2024-06-29 05:00:00", "author": "Graham Brown", "authors": ["Graham Brown"], "language": "en", "source_country": "gb", "sentiment": -0.003}

The singer, 36, who regularly promotes body positivity in her lyrics and on social media, faced shocking allegations of weight-shaming by her backup dancers last August, which she denies. Lizzo \u2013 real name Melissa Jefferson \u2013 claimed South Park naming her in a joke about people being happy with their weight proved she is succeeding in reducing fatphobia. Speaking in a video shared to TikTok, she reacted positively to South Park\u2019s Ozempic episode and said the scene that features her name exemplifies her notoriety. \u201cI really showed the world how to love yourself and not give a f*** to the point where these men in Colorado know who the f*** I am and put it in their cartoon that\u2019s been around for 25 years,\u2019 she said. South Park was created by writers Trey Parker and Matt Stone in 1998. In the show\u2019s Ozempic special, one of the lead characters Eric Cartman is introduced to the drug, which was initially intended for people with Type 2 diabetes but is now marketed for weightloss. Lizzo was namechecked in a joke where a woman who had been unhappy with her weight revealed she was now on \u201cLizzo\u201d a drug that \u201ccontrolled all her cravings to be thinner\u201d. \u201cI showed you all how to not give a f*** and I\u2019m going to keep on showing you how to not give a f***,\u201d Lizzo responded. Last year, dancers who filed a lawsuit against Lizzo alleged she had weight shamed them in an interview with America\u2019s NBC News. Arianna Davis and Crystal Williams, who filed a lawsuit with another dancer, Noelle Rodriguez, accused Lizzo of sexual harassment and creating a hostile work environment in their filing. They alleged Lizzo weight-shamed one of them, then fired her, after recording a meeting because of a health condition. They also accused the singer of pressuring one of them in a strip club to touch a nude performer, all of which she denies. Lizzo issued a statement at the time claiming she was \u201cnot the villain\u201d and said the accusations had been \u201cgut wrenching\u201d and \u201cdifficult\u201d. Shortly after the singer broke her silence, the accusers reacted in shock to Lizzo\u2019s \u201cdisheartening\u201d response to their allegations. Williams told Channel 4: \u201cInitially for me it just further deepened my disappointment in regards to how I was feeling and how I was treated.\u201d", "summary": "<p>\u2018I\u2019m really that b*tch,\u2019 the singer said</p>", "url": "https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/music/news/lizzo-south-park-ozempic-joke-b2551761.html", "image": "https://static.independent.co.uk/2024/03/29/23/newFile.jpg?width=1200", "video": "https://cdn.jwplayer.com/videos/6NuSiFOu-4VHSaSK0.mp4", "publish_date": "2024-05-26 12:50:57", "author": "Lydia Spencer-elliott", "authors": ["Lydia Spencer-elliott"], "language": "en", "source_country": "gb", "sentiment": 0.203}

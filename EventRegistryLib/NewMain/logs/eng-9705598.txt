Most of the two-hour conversation was devoted to the military operation in Ukraine. In addition, the president spoke about Russia's relations with NATO, the Nord Stream gas pipeline explosion and other topics. After the end of the interview, Putin and Carlson also had an off camera conversation, Putin's press secretary Dmitry Peskov said.\n\nAfter the interview, Politico called Carlson a \"useful idiot.\" Politico referred to The New York Times reporter Walter Duranty, who interviewed Joseph Stalin in Moscow in the early 1930s.

The point is to bring Americans much-needed information about the conflict that's completely reshaping their country's position in the world.

He has also interviewed Argentinian President Javier Millei, El Salvadoran President Nayib Bukele, Slovakian President Aleksandar Vucic, Hungary Prime Minister Viktor Orban, and former President Trump, along with other well-known public figures such as Ron Paul.\n\nFollowing his interview with Putin, the Russian President called Carlson a \"dangerous person,\" citing that he did not ask the questions Putin thought he would. That is why when Carlson interviews these world leaders, it is always worth watching to see what type of questions he will ask and whether or not that person will be able to answer them head-on or dodge them.\n\nIf and when the interview takes place, it will likely be one of the most viewed interviews on X. For context, the Putin interview received 214 million impressions solely on X. The interview with Zelenskyy should have the same magnitude, if not more so, than Tucker's previous interviews because of his past criticism of Zelenskyy and the U.S. involvement in funding Ukraine.\n\nIt will be interesting to see what Carlson asks Zelenskyy and if he will bring up the point that has been mentioned in the past by the likes of Independent presidential candidate Robert F. Kennedy Jr., whether it is true that Ukraine and Russia signed a treaty, but President Biden told then-Prime Minister of the United Kingdom, Boris Johnson, to travel Ukraine and \"forces him [Zelenskyy] to tear up the treaty.\" Whether it's true or not, we should know for a fact.\n\nWe don't know the exact date of the interview, per Carlson's post, but credit to Zelenskyy for something that Biden refuses to do daily: accepting the offer to sit down with a critic of his and have a conversation with him.", "source": {"uri": "redstate.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Redstate"}, "authors": [{"uri": "levon_satamian@redstate.com", "name": "Levon Satamian", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Volodymyr_Zelenskyy", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Volodymyr Zelenskyy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tucker_Carlson", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Tucker Carlson"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vladimir_Putin", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Vladimir Putin"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russian_invasion_of_Ukraine", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Russian invasion of Ukraine"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fox_News", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Fox News"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/President_of_Ukraine", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "President of Ukraine"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russia", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Russia"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Russia"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nayib_Bukele", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Nayib Bukele"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ron_Paul", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Ron Paul"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Viktor_Orb\u00e1n", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Viktor Orb\u00e1n"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aleksandar_Vu\u010di\u0107", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Aleksandar Vu\u010di\u0107"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/President_of_Argentina", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "President of Argentina"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/El_Salvador", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "El Salvador"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "El Salvador"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slovakia", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Slovakia"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Slovakia"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hungary", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Hungary"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Hungary"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_F._Kennedy_Jr.", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Robert F.

Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell blamed Tucker for a delay in the U.S. getting a new round of funding to Ukraine in April, according to the Daily Beast.\n\n\"I think the demonization of Ukraine began by Tucker Carlson, who in my opinion ended up where he should've been all along, which is interviewing Vladimir Putin,\" the senator reportedly said.", "source": {"uri": "dailycaller.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Daily Caller"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Volodymyr_Zelenskyy", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Volodymyr Zelenskyy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tucker_Carlson", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Tucker Carlson"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vladimir_Putin", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Vladimir Putin"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/President_of_Ukraine", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "President of Ukraine"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ukraine", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Ukraine"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Ukraine"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russian_language", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Russian language"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Journalist", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Journalist"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fox_News", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Fox News"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Daily_Beast", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "The Daily Beast"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Party_leaders_of_the_United_States_House_of_Representatives", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Party leaders of the United States House of Representatives"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-governmental_organization", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Non-governmental organization"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bloomberg_L.P.", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Bloomberg L.P."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mitch_McConnell", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Mitch McConnell"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_security", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "National security"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Senate", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "United States Senate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CNN", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "CNN"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_New_York_Times", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "The New York Times"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Terrorism", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Terrorism", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Warfare_and_Conflict", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Warfare and Conflict", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Activism/Media", "label": "dmoz/Society/Activism/Media", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 85}], "image": "https://cdn01.dailycaller.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/GettyImages-1805126069-scaled-e1720042153924.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9705598", "eventUri": "eng-9705598", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.003921568627450966, "wgt": 207, "relevance": 1}

Tucker allowed this monologue to go on uninterrupted, airing it to his 13 million X (Twitter) followers. 15 hours after publication, it had 110 million views. 20 million people watched the interview on YouTube.\n\nCarlson's platform provided an unchallenged space for Putin's dangerous rhetoric that justifies Russia's aggressive actions against Ukraine.\n\nCarlson explained his motive for interviewing Putin, saying, \"Most Americans have no idea why Putin invaded Ukraine or what his goals are now.\"\n\nEuropean Parliament members urged a ban on Tucker Carlson's entry into the EU. This unprecedented move comes as Carlson's interview provides a platform for Putin, who is accused of war crimes and aids Russian propaganda.\n\nIn March 2023, the International Criminal Court (ICC) issued a warrant of arrest for Putin, charging him with the illegal deportation of Ukrainian children to Russia on the Russian-occupied territories of Ukraine.\n\nThe European Commission spokesperson Nabila Massrali criticized Vladimir Putin's interview with Tucker Carlson, stating Putin merely reiterated old propaganda about Ukraine and the West. She emphasized that \"if Putin really wants to fight for the interests of the Russian people and his country, he must immediately and unconditionally withdraw his forces and military equipment from the entire territory of Ukraine within its internationally recognized borders and respond to the enormous challenges that Russian society faces every day.\"", "source": {"uri": "euromaidanpress.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Euromaidan Press"}, "authors": [{"uri": "vira_kravchuk@euromaidanpress.com", "name": "Vira Kravchuk", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tucker_Carlson", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Tucker Carlson"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vladimir_Putin", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Vladimir Putin"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ukraine", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Ukraine"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Ukraine"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russia", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Russia"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Russia"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Security_Service", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Federal Security Service"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/President_of_Ukraine", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "President of Ukraine"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Volodymyr_Zelenskyy", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Volodymyr Zelenskyy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fox_News", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Fox News"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Denazification", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Denazification"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conservatism", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Conservatism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Propaganda", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Propaganda"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dissolution_of_the_Soviet_Union", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Dissolution of the Soviet Union"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sovereignty", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Sovereignty"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russians", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Russians"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Separatism", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Separatism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genocide", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Genocide"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/YouTube", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "YouTube"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twitter", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Twitter"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russian-occupied_territories_of_Ukraine", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Russian-occupied territories of Ukraine"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russian_invasion_of_Ukraine", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Russian invasion of Ukraine"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Criminal_Court", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "International Criminal Court"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/War_crime", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "War crime"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deportation", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Deportation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Parliament", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "European Parliament"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Commission", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "European Commission"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Union", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "European Union"}, "location": null}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Hacking/Cracking", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Hacking/Cracking", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Martial_Arts/Russian", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Martial Arts/Russian", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 85}], "image": "https://euromaidanpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/tucker-carlson-e1652711786115.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9705598", "eventUri": "eng-9705598", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.003921568627450966, "wgt": 183, "relevance": 1}

Wednesday, Carlson caused a bit of a media ripple when he announced on \"X\" that he had scored an interview with Zelensky (see Tucker Carlson Confirms He Will Interview Ukrainian President Zelenskyy: 'Coming Soon We Hope').\n\nLooks like we've got the Zelenskyy interview. We've been trying for two years, and with particular intensity after interviewing Putin in February. The point is to bring Americans much-needed information about the conflict that's completely reshaping their country's position in the world. Coming soon we hope.\n\nZelensky's press secretary, Serhii Nykyforov, responded to the X post on Facebook:\n\nMr. Tucker Carlson should more carefully check his sources in the FSB. The President of Ukraine has a completely different schedule, and Tucker Carlson is not there.\n\nThis interview seemed unlikely at the time for several reasons. Carlson isn't merely a critic of US support for Ukraine's independence; he's a rather vocal critic of any action taken by Ukraine to defend itself, and he isn't terribly restrained by facts in his criticism. His critique of the Ukraine war makes the Facebook comments of Obama Birth Truthers look like Pulitzer Prize-quality work. This clip is a good example.\n\nIn it, he calls Zelensky a dictator for suspending elections, ignoring that the Ukrainian Constitution forbids national elections during a state of emergency.\n\nThese regularly scheduled elections were disrupted by the state of martial law declared in 2022, at the start of the full-scale Russian invasion. This can be expected from a country fighting for its very existence, where significant portions of its territory are occupied. Martial law is established as a concept in the Ukrainian Constitution and last updated by the national legislature in 2015, before Zelensky entered politics.\n\nArticle 83 of the Ukrainian Constitution states that if the term of the Verkhovna Rada expires under martial law, it shall automatically be extended until a new Rada is seated following the end of martial law. Article 19 of Ukraine's martial law legislation specifically forbids conducting national elections. Thus, for Ukraine to conduct elections while under martial law would be a violation of legal norms that predate Zelensky and the full-scale Russian invasion.\n\nHe finds fault with Zelensky for ordering the closure of the Moscow-based and FSB-owned and operated Ukrainian Orthodox Church after it began sermonizing against Ukraine's defensive effort and serving in the Ukraine Armed Forces.\n\nThe Ukrainian parliament gave initial approval on Thursday to a law that would ban the minority Ukrainian Orthodox Church (UOC) after Kyiv accused it of collaborating with Russia following last year's invasion.\n\nThe UOC has historic links with Moscow but says it is no longer aligned with the Russian Orthodox Church. It denies Kyiv's accusations and says the draft law would be unconstitutional.\n\nMost Ukrainian Christians are members of the Orthodox Church of Ukraine (OCU), formed from two churches independent of Moscow in 2018.\n\nThis is not an issue of freedom of religion. For instance, Evangelicals are free to worship in Ukraine while they are persecuted in Russia and Russian-occupied Ukraine. Orthodox Ukrainians can still attend Orthodox services, just without the treasonous clergy.\n\nHere is a clip from December in which he claims that the US is sending \"tens of billions to sleazy oligarchs in Ukraine.\" The billions the US is spending go to \"sleazy oligarchs\" at General Dynamics, Raytheon, and other major Defense contractors, not to Ukraine.\n\nWhile it was easy to see Carlson could hope to get redemption from the pantsing Vladimir Putin gave him, it was more than a little unclear what Zelensky and Ukraine would get.\n\nWhatever his good qualities, Carlson is a bad-faith actor when it comes to Ukraine. Zelensky's office is right to assume that has not changed. Zelensky has ready access to major media worldwide, and he can count on coverage ranging from cautiously skeptical to outright fawning. Why would he talk to someone who is not going to give him a fair shake? Beyond that, a non-trivial part of Carlson's audience actively supports Russia's invasion, while a much larger number don't believe Ukraine merits US support. Who, exactly, would this interview appeal to is anyone's guess, but politically, it is 100% downside and 0% upside.\n\nThe interview would undoubtedly make Carlson a lot of money, but there is no chance that it would result in more support for Zelensky or Ukraine or even a better understanding of the issues. So, Carlson was either making up a story to get attention or getting bad information from someone. I don't know if they were in the FSB, but maybe Carlson should do some due diligence and find out.", "source": {"uri": "redstate.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Redstate"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Volodymyr_Zelenskyy", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Volodymyr Zelenskyy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tucker_Carlson", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Tucker Carlson"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Martial_law", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Martial law"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/President_of_Ukraine", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "President of Ukraine"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ukraine", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Ukraine"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Ukraine"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constitution_of_Ukraine", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Constitution of Ukraine"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Facebook", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Facebook"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russia", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Russia"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Russia"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orthodox_Church_of_Ukraine", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Orthodox Church of Ukraine"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fox_News", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Fox News"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Declaration_of_Independence_of_Ukraine", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Declaration of Independence of Ukraine"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Verkhovna_Rada", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Verkhovna Rada"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vladimir_Putin", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Vladimir Putin"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kyiv", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Kyiv"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dictator", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Dictator"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eastern_Orthodox_Church", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Eastern Orthodox Church"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Security_Service", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Federal Security Service"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/State_of_emergency", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "State of emergency"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Legislature", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Legislature"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barack_Obama", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Barack Obama"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moscow", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Moscow"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Moscow"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Russia"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christians", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Christians"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constitutionality", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Constitutionality"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russian_Orthodox_Church", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Russian Orthodox Church"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Treason", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Treason"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Freedom_of_religion", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Freedom of religion"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Annexation_of_Crimea_by_the_Russian_Federation", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Annexation of Crimea by the Russian Federation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oligarchy", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Oligarchy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arms_industry", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Arms industry"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clergy", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Clergy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evangelicalism", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Evangelicalism"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Intellectual_Property", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Intellectual Property", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Hacking/Cracking", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Hacking/Cracking", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 98}], "image": "https://media.townhall.com/cdn/hodl/2024/182/79b93263-9866-4725-8b8f-9146f6f57f33.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9705598", "eventUri": "eng-9705598", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.02745098039215677, "wgt": 174, "relevance": 1}

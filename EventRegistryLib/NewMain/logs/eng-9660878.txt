Jamaal Bowman and his primary opponent George Latimer.\n\nThe men are facing off in what's now the most expensive House primary ever, one that has laid bare the divisions within the Democratic Party over the war in Gaza.\n\nMutual animosity between Latimer, the Westchester County executive, and Bowman, a two-term lawmaker, has been a throughline in the TV forums during the primary. The Tuesday evening debate on PIX11 was no different.\n\n\"It sends the wrong message and it's not what we should be doing at this time,\" Bowman, an Israel critic, said.\n\nOpposing Netanyahu's appearance before Congress highlights Bowman's deep antipathy over how the Israeli government has conducted the war in Gaza since the Oct. 7 Hamas attacks. And it's an issue where Bowman and Latimer have the most daylight.\n\nThe American Israel Public Affairs Committee and its super PAC, which has dropped more than $14 million into TV ads blasting Bowman.\n\nLatimer said he would attend the July speech by Netanyahu if he were a sitting member of the House. But Latimer, who has refrained by straying too deeply into Israeli politics, also said he disagreed with Netanyahu's criticism of President Joe Biden.\n\nBiden has publicly steered clear of this primary. But both candidates are eager to invoke his name -- and their support for a president whose poll numbers have been middling even in deep blue New York.\n\nLatimer in the debate called recent reporting and questions surrounding the 81-year-old president's abilities \"an ageist argument.\" Biden has a \"message that he can bring to the American people,\" he added.\n\nBowman has disagreed with Biden's support of Israel during the war. But on Tuesday night Bowman urged Democrats to unite behind Biden and especially encourage young voters to support the president.\n\n\"The Democratic Party needs to circle the wagons so he can win in November,\" Bowman said.\n\nBowman accused Latimer of taking money from Trump donors. Latimer knocked Bowman for having a Trumpian personality.\n\nAIPAC, the prominent pro-Israel group which has spent heavily to oppose Squad members like Bowman, is \"funded by racist MAGA Republicans,\" Bowman said.\n\nLatimer rebuffed that and pointed to AIPAC's backing of Jeffries, Reps. Ritchie Torres and Grace Meng -- all Democrats.\n\nFor his part, Bowman \"acts like Mr. Trump every chance he gets,\" Latimer said.\n\nBowman accused Latimer's campaign of sending mailers that have darkened his skin and for not taking an \"anti-racist approach\" to issues like housing and reparations for slavery. Latimer's donors are trying to silence him, Bowman said.\n\n\"I'm an outspoken Black man,\" Bowman said during the debate. \"His supporters don't want that, because it challenges their power.\"\n\nIt's a theme Bowman has hammered throughout the campaign in a district that includes a mix of affluent suburban enclaves and diverse urban neighborhoods.\n\nPushing back, Latimer tried to paint Bowman as a liar early in the debate, doing so three times within the first half hour.\n\nBowman needs \"a lie detector\" and has \"cornered the market on lies,\" Latimer said. He accused Bowman of \"fabrication\" in order to \"hold onto his seat in Congress.\"", "source": {"uri": "yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Biden", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Democratic Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israel", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Israel"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Israel"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gaza_Strip", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Gaza Strip"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Gaza Strip"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Palestine"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jamaal_Bowman", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Jamaal Bowman"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Latimer_(New_York_politician)", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "George Latimer (New York politician)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WPIX", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "WPIX"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Israel_Public_Affairs_Committee", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "American Israel Public Affairs Committee"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hamas", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Hamas"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Racism", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Racism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Westchester_County,_New_York", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Westchester County, New York"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Westchester County, New York"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_(state)", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "New York (state)"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Benjamin_Netanyahu", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Benjamin Netanyahu"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ageism", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Ageism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Political_action_committee", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Political action committee"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Congress", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United States Congress"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trumpism", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Trumpism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Make_America_Great_Again", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Make America Great Again"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grace_Meng", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Grace Meng"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reparations_for_slavery", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Reparations for slavery"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anti-racism", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Anti-racism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ritchie_Torres", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Ritchie Torres"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Suburb", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Suburb"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republican_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Republican Party (United States)"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues", "wgt": 7}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Warfare_and_Conflict", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Warfare and Conflict", "wgt": 7}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics", "wgt": 7}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/History", "label": "dmoz/Society/History", "wgt": 7}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Nationalism", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Nationalism", "wgt": 9}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 97}], "image": "https://s.yimg.com/cv/apiv2/social/images/yahoo_default_logo-1200x1200.png", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9660878", "eventUri": "eng-9660878", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "date": "-10-07", "textStart": 799, "textEnd": 805}], "sentiment": -0.3333333333333334, "wgt": 215, "relevance": 1}

Jamaal Bowman and challenger George Latimer has surged to new spending heights as the candidates and their allies fill TVs, phones and mailboxes with their messages in the race's final days.\n\nThe combined tab for the high-profile Democratic battle in New York's 16th Congressional district had passed $22 million as of Monday, according to federal records, with early voting underway and eight days to go before the June 25 election. It had become the nation's most expensive House primary this year and was likely to get costlier still before the last votes are cast.\n\nThe single biggest source was the United Democracy Project, a pro-Israel Super PAC that had so far reported pouring $11.6 million into commercials and mailings for Latimer and against Bowman, according to the Federal Election Commission. The second-term progressive and \"squad\" member from Yonkers was a prime target for the group because of his vocal criticism of Israel's war against Hamas in Gaza.\n\nLatimer, the Westchester County executive, also has benefited from $1.1 million in spending by another pro-Israel group -- Democratic Majority for Israel -- and $2.1 million by a group promoting crypto-currency.\n\nProgressive groups have scrambled to counter the barrage with their own ads and other support for Bowman. The Working Families Party and Justice Democrats each spent nearly $700,000 to bolster him. Another $500,000 in combined aid came from fellow New Yorker and squad-mate Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez; the Congressional Progressive Caucus; and a Muslim-American Advocacy Group.\n\nBut the spending tallies are lopsided. Outside groups backing Latimer had outspent Bowman's allies by 7-to-1.\n\nMaking their closing pitches\n\nLatimer, who has held elected offices in Westchester for more than 35 years, is campaigning in the homestretch with the same main message he used to start his House bid in December. \"Results not rhetoric\" is still his slogan, distilling his argument that he has a proven record as an effective leader and can accomplish more for the district in Washington than Bowman has.\n\nBowman has honed his own pithy message, one that takes aim at Latimer's outside support and casts a populist spin. \"This is the many versus the money,\" he proclaims in a new ad, condemning the flood of funding from well-heeled interests for his opponent and claiming the support of everyday people in the district.\n\nWide gap: Latimer leads Bowman by 17 points in poll days before voting starts in heated primary\n\nEach is touting high-profile endorsements on either side of the ideological split between progressives and more centrist Democrats. Hillary Clinton, who lives in Westchester, backed Latimer last week, while progressive icon Sen. Bernie Sanders -- Clinton's rival for the 2016 presidential nomination -- is supporting Bowman.\n\nSanders is even taking part in two rallies for Bowman this week, first in Hastings-on-Hudson on Friday and then in the Bronx on Saturday, where Ocasio-Cortez will join him.\n\nBreaking down the numbers\n\nThe two candidates have spent a combined roughly $6 million of their own campaign cash as of June 6, according to their federal reports. That includes $3.2 million Latimer had shelled out since launching his challenge and $2.8 million Bowman had spent since Oct. 1, as the prospect of a serious primary challenge began to loom.\n\nThe bulk of the more than $22 million in spending was done by outside groups, independent of the two campaigns.\n\nMore than $9 million of outside spending went into attack ads and mailings against Bowman, compared to $1 million in anti-Latimer efforts. Both slates of allies also have run positive messages to praise their preferred candidates: $5.4 million in pro-Latimer spending and $1 million in pro-Bowman expenses.\n\nFundraising surge: Pro-Israel and local donors power Latimer to big lead over Bowman in funds for primary\n\nOne of the newest spenders to join the fray was a group called Fairshake, which spent $2.1 million skewering Bowman in a TV ad. The group was formed to support Congress members who support the crypto-currency industry, although you wouldn't know if from the ad. That topic doesn't come up at all, and it hasn't been an issue on which Bowman and Latimer have staked out opposing stances.\n\nThe pro-Israel groups buying ads in the race also have generally steered clear of their main topic -- support for Israel and candidate stances on the Israel-Hamas war -- and focused on other reasons to praise Latimer or criticize Bowman.", "source": {"uri": "lohud.com",

Jamaal Bowman (D-NY) is on the verge of losing his primary to a challenger as several factors work against the \"Squad\" Democrat's quest to remain in office.\n\nBowman is at risk of being the first \"Squad\" Democrat to lose in his primary despite some efforts in the past that have nearly ousted members, such as Rep. Ilhan Omar (D-MN). Here are the three key reasons Bowman is on the brink of losing his seat to another Democrat next week.\n\nThe New York congressman is facing a challenge from Westchester County Executive George Latimer, who has pitched himself as a centrist Democratic alternative to the progressive Bowman. Latimer is well known in much of the district and has received the backing of former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton and key pro-Israel group the American Israel Public Affairs Committee, among others.\n\nWith Latimer's name and money to back him up, including a reported $14 million from AIPAC's super PAC alone, Bowman is calling up several progressive Democrats to support him in the waning days of the primary campaign.\n\nBowman has also attacked Latimer and his backing by AIPAC by claiming during a debate that the group is \"spending more money in this primary than any PAC has ever spent in U.S. history. Why? Because I'm an outspoken black man. I fight against genocide in Gaza, and I fight for justice right here.\"\n\nBowman has been one of the most vocal critics of Israel, which is in its ninth month of fighting against Hamas terrorists, since the war in Gaza began.\n\nHe has been at protests calling for an immediate ceasefire, without conditions on the hostages held by Hamas, and has called reports from Israel of Hamas sexually assaulting Israeli women \"propaganda,\" a comment he would later walk back.\n\nBowman's comments and stances have made him a top target to be ousted, as Israel is generally popular among most voters.\n\nWhile Bowman's anti-Israel stances have taken the spotlight in recent months, another reason voters may elect to oust him, and something his opponent has pointed out, is Bowman's antics in Congress.\n\nTwo incidents from Bowman's more than three years in Congress include a shouting match he had with Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene (R-GA) on the steps of the Capitol in May 2023 and when Bowman pulled a fire alarm as Congress was attempting to gather to vote on preventing a government shutdown in September 2023.\n\nLatimer hit Bowman in a May debate on his antics.\n\n\"You need to talk to them as normal people. You can't preach and scream at them on the steps of the Capitol,\" Latimer said. \"He's ineffective for this very reason.\"\n\nCLICK HERE TO READ MORE FROM THE WASHINGTON EXAMINER\n\nBowman said Latimer was attempting to use the \"angry black man\" trope.\n\nVoters in New York's 16th Congressional District will decide on Tuesday whether they want Bowman or Latimer to advance to the general election and almost certainly win in November in the heavily Democratic district.", "source": {"uri": "washingtonexaminer.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Washington Examiner"}, "authors": [{"uri":

Jamaal Bowman and fellow Democrat George Latimer, the current Westchester County Executive, are running to represent the 16th district of New York.\n\nNY Congressional races have played a critical role in determining who controls the House.\n\nRecent polls show Latimer ahead of Bowman, just days before primary day.\n\nElection Day in New York is Tuesday, June 24. Polls are open from 6 a.m. to 9 p.m. Early voting goes through June 23.\n\nSee here for more information on how to vote.\n\nThe results will essentially set the framework for the party's message in November and show how the most crucial suburban districts might vote in the fall.\n\nBoth candidates say they'll be on the road every day leading up to primary day to ensure voters get to the polls.\n\nRecently, the two have gone head-to-head on issues over the Israel-Hamas war, tax records, and gun violence.\n\nFOX 5 NY's Richard Giacovis spoke to voters who went to the polls Saturday.\n\nVoters in the 16th Congressional District rallied to the polls shortly after they opened.\n\n\"I've never voted early, but today, because this is such an important race, I'm here,\" one voter said.\n\nVoters seemed the most concerned about issues regarding education, housing and the war in Gaza.\n\nU.S. Rep. Jamaal Bowman, 48, a former middle school principal, seeking his third term, is arguably one of the House's most critical voices on Israel.\n\nIn 2020, he defeated U.S. Rep. Eliot Engel, chairman of the House Foreign Affairs Committee, who had served 16 terms.\n\nWhile he has condemned Hamas' attack, he claims that Israel is committing genocide in Gaza.\n\nSome of Bowman's priorities include but are not limited to:\n\nHis stance has put him at odds with the establishment, so much so, The American Israel Public Affairs Committee, a major lobbying organization, launched an entire campaign in order to unseat him.\n\nIn an interview with the Associated Press, Bowman defended his position on Israel.\n\nWhen asked how he plans to convince Jewish New Yorkers to vote for him, \"Well, it's not just about convincing Jewish New Yorkers. It's about convincing everyone across the district and just reintroducing myself.\"\n\nIn September, Bowman drew national attention after he triggered a fire alarm in the Cannon House Office Building as lawmakers scrambled to pass a funding bill before a government shutdown deadline.\n\nHe later pleaded guilty to a misdemeanor count for the move, but maintained it was a mistake as he tried to open a locked door while rushing to vote.\n\nGeorge Latimer, 70, has been a political figure in the district for over 30 years and serves as the Westchester County Executive.\n\nPreviously, Latimer served as a local and state legislator.\n\nHe recently scored the endorsement of former presidential candidate Hillary Clinton.\n\nHe says that Bowman's stance on Israel is only part of the reason he decided to join the race.\n\nLatimer believes voters in the district want a more moderate, pragmatic candidate than Bowman.\n\nSome of Latimer's priorities include but are not limited to:\n\nUnlike Bowman, Latimer has condemned Hamas' Oct. 7 attack on Israel and rising antisemitism, but has also been critical of U.S. military aid to Israel.\n\n\"If I go to Washington, I'm not going down there to be part of the verbal food fight. I'm going to try to figure out how to be a productive congressman that gets what results you can get,\" Latimer said in an interview with AP.\n\nBoth candidates have supported a two-state solution and say they want peace in the region.\n\nWhereas Bowman is critical of Israel's actions and wants a cease-fire, Latimer is clear in his support for Israel and said negotiating with Hamas is a nonstarter.\n\nLatimer also said he wouldn't give Israel \"a blank check\" on everything it chooses to do.", "source": {"uri": "fox5ny.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "FOX 5 New York"}, "authors":

And it's an issue where Bowman and Latimer have the most daylight.\n\nThe American Israel Public Affairs Committee and its super PAC, which has dropped more than $14 million into TV ads blasting Bowman.\n\nLatimer said he would attend the July speech by Netanyahu if he were a sitting member of the House.

Latimer's donors are trying to silence him, Bowman said.\n\n\"I'm an outspoken Black man,\" Bowman said during the debate. \"His supporters don't want that, because it challenges their power.\"\n\nIt's a theme Bowman has hammered throughout the campaign in a district that includes a mix of affluent suburban enclaves and diverse urban neighborhoods.\n\nPushing back, Latimer tried to paint Bowman as a liar early in the debate, doing so three times within the first half hour.\n\nBowman needs \"a lie detector\" and has \"cornered the market on lies,\" Latimer said.

Democratic Rep. Jamaal Bowman, a member of the Squad, is looking particularly vulnerable as he goes up against Westchester County Executive George Latimer. The latter leads Bowman in polls and also enjoys high profile endorsements. With Bowman and the overall Squad's anti-Israel take, especially but not merely since Hamas launched its October 7 attack against our ally in the Middle East, support for Israel certainly has come up as a prevalent issue in this race. That outside groups would dare to raise money on such a race is a factor Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-NY), a fellow Squad member of a nearby district, has not taken kindly to.\n\nAOC has been ranting for some time about this primary, though her outrage that Latimer would dare to challenge Bowman has really been ratcheting up in recent weeks. As we covered earlier this month, former Rep. Mondaire Jones, who previously represented the 17th Congressional District and is trying to win his seat back this year, has endorsed Latimer, to AOC's ire. Since then, Hillary Clinton has also endorsed him. Latimer also leads not only in internal polls, but non-internal polls as well.\n\nSen. Bernie Sanders (I-VT) and AOC will meanwhile hold a campaign event for Bowman on Saturday.\n\nPosting and reposting about those campaign event aren't enough for AOC, though. On Sunday she posted her outrage about outside spending involved in the race, including a cryptocurrency group known as FairShake. The independent expenditures for this cycle, at $16,478,266 shows Bowman on the receiving end of $10,264,793 and Latimer at the receiving end of $6,213,473.\n\n\"People everywhere need to understand how disgusting and abnormal it is for special interests to dump nearly $15 million to unseat a member of Congress in a primary,\" AOC claimed in her post. Rather than offer an explanation, she further engaged in an unhinged rant. \"This is corruption. It is a core threat to American democracy. It also fuels Trump,\" she also posted, demanding people \"Support Jamaal Bowman.\"\n\nWe've pointed out plenty of times before how Democrats keep ranting about and likely will keep ranting about these supposed \"threat[s] to American democracy,\" but to say that our primary process at work is \"a core threat\" is nonsensical even for AOC.\n\nBoth AOC and Bowman, as well as Rep. Cori Bush (D-MO), another Squad member at risk of losing her primary, came into office by defeating a Democratic incumbent in their primaries.\n\nBowman beat Rep. Eliot Engel, known for being a pro-Israel Democrat in the 2020 primary. During a recent virtual campaign event, Bowman referenced Engel and used antisemitic tropes in claiming that the American Israel Public Affairs Committee (AIPAC) has \"full control\" of Congress.\n\nAccording to Open Secrets, $635,220 of outside money was spent in AOC's 2018 primary against then incumbent Rep. Joe Crowley, with $633,302 spent to oppose her candidacy. Considering that AOC has beat outside spending forces before, she should perhaps welcome the challenge it brings to Bowman in this case.\n\nIn her general election against Republican Anthony Pappas, 36.31 percent of her funds came from \"Large Individual Contributions\" and 3.62 percent came from \"PAC Contributions,\" which \"Includes contributions from other candidate committees.\" This notably isn't 0 percent for a candidate who swears off PACs.\n\nFor Bowman's 2020 primary, OpenSecrets shows that he benefited from outside support. Of the $1,710,417 spent to support/oppose Bowman's bid to defeat Engel in the primary, more was actually spent to support Bowman: $903,752 worth. Engel benefited even more from outside dollars to support him, $1,404,737 worth of the $1,707,614 outside money spent, and he still lost.\n\nThat the primary process working in such a way \"fuel [former and potentially future President Donald] Trump\" is even more absurd a claim. This is a Democratic primary for a heavily Democratic district. The race is regarded as a \"Safe\" or \"Solid Democratic\" one regardless as to who wins the primary.\n\nThis would not be the first time that supposed Republican influence has come up in the primary for this heavily Democratic district. A common refrain from AOC, Bowman, Bush, and others has been to lambast AIPAC for also funding Republicans.\n\nIn addition to Bowman benefiting more from the groups mentioned in AOC's quoted repost, it's also noteworthy that 10 percent of Bowman's donations come from within the district, while that amount for Latimer is more than half.\n\nPOLITICO on Sunday highlighted those donation figures, but also the kind of rapport Latimer has in the district he's looking to represent:\n\nLatimer has picked up endorsements from fellow local leaders week after week -- including the mayor and three City Council members in Yonkers, where Bowman lives. And while just 10 percent of Bowman's campaign contributions come from his neighbors, more than half of Latimer's donations come from within the district.\n\nLatimer may not have any national name recognition compared to Bowman -- who has built his reputation in Congress as a left-wing agitator for sweeping change nationwide -- but he enjoys a different kind of celebrity. He's the Cher of Westchester County, known as just \"George\" to many in the suburban enclave north of New York City thanks to his 35 years in state and local government.\n\nLatimer's additional edge over Bowman comes from the American Israel Public Affairs Committee, or AIPAC, that's flooded the airwaves with more than $12 million in ads attacking the far-left firebrand for being out of step with mainstream Democrats. Bowman has tried to counter the hits by saying that AIPAC gets contributions from Republican megadonors.\n\nThe bitter Democratic primary between Bowman and Latimer -- one of the country's most competitive this cycle -- will test the influence of a movement politician pushing ultra-progressive national policies against a longtime local leader leveraging both his AIPAC support and his considerable community connections.\n\n\"You should know every one of the mayors, you should know what the five most important issues are in these communities,\" Latimer said at a recent campaign event. \"You ought to know that because you represent the people of your district, not the people who are part of a nationwide network that you communicate with on Twitter.\"\n\nThat same article begins by highlighting the \"local political clout\" Latimer has, in a piece memorably titled \"Jamaal Bowman's challenger is the Cher of suburban New York.\"\n\nRather than \"a core threat to American democracy,\" it is actually democracy in action for this primary to take place next Tuesday as the Democratic voters of New York's 16th Congressional District get to decide whether or not to elect Bowman for another term.\n\nClose to 6,000 replies came pouring in, as well as over 500 quoted reposts, to take issue with AOCs narrative. Users also jumped at the chance to bring up how Bowman pulled the fire alarm on September 30 last year when Congress was voting to avert a government shutdown, despite there being no emergency.",

Jamaal Bowman and Westchester County Executive George Latimer in New York's 16 Congressional District.\n\nBowman has represented the district, which covers Westchester County and a sliver of the Bronx, since 2021, after he won another hard-fought race against its former long-time Congress member, Eliot Engel. He ran as a far-left progressive and has maintained that status as a member of the so-called \"Squad.\"\n\nNow, Bowman is engaged in a bitter fight to keep his seat from Latimer -- a centrist who has been a fixture of Westchester County politics for decades. Latimer has led Westchester for the past six years and previously served on the town of Rye's City Council.\n\nAccording to a recent Emerson College poll, Latimer has 48% of the support from those surveyed, opening up a 17 point lead on the incumbent Bowman, who tallied 31%.\n\nMuch of the oxygen in the race has been taken up by the candidates' opposing views on Israel's devastating military offensive against Hamas in the Gaza Strip that followed the terror group's deadly Oct. 7 attacks -- where terrorists killed roughly 1,200 Israelis and took over 200 hostages.\n\nBowman is fiercely opposed to Israel's aggressive bombing campaign and ground invasion of the coastal enclave and has consistently referred to it as a genocide. Latimer, meanwhile, has defended the assault as necessary to the country's security.\n\nRace and the influence of money in politics have also been major points of contention in the election.\n\nBowman, during the final debate in the race on Pix11 Tuesday night, sought to refute accusations from Latimer that he does not work effectively with other lawmakers and stakeholders.\n\n\"My form of leadership is servant leadership, I like to serve the people in the district and serve the community,\" Bowman said. \"I work in collaboration with the people of New York City, Hastings, Mamaroneck, Rye and White Plains.\"\n\nLatimer,meanwhile, has tried to differentiate himself from Bowman by casting the current Congress member as more interested in making ideological statements than working with his peers to solve problems. By contrast, county executive argues that he is willing to collaborate with anyone to \"move from an idea to an actual accomplished fact.\"\n\nThroughout the primary, Bowman and Latimer have traded barbs over race.\n\nDuring the debate, Bowman charged that amid Latimer's tenure as county executive Black people in Westchester have made far less money than their white counterparts. Additionally, he accused Latimer of sending campaign attack mailers with images that darken his skin.\n\n\"He has an abysmal record when it relates to racial justice in Westchester and we need to hold him accountable for that,\" the representative said.\n\nLatimer responded that Bowman is \"cornering the market on lies,\" while rejecting the notion that his campaign darkened the Congress member's skin on campaign literature. He also insisted that he has worked on behalf of the district's Black and brown residents in areas like Yonkers and Mt. Vernon during his many years holding various levels of public office in Westchester.\n\n\"[Jamaal Bowman] doesn't know Westchester the way I do and when he talks about what we have or haven't done in the poor communities, he doesn't know, he's not in the district enough to know,\" Latimer said.\n\nAt the same time, Latimer has argued Bowman only represents the district's Black and brown communities, while ignoring its white and Asian residents. Bowman called the accusation \"a joke,\" emphasizing that his office has worked closely with the district's Asian community, while paying more attention to Black and brown residents he says have been historically \"neglected.\"\n\nWhen the debate turned to the armed conflict between Israel and Hamas, in which the country's military has killed roughly 37,000 Palestinians, according to the Gaza Health Ministry, Latimer rebuffed the idea that the massive death toll amounts to a genocide.\n\nInstead, he said, it is a result of Hamas' \"unwillingness\" to accept a plan recently outlined by President Biden to institute a three-phase end to the war in which there would be a ceasefire and Hamas would exchange Israeli hostages for Palestinian prisoners.\n\n\"It is not a genocide. Let me tell you what it is, it is the unwillingness of Hamas to sit down at the table,\" Latimer said. \"Hamas has to release hostages ... if you can get Hamas to release those prisoners, you can get a secession of the military action and humanitarian aid.\"\n\nWhile Israeli officials contend Hamas rejected the plan, the group said it simply reiterated specific terms it has long pushed for that were not included in the proposal.\n\nLatimer has also accused Bowman of minimizing the impact of Hamas' Oct. 7 attack and of antisemitism -- accusations which the representative denies.\n\nBowman, on the other hand, insisted that Israel's actions constitute genocide. He cited the massive Palestinian death toll and a determination from the International Court of Justice earlier this year that it is \"plausible\" the country violated the genocide convention of international law.\n\nFurthermore, the Congress member charged Latimer is refusing to acknowledge the Palestinian death toll or condemn Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu because of the large amount of donations that have flowed into his campaign from the American Israel Public Affairs Committee (AIPAC). The group has reportedly poured over $12 million into Bowman attack ads on Latimer's behalf.\n\n\"He does not acknowledge the existence of Palestinians, he has conflated Palestinians with Hamas and he doesn't support a Palestinian state,\" Bowman said. \"This is because AIPAC, the people who are funding his campaign, will not allow him to even condemn Benjamin Netanyahu or acknowledge the existence of Palestinians.\"", "source": {"uri": "amny.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "amNewYork"}, "authors": [{"uri": "ethan_stark_miller@amny.com", "name": "Ethan Stark-Miller", "type": "author",

Jamaal Bowman and Westchester County Executive George Latimer, the two candidates in the Democratic primary for New York's 16th Congressional District, squared off in a debate on PIX11 Tuesday night.\n\nNew York's 16th Congressional District includes a portion of Westchester County and part of the northern Bronx.\n\nBowman, a two-term incumbent, has served in the U.S. House of Representatives since 2021. Latimer has served as the county executive in Westchester since 2018.\n\nThe candidates debated a wide range of issues, including the economy, race, the war in Gaza, the U.S.-Mexico border and more.\n\nThe economy is the most important issue among likely Democratic primary voters in New York's 16th Congressional District, according to a recent poll conducted by PIX11, Emerson College and The Hill.\n\nBowman supports the Ending Corporate Greed Act, federal legislation that he says would bring down inflation costs and make corporations \"pay their fair share of taxes\" to the economy.\n\n\"We need to hold corporations accountable for price gouging and make sure they are contributing their fair share to support our government so that we can reinvest in the American people,\" Bowman said.\n\nLatimer said the first thing lawmakers need to do is restore the SALT tax deduction for taxpayers.\n\n\"There are middle class homeowners that have lost a major financial benefit that they need to have restored,\" Latimer said. \"My intention is to shift the tax cuts from those that received it under Donald Trump to the middle class howeowners. Those are the ones who deserve it, and those are the ones that when they have additional money will recycle it into the economy.\"\n\nRace-related topics have been invoked over the course of the campaign by both Bowman and Latimer. During the debate, both candidates were able to respond to allegations their opponent has made against them.\n\nLast week, Bowman said Latimer used an \"Islamophobic dog whistle\" in a forum when he said Bowman's \"constituency is Dearborn, Michigan\" while talking about outside sources of campaign funding.\n\nIn Tuesday's debate, Latimer called Bowman's Islamophobia claim \"baloney.\"\n\n\"The Islamophobic accusation comes from my mentioning of the words 'Dearborn, Michigan,' when I was citing where he was drawing support from. The reason why I used Dearborn, Michigan is not being of the Islamic presence there. It's because Rep. [Rashida] Tlaib and he created a joint fundraising committee ... in which money that she raises now can go into his campaign. That's why I mentioned Dearborn, Michigan. It has nothing to do with Islamophobia.\"\n\nIn their last debate, Latimer claimed Bowman ignores some constituents in the 16th District, saying Bowman doesn't mention Asians or people who are not Black or brown.\n\nBowman responded Tuesday night by calling Latimer's comment \"a joke.\"\n\n\"We've worked very closely with the Asian American community since we've gotten into office. We've stood up to anti-Asian hate in Scarsdale and other parts of the district. We represent the entire district, every corner of the district,\" Bowman said. \"The statement that I'm only representing part of the district is a joke.\"\n\nThe Israel-Hamas war in Gaza is another issue that has divided the two candidates.\n\nThe war began after Hamas militants attacked Israel on Oct. 7, killing around 1,200 people and taking 250 hostage. Israel's bombing since Oct. 7 has killed more than 37,000 Palestinians, according to health officials in Gaza.\n\nBowman has been critical of Israel's actions in Gaza and said Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu \"may be tried as a war criminal.\"\n\n\"The United States Congress should not be sending weapons to Israel at this time because according to the International Court of Justice, there is a plausible genocide happening in Gaza right now,\" Bowman said. \"We need a permanent cease-fire, which includes the release of the hostages ... [and] humanitarian aid getting into Gaza right now because a famine is setting in.\"\n\nLatimer voiced his support for Israel and denied that genocide is happening in Gaza.\n\n\"It is the unwillingness of Hamas to sit down at the table. President [Joe] Biden and Secretary [Antony] Blinken offered a program this very week that had the support of the United Nations and also had the support of Israel's willingness to go along with it,\" Latimer said.\n\nMore than 200,000 migrants have come to New York in the last two years. New York City and the state have spent billions of dollars assisting these men, women and children.\n\nEarlier this month, President Joe Biden took executive action to limit the number of migrants who can claim asylum at the southern border.\n\nBowman said he had concerns over Biden's executive action on the border. The congressman said he wants the U.S. to instead address the \"root causes of mass migration.\"\n\n\"I'm concerned about us taking a conservative approach to the border. I'm concerned about the executive action. When people are coming here, they are coming here seeking asylum, they are seeking safety. Our country has always been a place where people can come and seek asylum.\"\n\nLatimer said Biden's executive action is a \"step in the right direction,\" but he believes the best way to address the border crisis is through legislative action.\n\n\"There does need to be additional border security. There needs to be a restructuring of the asylum system. There needs to be some path for citizenship. There also has to be some ability to control the amount of numbers that come into the country,\" Latimer said.", "source": {"uri": "pix11.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "WPIX"}, "authors":

Jamaal Bowman finally apologizes for denying Hamas...", "body": "Embattled \"Squad\" Rep. Jamaal Bowman apologized at long last this week for initially claiming that reports of rape and child murder during Hamas' Oct. 7 terror attack against Israel were a \"lie.\"\n\n\"Immediately when the [United Nations] provided additional evidence, I voted to condemn the sexual violence. I apologize for my comments,\" Bowman said Monday during a WNYC interview after a listener pressed him on the matter.\n\n\"As soon as I got the additional information from the UN, we condemned the sexual violence, we voted to condemn it, and we're continuing to do the work.\"\n\nSpeaking during an anti-Israel rally in White Plains last Nov. 17, Bowman said: \"There was propaganda used at the beginning of the siege.\n\n\"There's still no evidence of beheaded babies or raped women, but they still keep using the lie,\" Bowman said, according to video posted to TikTok and first reported by Politico.\n\nBowman, 48, is facing off against Westchester County Executive George Latimer, 70, in the June 25 primary for the 16th House District, which covers much of Westchester and parts of the northern Bronx.\n\nThe race has shattered records as the most expensive House primary ever in terms of ad spending, with more than $23 million doled out for TV, radio, digital and social media spots.\n\nA recent Emerson College/WPIX poll showed Bowman trailing Latimer by 17 points -- 48% to 31% -- among likely primary voters, with 21% undecided.\n\nPro-Israel activists accused Bowman of spreading Hamas propaganda by denying atrocities against Israeli women and children during the Oct. 7 attack, which killed an estimated 1,200 people -- including 33 Americans.\n\nWhile Bowman had had walked back his November comments previously, Monday marked the first time the two-term congressman issued a humble mea culpa.\n\n\"I am not going to be perfect. I'm going to make mistakes. I'm going to say things that harm people, even though I don't mean to. When I do, I'm going to take accountability for it. I'm going to own it,\" he said on WNYC.\n\n\"I want to learn and grow and be the best representative I can be. That's who my mother raised me to be, that's who I was as an educator, and that's who I am now.\"\n\nLatimer and pro-Israel activists said Bowman's apology was \"too little, too late\".\n\n\"Denying rape is wrong, period. Denying the barbaric beheading of babies is wrong, period. Calling rape victims liars is wrong, period,\" the Latimer campaign said in a statement Thursday.\n\n\"And Bowman apologizing for his lies six months later, and only because he is now on the verge of getting tossed out of office, speaks volumes about his lack of decency and compassion. It's not just a matter of his 'apology being too little, too late' -- it's that no one believes Bowman because he has proven he will say anything, no matter how dishonest, cruel, or divisive, to try to stay in power.\"\n\nThe Democratic Majority for Israel, which is backing Latimer and released a digital ad accusing Bowman of lying on other issues, also mocked the congressman's \"half-hearted\" apology.\n\n\"Congressman Jamaal Bowman has flip-flopped again. Bowman falsely labeled the savage sexual violence perpetrated by Hamas 'propaganda.' Now, on the eve of an election he's losing, Bowman makes a halfhearted apology,\" said DMFI president Mark Mellman\n\n\"Way too little. Way too late.\"\n\nMeanwhile, Bowman is trying to connect with younger voters, making an appearance Wednesday night on CBS' \"Late Show with Stephen Colbert,\" during which he discussed hip-hop as well as the war in the Middle East.\n\nBowman said he immediately condemned the Hamas Oct. 7 attacks on Israel as a \"horrific\" but described Israel's retaliatory response in Gaza as \"collective punishment\", and called for a permanent cease-fire,\" saying: \"We've got to put the guns down.\"\n\nThe congressman is also scheduled to appear with rapper Cash Cobain Thursday night at the Capitol Theatre in Port Chester.\n\nThe Emerson/PIX/The Hill poll found Bowman leading Latimer among voters under 40, 44% to 35%, while older voters broke for the Westchester executive by double-digits.",

Jamaal Bowman and Westchester County Executive George Latimer, the two candidates in the Democratic primary for New York's 16th Congressional District, squared off in a debate on PIX11 Tuesday night.\n\nNew York's 16th Congressional District includes a portion of Westchester County and part of the northern Bronx.\n\nBowman, a two-term incumbent, has served in the U.S. House of Representatives since 2021. Latimer has served as the county executive in Westchester since 2018.\n\nThe candidates debated a wide range of issues, including the economy, race, the war in Gaza, the U.S.-Mexico border and more.\n\nThe economy is the most important issue among likely Democratic primary voters in New York's 16th Congressional District, according to a recent poll conducted by PIX11, Emerson College and The Hill.\n\nBowman supports the Ending Corporate Greed Act, federal legislation that he says would bring down inflation costs and make corporations \"pay their fair share of taxes\" to the economy.\n\n\"We need to hold corporations accountable for price gouging and make sure they are contributing their fair share to support our government so that we can reinvest in the American people,\" Bowman said.\n\nLatimer said the first thing lawmakers need to do is restore the SALT tax deduction for taxpayers.\n\n\"There are middle class homeowners that have lost a major financial benefit that they need to have restored,\" Latimer said. \"My intention is to shift the tax cuts from those that received it under Donald Trump to the middle class howeowners. Those are the ones who deserve it, and those are the ones that when they have additional money will recycle it into the economy.\"\n\nRace-related topics have been invoked over the course of the campaign by both Bowman and Latimer. During the debate, both candidates were able to respond to allegations their opponent has made against them.\n\nLast week, Bowman said Latimer used an \"Islamophobic dog whistle\" in a forum when he said Bowman's \"constituency is Dearborn, Michigan\" while talking about outside sources of campaign funding.\n\nIn Tuesday's debate, Latimer called Bowman's Islamophobia claim \"baloney.\"\n\n\"The Islamophobic accusation comes from my mentioning of the words 'Dearborn, Michigan,' when I was citing where he was drawing support from. The reason why I used Dearborn, Michigan is not being of the Islamic presence there. It's because Rep. [Rashida] Tlaib and he created a joint fundraising committee ... in which money that she raises now can go into his campaign. That's why I mentioned Dearborn, Michigan. It has nothing to do with Islamophobia.\"\n\nIn their last debate, Latimer claimed Bowman ignores some constituents in the 16th District, saying Bowman doesn't mention Asians or people who are not Black or brown.\n\nBowman responded Tuesday night by calling Latimer's comment \"a joke.\"\n\n\"We've worked very closely with the Asian American community since we've gotten into office. We've stood up to anti-Asian hate in Scarsdale and other parts of the district. We represent the entire district, every corner of the district,\" Bowman said. \"The statement that I'm only representing part of the district is a joke.\"\n\nThe Israel-Hamas war in Gaza was another issue that divided the candidates.", "source": {"uri": "pix11.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "WPIX"}, "authors": [{"uri": "dan_mannarino@pix11.com", "name": "Dan Mannarino", "type": "author",

Jamaal Bowman, D-N.Y., a former middle school principal who is backed by the progressive left, including self-described Democratic Socialist Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D-N.Y.\n\nOn the other side is Westchester County Executive George Latimer, a more moderate candidate who has scored backing from Hillary Clinton, the American Israeli Public Affairs Committee (AIPAC), and former Rep. Mondaire Jones, D-N.Y., who is vying to get back into Congress himself.\n\nThe fight is part of a wider fracture within the Democratic Party caused by Israel's war in Gaza.\n\nAOC SLAMMED FOR SAYING 'FALSE ACCUSATIONS' OF ANTISEMITISM ARE 'WIELDED AGAINST PEOPLE OF COLOR'\n\nBowman is part of a growing coalition on the left that's critical of the Israeli government and its treatment of Palestinians, a movement that's been met with bipartisan pushback.\n\nIt sparked a new battle for Bowman on Saturday after he criticized fellow House Rep. Ritchie Torres, D-N.Y., on the \"Night School\" podcast for his vocal support of Israel.\n\n\"I think that he's trying to gain political power for himself towards an ultimate objective,\" Bowman said.\n\nTorres told Fox News Digital on Monday in response, \"I have a general rule of not weighing in against a congressional Democrat who has not weighed in against me. But Bowman's gratuitous attack on my character might cause me to rethink that rule. Stay tuned.\"\n\n'SQUAD' MEMBER DEFENDS 'RIVER TO THE SEA' PHRASE INTERPRETED AS CALLING FOR 'EXTERMINATION' OF JEWS\n\nAIPAC's political arm also donated more than $1.5 million to Latimer during this campaign cycle, according to financial disclosures.\n\nIn response, Bowman and his allies have criticized AIPAC as a right-wing organization despite its bipartisan reputation.\n\nOcasio-Cortez called the group a \"slush fund for Republican billionaires\" on X \\this month and previously compared it to the National Rifle Association.\n\nShe's also accused outside groups of spending more than $15 million to unseat Bowman, writing on X, \"This is corruption. It is a core threat to American democracy. It also fuels Trump.\"\n\nShe and Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., are holding a rally for Bowman on Saturday before primary day.\n\nBowman's comments on the Israel-Hamas conflict are also what inspired Jones, a former ally of Bowman's in the Congressional Progressive Caucus (CPC), to publicly shun him in favor of his opponent.\n\nNIKKI HALEY WRITES CLEAR MESSAGE TO HAMAS ON IDF ARTILLERY SHELL\n\n\"Over the past few months, I have had countless conversations with Jewish residents in my district and across the Lower Hudson Valley who feel anxiety, anger, and fear due to Rep. Bowman's words and actions. I will always stand up for my Jewish constituents,\" Jones said in a statement when the CPC challenged him over his Latimer endorsement.\n\nBowman could lose his seat in similar circumstances under which he won it, by defeating longtime moderate Rep. Eliot Engel, D-N.Y., in the 2020 primary.\n\nA survey by Emerson College Polling/PIX11/The Hill released last week had Latimer leading Bowman 48% to 31%.\n\nBut Democrat strategist Max Burns of Third Degree Strategies argued that Bowman was still popular with voters.\n\nCLICK TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\n\"I think there's always going to be a concern that we need to move back to the center. There's always going to be this fear that we're alienating voters, but the data just shows that that's not true,\" Burns told Fox News Digital. \"I mean, Jamaal Bowman has been incredibly popular in his district. ...

ceasefire.\n\n\"Even if we were to get Hamas using these methods, we will just give birth to another generation of extremists,\" Bowman said.\n\nLatimer says that Israel has a right to defend itself and openly condemns the Hamas terrorist attack on October 7, but says that negotiations are incumbent on the president and his team.\n\n\"While negotiations are going on, I don't think it's helpful for those of us outside the negotiating process to comment about what we think should be discussed at the table,\" Latimer said.\n\nWhen it comes to domestic issues, the pair are not quite as divided.\n\nIn regard to the over 200,000 migrants who have come to New York in the past two years, Latimer says there needs to be more border security but would also like to see Congress make immigration policy a priority.\n\nBowman, meanwhile, called the issue a major challenge but agreed that there is more the federal government can and should do.", "source": {"uri": "fox5ny.com",

Jamaal Bowman against Westchester County Executive George Latimer.\n\n\"The #NY16 primary is one week away. It's seen over $23M in spending and reservations, making it the most expensive House primary ever,\" said campaign advertising tracking firm Ad Impact.\n\nA Super Pac affiliated with the Israel American Public Affairs Committee, United Democracy Project, has spent a staggering $14 million in ads -- 61% of the total -- mostly pounding Bowman, a critic of the Jewish State.\n\nThe figure includes digital ads on the web and social media as well as TV and radio spots.\n\nThe AIPAC group's barrage -- which included spots attacking Bowman for his vote against President Biden's infrastructure law, as well as his hostility toward Israel -- dwarfs the ad spending of all other groups combined.\n\nPro-Latimer forces together outspent those backing Bowman more than 5 to 1.\n\nLatimer's campaign has spent $2.54 million in ads and a pro-Latimer, anti-Bowman cryptocurrency group called Fair Shake bankrolled another $2.14 million.\n\nThat means the pro-Latimer forces have spent nearly $19 million in a bid to topple Bowman, who is seeking a third term in the 16th Congressional District encompassing much of Westchester and parts of the northern Bronx.\n\nBy comparison, the Bowman campaign has spent $2 million on ads, the pro-Bowman leftist group Justice Democrats paid for $1million and the Working Families Party, $538,000.\n\nThe spending on the New York race shatters the previous record for most expensive ad spending for a House primary in Oregon's 6th House District -- $17.8M in 2022, an Ad Impact spokesman said.\n\nThe New York race is the most closely watched in the country -- a microcosm playing out between the Democratic socialist progressive left in Bowman and the more moderate wing represented by Latimer, the popular Westchester County executive.\n\nThe split in the party -- and the candidates -- has been the Israel-Hamas war.\n\nLatimer has been a big booster of Israel and its retaliatory response in Gaza to Hamas' Oct. 7, 2023 attack on the Jewish State, while Bowman has accused the Israel military of committing \"genocide.\"\n\nOvercoming the avalanche of anti-Bowman ads will be a big challenge to his campaign's get out the vote operation that includes foot soldiers from leftist allies such as the Democratic Socialists of America and the Working Families Party.\n\n\"My opponent has sold out to AIPAC and their right-wing billionaires. They're spending millions to try and buy our district. They may have the money but we have the power of the people. #WeDecide the future of NY-16, not them,\" Bowman said in a statement Wednesday on X.\n\n\"This is the many versus the money and we will win,\" he said.\n\nCampaign strategists said Bowman -- who will participate in rallies with fellow Squad member and neighboring Rep. Alexandria Ocasio Cortez and democratic socialist Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders on Saturday -- has an uphill climb.\n\n\"It will be hard for the organized left to overcome a voting record that appears out of sync with this district. Not just on Israel but on supporting President Biden's infrastructure bill,\" said Democratic strategist Chris Coffey.\n\n\"You see lots of mainstream Democrats supporting Latimer, which is near unheard of against an incumbent democrat. \"\n\nCoffey said the Democratic left is \"pulling out all of the stops to try and hold on\" but polling and the money, as well as voter registration, favors Latimer.\n\n\"A great ground game might be worth a couple points and folks on the far left might be slightly more likely to vote, but Latimer seems to be far enough ahead that it should still be advantage Latimer,\" he said.\n\nA recent Emerson College/Pix 11 poll had Latimer ahead of Bowman by 17 points.\n\n\"This is a real test for the Democratic Socialists beyond this election,\" said campaign consultant Hank Sheinkopf.\n\nA victory for Latimer will embolden the pro-Israel lobby and weaken the anti-Israel DSA -- which supports the boycott, divestment and sanctions movement against the Jewish State -- in future elections including the race for mayor and council in New York City next year, he said.\n\nA Bowman victory will electrify the political left and the anti-Israel movement, he added.", "source": {"uri": "nypost.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "New York Post"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_media", "type": "wiki",

Latimer is leading in polling, and if he wins, he will be the first challenger to successfully unseat a member of the progressive \"Squad\".\n\nThe massive haul of outside spending - most of it funding ads attacking Bowman and supporting Latimer - underscores Bowman's precarious position as a high-profile \"Squad\" member whose criticism of Israel and outspoken support for Palestinian rights has drawn the ire of the pro-Israel lobby.\n\nBut the race is more than a referendum on Israel-Palestine policy. It's also a test of the fledgling progressive wing of the Democratic party, whose ranks Bowman joined after winning an upset primary victory in 2020 and defeating former representative Eliot Engel, an incumbent who had held the office since 1989.\n\nThe New York race has brought that split - between a generation of left-leaning Democrats and their establishment colleagues - back to the fore.\n\nAmong Bowman's highest-profile supporters are the senator Bernie Sanders and the representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (known as AOC), who will appear at a rally Saturday to turn out voters for the incumbent. Meanwhile, Latimer has earned the support of the former secretary of state and Democratic party establishment stalwart Hillary Clinton.\n\nThe race has turned ugly at times, with Latimer claiming during a debate that Bowman has earned more support from Dearborn, Michigan - the only majority-Arab city in the US - than his New York district.\n\nSince 7 October, Bowman has consistently voiced opposition to Israel's military operations in Gaza - a critical point of difference between the incumbent and his challenger, who has said he supports a two-state solution in the region but has not called for a ceasefire. Latimer has accused Bowman of rabble-rousing in Congress and has said he would govern as a centrist - and he avoided taking a position on tax hikes for the wealthy during a debate.\n\nThe proxy war between the left and right of the Democratic party has been bolstered by staggering outside spending. Super Pacs, which can spend unlimited amounts of money on ads advocating for or against candidates, had spent $20.3m as of 20 June, according to campaign finance records, which tend to slightly lag behind AdImpact's numbers.\n\nA Guardian analysis of campaign finance records has found that three Super Pacs have spent nearly $18m to unseat Bowman. United Democracy Project (UDP), an Aipac-affiliated Super Pac, has spent more than $14.5m backing Latimer - the most the group has spent on any single race in its history. Latimer has also benefited from $1m from the group Democratic Majority for Israel and $2m from the crypto-backed group FairShake, according to Federal Election Commission records. Meanwhile, a coalition of 10 progressive outside groups have spent about $3m in support of Bowman.\n\nBoth campaigns have also raised considerable cash in the form of direct campaign donations - in contrast with Super Pac spending, which doesn't go directly to campaigns - with Bowman raising $5.9m and Latimer netting $5.7m.\n\nOf those contributions, a larger share of Bowman's campaign cash has come from small donors than Latimer's - with a total of about $1.4m in donations of less than $200, to Latimer's approximately $320,000.", "source": {"uri": "theguardian.com", "dataType": "news",

Jamaal Bowman, of \"lying\" in a TV ad that suggests the Daily News gave him the newspaper's endorsement, which it did not.\n\nThe Bowman ad in question attributes the statement \"America needs brave leaders like Jamaal Bowman\" to The News -- and while that statement appeared in an opinion piece in the paper, it was not issued by the paper's editorial board.\n\n\"Bowman clearly feels that he can only win by twisting the facts and falsely attributing a statement to a major newspaper in a sad attempt to manipulate the electorate,\" Latimer's campaign said in a written statement Tuesday. \"Using this tactic is not only unethical, but it's also a clear attempt to deceive the public and exaggerate his support.\"\n\nThe ad includes text that reads: \"Paid for and approved by Jamaal Bowman for Congress.\"\n\nIn a statement, the paper noted that it endorsed Latimer, not Bowman in the upcoming Democratic primary for the 16th Congressional District.\n\n\"Political ads that misrepresent newspaper endorsements are a disservice to democracy,\" the News' statement said.\n\nBowman and Latimer, who serves as Westchester County executive, have been locked in a bitter primary battle for months with much of the debate centered on the war in Gaza and the Oct. 7 Hamas terrorist attacks which prompted it. Bowman has argued much of Latimer's support amounts to undue influence from pro-Israel lobbyists and Republicans, while Latimer has maintained Bowman is out of touch with the congressional district he represents.\n\nThe two have also sparred over statements from Bowman that the Latimer camp and his surrogates have framed as fact-challenged, such as Bowman's claim that he \"co-wrote\" President Biden's signature CHIPS and Science Act and claims he wouldn't accept money from campaign donors tied to the real estate industry, corporate PACs or lobbyists.\n\nThe accusation that Bowman spread \"lies,\" however, is a considerable escalation and comes amid early voting and a week before the June 25 primary.\n\nThe statement Bowman's campaign used in the TV ad came from a June 9 opinion piece penned by Naomi Klein, an associate professor of climate justice at the University of British Columbia. The title of the piece, which praises Bowman for his support of the Green New Deal, is \"America needs brave leaders like Jamaal Bowman.\"\n\nThe TV ad isn't the first time Bowman's campaign or his supporters have tried to portray The News as giving him its backing in the race.\n\nIn an April 24 fundraising email, the lefty political group Our Revolution cited the Daily News as suggesting attacks against Bowman are racist. That view wasn't put forth by The News itself, but in a guest opinion column in the paper that was authored by Audrey Sasson, executive director of Jews For Racial & Economic Justice, and Sochie Nnaemeka, former director of the New York Working Families Party.\n\nBowman's campaign did not immediately respond to questions about the ad and the email.", "source": {"uri": "nydailynews.com",

His primary opponent, Westchester County Executive George Latimer, has taken the opposite position.\n\nGroups supporting Latimer have attacked Bowman for the view and have used his comments about Hamas's sexual violence in advertisements and mailers to voters.\n\nThe race has been defined by age, which younger voters sticking with the progressive Bowman while older voters have tended to back Latimer, according to polling. It has also divided Democrats, with Hillary Clinton among the leaders to endorse Latimer while progressives like Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) prop up Bowman.\n\nFormer Rep. Mondaire Jones (D-N.Y.) also endorsed Latimer in what was viewed as backstabbing a fellow progressive. Jones has long ties to Latimer and worked with him before running for Congress himself.\n\nAn Emerson College/The Hill poll last week found Latimer with a sizable 17-point lead over Bowman in the primary, 48-31.\n\nThe poll found that 51 percent of respondents have a favorable view of Bowman, compared to 43 percent who have an unfavorable view of the House Democrat. In comparison, 65 percent said they have a favorable view of Latimer, while 23 percent had an unfavorable view of the county executive.\n\nThe seat is reliably blue, meaning whoever wins the Democratic primary later this month is the heavy favorite to win in November.", "source": {"uri": "thehill.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Hill"}, "authors": [{"uri": "nick_robertson@thehill.com", "name": "Nick Robertson", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sexual_violence", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Sexual violence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israel", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Israel"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Israel"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jamaal_Bowman", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Jamaal Bowman"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hamas", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Hamas"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Nations", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United Nations"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Presidency_of_Joe_Biden", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Presidency of Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Latimer_(New_York_politician)", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "George Latimer (New York politician)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Millennials", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Millennials"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Westchester_County_Executive", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Westchester County Executive"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Progressivism", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Progressivism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domestic_violence", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Domestic violence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mondaire_Jones", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Mondaire Jones"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hillary_Clinton", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Hillary Clinton"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emerson_College", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Emerson College"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/County_executive", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "County executive"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Progressivism_in_the_United_States", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Progressivism in the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Hill_(newspaper)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "The Hill (newspaper)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bernie_Sanders", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Bernie Sanders"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Congress", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "United States Congress"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Democratic Party (United States)"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Violence_and_Abuse", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Violence and Abuse", "wgt": 19}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Sexuality", "label": "dmoz/Society/Sexuality", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Sexuality/Sex_Education", "label": "dmoz/Society/Sexuality/Sex Education", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Domestic_Violence", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Domestic Violence", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Sexuality/Advice", "label": "dmoz/Society/Sexuality/Advice", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 93}], "image": "https://thehill.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/01/AP23334017059789-e1706731619594.jpg?strip=1&w=640", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9660878", "eventUri": "eng-9660878", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.3725490196078431, "wgt": 192, "relevance": 1}

Eliot Engel.\n\nAnd they've been critical this year as the very vulnerable lefty firebrand fights to fend off a challenge from George Latimer, an establishment Democrat whose base trends much more Boomer.\n\nGen Z-electeds like Rep. Maxwell Frost (D-Fla.) and New York City Council Member Chi Oss\u00e9 have campaigned with Bowman, producing slick social media videos to entice still more support from 20-somethings.\n\nYouth-led groups like Sunrise Movement, which advocates for a \"climate revolution,\" and Protect Our Power, which seeks to keep Squad members like Bowman in office, have been canvassing, phone banking and even confronting wealthy Latimer donors (getting it on video, natch).\n\n\"He has consistently shown up for young people, whether that be for our calls for climate action or labor or the pro-peace movement,\" Ella Weber, communications director for Protect Our Power, said in an interview.\n\nBut it may not be enough: Bowman is vastly outspent, down in the polls and struggling in the final stretch of the race. And older voters typically outnumber younger ones at the ballot box.\n\nLatimer, the executive of suburban Westchester County, said in an interview that his core support comes from voters who've gotten to know him throughout his long career in local and state government -- and they vote reliably.\n\nA recent Emerson College poll backed up his take: Democratic primary voters over age 40 favor him by significant margins, with his biggest advantage among voters over 70, who break for him 53 to 22 percent.\n\nThe Bowman-Latimer battle in Westchester County and the Bronx ranks as the most expensive House primary ever, with AIPAC and other pro-Israel groups pouring money into defeating Bowman over his criticism of Israel amid the war in Gaza.\n\nThe generational gap in appeal is stark between Bowman, a 48-year-old former middle school principal, and Latimer, the more moderate 70-year-old political veteran.\n\nAnd it's apparent in their outreach. Bowman makes fast-moving hype videos for TikTok and recently posted himself on X rapping KRS-One's \"The MC,\" while Latimer posts musings and grainy photos on Facebook.\n\nBut it's even more about Bowman's insistence that the United States should not finance the Israeli offensive in Gaza and AIPAC-backed Latimer's refusal to condemn Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu.\n\n\"The generational divide indicates other things like stance on Israel, like stances on racial justice, stances on climate, right? That's what you see here,\" Bowman said in an interview.\n\nThe Israel-Hamas war factors prominently in the contentious primary with a sizable Jewish electorate. It's also the flash point exacerbating President Joe Biden's struggles to retain younger, more left-leaning support.\n\n\"As we look to the general election and as we think about turning out young people to defeat Donald Trump, Joe Biden needs someone like Jamal Bowman who can really speak to young people,\" Stevie O'Hanlon of Sunrise Movement said in an interview. \"There is a real disillusionment among many young people with politics right now, and unfortunately, that is leading to some people staying home and deciding not to vote.\"\n\nBowman is harnessing young supporter enthusiasm ahead of next Tuesday's primary, including with a \"youth mobilization concert\" Thursday in Port Chester headlined by Cash Cobain, a 26-year-old rapper from the Bronx.\n\n\"He certainly appeals to them in style,\" Latimer conceded. \"He's an educator who worked with young people, so I do grant him that as being a strength of his.\"", "source": {"uri": "yahoo.com", "dataType": "news",

Bowman has called for a ceasefire, raising concerns about Israel's ground offensive in Gaza. Latimer, meanwhile, has established himself as the more moderate, pro-Israel candidate, voicing support for its military following Hamas' October 7, 2023, attack.\n\nThe race has drawn record-breaking ad spending for a primary election, with the majority being spent against Bowman, according to data reported by AdImpact this week.\n\n\"The #NY16 primary is one week away. It's seen over $23M in spending and reservations, making it the most expensive House primary ever,\" AdImpact wrote in a post to X, formerly Twitter.\n\nAdImpact reported that the United Democracy Project, an affiliate of American Israel Public Affairs Committee (AIPAC) has spent just over $14 million on ads opposing Bowman. Many of the ads, however, have not discussed Israel, instead focusing on other issues such as infrastructure.\n\nThe PAC has also received money from many Republican donors, sparking concerns from Bowman supporters who have said the party should not have so much influence on a Democratic primary.\n\nFairshake, a pro-cryptocurrency PAC, has spent more than $2 million on ads opposing Bowman.\n\nMeanwhile, Bowman has received support from outside spending groups, as well, though much less than Latimer. The progressive group Justice Democrats spent about $1 million on ads, and the Working Families Party spent about $538,000, according to AdImpact.\n\nLatimer's campaign has spent $2.54 million on ads, while Bowman's campaign has spent $2.03 million, according to the data.\n\nAn AdImpact spokesperson told Newsweek the previous record for primary ad spending was set by Oregon's 6th Congressional District in 2022, when Democrat Andrea Salinas defeated Carrick Flynn, a cryptocurrency billionaire who received nearly $11 million in donations from FTX CEO Sam Bankman-Fried, according to MarketWatch.\n\nThe other most expensive House primaries for ad spending were Georgia's 7th District in 2022, Virginia's 5th District in 2024 and Michigan's 11th District in 2022, according to the spokesperson.\n\nNewsweek reached out to Bowman's and Latimer's campaigns for comment via email.\n\nBruce Berg, a professor of political science at Fordham University, told Newsweek that the rise spending is significant \"because of the amount being spent and the visibility it is giving the campaigns.\"\n\nHe said that Bowman's votes against key Democratic priorities in Congress such as infrastructure have \"made him an outlier among Democratic regulars,\" and that his Israel criticism has alienated him from more conservative Jewish voters in the district. Latimer, meanwhile, is a strong challenger who is \"an established and respected candidate\" in the area, he said.\n\n\"Given all the ways in which the Democratic Party is currently divided -- pro-Biden, anti-Biden, Israel supporter, Israel critic -- this is the classic matchup. And it should not be forgotten that there is a racial aspect to this race,\" Berg said.\n\nAhead of the primary, polls suggest Latimer has a lead over Bowman.\n\nAn Emerson College poll conducted among 425 likely voters from June 6 to 8 found that 48 percent of respondents said they plan to back Latimer, while 31 percent said they will vote for Bowman. The poll has a margin of error of plus or minus 4.7 percentage points.\n\nA March 26 to 30 Mellman Group poll, sponsored by the Democratic Majority for Israel PAC, found Latimer leading 52 to 35. That poll was conducted among 400 likely voters and had a margin of error of 4.9 percentage points.\n\nWhoever wins the Democratic primary will be considered likely to win the general election in the deeply Democratic district, which is composed of parts of the Bronx and the more suburban Westchester County north of New York City. The district backed President Joe Biden by nearly 45 points in 2020.", "source": {"uri": "newsweek.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Newsweek"}, "authors": [{"uri": "andrew_stanton@newsweek.com",

Rep.'s 'Ethnic Advantage'", "body": "The Democratic primary in New York's 16th Congressional District is getting ugly. The race between progressive Rep. Jamaal Bowman (D-N.Y.) and Westchester County Executive George Latimer is already the most expensive House primary ever, and now Latimer is facing accusations of using racist tactics against the incumbent congressman.\n\nIn a Thursday interview with Punchbowl News, Latimer said he expects Bowman to get at least 40 percent of the vote.\"\n\n\"Does he have an obvious ethnic benefit? Yes,\" Latimer said of Bowman, who is Black. \"Will he get the people who are furthest to the left? Yes. But once you get beyond a couple of constituencies that he has strength in, he's weak everywhere else.\"\n\nEarlier this week, the two men faced off in the final primary debate ahead of next week's election. During the encounter, Bowman accused Latimer's campaign of mailing out flyers with images of him that significantly darkened his complexion.\n\nLooming over the heated battle between the two men is an effort by the American Israel Public Affairs Committee (AIPAC) to unseat progressive members of the House who have been critical of Israel's military actions in Gaza. In March, AIPAC launched a $100 million effort -- with the backing of prominent Republican donors and Trump allies -- to target candidates of their choice. These include progressive Democrats like Reps. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-N.Y.), Ilhan Omar (D-Minn.), Rep. Ayanna Pressley (D-Mass.), Rep. Cori Bush (D-Mo.), Rep. Rashida Tlaib (D-Mich.) -- the only Palestinian-American member of Congress -- and Bowman.\n\nIn New York's 16th Congressional District, AIPAC has already spent more than $14 million on attack ads against Bowman through their PAC, United Democracy Project. In one instance, the group tapped Elisha Wiesel, the son of famed Holocaust survivor and author Elie Wiesel, for an ad. \"Who are the antisemites engaged in falsely accusing Israel of genocide?\" she asked. \"Who stands up to oppose them? And who stands by silently? We know where Jamaal Bowman stands.\"\n\nBowman addressed AIPAC's involvement in the race directly during Tuesday's debate. \"AIPAC is spending more money in this primary than any PAC has ever spent in U.S. history,\" he said. \"Why? Because I'm an outspoken Black man. I fight against genocide in Gaza, and I fight for justice right here.\"", "source": {"uri": "rollingstone.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Rolling Stone"}, "authors": [{"uri": "nikki_mccann_ramirez@rollingstone.com", "name": "Nikki McCann Ramirez", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Progressivism_in_the_United_States", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Progressivism in the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Democratic Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jamaal_Bowman", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Jamaal Bowman"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York's_16th_congressional_district", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "New York's 16th congressional district"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Westchester_County_Executive", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Westchester County Executive"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Incumbent", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Incumbent"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Israel_Public_Affairs_Committee", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "American Israel Public Affairs Committee"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_House_of_Representatives", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States House of Representatives"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Racism", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Racism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republican_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Republican Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israel", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Israel"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Israel"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cori_Bush", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Cori Bush"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Holocaust_survivors", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Holocaust survivors"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elisha_Wiesel", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Elisha Wiesel"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alexandria_Ocasio-Cortez", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rashida_Tlaib", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Rashida Tlaib"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ayanna_Pressley", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Ayanna Pressley"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elie_Wiesel", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Elie Wiesel"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Political_action_committee", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Political action committee"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antisemitism", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Antisemitism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_the_United_States", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "History of the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genocide", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Genocide"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ilhan_Omar", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Ilhan Omar"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gaza_Strip", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Gaza Strip"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Gaza Strip"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Palestine"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Warfare_and_Conflict", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Warfare and Conflict", "wgt": 9}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics", "wgt": 8}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Campaigns_and_Elections", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Campaigns and Elections", "wgt": 8}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Race-Ethnic-Religious_Relations", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Race-Ethnic-Religious Relations", "wgt": 9}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Nationalism", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Nationalism", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 96}], "image": "https://www.rollingstone.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/George-latimer-comments.jpg?crop=0px%2C35px%2C1798px%2C1014px&resize=1600%2C900", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9660878", "eventUri": "eng-9660878", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.0980392156862745, "wgt": 184, "relevance": 1}

Jamaal Bowman, D-N.Y., was subjected to more scathing press that cited local Jewish leaders adamantly opposed to his re-election.\n\nBowman, considered a member of the left-wing \"Squad\" in Congress, was the subject of a Jewish Insider piece headlined \"No More Bridges to Burn in Westchester,\" referencing the suburban New York City county that makes up much of his district and is also home to the largest Jewish population outside the Big Apple.\n\nThe former junior high school principal is in the political fight of his life against a more moderate Democrat, Westchester County Executive George Latimer, and has even lost the support of some fellow progressives over his criticism of Israel.\n\nAccording to the Jewish Insider piece, Bowman asked a local Westchester Jewish leader in 2022 whether he had photographs of the two of them together as he tried to rally support for his election.\n\nDONALDS SLAMS LIBERALS LIKE BOWMAN, MIDLER FOR ATTACKS ON MANCHIN\n\n\"Do you have pics of us ... so I can show the world I'm friends with Jewish people[?]\" according to contents of a text reportedly viewed by the outlet.\n\nThe Jewish leader told the outlet he had at least one image from an event Bowman attended after a promise to support a House bill favoring former President Trump's Abraham Accords Mideast peace deal.\n\nBowman later reportedly withdrew his support for the legislation, and the Jewish leader said the overall situation made him \"uncomfortable.\"\n\nThat situation and other content in the piece caused outrage among Jewish activists, including StopAntisemitism founder Liora Rez, who told Fox News Digital it is time for Bowman to \"find a new job.\"\n\n\"Jamaal Bowman has consistently made clear in his statements and actions his animus toward Israel and the Jewish people,\" said Rez, who escaped antisemitism as a refugee from the Soviet Union.\n\nBOWMAN SWIPES AT HILLARY CLINTON AFTER SHE ENDORSES HIS OPPONENT\n\n\"His hostility to individuals, including his own constituents, simply because of their faith and ethnic background is sickening, and he and his bigoted views deserve no recognition in Washington.\"\n\nBowman's office did not respond to a request for comment on the Jewish Insider piece.\n\nAnother local Jewish leader, Rabbi Evan Hoffman, recently told the New York Post he would support Latimer as Jewish constituents are reportedly organizing a \"Vote Shabbat\" drive to oppose the incumbent.\n\n\"Bowman is opposed to Israel and more subtly the Jews in his own district,\" Hoffman said.\n\nBowman has spoken out on the BDS (Boycott Divestment Sanctions) movement against Israel, calling it a \"nonviolent protest opportunity to hold Israel accountable.\" Pro-Israel activists consider it conversely antisemitic and an effort to hurt Israel.\n\nBowman's opponent, Latimer, has gotten the opposite reception. A February report from The Intercept said support from AIPAC - the American Israel Public Affairs Committee - has constituted more than two-fifths of his fundraising war chest. Bowman has, in turn, accused the group of trying to \"buy\" the race.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nFormer Rep. Mondaire Jones, D-N.Y., a fellow progressive who represented the district across the Tappan Zee Bridge from Bowman, notably chose to endorse Latimer this year.\n\nJones' former district, now mostly represented post-redistricting by Rep. Michael Lawler, R-N.Y., also hosts a large Hasidic population in Rockland County.\n\n\"I'm making this endorsement [of Latimer] to stand up for my Jewish constituents because Representative Bowman and I have very different views on Israel,\" Jones told the Associated Press.\n\nBowman's supporters, however, sing his praises as much as his critics do the opposite. Angela Davis-Farrish, an official with the New Rochelle Municipal Housing Authority, praised the lawmaker in a Politico piece after the introduction of legislation to establish a rent ceiling for certain families on government assistance.\n\nHe is also endorsed by New York's Working Families Party and the Democratic Socialists of America.\n\nThe Republican contender primed to face either Bowman or Latimer is Dr. Miriam Flisser, a pediatric consultant who previously served as mayor of Scarsdale.\n\nThe district, however, is rated D+20 by the Cook Partisan Voting Index, which suggests that the eventual Democrat nominee is a heavy favorite in November.", "source": {"uri": "1010wcsi.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "1010 WCSI"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

Jamaal Bowman and Westchester County Executive George Latimer, the two candidates in the Democratic primary for New York's 16th Congressional District, will face off in a debate on PIX11 Tuesday night.\n\nThe debate will be broadcast live from 7 to 8 p.m. on PIX11. It will also be streamed on PIX11.com and PIX11+. The debate will be livestreamed in this story.\n\nPIX on Politics host Dan Mannarino and PIX11 political reporter Henry Rosoff will moderate the debate. Viewers are encouraged to share their thoughts during the debate on X using #PIXDebateNY16.\n\nNew York's 16th Congressional District includes a portion of Westchester County and part of the northern Bronx.\n\nThe race between Bowman and Latimer has been arguably the most closely watched contest ahead of the upcoming primary elections in New York. Millions of dollars from outside the district have poured into the race ever since Latimer launched his challenge of Bowman.\n\nBowman, a two-term incumbent, has served in the U.S. House of Representatives since 2021.\n\nLatimer has served as the county executive in Westchester since 2018.\n\nA recent PIX11 poll showed Latimer leading Bowman 48% to 31% just weeks before Election Day. The survey of likely Democratic primary voters in New York's 16th Congressional District was conducted by PIX11, Emerson College and The Hill. Of those polled, 21% were still undecided.\n\nThe early voting period for New York's primary elections is currently underway and will end on June 23. Election Day is June 25.", "source": {"uri": "pix11.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "WPIX"}, "authors": [{"uri": "finn_hoogensen@pix11.com", "name": "Finn Hoogensen", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WPIX", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "WPIX"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York's_16th_congressional_district", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "New York's 16th congressional district"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jamaal_Bowman", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Jamaal Bowman"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Latimer_(New_York_politician)", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "George Latimer (New York politician)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Westchester_County_Executive", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Westchester County Executive"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_House_of_Representatives", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States House of Representatives"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Democratic Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_(state)", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "New York (state)"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Westchester_County,_New_York", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Westchester County, New York"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Westchester County, New York"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Bronx", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "The Bronx"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "The Bronx"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emerson_College", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Emerson College"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/County_executive", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "County executive"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Hill_(newspaper)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "The Hill (newspaper)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Incumbent", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Incumbent"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Election_Day_(United_States)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Election Day (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Primary_election", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Primary election"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics", "wgt": 9}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Campaigns_and_Elections", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Campaigns and Elections", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Jewelry/Watches", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Jewelry/Watches", "wgt": 9}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Online_Issues_Polls", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Online Issues Polls", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Collecting/Clocks_and_Watches", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Collecting/Clocks and Watches", "wgt": 8}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 95}], "image": "https://pix11.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/25/2024/06/bowman-latamir.jpg?strip=1&w=640", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9660878", "eventUri": "eng-9660878", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-06-23", "textStart": 1503, "textEnd": 1510}, {"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-06-25", "textStart": 1528, "textEnd": 1535}], "sentiment": 0.05098039215686279, "wgt": 180, "relevance": 1}

Maxwell Frost (D-Fla.) and New York City Council Member Chi Oss\u00e9 have campaigned with Bowman, producing slick social media videos to entice still more support from 20-somethings.\n\nYouth-led groups like Sunrise Movement, which advocates for a \"climate revolution,\" and Protect Our Power, which seeks to keep Squad members like Bowman in office, have been canvassing, phone banking and even confronting wealthy Latimer donors (getting it on video, natch).\n\n\"He has consistently shown up for young people, whether that be for our calls for climate action or labor or the pro-peace movement,\" Ella Weber, communications director for Protect Our Power, said in an interview.\n\nBut it may not be enough: Bowman is vastly outspent, down in the polls and struggling in the final stretch of the race. And older voters typically outnumber younger ones at the ballot box.\n\nLatimer, the executive of suburban Westchester County, said in an interview that his core support comes from voters who've gotten to know him throughout his long career in local and state government -- and they vote reliably.\n\nA recent Emerson College poll backed up his take: Democratic primary voters over age 40 favor him by significant margins, with his biggest advantage among voters over 70, who break for him 53 to 22 percent.\n\nThe Bowman-Latimer battle in Westchester County and the Bronx ranks as the most expensive House primary ever, with AIPAC and other pro-Israel groups pouring money into defeating Bowman over his criticism of Israel amid the war in Gaza.\n\nThe generational gap in appeal is stark between Bowman, a 48-year-old former middle school principal, and Latimer, the more moderate 70-year-old political veteran.\n\nAnd it's apparent in their outreach. Bowman makes fast-moving hype videos for TikTok and recently posted himself on X rapping KRS-One's \"The MC,\" while Latimer posts musings and grainy photos on Facebook.\n\nBut it's even more about Bowman's insistence that the United States should not finance the Israeli offensive in Gaza and AIPAC-backed Latimer's refusal to condemn Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu.\n\n\"The generational divide indicates other things like stance on Israel, like stances on racial justice, stances on climate, right? That's what you see here,\" Bowman said in an interview.\n\nThe Israel-Hamas war factors prominently in the contentious primary with a sizable Jewish electorate. It's also the flash point exacerbating President Joe Biden's struggles to retain younger, more left-leaning support.\n\n\"As we look to the general election and as we think about turning out young people to defeat Donald Trump, Joe Biden needs someone like Jamal Bowman who can really speak to young people,\" Stevie O'Hanlon of Sunrise Movement said in an interview. \"There is a real disillusionment among many young people with politics right now, and unfortunately, that is leading to some people staying home and deciding not to vote.\"\n\nBowman is harnessing young supporter enthusiasm ahead of next Tuesday's primary, including with a \"youth mobilization concert\" Thursday in Port Chester headlined by Cash Cobain, a 26-year-old rapper from the Bronx.\n\n\"He certainly appeals to them in style,\" Latimer conceded. \"He's an educator who worked with young people, so I do grant him that as being a strength of his.\"", "source": {"uri": "politico.com", "dataType":

So I can show the world I'm friends with Jewish People.\"\n\n\"I was uncomfortable,\" the rabbi said of the request, adding that he \"kind of joked around with him about it.\"\n\n\"I don't want to be his court Jew,\" he told Jewish Insider. \"That wasn't what I signed up for.\"\n\nJustin Brasch, a Jewish Democrat who serves on the White Plains City Council, told the outlet that Mr. Bowman \"is not someone who wants to build bridges with Jews and the Jewish community. ...

Jamaal Bowman (D-NY) is likely to lose his primary next Tuesday against Westchester County Executive George Latimer. Past comments come back to haunt Bowman, including how he claimed last November it was \"propaganda\" and \"a lie\" to say that Hamas terrorists raped women when they perpetrated their attack on October 7 against Israel. The vulnerable congressman has once more apologized, as POLITICO covered on Thursday morning.\n\nPer their New York Playbook:\n\nSAYING SORRY: Bowman apologized this week for calling Hamas' sexual violence against Israeli women on Oct. 7 \"propaganda\" and \"lies.\"\n\nBowman, the left-leaning Democrat facing the prospect of defeat next week, said in response to a WNYC caller, \"Immediately when the UN provided additional evidence, I voted to condemn the sexual violence. I apologize for my comments and now we're continuing to do the work to fight sexual violence and domestic violence in all its forms.\"\n\nAfter POLITICO first reported on the comments he made at a pro-Palestinian rally last November, Bowman condemned Hamas and said he \"always stand[s] against sexual violence in all forms\" but didn't apologize at the time. His initial comments have been used in several attack ads and mailers. -- Daniel Lippman\n\nIn what world is Bowman merely a \"left-leaning Democrat,\" especially when he and other members of the Squad are more accurately far-left? This is especially on display when it comes to support for our ally in the Middle East, with Squad members taking particularly anti-Israel positions.\n\nNote also how Bowman \"didn't apologize at the time,\" which is in reference to how he was approached by POLITICO on the steps of the Capitol but wouldn't speak to the issue back in late March. Rather, his office later provided a statement to the outlet apologizing for such remarks.\n\nBowman made his remarks in the middle of November at an event calling for a ceasefire in the Israel-Hamas conflict. The comments, in which Bowman cast doubt on how Hamas terrorists had raped women during their October 7 attack against Israel, were not unearthed until late March. While more reports have since come forth about such atrocities, there was plenty of evidence about the rapes when Bowman spoke at the event.\n\nAs Bowman referenced in his apology to the WNYC caller in the conversation mentioned by POLITICO above, he joined with almost all of his fellow House members voting in February to pass a resolution condemning the sexual assault and rapes committed by Hamas. Only Rep. Rashida Tlaib (D-MI), a fellow Squad member, did not vote for the resolution, and instead voted \"present.\"\n\nBowman was also on the Wednesday episode of \"The Late Show With Stephen Colbert,\" whereas NewsBusters aptly put it in their headline, \"Colbert Helps Bowman Sanitize His History Of Spouting Hamas Propaganda.\"\n\nWhen Colbert asked Bowman to \"clarify where you stand and do you understand why some people have gotten upset about what you said,\" the congressman offered in part that \"yes, October 7th was incredibly traumatic. It was a war crime, it was a terrorist attack. We condemned it right away because they killed innocent civilians. It was horrible.\"\n\n\"However, the response has been collective punishment and tens of thousands of civilians have been killed and that's why we called very early on for a ceasefire and for us a permanent cease-fire, it means stop the fighting, release the hostages, get humanitarian aid in there because famine is setting in and children are starving to death, and please, please, please, let's find a pathway to peace,\" Bowman went on to say as part of his response, also going after Israel as he has done so.\n\nLatimer leads Bowman by double digits in internal and non-internal polls and also enjoys endorsements from the American Israel Public Affairs Committee (AIPAC), the Democratic Majority for Israel (DMFI), Hillary Clinton, and former Rep. Mondaire Jones.\n\nBowman is meanwhile supported by fellow Squad members, especially Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-NY), as well as Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-VT), both of who are campaigning for him on Saturday. With particularly looney takes on the primaries and money being spent in the race amounts to a supposed \"core threat to democracy,\" it'll be interesting to see if such support from AOC is enough to make a difference.", "source": {"uri": "townhall.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Townhall"}, "authors": [{"uri": "rebecca_downs@townhall.com", "name": "Rebecca Downs", "type": "author",

certain families on government assistance.\n\nHe is also endorsed by New York's Working Families Party and the Democratic Socialists of America.\n\nThe Republican contender primed to face either Bowman or Latimer is Dr. Miriam Flisser, a pediatric consultant who previously served as mayor of Scarsdale.\n\nThe district, however, is rated D+20 by the Cook Partisan Voting Index, which suggests

Jamaal Bowman (D-NY) bashed the American Israel Public Affairs Committee in his final debate against challenger George Latimer, denouncing their support for his opponent as \"Republican racist MAGA Trump money.\"\n\nBowman's race has been defined by the intervention of AIPAC, who turned on him following his change of position on Israel during the war in Gaza, from which he has emerged as one of the congressmen most critical of Israel. According to Punchbowl, AIPAC has devoted $14 million to the race, bashing Bowman and boosting Latimer. In their final debate, the incumbent continued his theme of bashing the donations as right-wing dark money.\n\nIn his closing statement, Bowman said that AIPAC is \"spending more money in this primary than any PAC has ever spent in U.S. history. Why? Because I'm an outspoken Black man. I fight against genocide in Gaza, and I fight for justice right here.\"\n\nAt another point, he said that there was an avalanche of \"Republican racist MAGA Trump money\" attacking him.\n\nBowman has come under fire since Hamas's surprise attack against Israel on Oct. 7, which began the deadliest clash between Israel and Palestinians since Israel's founding in 1948. Jewish leaders have denounced Bowman's hesitation to firmly side with Israel, whom he used to support prior to the current conflict. His current stance is in line with that of other progressives, such as Reps. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-NY), Ilhan Omar (D-MN), and Rashida Tlaib (D-MI).\n\nBowman's opposition to Israel has grown as the conflict has dragged on. Last week, in a meeting with the Democratic Socialists of America, he said that his views align with theirs and that he would soon announce his support for the boycott, divest, and sanction movement -- seen by many Jews as antisemitic. He has denounced the war in Gaza as a genocide and voiced opposition to funding for Israel's Iron Dome missile defense system.\n\nThe impact of the surge of funds was made evident during the TV debate when a single ad break featured three different attack ads against Bowman.\n\nIsrael was a prominent topic during the debate, with Bowman responding to a question about whether the United States should fund the Iron Dome, saying no more money should be given to Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu.\n\n\"This race is really about the many versus the money,\" Bowman said. \"It's about the working class people, the people in the district who have felt ignored for a very long time, versus powerful, very wealthy special interests, mostly Republican billionaires, who are trying to buy this seat from the people and bombard the people with advertisements and mailers to paint me as this bad person in Congress.\"\n\nCLICK HERE TO READ MORE FROM THE WASHINGTON EXAMINER\n\nLatimer repeatedly called the incumbent a liar, and accused him of hiding behind progressive rhetoric rather than delivering for the people of the district.\n\nBowman is set to be the first incumbent Democrat to lose his primary, with a June poll from PIX showing him trailing Latimer by 17 points.", "source": {"uri": "washingtonexaminer.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Washington Examiner"}, "authors": [{"uri":

Admin silently went back on their own deal with students in which they agreed to reverse our mass suspensions due to the outrage.\n\nAs part of my appeal, I submitted my Common Application essay to show that I have been transparent from the very start about my commitment to Palestinian liberation and organizing -- they knew who they admitted when they accepted me. This was the response I received.\n\nThe reality of these elite institutions is that\n\nthey love admitting students based on their supposed commitment to activism and social justice until those students actually follow through in ways that threaten the status quo and the institutional priorities.\n\nColumbia loves to flaunt its legacy of student protest. Barnard's entire purported mission is to uplift women's voices. These institutions capitalize on the legacies of their former student activists while actively repressing and punishing their current student activists.\n\nOur battle, in the end, is not with university administrators. It is with the entire U.S. war machine that funds the Zionist entity. However, the actions of these administrators are an important reminder that none of us are truly free under the settler-colonial apparatus.\n\nYou think you are free? You can't even speak out against genocide without being fired from your job or suspended or doxxed. You can't go to a protest without being brutalized or arrested. The state is lashing out, but this means we are winning. Escalate for Gaza, everywhere.\n\nChris Hayes\n\n@chrislhayes\n\nPeople should take a moment to imagine the amount of terror, violence, expense and destruction that is going to be necessary to deport TWENTY MILLION people. And also, think the won't just mess up and grab a whole bunch of American citizens while they're at it?\n\nEight years after the 2016 election, Democrats are reliving the infamous Clinton-Sanders battle -- this time in the race for New York's 16th Congressional District.\n\nRep. Jamaal Bowman (D-N.Y.), a \"squad\" member favored by Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.), is facing a rocky path to reelection against Westchester County Executive George Latimer, a centrist who earned Hillary Clinton's support this week.\n\nThe June 25 primary is unearthing old rivalries in a party facing an identity crisis over Israel in a part of the state that many Jews call home.\n\n\"This primary is more about the war in Gaza than anything else,\" said Doug Gordon, a Democratic consultant and co-founder of UpShift Strategies.\n\n...\n\nThere's plenty of anger in both camps. Bowman has repeatedly suggested Latimer is racist, while Latimer has accused Bowman of aligning with ultra-right-wing Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene (R-Ga.) on a key vote. Both have sought to paint the other as ineffective and wrong for the blue district.\n\nOn Wednesday, after Clinton threw her weight behind Latimer, old wounds were reexposed.\n\n\"With Trump on the ballot, we need strong, principled Democrats in Congress more than ever,\" Clinton wrote in a post on the social platform X. \"In Congress, @LatimerforNY will protect abortion rights, stand up to the NRA, and fight for President Biden's agenda--just like he's always done.\"\n\nAn endorsement from the former first lady -- who represented New York in the Senate -- is now being tested. Observers say it sent a signal about the ideological importance of the race for Democrats.\n\n...\n\nBowman, who's trailing in recent polls, downplayed her decision.\n\n\"I definitely wouldn't call that a major endorsement,\" Bowman said in an appearance on CNN, before touting his support from Sanders, Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) and House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries (D-N.Y.). Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-N.Y.) is also hosting a rally with Sanders for Bowman just before election day.\n\nOne progressive Bowman can't count on for support is former Rep. Mondaire Jones (D-N.Y.), who's running in the neighboring district after briefly leaving Congress. Jones lent his backing to Latimer in a surprise endorsement, causing a stir among liberals who saw it as a flat out backstab.\n\nThe firmness of [Latimer's] support from Israel allies has been the biggest point of frustration for progressives, who take issue with funding AIPAC and UDP receive from Republican donors.\n\n\"Sadly, it appears the real story here is the amount of campaign spending by outside groups to oust Bowman from his seat,\" said Tim Black, a pro-Sanders progressive commentator and activist.\n\nBowman has expressed solidarity with Palestinians. He often publicly condemns the Israeli government and has doubled down on critiques of Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and military leaders as the war continues.\n\nNoted bestselling author and ignorant racist Cori Bush is telling people she cured a woman of tumors just by touching her body, and the media treats this story as interesting, even heart-warming.\n\nThe trans TikToker who was banned from the White House after going topless during a Pride celebration on the lawn has been accused of sexual assaulting at least five people. Rose Montoya, who was born male but now identifies as a woman, allegedly abused the victims over many years.\n\nJesse Diamond, who goes by TransMuscleBear online, made the allegations on social media, detailing the abuse suffered at the hands of Montoya while recovering from sex change operation years ago. Diamond shared an email appearing to be from Montoya, which read, \"I broke your trust and violated you,\" as well as \"I'm sorry I forced myself on you.\"\n\nAccording to Diamond, while the abuse was \"nonstop for nearly a year,\" the emotional pain lasted far beyond that. \"I attempted to end my life on more than one occasion due to how depressed I was from the trauma,\" Diamond explained. \"After my third surgery, I went nearly 2 years without kissing or intimacy of any kind.\" Diamond said there were at least four other victims.\n\n\"I was incapable of walking the first 10+ times that she r*ped me,\" Diamond continued. \"I couldn't run away if I tried & I couldn't afford to stay anywhere else.\" Diamond noted that Montoya filed a restraining order to prevent Diamond from speaking out, but that it was denied by a judge. \"If she continues to try to threaten me with legal action,\" Diamond added, \"I have no issue presenting her confession to a judge + making it public record.\"", "source": {"uri": "acecomments.mu.nu", "dataType": "news", "title": "acecomments.mu.nu"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Columbia_University", "type":

Jamaal Bowman, D-N.Y., suggested the pro-Israel lobby is targeting him for being an \"outspoken Black man\" during a heated debate with his primary challenger on Tuesday night.\n\nThe debate was Bowman's last televised faceoff against Westchester County Executive George Latimer before next week, which will be the culmination of one of the most expensive House primary races in U.S. history.\n\nThe progressive Democrat took shots at the bipartisan-focused American Israeli Public Affairs Committee (AIPAC) several times throughout the event, accusing it of operating as a right-wing organization. AIPAC is supporting Latimer, and its campaign arm has poured millions into the race.\n\nAOC SLAMMED FOR SAYING 'FALSE ACCUSATIONS' OF ANTISEMITISM ARE 'WIELDED AGAINST PEOPLE OF COLOR'\n\n\"The majority of his money comes from right-wing Republicans who support Trump,\" Bowman said of Latimer.\n\nWithout naming AIPAC, he said, \"They are spending more money in this primary than any PAC has ever spent in U.S. history.\"\n\n\"Why? Because I'm an outspoken person of color. I'm an outspoken Black man. I fight against genocide in Gaza, and I fight for justice right here,\" Bowman said, before referring back to Latimer and adding, \"And his supporters don't want that because it challenges their power.\"\n\nFox News Digital reached out to Bowman's campaign to clarify whether his comments targeted AIPAC specifically.\n\nLatimer shot back at him that groups like AIPAC not only supported him but also people like House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries, D-N.Y., Rep. Ritchie Torres, D-N.Y., and House Foreign Affairs Committee ranking member Rep. Gregory Meeks, D-N.Y. - none of whom are White.\n\n'SQUAD' MEMBER DEFENDS 'RIVER TO THE SEA' PHRASE INTERPRETED AS CALLING FOR 'EXTERMINATION' OF JEWS\n\n\"The support that they have and I have from individuals comes because of our support of the state of Israel. His opposition comes because he has been anti-Israel, hostile to Israel,\" Latimer said. \"I have never once flipped a position because of campaign donation. Not once.\"\n\nBowman responded, \"Just because you've got a few Black friends doesn't make you an anti-racist organization.\"\n\n\"He keeps naming off these Black names as if it doesn't make AIPAC and their supporters racist,\" Bowman said.\n\nLatimer earlier called accusations of racism against himself \"baloney.\"\n\nBowman namedropped AIPAC again in his closing statement, arguing, \"I work in collaboration with the people, displaying servant leadership, while my opponent is big money in politics personified. He takes billions from right-wing Republicans to serve them and AIPAC.\"\n\nNIKKI HALEY WRITES CLEAR MESSAGE TO HAMAS ON IDF ARTILLERY SHELL\n\nLatimer's closing statement emphasized his decades in local New York politics, adding, \"Who do you trust? Who do you believe has your interest first?\"\n\nCLICK TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nA recent poll by Pix11, which hosted the debate, conducted along with Emerson College and The Hill, showed Latimer leading Bowman 48% to 31%.\n\nIf he wins the June 25 primary, Latimer will be the first moderate Democrat to knock off a member of the left-wing \"Squad.\"", "source": {"uri": "foxwilmington.com",

It's from fear,\" Ocasio-Cortez said on X. \"Reps are terrified of this. Of AIPAC. So they don't vote their conscience. They vote their fear.\"\n\nOcasio-Cortez's comments came in a response to a post referencing the money spent by a group affiliated with the American Israel Public Affairs Committee to oppose far-left congressman Jamaal Bowman (D., N.Y.), a fellow Squad member. Bowman's primary challenger, an AIPAC-supported candidate, is Westchester County executive George Latimer.\n\nBowman has been an outspoken critic of Israel since Hamas's Oct. 7 attack on the Jewish state. He has called reports of rapes perpetrated by Hamas on Oct. 7 \"propaganda\" and voted against a resolution condemning Hamas's attack on Israel because he believes the attack was not \"unprovoked\" as the resolution described it. Bowman once asked a Jewish community leader for a photo of the two of them together, \"So I can show the world I'm friends with Jewish People,\" according to a report this week.\n\nDuring a virtual town hall meeting in April alongside Reps.

Latimer Is About Whether Billionaires Control Congress, Says Sanders | Common Dreams", "body": "With early voting already underway in New York, U.S. Sen. Bernie Sanders warned Tuesday that Westchester County Executive George Latimer's primary challenge to Democratic Congressman Jamaal Bowman in the state's 16th District is ultimately about the power of the ultrarich.\n\n\"The Democratic primary between Rep. Jamaal Bowman and George Latimer is not just a clash of two very different points of view. It is a clash over the future of the Democratic Party and the future of American politics,\" said Sanders (I-Vt.). \"It is a clash over whether we will have, at least minimally, a democratic form of government in which Congress represents the needs of ordinary Americans, or whether Congress will be completely controlled by the billionaire class and corporate interests.\"\n\nSanders' statement came as the senator prepares to rally with Bowman on Friday at MacEachron Park in Hastings-on-Hudson. On Saturday, they are set to be joined by Democratic Congresswoman Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, who represents New York's 14th District, for a get-out-the-vote rally at St. Mary's Park in the Bronx. The official primary date is June 25.\n\nBowman -- a critic of the U.S.-backed Israeli war on Gaza -- has been the top congressional target of pro-Israel lobbying groups during this cycle. In fact, largely thanks to spending by a group tied to the American Israel Public Affairs Committee (AIPAC), \"it had become the nation's most expensive House primary this year,\" Gannett reported this week.\n\nUnited Democracy Project (UPD), an AIPAC-affiliated super political action committee (PAC), has spent over $14 million on advertising for the contest, according to AdImpact. The group is followed by Latimer -- who filed paperwork for his campaign after visiting Israel and was accused of \"straight up Islamophobia\" during a debate with Bowman last week.\n\n\"Latimer's campaign will attract more billionaire super PAC money than any primary race in history,\" Sanders said Tuesday. \"The donors behind these super PACs, AIPAC's United Democracy Project and the crypto-backed Fairshake, are not only spending a huge amount of money to support Latimer's campaign, but are also making large donations to right-wing extremist Republican candidates.\"\n\n\"For the billionaires who control these super PACs, it doesn't matter much whether you are a Democrat or a Republican. It only matters that you support the corporate agenda and Establishment neo-con foreign policies,\" he continued. \"The defeat of Bowman would not only result in the loss of a strong, progressive member of Congress, it would be a message to every member of Congress that if you oppose corporate interests the billionaire class will take you down. We must not allow that to happen.\"\n\nSharing Sanders' full remarks on social media, Bowman said that \"AIPAC and their Republican billionaire donors are using NY16 as a test. They think they can buy our district -- but we won't let them. On June 25th it's the many v. the money, and we will win.\"\n\nFellow \"Squad\" member Ocasio-Cortez also took aim at AIPAC on social media Tuesday, declaring that it is \"time to rally.\"\n\n\"Big money, from AIPAC to Wall Street, have poured millions to buy this election,\" she said, urging participation in the Saturday rally. \"To win, we must mobilize thousands.\"\n\nIn addition to targeting Bowman, AIPAC, UDP, and wealthy right-wingers are working to oust another Squad member: Democratic Congresswoman Cori Bush, who is facing St. Louis County Prosecutor Wesley Bell the August 6 primary for Missouri's 1st District.\n\n\"We've got your back, Jamaal Bowman!\" Bush declared on social media last week. \"From St. Louis to the Bronx, I know the people will stand with us to show that we are

Jamaal Bowman accused of treating Jews like 'tokens'...", "body": "Embattled \"Squad\" Rep. Jamaal Bowman once reportedly asked a Jewish leader for a picture of the two of them together to prove that \"I'm friends with Jewish people\" -- prompting outrage from rabbis Tuesday in his Westchester County district.\n\nJewish leaders from across the spectrum and many of their constituents in the 16th Congressional District accused the far-left pol of treating them like \"tokens,\" and said they'd be voting for his moderate rival George Latimer in next Tuesday's Democratic primary.\n\n\"I'm looking forward to taking a picture of Jewish leaders enthusiastically watching Bowman's concession speech,\" quipped Rabbi Joseph Potasnik, executive vice president of the New York Board of Rabbis.\n\nHe was referring to a private text that surfaced in a report by the Jewish Insider, dating back to when Bowman first ran for re-election in 2022.\n\n\"Do you have pics of us?\" So I can show the world I'm friends with Jewish People,\" Bowman wrote to an unidentified Jewish leader whose support he was seeking, according to the report published Tuesday.\n\nReligious leaders in the district, which takes in much of Westchester and part of the Bronx, told The Post it epitomized how Bowman has mistreated the local Jewish community.\n\nThe local leaders said it was unprecedented for them to publicly rebuke their sitting congressman, but that Bowman, who is seeking a third term, had left them no choice.\n\n\"One hundred percent I believe that happened,\" Rabbi Jonathan Morgenstern, head of Young Israel of Scarsdale, a modern orthodox synagogue, said of the text.\n\n\"Bowman tokenizes the Jewish people. Bowman went from bad to worse,\" Morgenstern said.\n\nMorgenstern said Bowman not only burned bridges with Jewish leaders in the district, he rarely made an effort to establish any connections in the first place.\n\n\"We tried to meet with him. We made the appointment -- and then he cancelled,\" Morgenstern said.\n\n\"Rabbis of all denominations know he's a dangerous man at a time of rising antisemitism. He's a representative who doesn't represent us.\"\n\nBowman -- who is part of the left-wing \"Squad\" of House members that includes fellow New York Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez -- was nowhere to be found when two Jewish-run businesses in Scarsdale were spray-painted with \"Genocide supporter,\" Morgenstern said.\n\nThe congressman's \"tone deafness\" regarding the Jewish faith was evident as recently as last week when he held a clergy event on June 13 -- during the Jewish holiday of Shavuot.\n\nMorgenstern let Bowman's office know the holiday \"precludes me and the great majority of my Rabbinic colleagues [from attending].\"\n\n\"Congressman Bowman has consistently been tone-deaf and antagonistic to his Jewish constituents, and his antagonism has spanned the spectrum of the Jewish denominational landscape,\" he told a Bowman staffer.\n\nHe also forwarded a letter to The Post he sent to Bowman in 2021, blasting the congressman for saying Israel was murdering \"black and brown\" Palestinians.\n\n\"Conflating this age-old conflict with racially charged rhetoric is a betrayal of our entire community, stoking anti-semitic sentiment against Jews and making all of us feel unsafe in our own district,\" he said.\n\nRabbi Scott Weiner, leader of Tamid Westchester Synagogue in New Rochelle and a self-described \"progressive Jew\" who previously voted for Bowman, now backs rival Latimer, the Westchester County executive well known and respected by Jewish leaders.\n\n\"Bowman totally lost my support before October 7,\" Weiner said, referring to the Hamas invasion of Israel last fall, triggering the raging war in Gaza.\n\nWeiner and others said Bowman denying as a \"lie\" and propaganda that Hamas militants raped Israeli women during the Oct. 7 invasion was beyond the pale. The congressman later apologized.\n\n\"He doesn't seem to care about Jews in the district -- talking to them or working with them,\" Weiner said.\n\nBut Bowman, during an interview Monday with WNYC radio host Brian Lehrer insisted, \"Thank God I still have a lot of support within the Jewish community\" -- citing backing from-left Jewish groups as Jewish Voice for Peace, which supports the boycott, divestment and sanctions movement against Israel.\n\nHe also doubled down, accusing financiers behind the American Israel Public Affairs Committee of bankrolling a \"racist\" campaign against him.\n\nBowman, who is backed by the anti-Israel Democratic Socialists of America, told the group during a recent endorsement interview that he, too, backs the BDS campaign against the Jewish State.\n\nBowman also said he now opposes Iron Dome defense funding for Israel, which he previously voted for.\n\nDuring the WNYC interview, Bowman also defended his statements that Israel is engaging in \"genocide\" in Gaza, citing the deaths of Palestinian woman and children, when Lehrer pressed him that Israel is not deliberately trying to wipe out an entire population of people.\n\nThe Bowman-Latimer battle -- the most watched race exposing the divide between the Democratic Party's left-wing and moderate factions -- is the most expensive primary in history, with more than $23 million spent on ads, according to AdI mpact, which tracks ad spending.\n\nThe American Israel Public Affairs Committee's affiliated group -- the anti-Bowman United Democracy Project -- makes up 61% of total spending, the tracker said.", "source": {"uri": "nypost.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "New York Post"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rabbi", "type":

Mr. Bowman's anti-Israel positions and his past embrace of conspiracy theories and toxic political groups have apparently soured voters in New York's 16th District on their own representative.\n\nThe Westchester County executive, George Latimer, has been running a campaign on getting \"progressive results\" done, and says Mr. Bowman is about nothing more than \"rhetoric\" and \"press coverage.\" He has a powerful ally in the American Israel Public Affairs Committee, which has helped make the Bowman-Latimer primary the most expensive in American history.\n\nIn total, $23 million has been spent so far in run up to the 16th District's Democratic primary, with the vast majority being spent by Mr. Latimer and Aipac. Mr. Latimer's campaign has spent about $2.5 million to unseat Mr. Bowman, but Aipac's outside spending group -- the United Democratic Project -- has dispersed more than $14 million in both pro-Latimer and anti-Bowman ads.\n\nA pro-cryptocurrency spending group called Fairshake has also spent $2 million attacking Mr. Bowman in the primary because he voted against the Financial Innovation and Technology for the 21st Century Act, a cryptocurrency regulation bill that would help alleviate some uncertainties in the market.\n\nMr. Bowman's campaign and the groups supporting it have been unable to keep up with the vast sums of money fueling the slick 30-second ads that are bombarding the New York area broadcasting market. The congressman's campaign has spent $2 million, and the biggest outside groups supporting him -- the Justice Democrats and the Working Families Party -- have spent just more than $1.5 million combined, according to OpenSecrets.\n\nThe United Democracy Project was established by Aipac in January 2022, but the group's relative youth seems to have no impact on its ability to cut ads and blanket the airwaves. For the entirety of the 2022 midterms, the United Democracy Project raised more than $35 million and spent nearly $33 million in less than a year. For the 2024 cycle, the group has raised more than $50 million to spend in both primaries and in the general election, though it has spent about $24 million.\n\nSome had hoped that a midterm redistricting following a successful legal challenge from Democrats would help Mr. Bowman retain his seat despite primary challenges because his new district includes Co-op City -- a community of about 50,000 residents of the North Bronx, the overwhelming majority of whom are Black.\n\nPolling, though, has not shown that to be the case. When he defeated Congressman Eliot Engel in the 2020 Democratic primary, Mr. Bowman took 55 percent of the vote. When Mr. Bowman faced three primary challengers in 2022, he walked away with 57 percent of the vote.\n\nNow, his approval rating seems to have fallen. A recent poll from Emerson College shows the congressman winning just 31 percent compared to Mr. Latimer's 48 percent.\n\nEndorsements have flowed Mr. Latimer's way in recent months as well, including from Senator Clinton and a former New York governor, David Paterson. Local officials like a state senator, Peter Harckham, and an assemblyman, Chris Burdick, also have endorsed the Westchester County executive. A former congressman, Mondaire Jones, who is running to reclaim a seat in the northern part of Westchester County against a sitting Republican, endorsed Mr. Latimer on June 3.\n\n\"Mr. Bowman has denied that Hamas committed assault against Israeli women on October 7. And he recently accepted the endorsement of the Democratic Socialists of America, whose New York City Chapter amplified that pro-Hamas rally that took place the day after October 7,\" Mr. Jones said in an interview with the Albany Times Union. \"Now I happen to believe that it's progressive to be pro-Israel, and that puts me at odds with some people on the far left.\"\n\nThe Democratic Socialists of America -- of which Mr. Bowman is a card-carrying member -- was recently brought up in a debate by Mr. Latimer as an example of the congressman embracing antisemitic fringe groups. On October 7, the DSA said in a statement that the Hamas attack was \"a direct result of Israel's apartheid regime.\" During an endorsement interview with DSA in May, Mr. Bowman came out against funding for the Iron Dome, a defensive missile technology used in Israel.\n\nAipac and the United Democracy Project have tried to knock off a few \"squad\" members this year. Congresswoman Rashida Tlaib did not face an Aipac-backed challenger in part because she has a substantial campaign warchest and is popular in her Detroit-based district.\n\nCongresswoman Summer Lee, who, like Mr. Bowman, consistently votes against sending money and arms to Israel, easily dispatched her Aipac-endorsed primary challenger in April.\n\nAfter Mr. Bowman's primary on Tuesday, the next challenge for Aipac and the United Democracy Project will be unseating a St. Louis lawmaker who -- like other \"squad\" members -- has been fiercely anti-Israel, Congresswoman Cori Bush. Aipac's spending group is already running ads in the area for a local prosecutor who is challenging Ms. Bush, Wesley Bell.", "source": {"uri": "nysun.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The New York

Jamaal Bowman (D-NY) who stands to lose his hold on the seat in New York's 16th congressional district in the upcoming Democrat primary, a contest in which he is badly trailing against his moderate pro-Israel opponent.\n\nA childish ticking human time bomb whose antics have been an ongoing embarrassment, Bowman could soon be looking for a new line of employment if AOC is unable to rally the faithful and she's frantically trying to \"mobilize thousands\" to save her colleague.\n\n\"Big money, from AIPAC to Wall Street, have poured millions to buy this election,\" the socialist diva said in a post to X on Tuesday. \"To win, we must mobilize thousands,\" sharing a link to a get-out-the-vote rally on Saturday where she will be joined by crypto communist cadaver Bernie Sanders and the embattled Bowman.\n\nOcasio-Cortez's \"us versus them\" schtick that the congressman's opponent, Westchester County Executive George Latimer, is a tool of the powerful American Israel Public Affairs Committee (AIPAC) and Wall Street comes as Bowman is really the one getting more money from outside of the district as a hero of the pro-Hamas crowd.\n\nAccording to a recent Politico report on the high-profile primary, \"just 10 percent of Bowman's campaign contributions come from his neighbors, more than half of Latimer's donations come from within the district,\" so AOC's suggestion that Latimer is backed by outside interests isn't presenting an accurate picture, as is usually the case with anything she says.\n\nA recent poll showed the former middle school principal getting his clock cleaned by Latimer who has bagged endorsements from popular former Rep. Mondaire Jones (D-NY) and failed Democrat presidential candidate Hillary Clinton, both of who appeal to the type of voters who are tired of the overt anti-Semitism of the \"Squad\" and Bowman's stunts like illegally pulling a fire alarm to shut down Congress during key funding negotiations last fall.\n\nThe former bartender was scorched by X users over her call to action.\n\nEven with Ocasio-Cortez and Comrade Bernie onboard, Bowman is likely to struggle to appeal to Democrats who long for the old days when the party hadn't been hijacked by extremists, and a new report shows how desperate he was to prove that he's not a Jew-hater like Reps. Rashida Tlaib (D-MI) and Ilhan Omar (D-MN) two years ago.\n\nAccording to a report from Jewish Insider, Bowman begged for a picture from a Westchester Jewish leader for what would seem to be purely political purposes.\n\n\"Do you have pics of us?\" Bowman texted the Jewish leader, who the outlet described as him having \"a cordial if uneasy relationship\" with. \"So I can show the world I'm friends with Jewish People.\"\n\n\"I was uncomfortable,\" the Jewish leader said of the \"Squad\" member's 2022 text message. \"I kind of joked around with him about it. I said, 'Oh, I'm sure you guys have it. Don't worry about it.'\"\n\n\"I was like, 'I don't want to be his court Jew,'\" he added. \"That wasn't what I signed up for.\"\n\nVoters have a chance to send Bowman packing, and in the process, deliver a blow to the narcissistic Ocasio-Cortez by showing that she doesn't have the clout that she believes she does.\n\nWe have no tolerance for comments containing violence, racism, profanity, vulgarity, doxing, or discourteous behavior.

Bernie Sanders (I-VT) at this rally, which will be located at St. Mary's Park in New York. AOC shared the details of the rally on social media, writing that the American Israel Public Affairs Committee and other \"corporate lobby interests\" are donating millions of dollars to unseat Bowman in the primary, with all three politicians at this rally being critics of Israel amid the war in Gaza.\n\nBowman's criticism of Israel included claiming that the country used \"propaganda\" after the Hamas attack on Oct. 7, claiming that there was no evidence of Israeli victims being raped or of Israeli babies being beheaded. He has since backtracked these comments, stressing the need for Hamas to release its hostages and that he will \"always stand against sexual violence.\"\n\nPolling data released last week on Bowman's primary in New York's 16th District, in which he is running against George Latimer, has the incumbent lawmaker at 31%, with Latimer at a double-digit lead at 48%.

Early voting has begun in New York's 16th Congressional District, which includes Mount Vernon, New Rochelle, Yonkers and a small portion of the Bronx.\n\nThe district is considered a safe Democratic seat, meaning that the victor in next week's vote is almost certain to take office next January.\n\nThe American Israel Public Affairs Committee (AIPAC), the right-wing Zionist lobby that supports the fascistic Netanyahu regime in Israel, has already spent over $12 million to defeat Bowman. Through its affiliated political action committee, the United Democracy Project, which allows it to raise unlimited amounts from individuals and corporations, it plans to spend up to $100 million this year in this and other election races.\n\nUnlimited spending by the ruling elite is usually decisive, especially in elections in which a majority -- the poor, the working class, the angry, disaffected and alienated -- don't vote. Indeed, polls in the Latimer-Bowman contest in the wake of heavy television and social media spending by AIPAC and others show the challenger with a 48-to-31 percent lead over Bowman, with the balance undecided.\n\nAIPAC knows that both the Democrats and the Republicans support Israel and its genocide in Gaza. However, it is targeting those Democrats who have expressed criticism of Israel's actions, while fully backing the Biden administration. Special attention is being focused on the \"Squad,\" the five DSA members and supporters in Congress.\n\nEven though the DSA has made clear its support for Israel -- Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez recently hosted two Zionist lobbyists on her Congressional X site for a friendly discussion on their version of the threat of antisemitism -- AIPAC and the billionaires and other ruling class layers it speaks for consider the Democratic \"lefts\" insufficiently loyal.\n\nThe New York contest is not the only one in which AIPAC is intervening aggressively. It was unable to defeat Congresswoman Summer Lee in Pittsburgh earlier this year, but it has targeted Cori Bush in Missouri and Ilhan Omar in Minneapolis, who both face August primary contests.\n\nSupport for the Gaza genocide is an overriding issue for the Zionist lobby, but it is undoubtedly getting huge sums for its campaign from billionaires who also want to ensure that they continue to pay little or nothing in taxes. The same elements want to unleash the police against protesters and against the working class as a whole. AIPAC is backed by major Republican funders like Bernard Marcus, the founder of Home Depot.\n\nLatimer is being touted as a supposed \"centrist\" or even a \"progressive\" Democrat, a politician whose record on major Democratic Party issues is unchallengeable. The so-called progressive Latimer has, however, labeled the DSA \"extremist,\" a description along the lines of Trump's regular fascistic attacks on Biden and the Democrats as \"Marxists\" and \"communists.\"\n\nThe White House has remained silent on the primary contest, but the Democratic establishment's support for Latimer was signaled by the announcement that Hillary Clinton, former First Lady, presidential candidate and Secretary of State, was backing his campaign.\n\nBowman, a former middle-school principal from the Bronx, has been endorsed by Senators Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren. He also has support from a number of elected officials, including House Majority Leader Hakeem Jeffries, who succeeded Nancy Pelosi last year. The support of Jeffries and others, however, is reported to be pro forma for sitting incumbents.\n\nBowman has been on the defensive on the issue of antisemitism. Like the DSA as a whole, he has concentrated on denying the charges of antisemitism, rather than showing that it is his Zionist opponents who are among the main allies of antisemites around the world, and are also responsible for stoking antisemitism because of their decades-long campaign to equate Judaism with the crimes of Israel.\n\nBowman finally raised the issue of genocide in recent months, after the Netanyahu regime had been charged with war crimes in the International Criminal Court, and after human rights organizations such as Human Rights Watch and Amnesty International had adopted that term. Recently, the UN Special Rapporteur on the situation of human rights in the Palestinian territories released a report declaring, \"there are reasonable grounds to believe that the threshold indicating the commission of the crime of genocide ... has been met.\"\n\nBowman's own criticisms of Israel are thoroughly insincere and hypocritical. A few years ago he voted for US funding of the Iron Dome, the air defense system employed by Israel. So great was the outcry against this within the DSA that Bowman stopped paying dues to the organization, and it was reported that he had let his membership lapse or that he had left the DSA. Now, however, a few weeks before the primary vote, the New York Times reports that Bowman and the DSA had declared that it had all been a misunderstanding -- that Bowman had never really left, and that he could and did make up his lapsed payments. The DSA is going all out to reelect the Congressman.\n\nMoreover, Bowman, like the rest of the DSA and the entire Democratic Party, fully supports the US-NATO war against Russia over Ukraine. He has repeatedly voted to finance the escalation of the proxy war, which threatens to develop into a nuclear conflict.\n\nIt is perhaps not surprising that the issue of race has been injected into the Bowman-Latimer campaign. Rather than focusing on the fundamental issues, including the role of Zionism and the drive towards world war being led by Biden, Bowman has emphasized the alleged racism of his opponent's supporters. Latimer has been even more crude, claiming that Bowman \"[doesn't] mention people who are not Black and brown.\" Openly appealing to Islamophobia, Latimer claimed in a recent debate that Bowman's true \"constituency is Dearborn, Michigan,\" referring to that city's large Arab-American population.\n\nPerhaps the most significant reply by Bowman to the attempt to unseat him is the full-page advertisements in some local newspapers just before the beginning of early voting. The ads do not mention Gaza or the US-NATO war against Russia over Ukraine. They make no mention of the danger of a third world war, or the growing threat of fascism.\n\nThe main headline instead declares, \"My Agenda is Biden's Agenda.\" Thus, the DSA and its member-Congressman solidarize themselves with the White House, which is responsible for the proxy war in Europe and the massacres, starvation and unspeakable suffering in the Middle East. Of course, the fact that Bowman is endorsing Biden is not news, but the conscious decision to headline it is his way of spelling out his loyalty to US imperialism.\n\nThe right-wing Zionist attack on Bowman has only served to further expose the role of his DSA backers. They are a faction of the Democratic Party, and their main job is to block the path to the political independence of the working class, to keep the Democrats and the capitalist two-party system alive. They stand with this party of imperialism against the Palestinian people and against the international working class as a whole.\n\nRead more New York Democratic Socialists of America endorses

Jamaal Bowman is for the youth.\n\nYoung people were key to the coalition that propelled Bowman into a House seat in 2020.\n\nAnd they've been critical this year as the very vulnerable Squad member fights to fend off a challenge from George Latimer, an establishment Dem whose base trends much more Boomer.\n\nGen Z electeds like Rep. Max Frost of Florida and City Council Member Chi Oss\u00e9 of Brooklyn have campaigned with Bowman, producing slick social media videos to entice still more support from 20-somethings.\n\nYouth-led groups like Sunrise Movement and Protect Our Power have been canvassing, phone banking and even confronting wealthy Latimer donors (getting it on video, natch).\n\n\"He has consistently shown up for young people, whether that be for our calls for climate action or labor or the pro-peace movement,\" Ella Weber of Protect Our Power told Playbook.\n\nBut it may not be enough: Bowman is vastly outspent, down in the polls and struggling in the final stretch of the race. And older voters typically outnumber younger ones at the ballot box.\n\nLatimer told Playbook that his core support comes from voters who've gotten to know him throughout his long career in local and state government -- and they vote reliably.\n\nA recent Emerson College poll backed up Latimer's take: Democratic primary voters over age 40 favor him by significant margins, with his biggest advantage among voters over 70, who break for him 53 to 22 percent.\n\nThe battle in Westchester County and the Bronx ranks as the most expensive House primary ever, with pro-Israel groups pouring money into defeating Bowman over his criticism of Israel amid the war in Gaza.\n\nThe generational gap in appeal is stark between Bowman, a 48-year-old former middle school principal, and Latimer, the more moderate 70-year-old political veteran.\n\nAnd it's apparent in their outreach. Bowman makes fast-moving hype videos for TikTok and recently posted himself on X rapping KRS-One's \"The MC,\" while Latimer posts musings and grainy photos on Facebook.\n\nBut it's even more about Bowman's insistence that the United States should not finance the Israeli offensive in Gaza and AIPAC-backed Latimer's refusal to condemn Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu.\n\n\"The generational divide indicates other things like stance on Israel, like stances on racial justice, stances on climate, right? That's what you see here,\" Bowman told Playbook.\n\nThe Israel-Hamas war factors prominently in the contentious primary with a sizable Jewish electorate. It's also the flashpoint exacerbating President Joe Biden's struggles to retain younger, more left-leaning support.\n\n\"As we look to the general election and as we think about turning out young people to defeat Donald Trump, Joe Biden needs someone like Jamal Bowman who can really speak to young people,\" Stevie O'Hanlon of Sunrise Movement told Playbook. \"There is a real disillusionment among many young people with politics right now, and unfortunately, that is leading to some people staying home and deciding not to vote.\"\n\nBowman is harnessing young supporters' enthusiasm ahead of next Tuesday's primary, including with a \"youth mobilization concert\" tonight in Port Chester headlined by Cash Cobain, a 26-year-old rapper from the Bronx.\n\n\"He certainly appeals to them in style,\" Latimer conceded. \"He's an educator who worked with young people, so I do grant him that as being a strength of his.\" -- Emily Ngo\n\nIT'S THURSDAY. Got news? Send it our way: Jeff Coltin, Emily Ngo and Nick Reisman.\n\nWHERE'S KATHY? Appearing in a pre-taped interview on CBS Mornings, then signing legislation relating to children on social media.\n\nWHERE'S ERIC? Making a jobs-related announcement, then meeting with the Gov.-elect of Puebla, Mexico Alejandro Armenta and Consul General of Mexico in New York Jorge Islas L\u00f3pez. After that, the Mayor will be live on \"The Beat 139\" podcast and then delivering remarks at a retirement celebration for Eileen Reilly.\n\nQUOTE OF THE DAY: \"The ascendance of Black elected officials in our city must translate to adequate funding for education, mental healthcare, community safety programs that reduce recidivism and services for older adults who are the backbone of our communities.\" -- New York City Council's Black, Latino and Asian Caucus, marking Juneteenth amid budget negotiations with Mayor Eric Adams, who is Black.\n\nBIDEN'S BAD NUMBERS: New York voters may dislike former President Donald Trump, but they do not have a particularly rosy view of Biden either these days.\n\nThe president continues to hold a surprisingly small advantage over Trump in a deep blue state that he won handily four years ago, a Siena College poll released today found.\n\nIn April, Biden led Trump by 10 points. That lead has narrowed to 8 points in today's survey: a 47-39 split. It's a meager lead, when compared to Biden's 23-point victory over Trump in New York in 2020.\n\nAnd it's a single-digit gap in a state a Republican presidential candidate has not won since 1984.\n\nThe big caveat is today's survey is composed of registered voters -- not people who are considered likely to vote in November, typically a more precise gauge.\n\nStill, the rest of Biden's numbers are simply not good for a state where Democrats outnumber Republicans by a factor of 2 to 1.\n\nA majority of New York voters -- 53 percent -- hold an unfavorable view of the president. The same percentage of voters either strongly disapprove or somewhat disapprove of how Biden is doing his job.\n\nBiden's biggest problem is with voters who are not registered in either party: 70 percent of independents hold an unfavorable view of him. Only 28 percent of independents expect to vote for the president.\n\nThe poll results for Biden in New York over the last three months mirror a broader concern for Democrats nationally that the president's reelection is in real jeopardy.\n\nVoters in the state continue to cite the migrant crisis and crime as top concerns -- issues Trump has hammered on the campaign trail as he looks to shift the conversation from the GOP's record on abortion and his own criminal convictions.\n\n\"New York Democrats need to wake up,\" Manhattan Borough President Mark Levine told POLITICO earlier this month. \"The number of people in New York, including people of color that I come across who are saying positive things about Trump, is alarming.\" -- Nick Reisman\n\nBUDGET POWERS: The City Council doesn't HAVE to approve a budget if Mayor Adams isn't funding the things they want, a progressive org is reminding legislators.\n\nNegotiations between the council and mayor are tense ahead of the July 1 deadline, the Daily News reported.\n\nSo the Peoples' Plan, NYC-DSA and dozens of other left-leaning groups are sending members a letter today saying they could unilaterally amend the budget, as the body did amid disagreements with then-Mayor Rudy Giuliani in 1998.\n\nIf Adams doesn't agree to certain funding levels for affordable housing, school nurses and libraries, then \"we would support the City Council to do everything it takes to deliver for working families -- including using its powers to overrule the Mayor.\"\n\nDeputy Speaker Diana Ayala, who's on the budget negotiating team, said Tuesday she expects to reach a deal before the deadline, but expressed frustration with the mayor's side.\n\n\"There's still a lot more that has to be negotiated,\" she said, \"and right now they're not engaging in good faith conversations.\"\n\nThe mayor downplayed tensions on Monday, saying he and Speaker Adams will \"land the plane\" like they have the previous two years. -- Jeff Coltin\n\nSTRAW DEAL: The Manhattan District Attorney dropped charges against Ronald Peek after initially accusing him of participation in a straw donor scheme meant to funnel money to the 2021 campaign of Mayor Eric Adams.\n\n\"My client is looking forward to moving on now that he has been able to clear his name,\" Ian Niles, attorney for Peeks, said in a statement following the decision. \"We thank the court as well as the Manhattan District Attorney's office for its thorough investigation that led to this dismissal.\" -- Joe Anuta\n\nMore from the city:\n\n-- The NYPD last year spent more on helicopter operations, took more flights outside of the city and spent more time in the air than in the four years prior. (Bloomberg News)\n\n-- The NYPD deployed drones to a Juneteenth block party after the Adams admin denied Black Lives Matter activist Hawk Newsome a permit since he applied at the last minute. (Daily News)\n\n-- The city can proceed with its long-delayed plan to build housing on the Elizabeth Street Garden, the state's top court ruled. (Crain's)\n\nCOMING TO A SCREEN NEAR YOU: Former Gov. Andrew Cuomo's pro-Israel advocacy organization Never Again, Now will begin airing TV ads in the supporting of the country amid the ongoing war with Hamas.\n\nThe ads will \"tell the truth about Hamas\" and support Israel, Cuomo told a crowd of more than 140 people at The Harmonie Club, a predominantly Jewish social club in Manhattan, earlier this week.\n\nNo spending target for the ad campaign has been set. But it's the first time that the group Cuomo formed earlier this year -- in response to a rise in antisemitism in New York that happens to coincide with Cuomo's own interest in returning to politics -- will undertake major public activity with an ad campaign.\n\nCuomo has not ruled out a potential comeback bid after his resignation in 2021 following allegations of sexual harassment and misconduct. He is said to be considering challenging Adams for mayor next year but his close aides reserve most of their ire for Hochul, who is up in 2026.\n\nThe former governor this month has also faced renewed scrutiny from state and federal officials who have questioned his handling of the early months of Covid-19 pandemic.\n\nOn all fronts, Cuomo has denied any wrongdoing.\n\nCuomo, speaking to more than 140 people at the Tuesday night event, knocked Democrats who act like \"a weathervane\" and waver in their support for Israel in response to pro-Palestinian demonstrations.\n\n\"You see the Democrats all taking half a step back,\" Cuomo told the gathering. \"These young activists, they're very powerful, especially in the primaries.\"\n\nCuomo has stepped up his appearances before small, mostly sympathetic audiences in New York City. He often speaks to Black churches to criticize the state of the city, public safety and housing, keeping in touch with a key portion of his base in the process. -- Nick Reisman\n\nMore from Albany:\n\n-- The Hochul-commissioned report on Covid-19 included false claims, the state comptroller's office said. (Times Union)\n\n-- Two top officials at the Office of Cannabis Management were let go following the departure of Executive Director Chris Alexander. (Post-Standard)\n\nSAYING SORRY: Bowman apologized this week for calling Hamas' sexual violence against Israeli women on Oct. 7 \"propaganda\" and \"lies.\"\n\nBowman, the left-leaning Democrat facing the prospect of defeat next week, said in response to a WNYC caller, \"Immediately when the UN provided additional evidence, I voted to condemn the sexual violence. I apologize for my comments and now we're continuing to do the work to fight sexual violence and domestic violence in all its forms.\"\n\nAfter POLITICO first reported on the comments he made at a pro-Palestinian rally last November, Bowman condemned Hamas and said he \"always stand[s] against sexual violence in all forms\" but didn't apologize at the time. His initial comments have been used in several attack ads and mailers. -- Daniel Lippman\n\nMore from Congress:\n\n-- Former staffers of House candidate John Mannion, a state senator, allegedly fostered a hostile work environment where he routinely berated employees and retaliated against those who spoke up. (New York Post)\n\n-- Attack ads hit Democratic House candidate John Avlon in his Long Island primary against Nancy Goroff. (New York Times)\n\n-- A Texas-based conservative small business advocacy group is running ads against Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and for her primary opponent in Times Square. (New York Post)\n\n-- Former Rep. Mondaire Jones has received almost $25,000 in salary payments from two of his congressional campaigns, according to financial disclosures. (New York Post)\n\nLEST YE BE JUDGED: The judge challenging the Queens Democratic Party's hold over Surrogate Court got a dreaded \"not approved\" rating from both the Queens and New York City Bar Association -- but Wendy Li says it's because they're \"under the influence of the machine.\"\n\nBoth orgs rated her opponent Cassandra Johnson \"approved.\" While the bar associations declined to explain their reasoning, the Daily News Editorial Board reported it's because Li, a Civil Court judge, lacked the experience of Johnson, a judge on the higher-level Supreme Court.\n\nThe News endorsed Li, saying she supports reforms that Johnson doesn't.\n\nIn a statement to Playbook, Li called the non-approval \"a miscarriage of justice,\" adding \"my educational and professional record, intellectual ability, work ethic, and fitness to be the next Queens Surrogate's Court Judge speak far louder than a predetermined political decision in furtherance of the Queens political machine's influence.\"\n\nThe Queens Eagle previously reported on the borough bar association's rating. The low-profile race is the only Queens-wide primary this year and is a major test for the county organization under Rep. Greg Meeks. -- Jeff Coltin\n\n-- Black New Yorkers are still more likely to die from heat-related complications compared to their white counterparts. (Gothamist)\n\nEdited by Daniel Lippman\n\nOUT & ABOUT: Abundance New York, a new nonprofit meant to be a \"political home\" for pro-housing, pro-growth New Yorkers, had a launch party Tuesday night at Savta in Greenwich Village. Co-founder Ryder Kessler, a former Assembly candidate, said \"things aren't working\" because electeds \"listen to the minority of folks for whom the status quo is working, homeowners and car

Jamaal Bowman (D-NY) is likely to lose his primary against Westchester County Executive George Latimer in the 16th Congressional District. Bowman himself has turned to what look to be some embarrassing tactics in the final stretch, but he's also had some help from a fellow Squad member as Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-NY). She too is facing a primary challenge, but not one considered as serious. AOC's tactics are just as, if not more so, bizarre as she takes to social media. She's already ranted about how this primary process in the works is a \"core threat to democracy,\" but the posts keep coming.\n\nAOC often takes the chance to brag about how she doesn't accept PAC money as a candidate, and she has also been profiled for it in the media. She did so again over X on Wednesday night in an exchange with the American Israel Public Affairs Committee (AIPAC), which is supporting Latimer. There is a strong contrast between Bowman and Latimer when it comes to showing support for Israel and their views on the Israel-Hamas war. Both internal and non-internal polls show Latimer leading by double digits, and Democratic primary voters in the district also support Latimer's view on the conflict over Bowman's view.\n\nThe feud looks to have started on Wednesday afternoon, as AOC again ranted and raved about how AIPAC and its allies are spending a considerable amount of money in what looks to be the most expensive House primary race.\n\nHer post referred to support for Israel and \"fear\" of groups like AIPAC. \"An unspoken secret in Congress is that much of the reflexive, blind, unconditional vote support for nearly any Israeli gov action isn't from actual agreement,\" AOC claimed, which is where that \"fear\" comes in and why members supposedly \"don't vote their conscience,\" but rather their fear.\n\nAIPAC later responded by reminding how it's actually a popular position to support the Israeli-American \"relationship,\" hence why members vote that way.\n\nMembers from both parties have voted for pro-Israel legislation, and AIPAC supports both Democrats and Republicans.\n\nThat many members of Congress, except for the particularly anti-Israel Squad, support Israel still led to accusations from AOC that AIPAC only spends money, including and especially in such a race, because they're not popular and thus \"AIPAC positions\" are \"bought.\"\n\nShe also stood up for Bowman as \"one of the handful of reps who don't vote the way you tell them to[,]\" with regards to his anti-Israel views in opposition to AIPAC.\n\nEven with AIPAC's positions being popular, the group has a role for spending money in Congressional races. That's really the whole purpose of a PAC, and in AIPAC's case, to support candidates who share their views and to oppose those candidates who do not. Just because AOC and other likeminded candidates don't take PAC money doesn't mean other members have to feel the same way.\n\nSen. Bernie Sanders (I-VT) also similarly spoke out against AIPAC and PACs, per Fox News' Chad Pergram.\n\n\"The real race is whether or not America retains its democratic tradition or we allow, we allow big money SuperPACs to buy elections,\" he claimed in part. Sanders also brought PACs even when asked about Bowman pulling the fire alarm late last September when Congress was voting to avert a government shutdown, despite there being no fire.\n\n\"But again, to me, what is important is that we not allow billionaires and their super PACs to be able to buy elections. If that happens, then you're really not a democracy anymore. You can run against me, and if I spend 100 times more than you, I'm going to beat you. That should not be with America is about,\" Sanders even claimed.\n\nBowman himself has similarly turned to embarrassing tactics. When it comes to being a member who doesn't vote the way AIPAC tells him to, to paraphrase AOC, Fox News highlighted some particularly noteworthy comments from a primary debate on Tuesday:\n\nThe progressive Democrat took shots at the bipartisan-focused American Israeli Public Affairs Committee (AIPAC) several times throughout the event, accusing it of operating as a right-wing organization. AIPAC is supporting Latimer, and its campaign arm has poured millions into the race.\n\nThe idea that AIPAC would oppose Bowman because he is \"an outspoken person of color... an outspoken black man,\" is absurd and involves a display of playing the victim.\n\nWhen Latimer went to counter that by pointing out that AIPAC supports black candidates, Bowman responded that \"just because you've got a few black friends doesn't make you an anti-racist organization,\" which seems to be painting not just AIPAC but also Republicans as racist.\n\nIt's particularly rich that Bowman would use the \"black friends\" narrative when it was recently revealed by Jewish Insider that he asked a local Jewish leader in 2022 for pictures of the two of them so he could \"show the world I'm friends with Jewish People\"\n\nAnother talking point we've heard ad nauseum, from those debate moments, as well as Bowman's talking points, the talking points of other Squad members, and their X posts, is that AIPAC dares to fund pro-Israel Republicans.\n\nBowman has also used antisemitic tropes before to claim AIPAC has \"full control of this district, just like they now have full control of Congress--as they fund everyone in Congress.\"\n\nBowman looks to be confused on the concept of PACs spending money on various candidates who support their particular cause as well, then.", "source": {"uri":

Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-NY) is joining her fellow New York lawmaker, Rep. Jamaal Bowman (D-NY), at a rally this weekend to secure his seat in a heated primary race, which is looking to be an uphill battle for the incumbent Democrat.\n\nBowman will also be joined by Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-VT) at this rally, which will be located at St. Mary's Park in New York. AOC shared the details of the rally on social media, writing that the American Israel Public Affairs Committee and other \"corporate lobby interests\" are donating millions of dollars to unseat Bowman in the primary, with all three politicians at this rally being critics of Israel amid the war in Gaza.\n\n\"We will not let them win,\" AOC's post on social media read. \"In order to prevail, we must put out a call to all who care for progress and believe in taking action to advance and protect change.\"\n\nThe rally is being held three days before New York's primary elections on June 25, with the congresswoman reminding her followers on X of this timing.\n\nBowman's criticism of Israel included claiming that the country used \"propaganda\" after the Hamas attack on Oct. 7, claiming that there was no evidence of Israeli victims being raped or of Israeli babies being beheaded. He has since backtracked these comments, stressing the need for Hamas to release its hostages and that he will \"always stand against sexual violence.\"\n\nPolling data released last week on Bowman's primary in New York's 16th District, in which he is running against George Latimer, has the incumbent lawmaker at 31%, with Latimer at a double-digit lead at 48%. The poll was conducted among 425 likely Democratic primary voters with a margin of error of +/- 4.7%.\n\nCLICK HERE TO READ MORE FROM THE WASHINGTON EXAMINER\n\nSanders joining this rally comes as he has also been critical of Israel, accusing the country of violating international law in its war against Hamas and stating that it \"should not be receiving the nickel in U.S. military aid.\" He has also stated he will not attend Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's address to Congress, which is scheduled for July 24.", "source": {"uri": "washingtonexaminer.com", "dataType": "news",

Job opportunities, the right to organize, and the benefits we fought so hard for are directly tied to decisions made in Washington D.C. It was in that spirit that I brought Bowman to tour our training center to learn about our union, its members and how we can work together to grow opportunities for any of his constituents who wanted to become a union trade worker. The congressman promised to always stand up for workers. His actions in Washington D.C. quickly made a liar out of him.\n\nThe 2021 Bipartisan Infrastructure Law was one of President Joe Biden's biggest accomplishments and will create thousands of good jobs for those in a union and apprenticeship opportunities for those who want to join one. It is also part of a game-changing federal effort to combat climate change and create safe drinking water for all Americans. Bowman loudly led the charge against it. He voted against it. However, now that he's on the verge of electoral defeat for opposing the infrastructure bill, he's suddenly found religion.\n\nHe has sent out text messages with false statements like \"Jamaal helped pass the infrastructure bill\" (the bill he voted against). He then further lies that his vote secured investments in \"our infrastructure, housing, green jobs, and insulin price caps for seniors\" and then follows that up by claiming, again falsely, that his opponent, County Executive George Latimer, \"isn't on board\" despite Latimer's well-known support for the infrastructure bill. Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg has pointedly slammed all MAGA-Republicans who voted against the bill but are claiming credit for it in their district. Bowman is no better.\n\nIn his questionnaire seeking our endorsement, the congressman also claimed to have voted for the bill. I'm not a congressman. Just a carpenter. Perhaps in Washington D.C., it's different, but on a job site we have a name for that: Liar.\n\nThe Ccongressman took it a step further, justifying his anti-worker vote against the infrastructure bill, Bowman falsely claimed that \"90% of the jobs in the first infrastructure bill go to white men.\" Mr. Bowman visited our training center. He saw that our union members reflect what Mayor Dinkins called the \"gorgeous mosaic\" that is New York City and America. He commended us for it, then turned around and said something completely different to the media when it suited him.\n\nRight now, the rights of workers are under attack, and we need to be building unity to preserve our middle class. We understand that because we live it every day. Without worker unity, there is no minimum wage, there is no prevailing wage, there literally is no weekend. Bowman's pathological ability to lie is a dagger to the neck of worker solidarity.\n\nOpinion: In the battle for the Democratic nomination in NY-16, climate change is on the ballot\n\nBecause of Bowman's votes against working people and his dishonesty, our union proudly endorsed his opponent, Democrat George Latimer. We did this not only because Latimer knows what it means to grow up living paycheck to paycheck and has always stood for working people, but also because we know he will be honest with us about what he is doing and why.\n\nTruth is in short supply in politics these days, and it's because people like Bowman realize that if they keep lying and can dupe their followers on social media to repeat the lie, it can become what former President Donald Trump's associates used to call \"alternate facts.\" We've seen Trump do it in the White House; we don't need a congressman in New York to join him in tearing apart our country with lies all in a vain effort to win an election. That kind of politics is bad for our nation, bad for democracy, and bad for the future. Worst of all, Bowman's lies are bad for the people of the 16th Congressional District. Come Primary Day, June 25, we look forward to helping to change that.", "source": {"uri": "lohud.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Journal News"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

Early voting began on June 15 and will extend until June 23. In these divisive and highly partisan times, with hateful anti-Israel and antisemitic rhetoric on the rise in the halls of government and misbegotten values on the ascendancy, it is more important than ever that members of our community come out and vote. Below we share some of our recommendations.\n\nIn the Congressional races, it is particularly important that Rep. Alexandra Ocasio-Cortez and Rep. Jamaal A. Bowman be defeated in their respective bids for reelection to Congress. Rep. Ocasio-Cortez is being challenged by Marty Dolan and Rep. Bowman by George Latimer. Both Ocasio-Cortez and Bowman have emerged as leading figures in the destructive extreme left, so-called progressive wing of the Democratic Party. It is a movement that seeks to hobble national and local government here in America and to dismantle the special relationship between the U.S. and Israel - a relationship that has proven indispensable to the national security of both countries.\n\nThus, both Ocasio-Cortez and Bowman have strongly supported the weakening of law enforcement. They fight against strong and effective policing and advocate for serious reductions in criminal penalties and debilitating bail reform. The resulting rampant crime is out there for all to see.\n\nBoth Ocasio-Cortez and Bowman have also promoted divisive racial preferences in employment and social services, which perpetuates racial strife. They are proponents of the Biden open borders policies that have mushroomed into an existential immigration crisis that threatens the very viability of our country.\n\nMost importantly, both Ocasio-Cortez and Bowman are trying mightily to erode traditional support in Congress for Israel by shamelessly accusing the Jewish state of committing genocide and other war crimes in the Gaza War.\n\nSo, we hope you will agree that Ocasio-Cortez and Bowman must go.\n\nRep Ocasio-Cortez is running in the 14 Congressional district, covering sections of the East Bronx and Northern Queens. She is being challenged by retired investment banker Marty Dolan. Dolan accuses Ocasio-Cortez with dereliction of duty for championing progressive, leftist policies that are part of her ideological makeup but which do not reflect the policies championed by most voters in the district. He points to her vetoing a plan for Amazon to locate its headquarters in the district and which would have provided 25,000 jobs for residents!\n\nRep. Bowman is being opposed by Westchester County Executive George Latimer in the Congressional race for the 16 Congressional District which includes White Plains, Mount Vernon, Yonkers and New Rochelle.\n\nWhile Latimer's campaign focuses on Bowman's anti-Israel rhetoric, he also says that Bowman is out of touch with residents of the district. Like Ocasio-Cortez, Latimer says, Bowman acts out of his own radical ideological beliefs rather than a concern for what his constituents want and need.\n\nFor us, Dolan and Latimer victories over Ocasio-Cortez and Bowman are no-brainers. At this perilous time in our history, the last thing we need in Congress are mindless ideologues who seem to have some fundamental problems with all things Jewish, and the traditional American way of life.\n\nSheepshead Bay, Flatlands, East Flatbush, Midwood and Canarsie: The Jewish Press endorses NYC Councilman Kalman Yeger for NYS Assembly in the 41 AD. In his six and a half years on the City Council he has been a consistently independent voice standing up against tax hikes, excessive fines and irresponsible government. He has been a powerful voice against antisemitism, frequently speaking out on the Council floor against antisemites in public office. He has been a strong advocate for yeshiva education, opposes the Regents attempt to strangle yeshivas' ability to function. Most recently, he was in the forefront of efforts to stop congestion pricing. As Councilman he delivered tens of millions of dollars into our neighborhoods to fund community institutions, to improve healthcare and public safety.\n\nCouncilman Yeger is endorsed by Assemblywoman Helene Weinstein to succeed her in the seat she has held for 44 years. We believe he would be a strong partner of NYS Senator Simcha Felder and NYS Assemblyman Simcha Eichenstein, both of whom have endorsed him.\n\nIn the Democratic Party primary election for Queens County Surrogate Judge, The Jewish Press endorses NYS Supreme Court Justice Cassandra A. Johnson. Justice Johnson seems admirably prepared to serve as a Surrogate Judge where she would be called upon to preside over matters pertaining to wills, estates, trusts, adoptions and guardianships. She currently serves as a Justice on the Queens Supreme Court bench having assumed that office in January of 2024. Prior to that, from 2021, she served as a judge on the Queens Civil Court. In addition to her judicial service, both before and after law school she worked at her mother's law practice where she focused on trusts and estates, adoption matters She also worked for several judges on a broad range of issues and served as a court attorney and referee and as a staff attorney for the City of New York.\n\nIn her interview with The Jewish Press Justice Johnson said she was drawn to the Surrogate's Court because it deals with people at times of great vulnerability and especially in need of help. She said she was not only committed to seeing that justice was done, but also that matters were dealt with quickly and efficiently.\n\nJanice Robinson is our choice in the Civil Court race in the 6 Municipal District. She has been a civil litigator in Brooklyn, working for major insurance companies for over 20 years. She says that appearing before many judges over those years has given her an important insight into what makes a judge effective: an even temperament, knowledge of the law, the ability to listen, respect for litigants, and the ability to move cases along on a calendar of perhaps 100 cases or more on any given day. She says she has had a front row seat and the best \"road map\" to becoming an effective judge and doing her part in making sure the people of Brooklyn receive fair and equal justice which is her professional goal.", "source": {"uri": "jewishpress.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Jewish Press - JewishPress.com"}, "authors": [{"uri": "editorial_board@jewishpress.com", "name": "Editorial

Jamaal Bowman pulling fire alarm in a Capitol Hill office building.\n\nFormer New York Times opinion editor Adam Rubenstein scolded his ex-employer for not adequately covering controversial remarks by Rep. Jamaal Bowman, D-N.Y., who said last year that claims Hamas raped women during the terror attacks of October 7 was \"propaganda.\"\n\nBowman, a vehement critic of Israel and member of the far-left \"Squad,\" is facing a tough primary challenge in New York's 16th Congressional District, apologized this week for previously dismissing Hamas' sexual violence against Israeli women. Rubenstein, a supporter of Israel who has been critical of the Gray Lady since his exit, took to X with a thread condemning Bowman and his \"local paper.\"\n\n\"Yikes. Jamaal Bowman now admits he was a rape denier and apologizes,\" Rubenstein wrote.\n\n'SQUAD' MEMBER SAID CLAIMS OF HAMAS RAPES WERE 'PROPAGANDA' DAYS AFTER LAWMAKERS SAW VIDEOS OF 10/7 ATROCITIES\n\n\"He's the Democrats' Todd Akin -- and I have to think, if he were a Republican who went around publicly and loudly denying rape, there would be unequivocal denunciations in the mainstream press,\" Rubenstein added.\n\nAkin sparked an outcry in 2012 when he said the female body has ways to shut down pregnancies that occur during \"legitimate rape.\" He was running for U.S. Senate in Missouri at the time, and the firestorm over his remarks contributed to his defeat by Democratic Sen. Claire McCaskill.\n\n\"In fact, on a single day, look how many pieces the Times published on Akin's rape-denial comments,\" Rubenstein wrote to accompany an image of Times search results showing Akin's comments were covered in seven different stories on Aug. 20, 2012.\n\nRubenstein then attempted a similar search of Bowman's comments.\n\n\"I haven't found a single mention of Bowman's rape-denial comments in his local paper, the Times. His comments were made in November 2023. It's June 2024 and his election is next week,\" Rubenstein wrote to caption an image showing zero results for Bowman's comment.\n\nNIKOLE HANNAH-JONES, OTHERS ACCUSE EX-NY TIMES EDITOR OF MAKING UP VIRAL CHICK-FIL-A STORY, BUT TALE CONFIRMED\n\nThe Times did mention that Bowman had \"cast doubt that Hamas committed sexual violence\" in a June 3 article that was published months after his rhetoric initially sparked backlash. The article did not mention the \"there's still no evidence\" quote that Rubenstein searched for. Fox News Digital could not locate other mentions of Bowman's comments in the Times' archives.\n\nThe New York Times did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\nBowman called reports of Hamas terrorists raping Israeli women \"propaganda\" during a Nov. 17 rally with dozens of pro-Palestinian protesters in New York. The remark came just days after lawmakers viewed a nearly 45-minute video of the tragic Oct. 7 terror attacks on Israel.\n\n\"There was propaganda used in the beginning of the siege,\" Bowman said in a TikTok post discovered and reported by Politico. \"There's still no evidence of beheaded babies or raped women. But they still keep using that lie [for] propaganda.\"\n\nTHE NEW YORK TIMES REMAINS HAUNTED BY THE TOM COTTON OP-ED ALMOST 4 YEARS LATER\n\nBowman apologized for the remarks, according to Politico. He now faces Westchester County Executive George Latimer in one of the most expensive House primary races in U.S. history. Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, another far-left \"Squad\" member, has condemned AIPAC for spending millions to oust Bowman.\n\n\"An unspoken secret in Congress is that much of the reflexive, blind, unconditional vote support for nearly any Israeli gov action isn't from actual agreement. It's from fear,\" she wrote on X on Wednesday, saying they lawmakers were afraid of AIPAC.", "source": {"uri": "foxnews.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Fox News"}, "authors": [{"uri":

Bowman is a progressive \"Squad\" member facing a tight nomination race in New York's 16th Congressional District against his Democratic challenger George Latimer, who has the backing of groups affiliated with the powerful American Israel Public Affairs Committee, or AIPAC, which have pumped millions of dollars into the primary. Bowman was one of the first lawmakers to call for a Gaza ceasefire after October 7. \"They are literally trying to purchase that election because he dared to stand for peace and justice,\" says Ramirez.", "source": {"uri": "democracynow.org", "dataType": "news", "title": "Democracy Now!"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Democratic Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Delia_Ramirez", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Delia Ramirez"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Campaign_finance", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Campaign finance"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_House_of_Representatives", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States House of Representatives"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democracy", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Democracy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Illinois", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Illinois"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Illinois"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York's_16th_congressional_district", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "New York's 16th congressional district"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advocacy_group", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Advocacy group"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Israel_Public_Affairs_Committee", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "American Israel Public Affairs Committee"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Progressivism", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Progressivism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gaza_Strip", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Gaza Strip"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Gaza Strip"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Palestine"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Campaigns_and_Elections", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Campaigns and Elections", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Equestrian/Racing", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Equestrian/Racing", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Motorsports", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Motorsports", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Democracy", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Democracy", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 61}], "image": "https://www.democracynow.org/images/story/67/72567/full_hd/Seg4-guestandbowman2.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9660878", "eventUri": "eng-9660878", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "date": "-10-07", "textStart": 701, "textEnd": 710}], "sentiment": 0.3254901960784313, "wgt": 126, "relevance": 1}

He is a three-star receiver in the 2025 recruiting class according to 247Sports.com. The Wolverines offered a scholarship to Bowman on May 21, which could put him in one of those recruiting situations that show up in The Game a few years from now. Bowman stood out at Ohio State, Michigan and Kentucky camps in June.\n\nA fourth star unlocks more possibilities. Seven receivers were selected in the first round of the 2024 NFL Draft. Six of them - Marvin Harrison Jr., Malik Nabers, Rome Odunze, Brian Thomas, Xavier Worthy and Xavier Legette - were four-star recruits in high school. Ricky Pearsall - the other first-round receiver - was a three-star recruit and surprise first-round pick.\n\nBowman is one of those recruits who emerged and should - at least if performance at those summer camps is an indicator - move up those recruiting rankings before his senior season. Does that fourth star matter?\n\n\"Yeah, it would,\" Bowman told Sporting News. \"It definitely would. I feel like I'm a top guy in the country, and I feel like I've been under-recruited; so to get that fourth star would definitely mean a lot.\"\n\nBowman is the best example of how far some recruits go to get that fourth star - and how much one offseason can make a difference in that evaluation.\n\n\"To me, there is no off day,\" Bowman said. \"You can always do something to get better. ... I don't want to look back and say, 'I could have done this or would have done that.'\"\n\nHe is doing everything instead.\n\nBowman's day starts at 5 a.m - even when school is out for the summer. That is a work-week in a football factory that continues to export next-level talent.\n\nCross-town rival Pickerington Central sent Duke defensive tackle DeWayne Carter to the NFL in 2024. Ohio State has six players from Pickerington on its roster, including Jack Sawyer and Sam Williams-Dixon from North and Sonny Styles, Lorenzo Styles Jr., Ty Hamilton and Max Lomonico from Central. It takes that kind of effort to stand out in this city.\n\n\"We have kids that might have similar talent to Preston, but he works on his skills,\" Pickerington North coach Nate Hillerich told SN. \"The two days we don't lift he would come in the morning and get on the JUGs machine. I think he watches guys like Marvin Harrison Jr., and he understands that is what it takes.\"\n\nBowman also trains with Kenny Stafford, a speed and agility coach who knows the path to the pros. Stafford was a three-star high school recruit who played at Toledo before a 10-year professional career between the NFL and CFL. From January through May, Bowman worked out with Stafford four times a week to improve his change-of-direction and route running within that unique frame - a body type that can be stereotyped unfairly in recruiting.\n\n\"He has the right body type, hands, route running, the total package,'\" Stafford said. \"He reminds me of a Golden Tate or a Deebo Samuel that has a route tree. It would be like Golden Tate when he was at Notre Dame.\"\n\nTate - who was 5-foot-10, 202 pounds - was a four-star recruit in the 2007 class. He played at Notre Dame before an 11-year NFL career, so that is a favorable comparison.\n\nBowman hit the winter and spring 7-on-7 circuit. He caught 12 TDs at the All-American Underclassmen Combine in San Antonio, Texas, on Jan. 5. He played in 7-on-7 in Indianapolis where TY Hilton and Andrew Luck were in attendance. He also made trips to Miami and USC.\n\nThat meant a lot of travel time with his father Geoffrey - who played running back at Miami, Ohio, from 1995-99 - and mother Beth. The Bowmans did not anticipate a summer full of football camps, but Preston wanted to leave no doubt with the coaches.\n\n\"I don't necessarily know if he thought he would be camping, but based on his situation and based on what he wanted to do he decided to camp,\" Geoffrey said. \"He's put on a show.\"\n\nMichigan offered Bowman on May 21, and that led to more screen time. Bowman was flooded with phone calls, text messages and direct messages from coaches across the country - and he sorted through those while staying on a busy schedule.\n\nHe attended Ohio State's camp on June 5 - where he backed up an impressive workout with the 4.5 in the 40-yard dash afterward.\n\n\"He dominated,\" Hillerich said. \"They had him go three times in a row at one point (in 1-on-1 drills). The first thing was, 'Is he fast enough to play on the outside at Ohio State?' I think that was Michigan's question, too. Then it is, 'If he plays in the slot, is he agile enough?' Everybody just questions him. 'Can he motion in and play running back?'\"\n\nBowman continues to answer all those questions. He earned camp MVP honors at Michigan on June 10. He worked out at Kentucky two days later and was re-offered by the Wildcats. A team 7-on-7 camp at Ohio State on Tuesday continued the circuit.\n\n\"He has grown up around all this,\" Geoffrey said. \"He has seen some of my former teammates, friends that played at Ohio State, friends that have played in the League. He's been in that environment where it's high level. The conversations are high level. The demand is high-level. If you want to play at that level, then that pressure is part of it. Do you meet the bell?\"\n\nThe Michigan-Ohio State layer of Bowman's recruitment is intriguing. The Wolverines have landed just six receivers from Ohio since 2000 - with Mario Mannigham (2005) and Roy Roundtree (2008) the standouts. Of course, Michigan's most-famous Ohio receiver is Desmond Howard - who won the Heisman Trophy in 1991.\n\nOhio State, meanwhile, has the best receiver pipeline in the country right now - one that has produced four first-round receivers in the last three years in Garrett Wilson, Chris Olave, Jaxon Smith-Njigba and Harrison Jr. The Buckeyes have not offered Bowman yet, but he has drawn interest that could push into the high school football season. Xavier Johnson - a three-star recruit from Cincinnati Summit Country Day - walked on with Ohio State in 2023. That might be an alternate path for Bowman to stay in Columbus.\n\nBowman knows both sides well. He studied Michigan receiver Roman Wilson's film on one side and zeroed in on Smith-Njigba's film on the other. Bowman said getting the Michigan offer was a thrill - even for someone who grew up wearing an Ohio State jersey to games with his family.\n\n\"I grew up watching Ohio State vs. Michigan,\" Bowman said. \"It is really big. With Ohio kids, it is knowing the rivalry is just different.\"\n\nThe best evaluation of Bowman should be the Pickerington North-Pickerington Central game film from last year. That is the ultimate rivalry game. Bowman had five catches for 203 yards and three touchdowns in a 39-34 victory on Sept. 8, 2023.\n\n\"He made the one-hand catch before halftime,\" Hillerich said. \"The play to start the game. All the big plays he made - that is something we talk about with Ohio State and Michigan and that rivalry game. You need to have somebody who can make plays in the biggest moments, and that's what he did.\"\n\nStafford, however, said the scouts will focus on the routes on those touchdowns - which were two slants and a fade. That is another wrinkle to the evaluation process that makes it difficult for three-star recruits to add that next star.\n\n\"I want him to get that fourth star because he low-key deserves it because of the work,\" Stafford said. \"The receivers I'm seeing in his class who are five-stars, he is as good if not better than them.\"\n\nOne day after the Kentucky camp, Bowman played in a 7-on-7 at Pickerington North High School. With one play left against Ironton, Bowman lined up on the outside. He took a jab step inside, went to the fade route and made an over-the-top-of-the-head-catch in the end zone.\n\nBowman remains in the present tense on the field, even if the recruiting future can be a day-to-day experience. He is not looking for the other benefits that have become part of the recruiting experience either.\n\n\"I want to just go play ball,\" Bowman said. \"Me and my parents talk about it. If you go do what you are told and do what you can do, the NIL will take care of itself. I don't worry about the money. I just want to go play football.\"\n\nGeoffrey and Beth see that every day. They have also put in that work in guiding their son into what should be an eventful final season of college football.\n\n\"I think it's just his mindset,\" Beth said. \"He knows where he wants to go. His ultimate goal - obviously like any football player - would like to go to the NFL. We know the percentage of that, but his first goal is to graduate from high school. He gets great grades, and he just wants to play and feel at home at a college he wants to be at.\"", "source": {"uri": "sportingnews.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Sporting News"}, "authors": [],

With days to go, the expenditures have already eclipsed what any interest group has ever spent on a single House race.\n\nPro-Israel groups are using the same approach elsewhere, most notably in an August primary in St. Louis.

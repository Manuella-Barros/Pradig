{"id": 243311172, "title": "I drove on the M5 and was left fuming by 'pointless' and frustrating change", "text": "It's one of the busiest sections of motorway in Europe so if you live in or around the Midlands there's a good chance you will have driven on it. It's the start of the M5, close to where it meets the M6 in the Black Country. Those not so familiar with this section of motorway or who perhaps don't drive on it very often may be surprised and frustrated when they are confronted with permanent 60mph signs. This was the case for me when I returned to this part of the M5 for the first time in a while last week. I'd forgotten these speed restrictions were in place. To be clear, these are physical road signs stating the maximum speed limit is 60mph, rather than overhead gantries which display changing speed limits due to congestion and other circumstances. Which means vehicles must go no faster than 60mph on this section of motorway at all times.

The reasoning for this change, which was introduced last year, has been explained by National Highways, which is responsible for the motorways. If it was for safety reasons it perhaps might be more understandable and acceptable for drivers. However, roads bosses say the move was made to improve air quality. The climate and quality of the air we breathe is of course a serious issue but this explanation might be more difficult for motorists to swallow. This part of the M5/M6 is one of the busiest and congested anywhere. There are often delays at peak times getting off the M6 onto the M5. Then when drivers finally get there and might want to put their foot down onto open road (to no more than the legal speed limit, of course) they are met with signs telling them to stick to 60mph. We never need to be doing ridiculous speeds on the motorway. That goes without saying. But many competent drivers have no issue with doing 70mph and feel this is a safe and correct speed to travel at on the motorway. Some might class this change to 60mph as nanny state behaviour. I'm no scientist so don't know how much difference slowing traffic from 70mph to 60mph actually makes to air quality but presumably it must have some impact in order for this change to have been made. Experts say it does make a difference and similar changes on the M6, which have now been lifted, have resulted in an improvement in air quality. There are surely also questions over how great the air quality can ever really be at this most heavily congested section where thousands of HGVs, cars and vans trundle along every day, until we're all driving electric. Some wags may dryly comment that you're unlikely to ever reach 70mph on our motorways anyway because you're always stuck in traffic and it's a fair point. National Highways has suggested it doesn't make much difference in the long run doing 60mph compared with 70mph, partially because of the frequent congestion. But there are times, outside of peak morning and evenings, when the motorways will be clearer for vehicles to travel at 70. There's also a lack of clarity over if or when they previous 70mph speed limit will be reintroduced. When BirminghamLive asked National Highways for an update, it said the area still has \"nitrogen dioxide levels in exceedance of legal limits\", meaning the 60mph limit is expected to remain in place for now. Sometimes it will be hard for drivers to escape the feeling such changes are unnecessary. On the rare occasions they are on open motorways free of traffic, many will feel they should not be restricted from driving at 70mph.", "summary": "Drivers may question why controversial changes have been brought in on some of the busiest sections of motorway in the country", "url": "https://www.birminghammail.co.uk/black-country/drove-m5-left-fuming-pointless-29425440", "image": "https://i2-prod.birminghammail.co.uk/incoming/article29394892.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_M5-traffic.jpg", "video": null, "publish_date": "2024-06-29 04:30:00", "author": "Richard Guttridge", "authors": ["Richard Guttridge"], "language": "en", "source_country": "gb", "sentiment": -0.264}

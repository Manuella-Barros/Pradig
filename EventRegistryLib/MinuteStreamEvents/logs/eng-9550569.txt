For the first time since the show was first revealed to be in the works in late 2023, plot details are now available.

At the time, there wasn't much information on it other than the fact that Daniels was working on one. There was a major update on the new The Office series back in January, when it was reported that creator Greg Daniels was setting up a writers room to explore ideas for a new series. The series was a long time coming and the fact that it's finally happening was well worth the wait. Now that the show has been given the green light, it will surely be exciting to see how it compares to the original.\n\nWhile the new show isn't a direct spinoff, using the same camera crew from Dundler Mifflin will be a good way to connect the two shows. As of now, it doesn't seem like anyone from The Office will be appearing in the new show, but that could always change once it gets going.Mockumentary comedies are still just as popular as ever, piggybacking off the success of The Office, Parks & Rec, and Abbott Elementary, among others. While it will be hard to match the success of The Office, fans will definitely want to tune in for the new series at some point in the future.\n\n0comments", "source": {"uri": "popculture.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Celebrity"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peacock_(streaming_service)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Peacock (streaming service)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Office_(American_TV_series)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "The Office (American TV series)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sabrina_Impacciatore", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Sabrina Impacciatore"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domhnall_Gleeson", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Domhnall Gleeson"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ensemble_cast", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Ensemble cast"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Koman", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Michael Koman"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greg_Daniels", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Greg Daniels"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBC", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "NBC"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comedy", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Comedy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deadline_Hollywood", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Deadline Hollywood"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dunder_Mifflin", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Dunder Mifflin"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mockumentary", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Mockumentary"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Documentary_film", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Documentary film"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scranton,_Pennsylvania", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Scranton, Pennsylvania"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Scranton, Pennsylvania"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universal_Television", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Universal Television"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBCUniversal", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "NBCUniversal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reboot_(fiction)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Reboot (fiction)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abbott_Elementary", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Abbott Elementary"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spin-off_(media)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Spin-off (media)"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Television/Programs", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Television/Programs", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Television/DVD", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Television/DVD", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Animation/Cartoons", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Animation/Cartoons", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 99}], "image": "https://sportshub.cbsistatic.com/i/2024/03/26/52d1cae8-de57-40df-8f87-536c2b1b27c1/the-office-cast-grief-counseling-getty.jpg?width=1200", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9550569", "eventUri": "eng-9550569", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.223529411764706, "wgt": 215, "relevance": 1}

Production on the show will begin in July.\n\n\"It's been more than 10 years since the final episode of The Office aired on NBC, and the acclaimed comedy series continues to gain popularity and build new generations of fans on Peacock,\" said Lisa Katz, president of NBCUniversal Entertainment. \"In partnership with Universal Television and led by the creative team of Greg Daniels and Michael Koman, this new series set in the universe of Dunder Mifflin introduces a new cast of characters in a fresh setting ripe for comedic storytelling: a daily newspaper.\"\n\nHere's the formal logline: \"The documentary crew that immortalized Dunder Mifflin's Scranton branch is in search of a new subject when they discover a dying historic Midwestern newspaper and the publisher trying to revive it with volunteer reporters.\" The untitled mockumentary, which arrives as ABC has found Emmy gold with Abbott Elementary, hails from the studio behind the former NBC favorite, Universal Television.\n\nThe comedy is executive produced by Daniels and Koman, alongside the creatives behind the U.K. original version of The Office, Ricky Gervais and Stephen Merchant, as well as Howard Klein, Ben Silverman and Banijay Americas (formerly Reveille).\n\nThe formal series pickup for The Office follow-up comes as Peacock is the exclusive streaming home for the Carell comedy, which found millions of new viewers when Netflix streamed the series. The series gives Peacock a must-see original at a time when it as struggled to find audiences for its scripted comedy originals. (See Girls5eva's move from Peacock to Netflix.) The NBCUniversal-backed streamer previously picked up another mockumentary, Mr. Throwback, starring Steph Curry and Adam Pally, and has comedies Ted and Killing It awaiting words on their futures. (Comedy Bupkis will not return for a second season after star and creator Pete Davidson decided to walk away from the show.)\n\nDetails on roles that Impacciatore and Gleeson are playing are being kept under wraps given the huge expectations that come along with anything connected to this new incarnation of The Office, though sources say Daniels and Koman have been casting a wide net to find talent availabilities for the latter half of this year.\n\nAs The Hollywood Reporter previously reported, The Office creator Daniels opened up a development room in early January to explore a new series that will be set in the same universe as the former NBC hit (itself a take on the British Gervais comedy). Daniels tapped Koman to co-create the project, which the prolific writer-producer does not consider to be a reboot of his 2005 mockumentary.\n\nThe new take on The Office comes at a busy time for Daniels, who recently scored a final season renewal for his Amazon comedy Upload. The prolific creator and producer is also reteaming with Mike Judge for a new season of his beloved animated comedy King of the Hill for Hulu. Together, the duo also has a wildly successful animation company with multiple series across a slew of streamers. Rumors surrounding a revival of The Office have swirled for years. In late 2017, NBC floated the idea of bringing The Office back with a fully-fledged revival featuring Daniels at the helm and a new star taking over for Carell. Nothing came of that effort.", "source": {"uri": "hollywoodreporter.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Hollywood Reporter"}, "authors": [{"uri": "lesley_goldberg@hollywoodreporter.com", "name":

We've done this reboot dance before, we'll do it again -- but in truth, few TV reboot/spin-off/continuations are as high profile as The Office. There's been buzz about this potential new series for months, and with Greg Daniels behind the wheel, it does actually have the potential to be good. Of course, the show has landed at Peacock, which is not exactly prime streaming real estate. It seems a shame, given that The Office was (after a rocky start) a 21st-century network television success story. But Peacock's whole thing is being the #1 destination for Real Housewives and The Office, so ultimately, it makes sense.\n\nOn Wednesday, Peacock officially announced the greenlight for the new Office series, which is co-created by Daniels (who originally developed the American version of the show) and Michael Koman (Nathan For You). Last month, Domhnall Gleeson (Star Wars: The Force Awakens) and Sabrina Impacciatore (The White Lotus) were revealed to be starring in the new series. Being Irish and Italian actors, respectively, we speculated that the new version might be more international. However, according to the first details we've got, the show remains decidedly American. Per a Peacock synopsis, \"The documentary crew that immortalized Dunder Mifflin's Scranton branch is in search of a new subject when they discover a dying historic Midwestern newspaper and the publisher trying to revive it with volunteer reporters.\"\n\n\"It's been more than ten years since the final episode of The Office aired on NBC, and the acclaimed comedy series continues to gain popularity and build new generations of fans on Peacock,\" said Lisa Katz (President of NBCUniversal Entertainment) in a statement. \"In partnership with Universal Television and led by the creative team of Greg Daniels and Michael Koman, this new series set in the universe of Dunder Mifflin introduces a new cast of characters in a fresh setting ripe for comedic storytelling: a daily newspaper.\"\n\nRoping the Dunder Mifflin documentary crew back into the mix is a clever, unobtrusive way to connect this series to the old one -- until the final season of The Office, the \"documentary crew\" was essentially invisible. The fact that it's \"set in the universe of Dunder Mifflin\" leaves the door open for interaction with the classic characters (or even Ricky Gervais' David Brent from The Office U.K.). But it seems unlikely that any of them would show up to the newspaper office, unless the old guys came to sell the new guys paper. At the end of the day, this seems like this is just a different workplace mockumentary sitcom with Office branding slapped on top.\n\nThat's not necessarily a bad thing, given Daniels' comedy pedigree. The Office satirized the drudgery of everyday capitalism in an office setting. The flailing midwestern daily newspaper is potentially even more ripe for social commentary about the state of media, the evolution of the industry, and the role of news in local communities. Regarding the latter point specifically, this show perhaps bears more resemblance to another Daniels sitcom, Parks And Recreation, than The Office. But we'll find out soon enough: the new Office goes into production in July, after which it will hit screens everywhere (as long as you have Peacock).", "source": {"uri": "avclub.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The A.V.

'In partnership with Universal Television and led by the creative team of Greg Daniels and Michael Koman, this new series set in the universe of Dunder Mifflin introduces a new cast of characters in a fresh setting ripe for comedic storytelling: a daily newspaper.'\n\nProduction on the series is expected to begin in July of this year.\n\nThe American version of The Office was based on the classic UK series of the same name created by Ricky Gervais and Stephen Merchant.\n\nIt premiered in 2005, with Steve Carrell starring as the manager of a paper company branch in Scranton, Pennsylvania, while Rainn Wilson, John Krasinski and Jenna Fischer were among the branch's employees.\n\nGreg Daniels, who developed the American version, co-created the upcoming series with Michael Koman.\n\n'The documentary crew that immortalized Dunder Mifflin's Scranton branch is in search of a new subject when they discover a dying historic Midwestern newspaper and the publisher trying to revive it with volunteer reporters,' the logline reads; Steve Carrell pictured\n\nThe show was previously reported to have added Domhnall Gleeson (L) and The White Lotus star Sabrina Impacciatore (R) to its cast\n\nThe show, which begins production in July, is not a spinoff, but does take place in the same universe as The Office; Krasinski, Wilson, Jenna Fischer and Carrell pictured on The Office\n\nDaniels and Koman will executive produce the show with Gervais and Merchant, Howard Klein, Ben Silverman and Banijay Americas.\n\nNBC seems to be eschewing a more lucrative broadcast spot for the new show in favor of its streaming service Peacock, but the new home may make it easier to draw connections to the original series.\n\nThe Office has continued to remain popular among fans years more than a decade after its 2013 finale, and Peacock is currently its streaming home.\n\nThe service has kept fans glued to the show by releasing longer cuts of episodes featuring previously unreleased scenes added in.", "source": {"uri": "dailymail.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "Daily Mail Online"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

Details on how they will fit into this new newsroom setting have yet to be revealed.\n\nThe series is executive produced by Daniels, Koman, Ricky Gervais, Stephen Merchant, Howard Klein, Ben Silverman, and Banijay Americas (formerly Reveille). Production is scheduled to begin in July.\n\nDaniels and Koman consider the new Office show to be more of a spinoff than a reboot.

It was announced on Wednesday 8 May that Peacock had placed a formal series order for the untitled series, which is set in the same universe as NBC's former Emmy-winning Steve Carell comedy. The new TV series is set to introduce a new cast of characters \"in a fresh setting ripe for comedic storytelling: a daily newspaper,\" according to NBCUniversal Entertainment's Lisa Katz.\n\nThis will be another addition to the massive The Office universe, reports the Mirror US.\n\nThe first version of the show was, of course, the British mockumentary television sitcom of the same name, which was first broadcast in the UK between 2001 to 2003. It was created by Ricky Gervais and Stephen Merchant, with Ricky playing the lead role of David Brent, and featured actors including Martin Freeman and Lucy Davis. The show inspired a slew of international remakes worldwide, but the most popular was the American version starring Steve as Michael Scott.\n\nThe series ran for nine seasons on NBC from 2005 to 2013 and had a second life after it began streaming on Netflix. Here's everything we know about the new untitled spinoff so far.\n\nWho's set to star in the The Office spin-off?\n\nDomhnall Gleeson, who starred in About Time and Ex-Machina as well as this year's romantic TV drama Alice & Jack, is teaming up with Sabrina Impacciatore, who wowed audiences in the second season of The White Lotus. They're headlining an exciting ensemble cast, although the specifics of their characters are hush-hush for now.\n\nWhat is the plot of the new The Office spinoff?\n\nLisa Katz, of NBCUniversal Entertainment, spilled the beans to The Hollywood Reporter about the show's concept. It's all happening in The Office US universe we know and love, but this time we're swapping out Dunder Mifflin's paper company antics for a behind-the-scenes look at a struggling Midwestern daily newspaper.\n\n\"It's been more than 10 years since the final episode of The Office aired on NBC, and the acclaimed comedy series continues to gain popularity and build new generations of fans on Peacock,\" she said. \"In partnership with Universal Television and led by the creative team of Greg Daniels and Michael Koman, this new series set in the universe of Dunder Mifflin introduces a new cast of characters in a fresh setting ripe for comedic storytelling: a daily newspaper.\"\n\nThe official description for the upcoming series states: \"The documentary crew that immortalized Dunder Mifflin's Scranton branch is in search of a new subject when they discover a dying historic Midwestern newspaper and the publisher trying to revive it with volunteer reporters.\"\n\nWho is making The Office spin-off?\n\nThe Office's very own Greg Daniels is teaming up with Nathan for You's Michael Koman to co-create the new comedy. The executive production team includes Greg and Michael, plus Ricky Gervais and Stephen Merchant from the original UK version of the series and Howard Klein and Ben Silverman, who worked on the US sitcom.\n\nGreg has previously mentioned that he doesn't see this new endeavour as a reboot of his 2005 mockumentary classic. Buzz about a potential new sitcom linked to The Office started swirling in January when Greg began brainstorming ideas for a connected series, rather than a reworking of the original.\n\nWhen can we expect The Office spin-off to hit our screens?\n\nWhile there's no confirmed release date yet, the cameras are set to roll this July. The show joins the mockumentary trend at an opportune moment, with Abbott Elementary currently a successful series that owes much to The Office's format.", "source": {"uri": "ok.co.uk", "dataType":

From Michael Scott's hilariously idiotic actions, to Dwight Schrute's eccentric dialogues, the hit comedy sitcom has given us so much to laugh about. It launched the careers of Steve Carell, John Krasinski, and many more. It also earned 5 Emmy awards and 42 nominations.\n\nThe NBC TV show ended in 11 years ago yet it is still highly popular thanks to streaming services picking it up. It debuted on OTT with Netflix and then was taken by Peacock. According to Nielsen, it was the most streamed show in 2020 with more than 57 billion minutes viewed.\n\nDue to the immense popularity of the workplace comedy, many spin-offs and reboots tried to match the charm of the original mockumentary but nothing ever really solidified into a watchable show.\n\nNow, the creator of 'The Office', Greg Daniels, has reportedly taken it upon himself to make a 'The Office' reboot.\n\nThe untitled reboot exists in the same universe as 'The Office' but it will move away from Dunder Mifflin.\n\nAs per Peacock, \"The documentary crew that immortalised Dunder Mifflin's Scranton branch is in search of a new subject when they discover a dying historic Midwestern newspaper and the publisher trying to revive it with volunteer reporters.\"\n\nThe new series is set to begin production in July.

(Koman is also married to former The Office actress Ellie Kemper.)\n\nRicky Gervais and Stephen Merchant, creators of the original British The Office and executive producers of the American adaptation that ran for nine seasons from 2005 to 2013, are also set to return as executive producers of the new series -- as are executive producers Howard Klein and Ben Silverman and production studio Banijay Americas (formerly known as Reveille).\n\n\"It's been more than ten years since the final episode of The Office aired on NBC, and the acclaimed comedy series continues to gain popularity and build new generations of fans on Peacock,\" said Lisa Katz, president of NBCUniversal Entertainment. In 2019, NBC paid some $500 million for the exclusive rights to stream The Office on Peacock, after it had amassed a massive audience from years of being on Netflix. Peacock has put out \"Superfan\" extended episodes of the show since 2020 to maintain and grow The Office's streaming viewership, which topped 57 billion minutes -- more than any other show -- in 2020.\n\nUniversal Television will produce the new series and production will begin in July, according to Peacock. The release date has not yet been revealed.\n\nHere's what we know so far about the spinoff.\n\nWhat is the new show about?\n\nThe new show is neither a reboot nor a sequel of the beloved franchise. It's also not a spinoff centered around any of the popular on-screen characters from the former series. Rather, the new show will retain the same mockumentary format of The Office but focus on a different kind of paper company.\n\n\"The documentary crew that immortalized Dunder Mifflin's Scranton branch is in search of a new subject when they discover a dying historic Midwestern newspaper and the publisher trying to revive it with volunteer reporters,\" Peacock said in its announcement. \"This new series set in the universe of Dunder Mifflin introduces a new cast of characters in a fresh setting ripe for comedic storytelling: a daily newspaper,\" said Katz.\n\nWho will be in the new show?\n\nLike The Office -- which made stars of actors John Krasinski, Mindy Kaling, and more -- the new show is set to revolve around an ensemble cast. Only two actors have been announced so far: Domhnall Gleeson and Sabrina Impacciatore.\n\nGleeson -- an Irish actor known for his lead roles in sci-fi film Ex Machina and romantic comedy About Time, as well as supporting roles in the Star Wars and Harry Potter movies -- recently co-starred alongside The Office's former boss Steve Carell in the FX psychological thriller series The Patient, for which Gleeson earned Critics Choice and Golden Globes award nominations.\n\nImpacciatore, an Italian actress, gained critical acclaim for her recent role as hotel manager Valentina on the second season of HBO's celebrated dramedy The White Lotus, for which she shared a Screen Actors Guild award for outstanding performance by an ensemble in a drama series and was nominated for an Emmy award for outstanding supporting actress in a drama series.\n\nHow did this new spinoff come about?\n\nNBC has been keen to extend the life of The Office in one form or another since even before it ended.\n\nA spinoff had reportedly been in the works in 2008, with a pilot planned for the following year. Daniels worked with The Office writer Michael Schur to create the new show, but the two ultimately decided a standalone series would work best, resulting in Parks and Recreation, which premiered on NBC in 2009 with no The Office tie-in other than its similar mockumentary format.\n\nAnother spinoff was planned in 2012, tentatively titled The Farm and centered around Rainn Wilson's character Dwight Schrute. But NBC ended up passing on the pilot, which was re-edited and aired as The Office's ninth season's 17th episode, which earned poor reviews.\n\nDaniels told TVGuide in 2013 that other spinoff ideas that were scrapped included one that would follow Ed Helms' character Andy and his suburban family -- which was nixed after Modern Family came out with a similar premise -- as well as ones focused on Craig Robinson's character Darryl or another branch of Dunder Mifflin elsewhere.\n\nIn 2021, The Hollywood Reporter reported that Dakota Johnson's appearance in the series finale of The Office was supposed to set up a future series featuring fresh Dunder Mifflin employees. In 2017, TVLine reported that a reboot of the show was eyed for the 2018-2019 TV lineup, but it never materialized. The reboot was reportedly going to be set at the same Dunder Mifflin office in Scranton and was to incorporate a mix of old and new cast members, except for Carell's Michael Scott.\n\nCarell told TIME in 2018 that he has no plans of ever reviving his role, for which he won several acting awards. \"I've never thought of it as a good idea,\" he said. \"I love it too much to ever want to do it again.\"\n\nLeslie David Baker, who played salesman Stanley Hudson in The Office, launched a crowdfunding campaign in 2020 to finance a web pilot episode of his proposed spinoff, Uncle Stan. The show would have followed Hudson coming out of retirement in Florida to help his nephew run a motorcycle and flower shop in Los Angeles. But in August, Baker returned over $110,000 in donations from fans who tried to help him launch the show, which he said had been set back by the COVID-19 pandemic and entertainment industry strikes.\n\nNews of a new project with Daniels back in creative control surfaced last year. Daniels told The Wrap in November that if The Office were to return, it would not be a reboot but instead something closer to Star Wars' spinoff shows: \"I would never want to redo that same show with a different cast, because I think we got the luckiest cast, the best cast ever, in TV, to do that show,\" he said.\n\nAt the time, he hinted at the direction he was thinking: \"Something like the notion of this documentary crew doing a documentary about a different subject,\" he said. \"That, I think, could be intriguing and creative. But I don't even know what you would call that. I don't know if that's like a sister show or something.\" Sources told The Hollywood Reporter in January that Daniels was assembling a writers room to work on his new take on the series.\n\nHow have people reacted to the announcement?\n\nInitial reactions on social media to the announcement of the new show are mixed -- particularly from journalists and those in the real news media business.\n\nThere is certainly some excitement. Josh Awtry, senior vice president at Newsweek, posted on X: \"BRB subscribing to a thousand Peacocks.\"\n\nMeanwhile, journalist Tiffany Moustakas posted: \"Available for hire as a consultant in case the Office spinoff at a local newspaper needs someone to share 3 years worth of comedic trauma!!\"\n\nThe Washington Post's Gene Park posted: \"'the office' for dying newspapers is great. it's still a paper business. our management is famously out of touch and incompetent. and the variety of situations you can throw a reporter into is infinite.\"\n\nAnd Park's colleague Herb Scribner posted: \"Been saying this for years. Newspaper offices can be hilarious!\"\n\nBut others have taken issue with one specific part of the announcement: \"I know people love 'The Office' but these creators can f*ck right off with this 'volunteer reporters' premise,\" Nina Metz, TV and film critic for the Chicago Tribune, posted on X.\n\n\"I've long thought that a Parks & Rec type show about local journalism would be a great way to help humanize reporters & show people the funny and at times heartwarming quirks of a small newspaper. There are lots of ways to tell that story w/out the 'use volunteer reporters' plot,\" Crain's Chicago Business reporter Leigh Giangreco posted.\n\nWashington Post media reporter Elahe Izadi posted: \"my immediate take (and not being in the writers room so what do I know!): there's comedic gold in adhering more closely to reality rather than this 'volunteer reporter' idea (like 3 local reporters making like 30k a year trying to do the work that 20 people used to do).\"\n\n\"The Office spinoff taking place at a 'dying newspaper' is a little too close to home to be funny,\" posted Sarah Rogers, creative director for Long Lead.\n\nOther social media users have complained that the forthcoming series' description feels like the old series' brand is doing much of the heavy lifting. One X user posted: \"this is so stupid...i like the premise of the show, i'ma socket for mockumentaries but they really don't need to share a universe.\" And another posted: \"Sounds to me like Greg Daniels' production company had a pitch for a new sitcom set at a newspaper and were told 'we'll green light this show if it's called The Office.'\"\n\nContact us at letters@time.com.", "source":

Both Daniels and Koman will produce the series along with the original \"Office\" creators Ricky Gervais and Stephen Merchant.\n\n\"The Office\" premiered in the US in 2005 and concluded in 2013, featuring a star-studded cast including Steve Carell, John Krasinski, Jenna Fischer, Mindy Kaling, Rainn Wilson, and BJ Novak, among others. The series garnered early and widespread success, propelling many cast members to household fame. Throughout its run, \"The Office\" received five Emmy Awards.\n\nSimilar to its precursor led by Gervais, the show adopted a mockumentary style, wherein cast members directly addressed the camera while a crew documented the mundane daily routines, workplace relationships, and occasionally eccentric behavior of the office staff.\n\nThe possibility of any former cast members making cameo appearances in the Peacock series is yet to be decided. Production for the show is scheduled to commence in July.", "source": {"uri": "thedailystar.net", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Daily Star"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Office_(American_TV_series)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "The Office (American TV series)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dunder_Mifflin", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Dunder Mifflin"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comedy", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Comedy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_White_Lotus", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "The White Lotus"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sabrina_Impacciatore", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Sabrina Impacciatore"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domhnall_Gleeson", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Domhnall Gleeson"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mockumentary", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Mockumentary"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ensemble_cast", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Ensemble cast"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greg_Daniels", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Greg Daniels"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HBO", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "HBO"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBC", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "NBC"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Koman", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Michael Koman"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peacock_(streaming_service)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Peacock (streaming service)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_X_Factor_(British_TV_series)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "The X Factor (British TV series)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nathan_for_You", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Nathan for You"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pitch_(filmmaking)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Pitch (filmmaking)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ricky_Gervais", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Ricky Gervais"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stephen_Merchant", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Stephen Merchant"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Showrunner", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Showrunner"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Documentary_film", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Documentary film"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scranton,_Pennsylvania", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Scranton, Pennsylvania"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Scranton, Pennsylvania"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emmy_Awards", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Emmy Awards"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rainn_Wilson", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Rainn Wilson"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Krasinski", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "John Krasinski"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cameo_appearance", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Cameo appearance"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jenna_Fischer", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Jenna Fischer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mindy_Kaling", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Mindy Kaling"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steve_Carell", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Steve Carell"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Television", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Television", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Television/Programs", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Television/Programs", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Television/DVD", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Television/DVD", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Animation/Cartoons", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Animation/Cartoons", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://tds-images.thedailystar.net/sites/default/files/styles/social_share/public/images/2024/05/09/untitled_design_5_0.png", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9550569", "eventUri": "eng-9550569", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.411764705882353, "wgt": 187, "relevance": 1}

(Koman is also married to former The Office actress Ellie Kemper.)\n\nRicky Gervais and Stephen Merchant, creators of the original British The Office and executive producers of the American adaptation that ran for nine seasons from 2005 to 2013, are also set to return as executive producers of the new series -- as are executive producers Howard Klein and Ben Silverman and production studio Banijay Americas (formerly known as Reveille).\n\n\"It's been more than ten years since the final episode of The Office aired on NBC, and the acclaimed comedy series continues to gain popularity and build new generations of fans on Peacock,\" said Lisa Katz, president of NBCUniversal Entertainment. In 2019, NBC paid some $500 million for the exclusive rights to stream The Office on Peacock, after it had amassed a massive audience from years of being on Netflix. Peacock has put out \"Superfan\" extended episodes of the show since 2020 to maintain and grow The Office's streaming viewership, which topped 57 billion minutes -- more than any other show -- in 2020.\n\nUniversal Television will produce the new series and production will begin in July, according to Peacock. The release date has not yet been revealed.\n\nHere's what we know so far about the spinoff.\n\nThe new show is neither a reboot nor a sequel of the beloved franchise. It's also not a spinoff centered around any of the popular on-screen characters from the former series. Rather, the new show will be a follow-up centered around the mockumentary format of The Office.\n\n\"The documentary crew that immortalized Dunder Mifflin's Scranton branch is in search of a new subject when they discover a dying historic Midwestern newspaper and the publisher trying to revive it with volunteer reporters,\" Peacock said in its announcement. \"This new series set in the universe of Dunder Mifflin introduces a new cast of characters in a fresh setting ripe for comedic storytelling: a daily newspaper,\" said Katz.\n\nLike The Office -- which made stars of actors John Krasinski, Mindy Kaling, and more -- the new show is set to revolve around an ensemble cast. Only two actors have been announced so far: Domhnall Gleeson and Sabrina Impacciatore.\n\nGleeson -- an Irish actor known for his lead roles in sci-fi film Ex Machina and romantic comedy About Time, as well as supporting roles in the Star Wars and Harry Potter movies -- recently co-starred alongside The Office's former boss Steve Carell in the FX psychological thriller series The Patient, for which Gleeson earned Critics Choice and Golden Globes award nominations.\n\nImpacciatore, an Italian actress, gained critical acclaim for her role as hotel manager Valentina on the second season of HBO's celebrated dramedy The White Lotus, for which she shared a Screen Actors Guild award for outstanding performance by an ensemble in a drama series and was nominated for an Emmy award for outstanding supporting actress in a drama series.\n\nNBC has been keen to extend the life of The Office in one form or another since even before it ended.\n\nA spinoff had reportedly been in the works in 2008, with a pilot planned for the following year. Daniels worked with The Office writer Michael Schur to create the new show, but the two ultimately decided a standalone series would work best, resulting in Parks and Recreation, which premiered on NBC in 2009 with no The Office tie-in other than its similar mockumentary format.\n\nAnother spinoff was planned in 2012, tentatively titled The Farm and centered around Rainn Wilson's character Dwight Schrute. But NBC ended up passing on the pilot, which was re-edited and aired as The Office's ninth season's 17th episode, which earned poor reviews.\n\nDaniels told TVGuide in 2013 that other spinoff ideas that were scrapped included one that would follow Ed Helms' character Andy and his suburban family -- which was nixed after Modern Family came out with a similar premise -- as well as ones focused on Craig Robinson's character Daryll or another branch of Dunder Mifflin elsewhere.\n\nIn 2021, The Hollywood Reporter reported that Dakota Johnson's appearance in the series finale of The Office was supposed to set up a future series featuring fresh Dunder Mifflin employees. In 2017, TVLine reported that a reboot of the show was eyed for the 2018-2019 TV lineup, but it never materialized. The reboot was reportedly going to be set at the same Dunder Mifflin office in Scranton and was to incorporate a mix of old and new cast members, except for Carell's Michael Scott.\n\nCarell told TIME in 2018 that he has no plans of ever reviving his role, for which he won several acting awards. \"I've never thought of it as a good idea,\" he said. \"I love it too much to ever want to do it again.\"\n\nLeslie David Baker, who played salesman Stanley Hudson in The Office, launched a crowdfunding campaign in 2020 to finance a web pilot episode of his proposed spinoff, Uncle Stan. The show would have followed Hudson coming out of retirement in Florida to help his nephew run a motorcycle and flower shop in Los Angeles. But in August, Baker returned over $110,000 in donations from fans who tried to help him launch the show, which he said had been set back by the COVID-19 pandemic and entertainment industry strikes.\n\nNews of a new project with Daniels back in creative control surfaced last year. Daniels told The Wrap in November that if The Office were to return, it would not be a reboot but instead something closer to Star Wars' spinoff shows: \"I would never want to redo that same show with a different cast, because I think we got the luckiest cast, the best cast ever, in TV, to do that show,\" he said.\n\nAt the time, he hinted at the direction he was thinking: \"Something like the notion of this documentary crew doing a documentary about a different subject,\" he said. \"That, I think, could be intriguing and creative. But I don't even know what you would call that. I don't know if that's like a sister show or something.\" Sources told The Hollywood Reporter in January that Daniels was assembling a writers room to work on his new take on the series.\n\nInitial reactions on social media to the announcement of the new show are mixed -- particularly from journalists and those in the real news media business.\n\nThere is certainly some excitement. Josh Awtry, senior vice president at Newsweek, posted on X: \"BRB subscribing to a thousand Peacocks.\"\n\nMeanwhile, journalist Tiffany Moustakas posted: \"Available for hire as a consultant in case the Office spinoff at a local newspaper needs someone to share 3 years worth of comedic trauma!!\"\n\nThe Washington Post's Gene Park posted: \"'the office' for dying newspapers is great. it's still a paper business. our management is famously out of touch and incompetent. and the variety of situations you can throw a reporter into is infinite.\"\n\nAnd Park's colleague Herb Scribner posted: \"Been saying this for years. Newspaper offices can be hilarious!\"\n\nBut others have taken issue with one specific part of the announcement: \"I know people love 'The Office' but these creators can f*ck right off with this 'volunteer reporters' premise,\" Nina Metz, TV and film critic for the Chicago Tribune, posted on X.\n\n\"I've long thought that a Parks & Rec type show about local journalism would be a great way to help humanize reporters & show people the funny and at times heartwarming quirks of a small newspaper. There are lots of ways to tell that story w/out the 'use volunteer reporters' plot,\" Crain's Chicago Business reporter Leigh Giangreco posted.\n\nWashington Post media reporter Elahe Izadi posted: \"my immediate take (and not being in the writers room so what do I know!): there's comedic gold in adhering more closely to reality rather than this 'volunteer reporter' idea (like 3 local reporters making like 30k a year trying to do the work that 20 people used to do).\"\n\n\"The Office spinoff taking place at a 'dying newspaper' is a little too close to home to be funny,\" posted Sarah Rogers, creative director for Long Lead.\n\nOther social media users have complained that the forthcoming series' description feels like the old series' brand is doing much of the heavy lifting. One X user posted: \"this is so stupid...i like the premise of the show, i'ma socket for mockumentaries but they really don't need to share a universe.\" And another posted: \"Sounds to me like Greg Daniels' production company had a pitch for a new sitcom set at a newspaper and were told 'we'll green light this show if it's called The Office.'\"", "source": {"uri": "time.com", "dataType": "news",

On Wednesday, Peacock announced that the untitled new comedy will hail from Greg Daniels (who adapted the original NBC show) and \"Nathan for You\" co-creator Michael Koman.\n\nIrish actor Domhnall Gleeson, 40 (\"About Time,\") and Italian actress Sabrina Impacciatore, 56 (\"The White Lotus\") will lead an ensemble cast. It's not clear yet if either (or both) of them will be in a boss role, similar to Michael Scott (Steve Carrell) or if they'll perhaps be this show's version of a star-crossed couple Jim (John Krasinski) and Pam (Jenna Fisher).\n\nIronically, Gleeson has previously terrorized Steve Carrell onscreen (in Hulu's \"The Patient\").\n\nThe show isn't returning to Scranton, Pennsylvania. Per Peacock's description, this spinoff will be set in the same world, following different characters in the Midwest.\n\n\"The documentary crew that immortalized Dunder Mifflin's Scranton branch is in search of a new subject when they discover a dying historic Midwestern newspaper and the publisher trying to revive it with volunteer reporters,\" according to Peacock.\n\n\"It's been more than ten years since the final episode of The Office aired on NBC, and the acclaimed comedy series continues to gain popularity and build new generations of fans on Peacock,\" Lisa Katz, President, NBCUniversal Entertainment, told Peacock in a statement.\n\n\"In partnership with Universal Television and led by the creative team of Greg Daniels and Michael Koman, this new series set in the universe of Dunder Mifflin introduces a new cast of characters in a fresh setting ripe for comedic storytelling: a daily newspaper.\"\n\nOriginal UK \"The Office\" creators Ricky Gervais and Stephen Merchant are onboard as producers.\n\nThe original American \"The Office,\" aired on NBC from 2005-2013 for a whopping nine seasons and 201 episodes, launching actors such as Carrell, Krasinski, and Mindy Kaling to stardom.\n\nThe original mockumentary followed the daily lives and antics of employees at a paper company, including blowhard boss Michael, perpetually flirting Jim and Pam, eccentric Dwight (Rainn Wilson), chilly Angela (Angela Kinsey) and frequently exasperated Oscar (Oscar Nunez), among others.\n\nIn the book, \"Welcome to Dunder Mifflin: The Ultimate Oral History of 'The Office'\" by Brian Baumgartner (who played Kevin) and Ben Silverman, an executive producer the cast and crew dish about how the show began as a scrappy underdog with little support from its network -- including regular messages that it was getting the axe -- low ratings and mass skepticism.\n\nThroughout Season 1, which snared fewer than 5 million viewers per week -- dismal for network TV at the time -- an NBC executive frequently came to the set to inform everyone that the current episode would be the end of the series.\n\n\"He was like, 'This will be the last one ... It's just not getting the ratings and the network doesn't get it.' He said that every week of the first season,'\" Krasinski recalled in the book.\n\n\"NBC didn't give enough of a sh-t to even pay attention to it,\" Silverman said, adding that when he begged then-network president Jeff Zucker to renew the show for Season 2, \"I was thrown out of his office.\"\n\nProduction on the untitled spinoff series will start in July.\n\nThe new show will premiere on Peacock on an unannounced date.", "source": {"uri": "nypost.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "New York Post"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peacock_(streaming_service)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Peacock (streaming service)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Office_(American_TV_series)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "The Office (American TV series)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBC", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "NBC"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Koman", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Michael Koman"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dunder_Mifflin", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Dunder Mifflin"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domhnall_Gleeson", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Domhnall Gleeson"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greg_Daniels", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Greg Daniels"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spin-off_(media)", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Spin-off (media)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Midwestern_United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Midwestern United States"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comedy", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Comedy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scranton,_Pennsylvania", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Scranton, Pennsylvania"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Scranton, Pennsylvania"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_White_Lotus", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "The White Lotus"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sabrina_Impacciatore", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Sabrina Impacciatore"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nathan_for_You", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Nathan for You"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Krasinski", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "John Krasinski"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Scott_(The_Office)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Michael Scott (The Office)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ensemble_cast", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Ensemble cast"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Italian_language", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Italian language"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hulu", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Hulu"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Angela_Kinsey", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Angela Kinsey"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universal_Television", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Universal Television"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ricky_Gervais", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Ricky Gervais"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stephen_Merchant", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Stephen Merchant"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBCUniversal", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "NBCUniversal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fictional_universe", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Fictional universe"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Documentary_film", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Documentary film"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Kingdom", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/What_If...?_(TV_series)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "What If...?

Can you blame them? The Office delivered nine seasons of pure comedy gold. It launched the careers of Mindy Kaling, John Krasinski, and Ellie Kemper. It gave us this meme. It taught us about the horrors of nepotism and the beauty of a choreographed wedding entrance. It was perfect.\n\nThough some fans have been anti-reboot -- they want the show to be preserved in all its glory -- I identify with the fans who want more episodes, hijinks, workplace relationships we grew to know and love. If you feel the same way as I do, rejoice -- because our wish has been granted. Sort of. Peacock ordered a new television comedy from Greg Daniels, who adapted The Office for the United States (the series originated in the UK) and Nathan for You co-creator Michael Koman.\n\nHere's the gist of the new series, per a press release from NBC: \"The documentary crew that immortalized Dunder Mifflin's Scranton branch is in search of a new subject when they discover a dying historic Midwestern newspaper and the publisher trying to revive it with volunteer reporters.\" Lisa Katz, the president of NBC Entertainment, added, \"This new series set in the universe of Dunder Mifflin introduces a new cast of characters in a fresh setting ripe for comedic storytelling.\"\n\nThose new characters? Well, according to Deadline, Domhnall Gleeson (The Patient) and Sabrina Impacciatore (The White Lotus) will lead the new ensemble. We don't have any casting details otherwise.\n\nThe show's name is a mystery, but my money's on The Other Office. Other knee-jerk thoughts: taking the focus far away from Scranton certainly cuts down the chances of cameos from any of our friends from The Office. Unless someone needs to order a large quantity of paper...\n\nThe release date has not been revealed. Patience, people! However, the production process should ramp up any minute, now that NBC has officially greenlit the project. In the meantime, Katz spoke about the lasting impact of The Office. \"It's been more than ten years since the final episode of The Office aired on NBC, and the acclaimed comedy series continues to gain popularity and build new generations of fans on Peacock,\" she said.", "source": {"uri": "yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Office_(American_TV_series)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "The Office (American TV series)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dunder_Mifflin", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Dunder Mifflin"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Krasinski", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "John Krasinski"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ellie_Kemper", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Ellie Kemper"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Series_finale", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Series finale"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mindy_Kaling", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Mindy Kaling"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reboot_(fiction)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Reboot (fiction)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_meme", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Internet meme"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBC", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "NBC"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sitcom", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Sitcom"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Koman", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Michael Koman"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peacock_(streaming_service)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Peacock (streaming service)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nathan_for_You", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Nathan for You"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greg_Daniels", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Greg Daniels"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fictional_universe", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Fictional universe"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Documentary_film", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Documentary film"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Midwestern_United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Midwestern United States"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Television_comedy", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Television comedy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comedy", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Comedy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scranton,_Pennsylvania", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Scranton, Pennsylvania"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Scranton, Pennsylvania"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Kingdom", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_White_Lotus", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "The White Lotus"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deadline_Hollywood", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Deadline Hollywood"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sabrina_Impacciatore", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Sabrina Impacciatore"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domhnall_Gleeson", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Domhnall Gleeson"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cameo_appearance", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Cameo appearance"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mystery_fiction", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Mystery fiction"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Television/Programs", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Television/Programs", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Advice", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Advice", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Television/DVD", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Television/DVD", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Animation/Cartoons", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Animation/Cartoons", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://media.zenfs.com/en/esquire_269/465f7be3c2ae9657a474f61800728e22", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9550569", "eventUri": "eng-9550569", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.2784313725490195, "wgt": 182, "relevance": 1}

In 2019, NBC paid some $500 million for the exclusive rights to stream The Office on Peacock, after it had amassed a massive audience from years of being on Netflix. Peacock has put out \"Superfan\" extended episodes of the show since 2020 to maintain and grow The Office's streaming viewership, which topped 57 billion minutes -- more than any other show -- in 2020.\n\nUniversal Television will produce the new series and production will begin in July, according to Peacock. The release date has not yet been revealed.\n\nHere's what we know so far about the spinoff.\n\nThe new show is neither a reboot nor a sequel of the beloved franchise. It's also not a spinoff centered around any of the popular on-screen characters from the former series. Rather, the new show will be a follow-up centered around the mockumentary format of The Office.\n\n\"The documentary crew that immortalized Dunder Mifflin's Scranton branch is in search of a new subject when they discover a dying historic Midwestern newspaper and the publisher trying to revive it with volunteer reporters,\" Peacock said in its announcement. \"This new series set in the universe of Dunder Mifflin introduces a new cast of characters in a fresh setting ripe for comedic storytelling: a daily newspaper,\" said Katz.\n\nLike The Office -- which made stars of actors John Krasinski, Mindy Kaling, and more -- the new show is set to revolve around an ensemble cast. Only two actors have been announced so far: Domhnall Gleeson and Sabrina Impacciatore.\n\nGleeson -- an Irish actor known for his lead roles in sci-fi film Ex Machina and romantic comedy About Time, as well as supporting roles in the Star Wars and Harry Potter movies -- recently co-starred alongside The Office's former boss Steve Carell in the FX psychological thriller series The Patient, for which Gleeson earned Critics Choice and Golden Globes award nominations.\n\nImpacciatore, an Italian actress, gained critical acclaim for her recent role as hotel manager Valentina on the second season of HBO's celebrated dramedy The White Lotus, for which she shared a Screen Actors Guild award for outstanding performance by an ensemble in a drama series and was nominated for an Emmy award for outstanding supporting actress in a drama series.\n\nNBC has been keen to extend the life of The Office in one form or another since even before it ended.\n\nA spinoff had reportedly been in the works in 2008, with a pilot planned for the following year. Daniels worked with The Office writer Michael Schur to create the new show, but the two ultimately decided a standalone series would work best, resulting in Parks and Recreation, which premiered on NBC in 2009 with no The Office tie-in other than its similar mockumentary format.\n\nAnother spinoff was planned in 2012, tentatively titled The Farm and centered around Rainn Wilson's character Dwight Schrute. But NBC ended up passing on the pilot, which was re-edited and aired as The Office's ninth season's 17th episode, which earned poor reviews.\n\nDaniels told TVGuide in 2013 that other spinoff ideas that were scrapped included one that would follow Ed Helms' character Andy and his suburban family -- which was nixed after Modern Family came out with a similar premise -- as well as ones focused on Craig Robinson's character Daryll or another branch of Dunder Mifflin elsewhere.\n\nIn 2021, The Hollywood Reporter reported that Dakota Johnson's appearance in the series finale of The Office was supposed to set up a future series featuring fresh Dunder Mifflin employees. In 2017, TVLine reported that a reboot of the show was eyed for the 2018-2019 TV lineup, but it never materialized. The reboot was reportedly going to be set at the same Dunder Mifflin office in Scranton and was to incorporate a mix of old and new cast members, except for Carell's Michael Scott.\n\nCarell told TIME in 2018 that he has no plans of ever reviving his role, for which he won several acting awards. \"I've never thought of it as a good idea,\" he said. \"I love it too much to ever want to do it again.\"\n\nLeslie David Baker, who played salesman Stanley Hudson in The Office, launched a crowdfunding campaign in 2020 to finance a web pilot episode of his proposed spinoff, Uncle Stan. The show would have followed Hudson coming out of retirement in Florida to help his nephew run a motorcycle and flower shop in Los Angeles. But in August, Baker returned over $110,000 in donations from fans who tried to help him launch the show, which he said had been set back by the COVID-19 pandemic and entertainment industry strikes.\n\nNews of a new project with Daniels back in creative control surfaced last year. Daniels told The Wrap in November that if The Office were to return, it would not be a reboot but instead something closer to Star Wars' spinoff shows: \"I would never want to redo that same show with a different cast, because I think we got the luckiest cast, the best cast ever, in TV, to do that show,\" he said.\n\nAt the time, he hinted at the direction he was thinking: \"Something like the notion of this documentary crew doing a documentary about a different subject,\" he said. \"That, I think, could be intriguing and creative. But I don't even know what you would call that. I don't know if that's like a sister show or something.\" Sources told The Hollywood Reporter in January that Daniels was assembling a writers room to work on his new take on the series.\n\nInitial reactions on social media to the announcement of the new show are mixed -- particularly from journalists and those in the real news media business.\n\nThere is certainly some excitement. Josh Awtry, senior vice president at Newsweek, posted on X: \"BRB subscribing to a thousand Peacocks.\"\n\nMeanwhile, journalist Tiffany Moustakas posted: \"Available for hire as a consultant in case the Office spinoff at a local newspaper needs someone to share 3 years worth of comedic trauma!!\"\n\nThe Washington Post's Gene Park posted: \"'the office' for dying newspapers is great. it's still a paper business. our management is famously out of touch and incompetent. and the variety of situations you can throw a reporter into is infinite.\"\n\nAnd Park's colleague Herb Scribner posted: \"Been saying this for years. Newspaper offices can be hilarious!\"\n\nBut others have taken issue with one specific part of the announcement: \"I know people love 'The Office' but these creators can f*ck right off with this 'volunteer reporters' premise,\" Nina Metz, TV and film critic for the Chicago Tribune, posted on X.\n\n\"I've long thought that a Parks & Rec type show about local journalism would be a great way to help humanize reporters & show people the funny and at times heartwarming quirks of a small newspaper. There are lots of ways to tell that story w/out the 'use volunteer reporters' plot,\" Crain's Chicago Business reporter Leigh Giangreco posted.\n\nWashington Post media reporter Elahe Izadi posted: \"my immediate take (and not being in the writers room so what do I know!): there's comedic gold in adhering more closely to reality rather than this 'volunteer reporter' idea (like 3 local reporters making like 30k a year trying to do the work that 20 people used to do).\"\n\n\"The Office spinoff taking place at a 'dying newspaper' is a little too close to home to be funny,\" posted Sarah Rogers, creative director for Long Lead.\n\nOther social media users have complained that the forthcoming series' description feels like the old series' brand is doing much of the heavy lifting. One X user posted: \"this is so stupid...i like the premise of the show, i'ma socket for mockumentaries but they really don't need to share a universe.\" And another posted: \"Sounds to me like Greg Daniels' production company had a pitch for a new sitcom set at a newspaper and were told 'we'll green light this show if it's called The Office.'\"", "source": {"uri": "yahoo.com", "dataType":

Cameras will start rolling in July, but no release date for the comedy has been announced yet. The series stars Domhnall Gleeson and Sabrina Impacciatore.\n\nThe new series set in the same universe as The Office is one step closer to becoming a reality, with The Hollywood Reporter stating that Peacock has given the series a full season order. The untitled project will follow the team behind a dying Midwestern newspaper, with a cast led by Domhnall Gleeson and Sabrina Impacciatore. While a release date for the new comedy set in the same universe as The Office wasn't announced, it's been confirmed that cameras will begin rolling in July.\n\nGreg Daniels, the showrunner of the version of The Office that starred Steve Carell, John Krasinksi and Jenna Fischer, created the new show alongside Michael Koman, the co-creator of Nathan For You. The official logline for the upcoming project reads as follows: \"\"The documentary crew that immortalized Dunder Mifflin's Scranton branch is in search of a new subject when they discover a dying historic Midwestern newspaper and the publisher trying to revive it with volunteer reporters.\" Even if the new title follows different characters, it's clear from the logline that the spirit of The Office will be very much alive, with a struggling team trying to keep their business from closing.\n\nWhat Else Have the Cast Been Up To? Close\n\nDetails regarding the characters both Domhnall Gleeson and Sabrina Impacciatore are still kept under wraps, but the performers have been very busy in recent years. Impacciatore was recently seen as Valentina in the second season of The White Lotus, the HBO dark comedy about a luxurious resort where things don't always go as planned. The actress has also worked in an extensive list of Italian productions, cementing her name both in Hollywood and in her home country. Time will tell what Impacciatore has in store for the new Office series, as Peacock looks forward to expanding the franchise.\n\nGleeson might be known for bringing General Hux to life during the Star Wars sequel trilogy, but the performer has moved on from the galaxy far, far away while looking for new projects. The actor was recently seen as Jack in Alice & Jack, the miniseries that followed a romance that developed for over a decade, with the unpredictable changes and imperfections such a lasting bond might include. A new project set in the same universe as The Office was bound to happen considering the number of people that constantly watch the comedy more than a decade after it came to an end. It remains to be seen if the Midwestern newspaper will be as beloved as the Dunder Mifflin Paper Company.\n\nThere is currently no release date for the series. The original The Office is streaming now on Peacock.\n\nThe Office TV-14Sitcom\n\nA mockumentary on a group of typical office workers, where the workday consists of ego clashes, inappropriate behavior, and tedium.\n\nRelease Date March 24, 2005 Cast Steve Carell , Rainn Wilson , John Krasinski , Jenna Fischer , Mindy Kaling , Craig Robinson , B.J.

And Michael Koman, who co-created Nathan For You, will also helm the project. When it comes to the mockumentary game, these two are incredibly trustworthy.\n\nNow, all that's left to do is cast a likable (and somewhat hateable) team of Midwestern all-stars. Maybe the Parks and Recreation cast can be of assistance?\n\nRead more at The Daily Beast.\n\nGet the Daily Beast's biggest scoops and scandals delivered right to your inbox.

They will also serve as executive producers along with Ricky Gervais and Stephen Merchant, who created the original British series. Production is scheduled to begin in July.\n\nBecause the new series is set in the same universe as The Office, it's possible that beloved characters could make appearances -- but no plans for any of the original actors to reprise their roles have been revealed.\n\nSome of them might be up for the job if asked. Angela Kinsey and Jenna Fischer expressed interest in returning for an Office movie, or any reboot project that Daniels was involved in. \"I would do it for my kids because I think they would think that's fun,\" Kinsey said, with Fischer adding, \"As long as Greg is writing it and he's in charge of it, then I say yes.\"\n\nHowever, Daniels has previously expressed that he has no interest in reviving The Office in any way. \"I feel like we ended that story beautifully,\" he told TheWire in November. \"I think we got the luckiest cast, the best cast ever, in TV, to do that show.\"", "source": {"uri": "bustle.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Bustle"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Office_(American_TV_series)", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "The Office (American TV series)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peacock_(streaming_service)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Peacock (streaming service)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dunder_Mifflin", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Dunder Mifflin"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mockumentary", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Mockumentary"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reboot_(fiction)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Reboot (fiction)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Variety_(magazine)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Variety (magazine)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Documentary_film", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Documentary film"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scranton,_Pennsylvania", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Scranton, Pennsylvania"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Scranton, Pennsylvania"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_White_Lotus", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "The White Lotus"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Office_(British_TV_series)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "The Office (British TV series)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Koman", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Michael Koman"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sabrina_Impacciatore", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Sabrina Impacciatore"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domhnall_Gleeson", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Domhnall Gleeson"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ricky_Gervais", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Ricky Gervais"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stephen_Merchant", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Stephen Merchant"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greg_Daniels", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Greg Daniels"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Executive_producer", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Executive producer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Star_Wars", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Star Wars"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Midwestern_United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Midwestern United States"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Kingdom", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Angela_Kinsey", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Angela Kinsey"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jenna_Fischer", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Jenna Fischer"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Television/Programs", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Television/Programs", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Advice", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Advice", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 99}], "image": "https://imgix.bustle.com/uploads/getty/2024/5/8/c17fe59b-b971-4766-a381-5d3d5fe5d0d3-getty-141187336.jpg?w=1200&h=630&fit=crop&crop=faces&fm=jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9550569", "eventUri": "eng-9550569", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-05-08", "textStart": 39, "textEnd": 44}], "sentiment": 0.09019607843137245, "wgt": 173, "relevance": 1}

This time, they've found a new subject: a dying historic Midwestern newspaper. With a publisher attempting to revive the brand and a handful of volunteer reporters keeping it afloat, the paper serves as the perfect topic for a documentary.\n\nTwo big names have already been announced to be starring in the project. About Time star Domhnall Gleeson and The White Lotus hotel manager Sabrina Impacciatore have been cast, which raises some eyebrows. Sure, these two are great actors. But what do two Europeans have to do with a Midwestern newspaper?\n\nThat said, the concept for this reboot does sound hilarious. Maybe I'm a bit biased -- being a reporter and all -- but the world of journalism seems to be ripe for humor, especially in the form of a workplace comedy like The Office. Finally, we're getting our own version of one of the funniest TV genres.\n\nThe team behind the show is promising, too. Greg Daniels, who originally adapted the British version of The Office for American audiences, is back to create the show. And Michael Koman, who co-created Nathan For You, will also helm the project. When it comes to the mockumentary game, these two are incredibly trustworthy.\n\nNow, all that's left to do is cast a likable (and somewhat hateable) team of Midwestern all-stars.

Nearly since it went off the air, fans have been asking for a return of The Office. Be careful what you wish for, because a sort of new version of The Office is returning to television. Streaming television.\n\nThe Office, the American version of The Office, ran on NBC from 2005 to 2013. The show was so popular a spin-off was announced in 2008 (that spin-off never happened and became the equally fantastic Parks and Recreation). Since going off the air the popularity of the extremely bingeable comedy has skyrocketed.\n\nOn Jan. 12, 2021 Variety reported that The Office was by far the most streamed show of 2020. In the first year of the pandemic, people just wanted to check in with their TV pals stuck at work. Not virtual work, but in an office. 57 billion minutes of the show were streamed. The next most popular show was Grey's Anatomy, another show featuring people at work, with 39.4 billion minutes.\n\nGrey's Anatomy was also on broadcast television in 2020. Hell, it still is on broadcast television. But not The Office. While Michael, Dwight, Pam, Jim, Andy and everyone else may not be coming back to TV, a new/reboot of The Office is.\n\nOn May 8, 2024 Peacock, the current home to every episode of The Office, announced something that may please some Office fans. The press release titled, \"Peacock Announces New Comedy Created by Greg Daniels and Michael Koman: The untitled series produced by Universal Television takes place at a daily newspaper and is set in the same universe as The Office\" doesn't promise a new Office, but a show in the Office universe.\n\nThe press release makes it clear that the show will be 'filmed' by the same people that 'filmed' the fictional documentary the folks behind the camera in The Office were making. \"The documentary crew that immortalized Dunder Mifflin's Scranton branch is in search of a new subject when they discover a dying historic Midwestern newspaper and the publisher trying to revive it with volunteer reporters.\"\n\nWhy now? Popularity! \"It's been more than ten years since the final episode of The Office aired on NBC, and the acclaimed comedy series continues to gain popularity and build new generations of fans on Peacock,\" said Lisa Katz, President, NBCUniversal Entertainment.\n\nSo no Dunder Mifflin, no Michael, Dwight, Pam, Jim, Andy, etc. in this new series. But the only announced cast are pretty great: Domhnall Gleeson and Sabrina Impacciatore. Domhnall recently co-starred with Steve Carell in 2022's The Patient on FX. The show was nominated for a Peabody. You may recognize Sabrina from her excellent performance on The White Lotus, a role that won her an Emmy nomination.", "source": {"uri": "distractify.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Distractify"},

There's a part of me that would love to watch a new series with that brand of humor and charm (and awkwardness) and the whole mockumentary format. I miss that show. It's kind of crazy to think how long ago it aired, back in the day when people still burned DVDs. I think I have a couple The Office DVDs we burned back in the day tucked away in some disc holder still.\n\nAnother part of me is sounding alarm bells. How can you possibly avoid the long shadow cast by Dunder Mifflin? Steve Carell as the bumbling regional manager, Michael Scott, was simply too perfect, and he was surrounded by an equally perfect cast, from John Krasinski's Jim Halpert and Jenna Fisher's Pam Beesly, to the true star of the show, Rainn Wilson as the assistant (to the) regional manager, Dwight Schrute.\n\nBut now we have confirmation that a reboot / revival or I suppose new anthology or spinoff in The Office universe is indeed coming from the show's creator, Greg Daniels, and writer Michael Koman. The new show will take place in the same universe as the original mockumentary (and yes, I know the actual original was a British show) but it will not take place in Scranton, PA and it will not be about a paper company.\n\nThe new show will follow the same documentary crew that \"filmed\" the original, but this time they'll cover a \"dying historic Midwestern newspaper and the publisher trying to revive it with volunteer reporters.\" That sounds like a pretty good idea, to be honest, and a newsroom should be a welcome change from a paper sales office. That's the good news.\n\nThe bad news is that it's coming to Peacock.\n\nTwo cast members have been announced so far, though Peacock says the show will feature an \"ensemble cast.\" The first is Domhnall Gleeson who we know from Ex Machina, Star Wars and plenty of other films. He's a great actor, though not exactly someone I'd associate with this kind of comedy. Then again, he was in The Patient with Steve Carell . . . .\n\nSabrina Impacciatore, who we met in Season 2 of The White Lotus as the hapless hotel manager has also been cast, though we know nothing about either character.\n\nI will point out here that one of the great features of The Office was the fact that very few of its core cast members were famous when it began airing. Many of them became famous, or went on to play roles in other shows and films, but most of them were new faces or at least not very recognizable (I just realized the other day that Rainn Wilson was in Sahara with Matthew McConaughey). I hope that the new series doesn't go with all established actors and allows some newcomers as well.\n\n\"It's been more than ten years since the final episode of The Office aired on NBC, and the acclaimed comedy series continues to gain popularity and build new generations of fans on Peacock,\" NBCUniversal Entertainment President Lisa Katz said in a statement. \"In partnership with Universal Television and led by the creative team of Greg Daniels and Michael Koman, this new series set in the universe of Dunder Mifflin introduces a new cast of characters in a fresh setting ripe for comedic storytelling: a daily newspaper.\"\n\nP.P.S. What I would really love to see is a Michael Scarn movie. Just an entire movie that takes place in the wacky world of Michael Scott's improv class character.", "source": {"uri": "forbes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Forbes"}, "authors": [], "concepts":

Now it's official.\n\nAs has been previously reported, the new The Office is neither a reboot, sequel, or prequel, but an entirely new series with a similar setup, namely that it's a mockumentary. There have been a number of mockumentary series since (like Abbott Elementary), so it's unclear why they even needed to call this The Office, but for the fact that it's bringing back the creator of the American The Office, Greg Daniels, as well as the creators of the British series, Ricky Gervais and Stephen Merchant, to act as producers, and because The Office is recognizable IP.\n\nDomhnall Gleeson and Sabrina Impacciatore have already been cast as the leads in the ensemble, and I am not mad about that, even if it might be odd to hire a Brit and an Italian to lead a series set in the midwest.

Any sort of straight-up redoing The Office would automatically end in disaster even if the actual writing was good, just because folks are far too attached to the Dunder Mifflin crew and their wacky stories. Focusing on an entirely different industry in a new setting feels like the right call here, especially if the powers that be want to recruit new fans.\n\nThe Office remains one of the most successful shows that are constantly licensed out to streamers such as Netflix, so NBCUniversal looking into a brand-new iteration of the series was only a matter of time, especially when Peacock is lacking a few more hit exclusives. \"It's been more than ten years since the final episode of The Office aired on NBC, and the acclaimed comedy series continues to gain popularity and build new generations of fans on Peacock,\" Lisa Katz, President, Scripted Content, NBCUniversal Entertainment said in a statement.

In a press release issued by Peacock, the series logline reads:\n\nThe documentary crew that immortalized Dunder Mifflin's Scranton branch is in search of a new subject when they discover a dying historic Midwestern newspaper and the publisher trying to revive it with volunteer reporters.\n\nOnly two cast members have been announced for The Office spinoff so far, but they're sure to be familiar faces to many viewers. First up is Domhnall Gleeson, who's starred in films like About Time, Ex Machina, and the Star Wars sequel trilogy. Joining him is Sabrina Impacciatore, whose hilarious performance as hotel manager Valentina in The White Lotus Season 2 earned her an Emmy nomination for Outstanding Supporting Actress in a Drama.\n\nThe pair will lead an ensemble cast, with new cast members yet to be announced.\n\nThere is no official airdate for The Office spinoff yet, but Peacock confirmed in its press release that the series will go into production in July.

Greg Daniels confirmed plans for the new series which will have a similar mockumentary style. The reboot will star Sabrina Impacciatore and Domhnall Gleeson. SCREENRANT VIDEO OF THE DAY SCROLL TO CONTINUE WITH CONTENT\n\nNew details on The Office spinoff have finally been revealed, with a key connection to the past uncovered as the project moves forward at Peacock. It was reported late last year that a reboot of The Office was in the works from Greg Daniels, who developed the U.S. version of the comedy. Daniels elaborated on his plans this past January, clarifying that the story would take place within the same world as the popular NBC series led by Steve Carrell. Since then, it's been confirmed that The Office reboot will star Sabrina Impacciatore and Domhnall Gleeson.\n\nNow, according to TVLine, the reboot of The Office has been given a full series order at Peacock.

The new show, co-created by Greg Daniels and Michael Koman, will delve into the lives of a struggling Midwestern newspaper, leveraging the original documentary crew that made Dunder Mifflin a household name, Deadline reports. Domhnall Gleeson and Sabrina Impacciatore are set to headline the ensemble cast, with production kicking off in July.\n\nA Fresh Take on a Familiar Universe\n\nIn an intriguing shift from paper sales to newsprint, the new series will follow the documentary crew as they pivot from the well-known confines of Scranton to a historic newspaper fighting to stay relevant. The publisher, played by Domhnall Gleeson, alongside a ragtag team of volunteer reporters, including Sabrina Impacciatore, attempts to rejuvenate the dying enterprise, promising a mix of new dynamics and comedic scenarios.\n\n\"It's been over a decade since 'The Office' concluded, yet it continues to win over new fans, thanks in part to its availability on Peacock,\" said Lisa Katz, president of NBCUniversal Entertainment. She emphasized the unique setting of a daily newspaper as a ripe environment for the show's renowned style of humor, which mixes the mundane with the extraordinary.\n\nGreg Daniels, the mind behind the American adaptation of \"The Office,\" teams up once again with Michael Koman to spearhead this latest venture. The creative duo will also serve as executive producers, alongside \"The Office\" creators Ricky Gervais and Stephen Merchant, as well as seasoned producers Howard Klein, Ben Silverman, and Banijay Americas.\n\nContinuing the Legacy\n\nThis announcement rekindles the legacy of \"The Office,\" which has maintained its cultural footprint well beyond its nine-season run from 2005 to 2013. The series' ability to resonate with audiences has led to its continued success on streaming platforms, where new generations have discovered and embraced its unique brand of humor.\n\nThe conception of this new series aligns with previous attempts to expand the \"The Office\" universe. While some projects like the potential Dwight Schrute spin-off did not progress, this new initiative by Peacock represents a promising new chapter. Interestingly, the new series surfaces following a period of renewed interest in creating spin-offs, highlighted by Leslie David Baker's attempt to launch a show centered around his character, Stanley Hudson, which ultimately did not materialize.\n\nAs the new series sets to begin production, fans of \"The Office\" are eagerly anticipating how the beloved mockumentary format will adapt to its new setting. With a combination of fresh talent and seasoned creators, the series should offer an exciting exploration of office life in a completely different context, promising both nostalgia for longtime fans and fresh engagement for new viewers. The announcement also signals Peacock's commitment to leveraging beloved franchises to attract a broad audience, ensuring that the legacy of \"The Office\" continues to evolve in today's streaming era.", "source": {"uri": "clutchpoints.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "ClutchPoints"}, "authors": [{"uri": "burtland_dixon@clutchpoints.com", "name": "Burtland Dixon", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peacock_(streaming_service)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Peacock (streaming service)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Office_(American_TV_series)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "The Office (American TV series)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Koman", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Michael Koman"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sabrina_Impacciatore", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Sabrina Impacciatore"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domhnall_Gleeson", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Domhnall Gleeson"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greg_Daniels", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Greg Daniels"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Documentary_film", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Documentary film"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deadline_Hollywood", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Deadline Hollywood"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dunder_Mifflin", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Dunder Mifflin"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mockumentary", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Mockumentary"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Scott_(The_Office)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Michael Scott (The Office)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ensemble_cast", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Ensemble cast"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cameo_appearance", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Cameo appearance"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fictional_universe", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Fictional universe"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comedy", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Comedy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scranton,_Pennsylvania", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Scranton, Pennsylvania"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Scranton, Pennsylvania"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Howard_Klein_(television_producer)", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Howard Klein (television producer)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ricky_Gervais", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Ricky Gervais"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stephen_Merchant", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Stephen Merchant"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBCUniversal", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "NBCUniversal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Executive_producer", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Executive producer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ben_Silverman", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Ben Silverman"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leslie_David_Baker", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Leslie David Baker"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dwight_Schrute", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Dwight Schrute"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Streaming_media", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Streaming media"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spin-off_(media)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Spin-off (media)"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Television", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Television", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Television/Programs", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Television/Programs", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Office_Products/Furniture", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Office Products/Furniture", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Consumer_Goods_and_Services/Office_Products", "label": "dmoz/Business/Consumer Goods and Services/Office Products", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Software/Office_Suites", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Software/Office Suites", "wgt": 16}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 99}], "image": "https://wp.clutchpoints.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/7379079584.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9550569", "eventUri": "eng-9550569", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.2078431372549019, "wgt": 163, "relevance": 1}

Largely satirical in nature, the show provides an interesting look into the humorous and sometimes absurd ways employees cope with being stuck in the 9 - 5 office lifestyle. Meanwhile, its short episodes, clever humor, and phenomenal performances made it a particularly addictive and bingeworthy series. The Office ultimately ran for nine seasons and achieved high critical acclaim during its run.\n\nFor many viewers, it's hard to believe that The Office actually ended over a decade ago. It has remained a highly-streamed series, and its popularity has carried on to younger generations, making it seem as if the show only ended a short time ago. Given The Office's enduring legacy, many original fans of the series have been curious about whether the franchise will continue. Over the years, several spinoffs and a reboot have been proposed, but none of them ever went anywhere. However, that changed when Peacock announced it had picked up a new The Office series.\n\nThe Office itself isn't coming back, but its universe is. Those hoping for a spinoff focused on characters from The Office may be disappointed as the new series isn't quite a spinoff nor a reboot. Instead, the series will exist in the same universe as the original series but will focus on a completely new cast of characters and company. Essentially, the documentary crew that followed Dunder Mifflin's employees' daily lives decides to find another subject for a documentary. Soon, the crew settles on a \"dying historic Midwestern newspaper\" that a devoted publisher and volunteers are trying desperately to save.\n\nThe series is co-created by Daniels and Nathan For You producer Michael Koman. Peacock has confirmed that Domhall Gleeson and Sabrina Impacciatore will lead the cast. However, as of now, there's no indication any of the original The Office stars will be returning for the show. Still, given that the documentary crew is the same, one can expect there to be references to The Office, and the setting makes it possible for potential returns.\n\nIt can't be denied the setting is quite interesting, as the newspaper industry and the increasing loss of local newspapers certainly could use some commentary and viewing from a satirical lens. Although The Office itself isn't returning, the new series has the potential to stand on its own with some minor support from its tie-in to the original show.", "source": {"uri": "themarysue.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Mary Sue"}, "authors": [{"uri": "rachel_ulatowski@themarysue.com", "name": "Rachel Ulatowski", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Office_(American_TV_series)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "The Office (American TV series)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peacock_(streaming_service)", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Peacock (streaming service)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Office_(British_TV_series)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "The Office (British TV series)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dunder_Mifflin", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Dunder Mifflin"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mockumentary", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Mockumentary"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greg_Daniels", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Greg Daniels"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reboot_(fiction)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Reboot (fiction)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BBC", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "BBC"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fictional_universe", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Fictional universe"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Satire", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Satire"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Documentary_film", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Documentary film"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spin-off_(media)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Spin-off (media)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Koman", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Michael Koman"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sabrina_the_Teenage_Witch_(1996_TV_series)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Sabrina the Teenage Witch (1996 TV series)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nathan_for_You", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Nathan for You"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Television_producer", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Television producer"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Television/Programs", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Television/Programs", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Television/DVD", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Television/DVD", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Animation/Cartoons", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Animation/Cartoons", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 92}], "image": "https://www.themarysue.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Steve-Carell-Michael-Scott-The-Office.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9550569", "eventUri": "eng-9550569", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.223529411764706, "wgt": 163, "relevance": 1}

It will be a standalone series that brings together a new cast of characters in a new city and with a new purpose, even if it will technically be set in the same universe as The Office.\n\nIn terms of the official synopsis for the series, this adds: \"The documentary crew that immortalized Dunder Mifflin's Scranton branch is in search of a new subject when they discover a dying historic Midwestern newspaper and the publisher trying to revive it with volunteer reporters.\"\n\nThe cast of this new series will be led by Domhnall Gleeson (Star Wars' General Hux) and Sabrina Impacciatore (The White Lotus), but no doubt we'll be hearing who will be joining this duo very soon as production on the series is slated to begin as soon as July this year.", "source": {"uri": "gamereactor.eu", "dataType": "news", "title": "GameReactor"}, "authors": [{"uri": "ben_lyons@gamereactor.eu", "name": "Ben Lyons", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Office_(American_TV_series)", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "The Office (American TV series)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dunder_Mifflin", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Dunder Mifflin"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reboot_(fiction)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Reboot (fiction)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peacock_(streaming_service)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Peacock (streaming service)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sequel", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Sequel"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fictional_universe", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Fictional universe"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Variety_(magazine)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Variety (magazine)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_White_Lotus", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "The White Lotus"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_Hux", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "General Hux"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sabrina_Impacciatore", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Sabrina Impacciatore"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domhnall_Gleeson", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Domhnall Gleeson"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Documentary_film", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Documentary film"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Star_Wars", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Star Wars"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Midwestern_United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Midwestern United States"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scranton,_Pennsylvania", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Scranton, Pennsylvania"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Scranton, Pennsylvania"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Television/Programs", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Television/Programs", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Useless_Pages", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Useless Pages", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Pranks", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Pranks", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 98}], "image": "https://www.gamereactor.eu/media/90/officevendersandsynligvis_2309033b.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9550569", "eventUri": "eng-9550569", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.02745098039215677, "wgt": 161, "relevance": 1}

The production is set to start in July, with the series filming in a Midwestern American setting that revolves around a historic but struggling newspaper office. The premise follows the iconic documentary crew, initially famous for their coverage of Dunder Mifflin's Scranton branch, as they embark on a new journey to document the lives of the newspaper's staff attempting to revive the failing paper with the help of volunteer reporters.\n\nThe series promises to deliver a blend of old charm and new challenges. The show will introduce viewers to a diverse array of characters, each bringing unique quirks and conflicts, reminiscent of the dynamic seen at Dunder Mifflin. The setting in a newspaper office is particularly poignant, given the current struggles of print journalism, and will likely provide a rich backdrop for both humor and heartfelt moments.\n\nWhile the new series will feature a new cast, the creative legacy of The Office remains a cornerstone. Greg Daniels's involvement suggests a continuation of the show's celebrated humor and storytelling style. Although Jenna Fischer, who portrayed Pam Beesly, mentioned not being approached for the spinoff, the door seems open for potential cameo appearances by other original cast members, depending on how the series evolves.\n\nThe Office spin off is scheduled to premiere on Peacock, the series underscores NBCUniversal's commitment to leveraging its classic IPs to attract viewers to its streaming platform. With the sustained popularity of The Office on Peacock, the spinoff series is positioned as a strategic expansion that could replicate the success of the original series, tapping into a mix of nostalgia and new narrative explorations.", "source": {"uri": "devdiscourse.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Devdiscourse"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Office_(American_TV_series)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "The Office (American TV series)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mockumentary", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Mockumentary"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_White_Lotus", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "The White Lotus"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Koman", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Michael Koman"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peacock_(streaming_service)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Peacock (streaming service)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sabrina_Impacciatore", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Sabrina Impacciatore"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dunder_Mifflin", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Dunder Mifflin"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domhnall_Gleeson", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Domhnall Gleeson"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greg_Daniels", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Greg Daniels"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fictional_universe", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Fictional universe"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spin-off_(media)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Spin-off (media)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Kingdom", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Documentary_film", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Documentary film"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Midwestern_United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Midwestern United States"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scranton,_Pennsylvania", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Scranton, Pennsylvania"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Scranton, Pennsylvania"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pam_Beesly", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Pam Beesly"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cameo_appearance", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Cameo appearance"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jenna_Fischer", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Jenna Fischer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBCUniversal", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "NBCUniversal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intellectual_property", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Intellectual property"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Streaming_media", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Streaming media"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Television/Programs", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Television/Programs", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Television/DVD", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Television/DVD", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Animation/Cartoons", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Animation/Cartoons", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 96}], "image": "https://www.devdiscourse.com/remote.axd?https://devdiscourse.blob.core.windows.net/devnews/09_05_2024_13_12_17_9992166.jpg?width=920&format=jpeg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9550569", "eventUri": "eng-9550569", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.3725490196078431, "wgt": 158, "relevance": 1}

Although the series came to an end over a decade ago, it remains just as popular as ever, especially on streaming services. The series racked up some big numbers on Netflix before it departed for Peacock, with NBCUniversal paying Universal Television $100 million annually for the next five years.\n\nWhile it may prove difficult to capture that lightning in a bottle once again, I'm willing to give this new series a shot.

Well, most of the details; we still don't know what the new show will be called, nor the degree to which the forthcoming spinoff will intersect with any of the Dunder Mifflin characters we loved from the OG series.

Leaving the Scranton branch of Dunder Mifflin behind, the crew discovers a dying newspaper and its publisher in the Midwest. The paper has brought in volunteer reporters to turn things around, and I suspect the documentary crew will zero in on the individual characters to tell the story of a legacy journalism business that, honestly, sounds a lot like the regional paper and office products supplier in Scranton.\n\nHaving worked in journalism for a few small-town newspapers many years ago, I can confirm: The characters, the weirdness, the heart, and the camaraderie will definitely lend itself to the kind of show the fans of The Office want to see.

The new show will launch on NBCUniversal's streaming service, Peacock, and boast an \"ensemble\" supporting cast.\n\nThough the last episode of \"The Office\" aired in 2013, the comedy's popularity has seemingly only grown with time. That's in part thanks to Netflix, where fans streamed the show more than any other in 2020 amid the lockdowns of Covid-19, Neilsen reports. The president of NBCUniversal Entertainment, Lisa Katz, said in a statement that \"the acclaimed comedy series continues to gain popularity and build new generations of fans on Peacock.\"\n\nThroughout its nine seasons, the show earned a whopping 42 Emmy nominations and won a total of five.\n\nMany millennials and members of Gen Z, the oldest of whom would have been in grade school when the sitcom premiered in 2005, know all too well the romance between coworkers Jim Halpert and Pam Beesly, the pranks launched at their cutthroat yet clueless colleague, Dwight Shrute, and the whims of their hilariously unproductive boss, Michael Scott, whose catchphrase, \"that's what she said,\" has become a 21st-century cultural clich\u00e9. The actors still can't escape the show's famous antics: when Mr. Shrute's Rainn Wilson ordered room service during a hotel stay recently, he found his cutlery encased in jello.\n\nIn 2021, NBCUniversal brought \"The Office\" home at a cost of $100 million per year for a five-year period. When the beloved sitcom departed Netflix, many Dunder Mifflin-ites shared a meme of Mr. Scott yelling \"No! God! Please! No!\" Now, the upcoming adaptation might inspire fans to share another one of his famed lines: \"Well well well.

The show will focus on a failing Midwest newspaper, providing a potential connection to Dunder Mifflin. This could mean that original characters from The Office will make cameos in the new show.\n\nA plot description for the reboot of The Office reveals how the new show will connect to the original. The iconic nine-season sitcom, which ran on NBC for nine seasons between 2005 and 2013, is itself a reboot of the UK show of the same name, which was co-created by Stephen Merchant and star Ricky Gervais. Although many other international reboots have launched in the meantime, including an Australian version set to premiere in 2024, an American reboot in the same universe as the iconic Dunder Mifflin workers was announced to be in development in September 2023.\n\nThe Office reboot, which has been picked up to series by Peacock with production set to commence in July, has already assembled some key creatives. The show will be co-created by Nathan for You's Michael Koman and Greg Daniels, who was the original creator and showrunner of the U.S. show. The ensemble cast has also set lead stars Domhnall Gleeson and Sabrina Impacciatore. While their characters are still unknown, a recent update about the show's plot sheds major light on the setting of the upcoming comedy and how it connects with the world of Dunder Mifflin.\n\nRelated Every Failed The Office Spinoff Explained\n\nThe Office's success gave the show's creators and NBC several ideas for spinoffs, but none ever came to fruition - here's every failed attempt.\n\nThe Office's Documentary Crew Is Searching For A New Subject\n\nThe Crew Was Mostly Unseen Throughout The Run Of The Office\n\nA new report from Variety reveals a plot description that showcases how the show will expand the universe after 201 The Office episodes, though not without potentially setting up a future crossover. The show will follow the in-universe documentary crew who have been searching for new subject matter after filming the exploits of the Dunder Mifflin staff for many years. However, it has not been revealed how often, if at all, the crew members themselves will appear on camera throughout the new show.\n\nThe documentary crew of The Office was a consistent behind-the-scenes presence throughout the run of the mockumentary show, though almost nothing is known about them. It wasn't until the ninth and final season of the show that any member of the crew was revealed, which occurred during a moment when the boom mic operator Brian (Chris Diamantopoulos) comforted Pam (Jenna Fischer) after a particularly emotional fight with her husband Jim (John Krasinski). Beyond that controversial storyline, which implied that the office staff had a longstanding but offscreen relationship with the crew, the documentarians themselves remain a mystery.\n\nThe Office season 9 also featured the characters reacting to the initial airing of the documentary.\n\nThe Office Reboot's Newspaper Setting Can Tie Into Dunder Mifflin\n\nThe Show Will Follow A Newspaper In The Same Universe As The Office\n\nThe plot description reveals that the documentarians find a viable new subject in the form of a failing Midwest newspaper. Because of this, it seems that this new show will be less of a reboot of The Office and more of a standalone spinoff like the original plan for Parks and Recreation. While the latter long-running mockumentary ended up cutting all ties to the other show before going to air (which explains Office alum Rashida Jones appearing in the show as an entirely different character), the Peacock reboot still exists in the same universe and seems ripe for a crossover.\n\nIt is possible that there could be new or previously unseen branches of the company...\n\nIt seems natural for a newspaper and a paper company to have some type of contact, which could provide an avenue for Dunder Mifflin to be featured in the new show. While the branches of Dunder Mifflin are typically shown to be in the Northeastern states of Pennsylvania and New York, the original show already introduced a branch in Akron, Ohio. Because of this extension of their overall territory, it is possible that there could be new or previously unseen branches of the company that are located in the Midwest and could easily service the as-yet unnamed newspaper.\n\nWill Any The Office Characters Appear In The New Show?\n\nSeveral Original The Office Characters Still Work At Dunder Mifflin\n\nClose\n\nSo far, beyond Gleeson and Impacciatore, no cast members for the reboot show have been officially announced. However, this connection means that there is an opportunity for original The Office characters to return in some capacity. It seems most likely that these characters would be those who remained at Dunder Mifflin following the finale, though the others' lives may have changed considerably in the intervening decade, leading some to return. The key characters who were still on the company's payroll at that time included Dwight (Rainn Wilson), Angela (Angela Kinsey), Erin (Ellie Kemper), Pete (Jake Lacy), and Phyllis (Phyllis Smith).\n\nPete joined the show in season 9 alongside Clark (Clark Duke), who also still worked at Dunder Mifflin as of the finale.\n\nWhile this provides an in-universe opportunity for these characters to return, some of the actors may be too busy to make appearances including Lacy, who recently starred in the miniseries Apples Never Fall. However, The Office cast members Fischer, Wilson, Craig Robinson (Darryl), Brian Baumgartner (Kevin), Kate Flannery (Meredith), and Creed Bratton (Creed) recently reunited for an AT&T commercial, proving their willingness to honor the legacy of the show in some capacity. This could indicate that they may say yes to making cameo appearances in the new show, even if their characters left Dunder Mifflin behind.\n\nSource: Variety\n\nThe Office Where to Watch\n\n*Availability in US\n\nstream rent buy\n\nNot available\n\nNot available\n\nNot available\n\nThe Office is the U.S. remake of the British comedy mockumentary series of the same name.

More information | Send your opinion\n\nMore than ten years ago, the finale of the NBC series \"The Office\" hit our screens. Now a new edition is planned. Filming is scheduled to begin in the summer.\n\nIn the United States of America there is a new version of the hit series \"The Office\". As reported by Variety, a magazine specializing in this field, the new version was commissioned by the streaming service NBC Peacock. According to the article, this is not a classic reboot or spin-off, but a new mockumentary series with a completely new cast, which, however, is set in the same universe as the original series. Work on the new version has been underway since the end of 2024.\n\nAccording to an official statement obtained by Variety, the new series revolves around \"a historic, dying newspaper in the Midwest\" whose publisher is trying to save his product with a documentary film team. Filming is scheduled to begin next July, and Irish actor Domhnall Gleeson and his Italian colleague Sabrina Impacciatore are being talked about as main actors.\n\nA statement issued by the NBC broadcaster said that the series aims to build a new generation of fans of this format. Greg Daniels, former \"The Office\" director, will develop the new series and serve as executive producer with Michael Koman. Popular comedian Ricky Gervais and Stephen Merchant, who created the British original, are also on board.\n\nThe previous series, The Office, ran on NBC from 2005 to 2013 and starred Steve Carell as the lead actor. There, a fictional film crew accompanied the employees of the struggling Dunder Mifflin paper mill. The original British series The Office ran on the BBC from 2001 to 2003 and featured Ricky Gervais as the eccentric head of a sidewalk wholesale company. In Germany, the comedy series \"Stromberg\" with Christoph Maria Herbst is based on the same idea, but its events take place in the context of an insurance company.", "source": {"uri":

The nine-season comedy remains a pop culture staple, which is why many have long been asking for a revival of sorts. Well, while fans likely won't be returning to the Dunder Mifflin Paper Company in Scranton, they will get to jump back into the fictional universe. Creator Greg Daniels alongside Michael Korman is creating a new Office show set within the same continuity. Now, said project has landed a home, and the first official plot details have been revealed. And, thanks to what we now know, I'm very pumped to see this series!\n\nPer an official press release, it was revealed that the yet-to-be-titled project has been given a series order at Peacock. The release confirmed previous reports that actors Domhnall Gleeson and Sabrina Impacciatore had been cast in the production. What's most intriguing to me, though, is the brief synopsis that was provided. This new show will apparently see the same documentary crew that filmed Dunder Mifflin looking for its next subjects. They eventually land on a struggling Midwestern newspaper. It's there that the historic publication's publisher is looking to boost the outlet using volunteer contributors.\n\nThis premise absolutely tracks with what's been said about the new Office series up to this point. Greg Daniels previously explained that this offshoot would focus on a new workplace with a new crew of characters as opposed to a brand-new group at DM. Such a creative decision is smart, as it should allow the production to stand on its own a bit more, even if it takes place in the same continuity as its predecessor. That should be helpful when it comes to world-building as well.\n\nI'm just going to go ahead and say that I love this idea so much. Obviously, it strikes a chord with me, in part, because I work for a news outlet and have an understanding of this comedy's backdrop. The journalism industry is in a rough spot right now, and many publications - especially smaller, local outlets - are hurting and folding up in some cases. So that instantly makes this a timely piece of work. I'm curious to see how the writers and producers of this series manage to counterbalance that somewhat bleak professional outlook with the humor.\n\nAlso, what really makes me high on this concept is the plethora of news-based shenanigans that could occur on the show. Working at a paper company is one thing, but delivering the news to a community is something else entirely. I imagine that many of the characters will make bad choices and, as was the case with the OG show, job competency will vary by person. And I wouldn't be surprised at all if pranks occur in this new office.\n\nBecause the show will be on the streamer, Greg Daniels and co. should have a lot of creative freedom. It may be early days, but I'm confident that this could be a delightful romp that entertains the masses like its parent show. One can also be hopeful given that Daniels added Michael Korman, who is famous for co-creating critically acclaimed comedy Nathan For You. On top of that, Domhnall Gleeson and Sabrina Impacciatore are talented stars, and I'm eager to learn about their roles.\n\nNow that the show has been ordered to series, it's likely that further details, specifically cast-related updates, should arrive in the coming months.

The reboot connects to the original show through the documentary crew, but with a different storyline focusing on a new location. The Office reboot may give more focus to the documentary team, providing a fresh perspective on the beloved series. SCREENRANT VIDEO OF THE DAY SCROLL TO CONTINUE WITH CONTENT\n\nA new series set in The Office universe is now in the works, and while the reboot is exciting for fans, it is going to lose one of the show's biggest mysteries. Despite the U.S. remake of The Office being a sitcom, the show has a surprising amount of lore, with the show hiding some dark secrets. Fans of the show know that one of these dark story beats is the reason that the show exists at all, and due to how essential it is to the series, it seems strange that The Office reboot is forgetting about it.\n\nThe Office is one of the most beloved sitcoms of all time, with it following iconic characters like Michael, Jim, and Pam as they work at the Dunder Mifflin paper company in Scranton, Pennsylvania. Throughout The Office's nine seasons, all kinds of stories surrounding Dunder Mifflin are told, with the show's mockumentary format creating some unique narratives. This format is what defined the humor of The Office, with plenty of successor shows like Parks and Recreation, What We Do in the Shadows, and Abbot Elementary lifting this idea for their own use.\n\nThe Original The Office Documentary Crew Was Filming Dunder Mifflin For A Dark Reason Close\n\nThe Office is a mockumentary, with the in-universe reason for the format being one of the most interesting mysteries of the show. Throughout The Office, a real in-universe documentary crew is following the employees of Dunder Mifflin around, with each episode of the show being made up of recordings and interviews shot by the documentary crew. However, many fans have thought that it is off for a documentary crew to be so invested in the lives of employees of a random paper company. However, The Office has already addressed this.\n\nAs it turns out, there is a dark reason that Dunder Mifflin is being filmed in The Office. As is alluded to in the show, a former employee of Dunder Mifflin took their own life in the years before The Office timeline, with this attracting the attention of the documentary crew. The filmmakers decided to start filming at the Dunder Mifflin Scranton branch in order to make a documentary about how the employees are coping with the loss of their coworker, with this being the incredibly dark in-universe justification for the documentary crew's presence.\n\nRelated The Office Reboot's Connection To The Original Show Makes A Crossover Way More Likely\n\nDetails from the new plot description of Peacock's upcoming reboot of The Office clarify how the show will connect with the iconic original comedy.\n\nThe Office Reboot Features The Same Documentary Crew (But For A Completely Different Reason) Close\n\nSome details regarding The Office reboot have been revealed, hinting at a major connection to the original show. While The Office reboot series will follow different characters at a different paper company, the in-universe documentary crew is meant to be the same people across both shows. While this is a fun way to justify another TV show set in The Office universe, the reasoning for this new storyline is completely different, ridding itself of the dark mystery from the original TV show.\n\nThis time, the documentary crew will find a Midwestern newspaper company that is struggling to survive with the times, with the series following the employees at this location. It seems that the in-universe documentary crew is trying to focus their documentary around this struggling business rather than around the fallout of a suicide, as was the case with the original The Office TV show. While it isn't a bad thing to change this throwaway explanation, it does mean that the reboot series is losing a unique aspect of the original The Office's story justification.\n\nWill The Office Reboot Give The Documentary Crew More Focus? Close\n\nAlthough details on The Office reboot are still slim, it seems that the series may be setting up a story in which the documentary crew gets more focus, highlighting this important aspect of the original series. Although the documentary crew in The Office has a greater role in the later seasons, their impact on the show is minimal at the beginning, with the documentary mostly being used as a framing device.\n\nRelated The Office: 15 Stars Who Auditioned But Weren't Cast\n\nThe cast of the hit mockumentary series The Office is iconic, but these other actors could have gotten their start on the show after auditioning.\n\nHowever, the synopsis for The Office reboot series seems to put more emphasis on the documentary team, meaning that their journey to find a new documentary subject could be highlighted early in the show. After all, these seem to be the only returning characters from the original The Office TV show. While this story would stray away from the spirit of the original series, it would be a fun way to provide a fresh new perspective on the world of The Office.\n\nThe Office ComedyDramaSitcom Where to Watch\n\n*Availability in US\n\nstreamrentbuy\n\nNot available\n\nNot available\n\nNot available\n\nThe Office is the U.S. remake of the British comedy mockumentary series of the same name.

The story will be told by the same fictional documentary team from the U.S. version of the \"The Office,\" an Emmy-winning series about a group of Dunder Mifflin paper company employees that concluded its ninth and final season in 2013.\n\nThe new show will star Domhnall Gleeson (\"Ex-Machina\") and Sabrina Impacciatore (\"The White Lotus\"). It will be produced by \"Nathan for You\" co-creator Michael Koman and Greg Daniels, who adapted the original British version of the \"The Office\" for American audiences.\n\nNewsrooms, ahem, have been featured in television shows and movies to varying degrees of success. The '90s comedy series \"NewsRadio,\" set at an eccentric radio station in New York, ran for five seasons and starred Dave Foley, Andy Dick and Joe Rogan (yes, Joe Rogan). David Spade starred as a quirky publisher's assistant Dennis Finch at a high-profile magazine office in \"Just Shoot Me, \" which aired 145 episodes from 1997 to 2003. Meanwhile, the super serious Aaron Sorkin drama \"The Newsroom\" ran for three seasons and is mostly remembered for the \"America is not the greatest country in the world\" monologue, which actor Jeff Daniels says saved his career.\n\nMore recently, ABC's \"Not Dead Yet,\" a sitcom about a woman who starts writing obituaries for her local newspaper, is holding down the fort for journalism shows in the current, terrible, economic environment.\n\n\"The Office\" was a cultural juggernaut during its nine-season run, helping launch the careers of John Krasinski, Ed Helms, Jenna Fischer and Mindy Kaling. The show's mockumentary style became its own mini-genre, echoed in hits like \"Parks and Recreation,\" the Emmy-winning powerhouse \"Modern Family\" and \"What We Do in the Shadows,\" which is like \"The Office\" with vampires.\n\nAfter an \"Office\" revival's existence was reported last year, The Washington Post asked modern-day office workers what they'd expect to see in it. They imagined a Michael Scott-style boss sending gaffes and jokes through Microsoft Teams while Dwight Schrute monitored everyone's keystrokes. No one guessed \"newspaper.\"\n\nSo, can we look forward to journalism-version of Jim falling in love with journalism-version of Pam as they work late trying to cut 1,000 words from an overlong draft? Will some Ryan Howard-esque hotshot show up and TikTok all the news? Can a show about depressed (we assume) reporters possibly follow up the TV magic of \"The Office?\"\n\nHere in this actual newsroom, we can only wait and watch.", "source": {"uri": "seattletimes.com",

Could this newspaper be covering stories in a town like Cedar Rapids or Waterloo or even Dubuque?\n\nHypothetically, let's assume the creators are shooting for a similar city to Scranton, Pennsylvania.\n\nThe population of Scranton is about 76,000 according to the United States Census.\n\nThe city of Cedar Rapids has a population of about 137,000 people according to reports. This is well over TWICE the population of the Electric City.\n\nA city in the Hawkeye State that is slightly more similar in size is Waterloo! The home of Iowa Irish Fest has a population of about 67,000.\n\nIs it possible that we might be seeing characters get some after work drinks at SingleSpeed or grab lunch at Jameson's?\n\nWaterloo could be a good contender for the new spinoff.\n\nThere aren't too many details that have been made public about the show.\n\nOfficials confirmed that production on the spinoff series will begin sometime in July.\n\nIn addition, the two leads of the show have already been cast. Domhnall Gleeson and Sabrina Impacciatore are set to lead the show's ensemble.\n\nKey players from the original series are set to be returning. Most of these individuals are from BEHIND the screen.\n\nGreg Daniels developed the beloved NBC series for American television. He along with Michael Koman are co-creators of this new show and will act as the executive producers.\n\nEven some of the creators of the original British version of the show will be back!\n\nRicky Gervais and Stephen Merchant created this version and will be returning to 'The Office' universe as executive producers, according to reports.\n\nThere is no set date that fans should expect to see this new series on their tv screens.\n\nWe will keep you updated on the release date when it is made available to the public.\n\nStay up to date with everything going on in Eastern Iowa by downloading the free station app from your app store.

Carell was practically the most well-known cast member at the time of the show's debut, but when popularity soared, so did the status of the actors within the ensemble cast that included Krasinski, Rainn Wilson, Jenna Fischer, Mindy Kaling and eventually Ed Helms and Ellie Kemper.", "source": {"uri": "star-telegram.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Fort Worth Star-Telegram"}, "authors": [{"uri": "dominic_genetti@star-telegram.com", "name": "Dominic Genetti", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peacock_(streaming_service)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Peacock (streaming service)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Office_(American_TV_series)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "The Office (American TV series)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sabrina_Impacciatore", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Sabrina Impacciatore"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domhnall_Gleeson", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Domhnall Gleeson"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBC", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "NBC"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reality_television", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Reality television"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mobile_app", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Mobile app"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Texas", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Texas"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Texas"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Koman", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Michael Koman"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greg_Daniels", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Greg Daniels"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Documentary_film", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Documentary film"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Film_producer", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Film producer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Midwestern_United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Midwestern United States"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scranton,_Pennsylvania", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Scranton, Pennsylvania"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Scranton, Pennsylvania"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Voice_(American_TV_series)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "The Voice (American TV series)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advertisement_film", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Advertisement film"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rainn_Wilson", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Rainn Wilson"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Krasinski", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "John Krasinski"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ellie_Kemper", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Ellie Kemper"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ed_Helms", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Ed Helms"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ensemble_cast", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Ensemble cast"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ricky_Gervais", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Ricky Gervais"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stephen_Merchant", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Stephen Merchant"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jenna_Fischer", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Jenna Fischer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mindy_Kaling", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Mindy Kaling"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steve_Carell", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Steve Carell"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Television", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Television", "wgt": 21}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Television/Programs", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Television/Programs", "wgt": 20}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Performing_Arts/Acting", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Performing Arts/Acting", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Equestrian/Shows", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Equestrian/Shows", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Autos/Events_and_Shows", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Autos/Events and Shows", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://www.star-telegram.com/wps/build/images/star-telegram/facebook.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9550569", "eventUri": "eng-9550569", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-05-09", "textStart": 76, "textEnd": 81}], "sentiment": 0.05098039215686279, "wgt": 129, "relevance": 1}

I literally know nothing about it,\" he said. \"But I love the idea that they're trying to do an Office spinoff not in Dunder Mifflin, not with the same characters but a documentary crew following a different workplace. That's a great concept.\"\n\nEven though Schrute lives in PA on his beet farm, Wilson says that he is open to returning as the weird paper salesman if it makes sense. \"Sure, if Dwight Schrute shows up at a newspaper in the Midwest then I'm there,\" he added.\n\nHey... magazines need paper, so it is not that weird to imagine the #1 salesman taking a quick little business trip out to there.

Daniels' follow-up is still in its early stages, but fans are already wondering if he can do it again.\n\nThe spinoff, announced Wednesday, will reportedly introduce an all-new cast and take viewers far away from their favorite regional manager, Michael Scott, and the Dunder Mifflin Paper Company. According to an official log line, however, one key aspect will remain the same.\n\n\"The documentary crew that immortalized Dunder Mifflin's Scranton branch is in search of a new subject when they discover a dying historic Midwestern newspaper and the publisher trying to revive it with volunteer reporters,\" the synopsis reads, per Variety. (It's a premise that maybe reflects life in the 2020s a little too well, given all the challenges facing legacy news outlets and digital publications alike.)\n\nThe U.S. \"Office\" chronicled the daily mundanities of life at a struggling paper company in Pennsylvania, as well the interpersonal and romantic relationships that emerged under the leadership of Michael Scott (Carell), the bumbling but (usually) endearing boss.\n\nThe show spanned nine seasons and concluded in 2013 with 42 Primetime Emmy nominations and five wins under its belt. Shows like \"Parks and Recreation\" and \"Modern Family\" followed in its mockumentary footsteps, which were laid out by the original U.K. version, starring and co-created by Ricky Gervais. (The U.K. show also starred Lucy Davis, Martin Freeman, Mackenzie Crook, Ralph Ineson and scene-stealer Ewen MacIntosh, who died earlier this year.)\n\nFans of the original BBC series -- which aired from 2001 to 2002, with a handful of special follow-up installments -- were wary when NBC announced its U.S. version. However, the adaptation, as led by Carell, gained a devoted following and proved its longevity, eventually breaking streaming records with 57.1 billion minutes of viewership in 2020.\n\nSome users on X, the platform formerly known as Twitter, are nonetheless skeptical about the new, as-yet untitled spinoff.\n\n\"Sounds to me like Greg Daniels' production company had a pitch for a new sitcom set at a newspaper and were told 'we'll green light this show if it's called The Office,'\" one person wrote.", "source": {"uri": "yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo"}, "authors": [],

Now, could it happen? Sure. Details are being closely guarded, but the expectation is it will be a completely new cast.\n\nNot bringing back any original members is a bold move. Peacock and the writers are asking viewers to get attached to new characters and actors in the same way we were all attached to the crew at Dunder Mifflin. Good look striking gold twice.\n\nMaybe the series will come out and shock us all. Maybe it will be incredible. It's possible, but for now, people seem very pessimistic about the Peacock series.

Sleeper hit Lopez vs. Lopez was renewed for a third season thanks to strong ratings, and the network also gave a series order to a Reba McEntire-led pilot, which will reunite the team that produced the singer's long-running titular WB/CW show. The new multi-cam comedy is set in the culinary world and will debut during the 2024-2025 broadcast season -- along with the new season of Lopez vs. Lopez.\n\nComedy is also alive and well on the timeline.

Ideas are scarce in Hollywood. In September, for example, we had reported that The Office, as rumored in the industry, would have a reboot. With Greg Daniels on board, who knew how to adapt the British comedy by Ricky Gervais with the same name but giving it his own personality, he had to follow the project closely. But, now that new details of the project are known, it directly deserves the attention of fans of the Dunder Mifflin offices.\n\nDaniels, with the help of Michael Koman (How to with John Wilson) as co-creator, has found an unexpected creative angle. The still unnamed series will focus on the team of documentary filmmakers who recorded Michael Scott and the rest of the characters in The Office, whose lives are absolutely gray. After immortalizing them, as indicated by TVLine, they are looking for new subjects to portray. They focus on the workers of a decadent newspaper in inner America.\n\nWith this starting point, this spin-off, reboot or simply series \"set in the same universe\" of The Office aims to turn the tables: not only reuse the condition of (false) documentary of the original series to integrate the documentarians within the plots and jokes, in a direct way.\n\nThe two leading actors have already been hired: the Irish Domhnall Gleeson, known for his work in Ex Machina, Harry Potter, A Matter of Time or the series The Patient, and the Italian Sabrina Impacciatore, who was nominated for an Emmy as director of the Sicilian hotel. by The white lotus. In July they begin filming the first season.\n\nThe Office is one of those properties that studios look at with nostalgia, just like Friends or The Big Bang Theory. It is a title that gave great results in its original broadcast on television and that has never completely died. Its memes are always recovered, it is part of the cultural imagination and in streaming it does not stop being seen over and over again, even being recovered by new generations.\n\nIt is normal that Universal, since the American version said goodbye in 2013, has thought and looked for a way to recover the series. However, the last stage of The Office, where Steve Carell did not lead the cast, was a good warning: it was not a comedy that worked by default and the public was not going to buy any derivative project that was offered.\n\nWith a decade in between and a totally new starting point, without the participation of veterans from the original cast being expected, we will have to see if The Office lovers are interested. The project has been commissioned by Peacock, the Universal platform that does not operate as such in Spain, although Universal does have a joint venture in streaming with Paramount, SkyShowtime.", "source": {"uri": "usanews.net", "dataType": "news", "title": "USANews Press Release Network"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Office_(American_TV_series)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "The Office (American TV series)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greg_Daniels", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Greg Daniels"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reboot_(fiction)", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Reboot (fiction)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hollywood,_Los_Angeles", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Hollywood, Los Angeles"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Koman", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Michael Koman"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dunder_Mifflin", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Dunder Mifflin"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ricky_Gervais", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Ricky Gervais"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Documentary_film", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Documentary film"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comedy", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Comedy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Kingdom", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sabrina_Impacciatore", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Sabrina Impacciatore"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domhnall_Gleeson", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Domhnall Gleeson"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Scott_(The_Office)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Michael Scott (The Office)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TVLine", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "TVLine"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fictional_universe", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Fictional universe"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Italian_language", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Italian language"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spin-off_(media)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Spin-off (media)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harry_Potter", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Harry Potter"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ireland", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Ireland"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Ireland"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emmy_Awards", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Emmy Awards"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peacock_(streaming_service)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Peacock (streaming service)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/What_If...?_(TV_series)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "What If...?

According to Peacock, which has commissioned the show, the new show will take place in the same universe as The Office and retain the mockumentary format, but it'll tell a new story with a new cast.\n\nThis time around the show will take place not in a paper company but in a dying newspaper in the Midwest, where the publisher is attempting to revive it with a crew of volunteer reporters. According to NBC Universal Entertainment president Lisa Katz (via Hollywood Reporter), \"this new series set in the universe of Dunder Mifflin introduces a new cast of characters in a fresh setting ripe for comedic storytelling\".\n\nThe US version of The Office was already not the original: initially based on the UK sitcom of the same name, it soon became its own - and arguably better - show as it left its UK parent behind. Where the UK version only ran for 12 episodes and a holiday special, the US version racked up 201 episodes - although it didn't maintain the quality throughout, and the final seasons weren't up there with the better, earlier ones. There's some debate as to whether the show started to decline after season four or if it wasn't until Steve Carell left after eight seasons, but the quality had definitely dropped by the final episodes. So starting in a new place with new characters seems like a wise move.\n\nAs a fan of the show, I'm hopeful about a new season, but I'm also very aware that in the 23 years since the first UK Office episode aired and the decade since the US Office closed, the mockumentary format has been done to death - sometimes well, as in What We Do in the Shadows, but often less effectively or hilariously.\n\nThe Ringer was describing the rise and fall of the mockumentary sitcom back in 2020, arguing that the format was \"built on a technological stopgap: portable, budget-friendly equipment that democratized filming - though not nearly as much as smartphones and social media eventually would. The intentionally janky look of the American Office, once jarring in the appearance-conscious context of broadcast TV, no longer squares with a time when TikTok has taught a generation of teens the fundamentals of editing and post-production.\" What was once unusual and innovative feels rather tired today because we've seen it so many times.\n\nThat said, what made the US show so good wasn't the format but the writing, particularly around Steve Carell's needy Michael Scott, Rainn Wilson's Dwight Schrute, John Krasinski's Jim Halpert and Jenna Fischer's Pam Beesly. Here's hoping the new show introduces us to similarly compelling characters.", "source": {"uri": "techradar.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "TechRadar"}, "authors": [{"uri": "carrie_marshall@techradar.com", "name": "Carrie Marshall", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peacock_(streaming_service)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Peacock (streaming service)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Office_(American_TV_series)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "The Office (American TV series)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mockumentary", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Mockumentary"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fictional_universe", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Fictional universe"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Kingdom", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBCUniversal", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "NBCUniversal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Streaming_media", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Streaming media"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spin-off_(media)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Spin-off (media)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBC", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "NBC"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comedy", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Comedy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hollywood,_Los_Angeles", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Hollywood, Los Angeles"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dunder_Mifflin", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Dunder Mifflin"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sitcom", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Sitcom"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/What_We_Do_in_the_Shadows_(TV_series)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "What We Do in the Shadows (TV series)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TikTok", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "TikTok"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pam_Beesly", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Pam Beesly"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jim_Halpert", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Jim Halpert"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rainn_Wilson", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Rainn Wilson"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dwight_Schrute", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Dwight Schrute"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Krasinski", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "John Krasinski"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Scott_(The_Office)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Michael Scott (The Office)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Post-production", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Post-production"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jenna_Fischer", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Jenna Fischer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steve_Carell", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Steve Carell"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_media", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Social media"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Ringer_(website)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "The Ringer (website)"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Television", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Television", "wgt": 26}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Television/Programs", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Television/Programs", "wgt": 26}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Performing_Arts/Hypnotism", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Performing Arts/Hypnotism", "wgt": 18}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Equestrian/Shows", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Equestrian/Shows", "wgt": 19}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Autos/Events_and_Shows", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Autos/Events and Shows", "wgt": 20}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 95}], "image": "https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/pwNHjrXRDvKcHqLQwd9D5N-1200-80.png", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9550569", "eventUri": "eng-9550569", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.2313725490196079, "wgt": 110, "relevance": 1}

One civilian mariner remains missing following the attack, Singh said.\n\nOn June 14, the guided-missile cruiser USS Philippine Sea responded to distress calls from the Tutor. Aircraft from the cruiser and partner forces helped evacuate all personnel from the vessel. This operation took place in the Red Sea and within range of Houthi weapons, making it a risky and complex operation, she said.\n\nIranian, Russian and Chinese naval vessels were among the ships within response distance that did nothing to assist the Tutor, Singh noted.\n\nThe Tutor remains in the Red Sea and is slowly taking on water while awaiting recovery by salvage vessels, she added.\n\nThe June 13 attack on the Verbena resulted in fires onboard. One civilian mariner was medically evacuated by aircraft from the Philippine Sea to a partner nation's ship for medical treatment, she said.\n\nOn June 15, the crew of the Verbena issued a distress call, but was forced to abandon ship. They were then rescued by the M/V Anna Meta, which was in the vicinity. At the time, an Iranian frigate was 8 nautical miles away from the Verbena and did not respond to the distress call, Singh said.\n\nThe Verbena is no longer on fire and is being towed toward a nearby port, she added.\n\nSince Nov. 19, the Houthis have launched about 190 attacks. Only a handful have been successful, which speaks to the effectiveness of coalition forces at stopping the attacks, she said.\n\nAlso on June 14, U.S. Central Command removed the temporary pier from the Gaza shoreline, due to heavy seas; it was towed back to Ashdod, Israel. The pier will most likely be re-anchored later this week in Gaza when the sea state subsides, Singh said.\n\nThe U.S. is working with the international community to get aid into Gaza as quickly as possible. Since the pier was anchored on May 17, over 3,500 metric tons of aid have been delivered to Gaza by humanitarian organizations, she said.", "source": {"uri": "defense.gov", "dataType": "news",

Image by ronib1979 via iStock\n\nIn its latest Maritime Security Threat Advisory (MSTA), which was released this week, Dryad Global highlighted that two vessels were recently hit in the Red Sea region - the M/V Tutor and the M/V Verbena.\n\n\"On 12 June 2024, the Liberian-flagged, Greek-owned bulk cargo carrier M/V Tutor was struck in the Southern Red Sea,\" Dryad noted in the MSTA.\n\n\"After being targeted by an unmanned surface boat, drones, and ballistic missiles, the coal carrier was severely damaged. The attack resulted in severe flooding and damage to the engine room, marking the Houthis' first successful use of a boat as a weapon,\" it added.\n\n\"The crew abandoned the ship and were rescued by coalition forces. The vessel has been abandoned and is drifting in the vicinity of the last reported position. The Tutor was loaded at the port of Ust-Luga, Russia, and discharged at Port Said, Egypt on 09 June 2024. The next scheduled stop was Aqaba, Jordan en route to India,\" it continued.\n\nDryad also noted that, on June 13, the \"Palauan-flagged, Ukrainian-owned, Polish-operated vessel M/V Verbena was struck by two cruise missiles, resulting in damage and fires on board, with one civilian mariner seriously injured\".\n\n\"The injured sailor was airlifted to another ship to receive medical attention. Crew members were battling the fires for two days but were unsuccessful,\" it added.\n\n\"On 15 June 2024, the merchant vessel's crew evacuated the ship. The unlit ship is now drifting 30 nautical miles northeast of Djibouti, still on fire and sinking,\" Dryad said.\n\nIn the MSTA, Dryad outlined that a U.S.-led effort has failed to deter the Houthi's targeting of ships and warned that the threat is expected to persist.\n\n\"Ship traffic through the strait has dropped by 67 percent and tanker traffic by about 50 percent,\" Dryad said in the MSTA.\n\n\"Since the attacks began in November 2023, the U.S. Navy has spent approximately $1 billion on munitions to defend the Red Sea, conducting over 450 strikes and intercepting more than 200 drones and missiles,\" it added.\n\n\"U.S. officials are concerned that the conflict will be unsustainable for the defense industrial base, which is already overburdened with demands for weapons from Ukraine and Israel,\" it continued.\n\n\"The Houthi supply of weapons from Iran is cheap and sustainable, whereas the coalition's supply chains are constrained, and logistics tails are long and costly,\" it went on to state.\n\nDryad noted in the report that coalition forces are \"engaged in whack-a-mole, whereas the Houthis are taking the long game\".\n\nIn a statement posted on its X page on June 15, U.S. Central Command said \"Iranian-backed Houthis struck M/V Tutor ... with an uncrewed surface vessel (USV) resulting in severe flooding and damage to the engine room\".\n\n\"One civilian mariner remains missing following the attack. The crew abandoned ship and were rescued by USS Philippine Sea (CG 58) and partner forces. M/V Tutor remains in the Red Sea and is slowly taking on water,\" Centcom added.\n\nAlso in that statement, Centcom said Houthis struck M/V Verbena in two separate missile attacks, \"resulting in fires on board\".\n\n\"One civilian mariner was medically evacuated due to severe injuries,\" Centcom noted in that statement.\n\n\"The crew of M/V Verbena extinguished the fire and have resumed their transit in the Gulf of Aden. This continued malign and reckless behavior by the Iranian-backed Houthis threatens regional stability and endangers the lives of mariners across the Red Sea and Gulf of Aden,\" it added.\n\n\"The Houthis claim to be acting on behalf of Palestinians in Gaza and yet they are targeting and threatening the lives of third country nationals who have nothing to do with the conflict in Gaza. The ongoing threat to international commerce caused by the Houthis in fact makes it harder to deliver badly needed assistance to the people of Yemen as well as Gaza,\" it continued.\n\n\"The United States will continue to act with partners to hold the Houthis accountable and degrade their military capabilities. Centcom will continue to act with partners to hold the Houthis accountable and degrade their military capabilities,\" Centcom went on to state.\n\nIn an update posted on its X page on the same day, Centcom said the M/V Verbena crew issued a distress call indicating they were abandoning the ship.\n\n\"M/V Anna Meta responded to render assistance. Anna Meta has recovered the mariners and is transporting them to safety,\" Centcom noted in that statement.\n\n\"The crew abandoned ship due to continued fires and an inability to control them,\" it added.\n\nThe Red Sea, with its connection to the Suez Canal, is one of the world's busiest shipping lanes, Dryad notes on its website, adding that it's an \"essential channel, crucial to maintaining many countries' political and economic stability\".\n\n\"The Red Sea is of huge strategic importance lying between the continents of Asia and Africa, separating the Middle East and the Far East as well as Europe and Asia,\" the company states on its site.\n\n\"The geopolitical position of the Red Sea is important because it's a natural border between the eastern coast of Africa and the western coast of the Arabian Peninsula and a vital route for the unarmed transportation of oil through the Bab el-Mandeb in the south to the Suez Canal in the North,\" it adds.\n\n\"As long as oil remains a primary source of energy for the world, this shipping lane will remain a vital channel for its transport from the Gulf,\" it continues.", "source": {"uri": "rigzone.com", "dataType": "news", "title":

A crew member aboard the ship is believed to have been killed, officials said.\n\n\"This is an unacceptable situation, and these attacks must stop now. We call on states with influence in the region to safeguard our innocent seafarers and for the swift de-escalation of the situation in the Red Sea,\" read the statement released Wednesday by the International Association of Dry Cargo Shipowners, the International Association of Independent Tanker Owners, the World Shipping Council, the International Chamber of Shipping, and several other maritime organizations.\n\nIn March, the Houthis attacked the M/V Rubymar, a Belize-flagged cargo ship carrying fertilizer. It sank in the Red Sea after taking on water for days after the strike.\n\n\"We have heard the condemnation and appreciate the words of support, but we urgently seek action to stop the unlawful attacks on these vital workers and this vital industry,\" the commercial shipping organizations said in their statement.\n\nThe Houthis claim their targets are vessels bound for Israeli ports or those owned or operated by Israeli companies. They later expanded their target list to include U.S. and British commercial ships. The Houthis began their attacks in the vital maritime trade corridor after Israel launched its war in the Gaza Strip against Hamas, which perpetrated an Oct. 7 attack on Israel that killed more than 1,200 people.\n\nThe Houthis fired missiles at another ship, the M/V Verbena, a day after the Tutor was attacked. The crew of the Ukrainian-owned and Polish-operated bulk cargo carrier was forced to abandon the vessel after they were unable to control fires on board. At least one crew member was seriously injured in the incident, officials said.\n\n\"It is deplorable that innocent seafarers are being attacked while simply performing their jobs, vital jobs which keep the world war, fed, and clothed,\" the shipping industry statement said.\n\nThe Houthis have launched dozens of strikes, mostly using missiles and drones, that are believed to have killed four merchant sailors. At least 15% of the world's maritime trade passes through the Red Sea corridor. The U.S. Defense Intelligence Agency said vessel traffic in the region has declined by 90% since the attacks began.\n\nThe maritime attacks by the Houthi rebels appear to be escalating even as the U.S. maintains a robust naval presence in the Red Sea. The Navy launched Operation Prosperity Guardian in response to the Houthi-led attacks on commercial ships.\n\n\"This continued malign and reckless behavior by the Iranian-backed Houthis threatens regional stability and endangers the lives of mariners across the Red Sea,\" U.S. Central Command said in a statement. \"The Houthis claim to be acting on behalf of Palestinians in Gaza and yet they

It was the second ship sunk in the rebels' campaign targeting Red Sea shipping.\n\nThe sinking of the Tutor marks what appears to be a new escalation by the Iranian-backed Houthis in their campaign of attacks on ships in the vital maritime corridor over the Israel-Hamas war in the Gaza Strip.\n\nThe attack comes despite a monthslong U.S.-led campaign in the region that has seen the Navy face its most-intense maritime fighting since World War II, with near-daily attacks targeting commercial vessels and warship.\n\nThe Liberian-flagged, Greek-owned-and-operated Tutor sank in the Red Sea, the British military's United Kingdom Maritime Trade Operations center said in a warning to sailors in the region.\n\n\"Military authorities report maritime debris and oil sighted in the last reported location,\" the UKMTO said. \"The vessel is believed to have sunk.\"\n\nThe Houthis late Wednesday released footage showing their attack on the Tutor, acknowledging they used two different drone boats to hit the vessel from both its side and the stern.\n\nThe U.S. military did not respond to requests for comment over the sinking.\n\nThe Tutor came under attack about a week ago by a bomb-carrying Houthi drone boat in the Red Sea. John Kirby, a White House national security spokesman, said on Monday that the attack killed \"a crew member who hailed from the Philippines.\" The Philippines has yet to acknowledge the death, but the man who had been aboard the Tutor has been missing for over a week in the Red Sea, which faces intense summertime heat.\n\nThe use of a boat loaded with explosives raised the specter of the attack in 2000 on the USS Cole, a suicide assault by al-Qaida when the warship was at port in the Yemeni city of Aden, killing 17 on board. The Cole is now part of a U.S. Navy operation in the Red Sea led by the aircraft carrier USS Dwight D. Eisenhower to try and halt the Houthi attacks, though the rebels continue their assaults.\n\nThe Houthis have launched more than 60 attacks targeting specific vessels and fired off other missiles and drones in their campaign that has killed a total of four sailors. They've seized one vessel and sunk two since November. A U.S.-led airstrike campaign has targeted the Houthis since January, with a series of strikes May 30, killing at least 16 people and wounding 42 others, the rebels say.\n\nIn March, the Belize-flagged Rubymar carrying fertilizer cargo sank in the Red Sea after taking on water for days following a rebel attack.\n\nThe Houthis have maintained that their attacks target ships linked to Israel, the United States or Britain. However, many of the ships they've attacked have little or no connection to the ongoing Israel-Hamas war.\n\n\"It is deplorable that innocent seafarers are being attacked while simply performing their jobs, vital jobs which keep the world warm, fed, and clothed,\" the shipping industry said in a joint statement Wednesday.\n\n\"This is an unacceptable situation, and these attacks must stop now,\" it said.\n\nThe war in Gaza has killed more than 37,000 Palestinians there, while hundreds of others have been killed in Israeli operations in the West Bank. It began after Hamas-led militants attacked Israel on Oct. 7, killing about 1,200 people and taking around 250 hostage.\n\nA recent report by the U.S. Defense Intelligence Agency said that container shipping through the Red Sea has declined by 90% since December because of the attacks. As much as 15% of the world's maritime traffic flows through that corridor.\n\nMeanwhile, the Houthis said on Wednesday that U.S.-led airstrikes targeted Raymah, a province in Yemen under rebel control. The Houthi-controlled SABA news agency described a local radio station's building as being \"totally destroyed\" in the strikes. About a week earlier, the Houthis said similar strikes killed two people and wounded nine others, without saying if those hurt were fighters or civilians.\n\nLater in the day, SABA also reported U.S.-led strikes targeting the port city of Hodeida.\n\nThe U.S. military's Central Command said in a statement early Thursday it destroyed \"one ground control station and one command and control node in a Houthi-controlled area of Yemen\" in the strikes. It also claimed destroying two Houthi drone boats in the Red Sea as well over the last 24 hours.", "source": {"uri": "africanews.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Africanews"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Houthi_movement", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Houthi movement"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red_Sea", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Red Sea"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Kingdom", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Navy", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "United States Navy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unmanned_aerial_vehicle", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Unmanned aerial vehicle"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Warship", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Warship"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yemen", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Yemen"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Yemen"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bulk_carrier", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Bulk carrier"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Petroleum", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Petroleum"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_War_II", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "World War II"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gaza_Strip", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Gaza Strip"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Gaza Strip"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Palestine"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philippines", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Philippines"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Philippines"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liberia", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Liberia"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Liberia"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Explosive", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Explosive"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Kirby_(admiral)", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "John Kirby (admiral)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/USS_Cole_(DDG-67)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "USS Cole (DDG-67)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/USS_Dwight_D._Eisenhower", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "USS Dwight D.

The same international community that should have prevented Hamas from controlling Gaza in the first place has looked on as Iran then set in motion wars across the Middle East.\n\nFirst, let's survey the recent news. On June 13 and June 14, the Houthis attacked two commercial ships, the bulk carrier Tutor, which was making its way to Aqaba in Jordan, and cargo ship Verbena, which was en route to Venice. Both ships were attacked twice and the crew had to abandon ship.\n\nThere is no other place in the world that exists in the kind of Hobbesian chaos of the Middle East, where countries can back militia-terrorist groups that take over states and then attack ships or launch thousands of rockets. There are other areas of the world where there are terrorist groups, such as Boko Haram in Nigeria, that spread massacres and destruction, but the Middle East is unique in the power of these groups.\n\nFor instance, Hamas constructed hundreds of kilometers of tunnels and stockpiled more weapons per capita than most countries. It also launched thousands of rockets at Israel. Hezbollah then joined the war on October 8, launching thousands of rockets, anti-tank missiles, and drones at Israel. There has been no condemnation by the UN or others of these endless attacks. Iran, emboldened by pushing Hamas and Hezbollah into a war that affected millions in Gaza, Israel, and Lebanon, then pushed the Houthis in Yemen to begin attacking ships.\n\nThis began in October and November. It has ebbed and flowed in terms of the Houthi \"success\" at hitting ships. The US partnered with the UK and other countries to try to protect shipping. However, it is obvious that the US has now settled into the same routine that Israel settled into with Hezbollah. US Central Command, which is the on-scene command for securing the Red Sea and shipping lanes, has carried out some strikes with partner forces on the Houthis. However, the Houthis continue their attacks. This is because the \"response\" is so small and proportional that it doesn't harm the Houthis' capabilities.\n\nThe recent attacks have increased the danger to shipping in the Red Sea and Gulf of Aden. \"On June 12, Iranian-backed Houthis struck M/V Tutor, a Liberian flagged, Greek-owned and operated bulk cargo carrier, with an uncrewed surface vessel (USV) resulting in severe flooding and damage to the engine room. One civilian mariner remains missing following the attack. The crew abandoned ship and were rescued by USS Philippine Sea (CG 58) and partner forces. M/V Tutor remains in the Red Sea and is slowly taking on water,\" US Central Command said.\n\nUS Central Command said on June 13 the Houthis struck the \"M/V Verbena, a Palauan-flagged, Ukrainian-owned, Polish-operated bulk cargo carrier in two separate missile attacks. Today [June 16], at approximately 1:45 p.m. (Sanaa time), the crew issued a distress call indicating they were abandoning the ship. M/V Anna Meta responded to render assistance. Anna Meta has recovered the mariners and is transporting them to safety. The crew abandoned ship due to continued fires and an inability to control them.\"\n\nUS Central Command said Iranian navy frigate Jamaran was only eight nautical miles from the Verbena when it was struck. It didn't respond to the distress call. The real story may be that the Iranian ship played a role in this attack. Like many things in this conflict, Iran often has ships snooping around and nothing is done against them while Iran's proxies attack commercial ships. It shows the complete impunity enjoyed by Iran in fueling this crisis.\n\nThese attacks are increasing and there is no solution put forward by the international community to stop them. This shows how incapable the international community has become in terms of protecting shipping. It also is not a positive development amid tensions between Israel and Hezbollah.\n\nRecent concerns being floated by numerous countries and international organizations about the possibility of a war between Israel and Hezbollah illustrate how there is no real attempt to stop the Hezbollah attacks. Iran has basically taken upon itself a new \"right\" in the region to spread attacks from Lebanon to Yemen, over an arc of thousands of kilometers, in which it operationalizes proxies to launch thousands of rockets at Israel and attack ships.\n\nIn a world where a rules-based international order worked, Hezbollah and the Houthis would face pushback. Today, Iran's proxies primarily do as they want and Israel suffers and the crew of commercial ships suffer. The recent attack on two ships is a major blow to shipping and will further erode confidence that the US and other countries can secure the shipping lanes.\n\nReports at China's Xinhua on June 15 that \"two warships of the Russian Pacific Fleet will participate in joint naval exercises with the Egyptian Navy in the Mediterranean Sea,\" further illustrate how Russia may be taking advantage of the situation.\n\n\"According to the ministry, a group of combat ships from the Pacific Fleet, including the missile cruiser Varyag and the frigate Marshal Shaposhnikov, has left for the Egyptian port of Alexandria to engage in the joint exercise with the Egyptian Navy,\" the report said. Russia also sent warships to Cuba recently.", "source": {"uri": "fdd.org", "dataType": "news", "title": "FDD"}, "authors": [{"uri": "hhanes@fdd.org", "name": "hhanes", "type": "author", "isAgency":

Just to jump right in, I just have a few things, and then I'm happy to jump in and take questions.\n\nSo as you know, on Friday, June 14th, ahead of heavy sea states, U.S. Central Command removed the temporary pier from Gaza and towed it back to Ashdod. The pier remains there and will likely be re-anchored later this week when sea states subside. I don't have an exact date for you just yet, but we'll keep you updated. And alongside USAID and humanitarian organizations, we remain committed to working with the international community to get aid into Gaza as quickly as possible.\n\nSince the pier was anchored on May 17th, over 3,500 metric tons have been delivered for onward delivery by humanitarian organizations. Of the 3,500 metric tons, 2,500 metric tons were delivered since the temporary pier was re-anchored to the beach in Gaza on June 7th. And as we have updates on the temporary pier, I'll be sure to pass that information along.\n\nSeparately, last week, the Houthis struck two different cargo ships, the M/V Tutor, which is Liberian-flagged and Greek-owned, and the M/V Verbena, which is Palauan-flagged, Ukrainian-owned and Polish-operated. The June 12th attack on the Tutor resulted in severe flooding and damage to the engine room. One civilian mariner remains missing following the attack.\n\nOn June 14th, the USS Philippine Sea responded to distress calls from the Tutor. Aircraft from the Philippine Sea and partner forces helped evacuate all personnel from the vessel. This airlift operation was done in the Red Sea and in range of Houthi weapons systems, which means that our U.S. Navy and partner forces successfully executed a very complex operation under hostile conditions. Among the ships that were in response distance and did nothing to assist the M/V Tutor were Iranian, Russian and Chinese naval vessels. The Tutor remains in the Red Sea and is slowly taking on water while waiting for salvage vessels to help with recovery.\n\nSeparately, the June 13th attack on the M/V Verbena resulted in fires on board. One civilian mariner was medically evacuated by aircraft from the Philippine Sea to a partner force ship nearby for medical attention.\n\nOn Saturday, June 15th, the crew issued a distress call and was forced to abandon ship and were rescued by the M/V Anna Meta, who was operating nearby. During this time, an Iranian frigate was eight nautical miles away from the Verbena and did not respond to the distress call. The Verbena is no longer on fire, and is being towed by another vessel toward a nearby port.\n\nThis continued reckless behavior by Iranian-backed Houthis threatens regional stability and endangers the lives of mariners across the Red Sea and the Gulf of Aden. The Houthis claim to be acting on behalf of Palestinians in Gaza, and yet, they are threatening the lives of those who have nothing to do with the conflict. The ongoing threat to the ability to safely transit the region caused by the Houthis makes it harder to deliver commercial goods and critical assistance to the people of Yemen, as well as those in Gaza.\n\nAnd with that, I'd be happy to take your questions. Lita?\n\nQ: Sabrina, can you give us an update on the aid agencies? And how -- like, how much aid is now sort of gathered on the shore? And is there any indication that it's going to start to be distributed at any -- even this next week or anything?\n\nMS. SINGH: What you're referring to is WFP being able to continue doing the distribution. I don't have an update for you on that. They're still not doing the distribution within Gaza, but I'd refer you to them for when they decide to continue to go back and operate.\n\nIn terms of the aid that's already pre-positioned and in the marshaling area, I don't have a total for you, but I can look into that...\n\nQ: I think over the weekend, the secretary invited Minister Gallant to the Pentagon.\n\nMS. SINGH: Part of his engagements is, of course, he regularly speaks with Minister Gallant. Sometimes it's important to have those face-to-face conversations. You've seen the secretary go to Israel and elsewhere in the region to have conversations. The invite was extended and accepted; not going to get ahead of a meeting that hasn't taken place, but I think what you can expect on the agenda is things that you've seen raised in these calls, whether it being humanitarian assistance getting into Gaza, understanding a little bit more about their operations, what they're doing. But we'll have more to follow.\n\nQ: Why did he -- is there something he couldn't say on the phone that required an in-person meeting?\n\nMS. SINGH: No, it's always good to have an in-person meeting. He invites...\n\nQ: He doesn't invite -- he doesn't invite every person he's talked to on the phone.\n\nMS. SINGH: He certainly does regular bilateral meetings with counterparts all over the world. Minister Gallant was one that he spoke to recently. The invite was extended. That happens not just with his Israeli counterparts, but with other counterparts, and that's why you see bilateral engagements here in the Pentagon, which you often come to.\n\nMS. SINGH: I don't yet, but we'll keep you updated on that.\n\nQ: Regarding the Houthi attacks, so there -- there've been, it seems, a lot more damage from some of these recent attacks and -- and casualties, as well.\n\nMS. SINGH: Yeah.\n\nQ: Has there been any change either in terms of the weapons the Houthis are using or -- or are there -- kind of targeting or anything of that nature...\n\nMS. SINGH: I'm not tracking -- oh, I'm sorry.\n\nQ: ... that's resulting in this, or -- or is it just kind of luck of the draw, effectively, that this could have happened anytime? It just happened to happen now?\n\nMS. SINGH: I'm not tracking any change in weapons. I was just trying to see if I could -- here we go. I'm not tracking any change in terms of weapons that the Houthis are using. I think what's important to remember is that the Houthis have attacked or threatened U.S. Navy or other commercial vessels over 190 times since November 19th, and while they, you know, thankfully haven't been successful every time, the fact that we're talking about, you know, two to three, you know a few ships that have been hit over the course of the time since November, I think really speaks to the precision that not only U.S. Naval forces in the region have when it comes to striking back at, you know, what's launched towards them, but the coalition that Operation Prosperity Guardian operates under and other countries that operate that are not necessarily part of the coalition, but that have been effective in shooting down some of these, you know, missiles, anti-ballistic missiles that come towards our ships. I think it's important to remember that not every attack gets through. It is unfortunate that some did this weekend. But you know it's a testament to our Navy and what they're doing out there.\n\nYeah?\n\nQ: So the State Department a few weeks ago, on this NSM-20 report, said it was reasonable to assess that some weapons that the U.S. supplied Israel have been used in war crimes or -- or things that would have violated international law, but that they had to still investigate that. Is the Pentagon part of those investigations? Is anyone in this building looking at what's happening, what -- what types of bombs Israel is using? Do -- should we expect any kind of assessment on that?\n\nMS. SINGH: I don't have an update to provide right now. The NSM was something that the secretary of defense certainly gave his input into, but it a State-led mission. But I just don't have an update to provide at this time.\n\nQ: OK.\n\nQ: Thanks, Sabrina. Switching to similarly (inaudible) confirms that the ISIS leader in Somalia was among the targets of a U.S. strike on May 31st. Can you also confirm that he was the target of that strike on May 31st? And can you also confirm whether or not he was killed and whether or not he was considered the leader of ISIS overall, the entire caliphate?\n\nMS. SINGH: Yeah, right now, I'd still have to refer you back to the AFRICOM statement that was issued on May 31st that I don't have it word-for-word in front of me, but it said that they took action against an ISIS leader, or ISIS militants. I don't have any more information to provide right now. I know there's interest in this strike. When there's more information, be happy to provide it, but I just don't have it right now.\n\nYes?\n\nQ: Thank you. Russia and North Korea announced that Russian President Putin will visit North Korea tomorrow. So what would be the Pentagon's comment on this?\n\nMS. SINGH: So I think that visit is happening later this week. You know, it's something that we're continuing to monitor. I think what's important to remember is we're seeing a -- what's concerning to us is a deepening cooperation between Russia and North Korea. The relationship further continues the war in Ukraine. We know that they are providing weapons to Russia to use on the battlefield in Ukraine.\n\nWe're going to continue to monitor but we're seeing Russia go towards countries like the DPRK, like Iran to help with, you know, getting assistance on weapons because they are further isolated on the world stage. And in contrast, you have the United States, other European partners, allies around the world that -- you know, 50 some nations are supporting Ukraine in their efforts.\n\nSo we'll continue to monitor Putin's visit, but we're focused on making sure that Ukraine has what it needs to be successful.\n\nYeah, go ahead.\n\nQ: Sorry, separately -- so yesterday, in the South China Sea, Philippines ship and Chinese vessel had a -- collisions. China claimed that Philippines was responsible. So what would be your comment?\n\nMS. SINGH: You're talking about around the Second Thomas Shoal?\n\nQ: Yeah.\n\nMS. SINGH: So seen the reporting coming out of there. You know, I'd direct you to the Philippines to speak more to what happened, the actual event. Unfortunately, this behavior is not uncharacteristic. We've seen it before. We're going to continue to, like we always do, monitor, but we don't want to see, you know, tensions continue to escalate.\n\nAnd as you might remember, the Secretary held a meeting with his PRC counterpart at the Shangri-La Dialogue. Certainly, activity within the South China Sea was something that came up during their conversation. And we're going to just continue to monitor what's going on in the region.\n\nErin ?\n\nQ: To go off her question about the Kim and Putin meeting, what do you expect to come out of this? I mean, what does Putin get out of it and what does Kim get out of it? Do you think it's just going to be a tech exchange, more munitions, only deepening relationship? What do you expect to come out of it?\n\nMS. SINGH: I don't know. You'd have to ask each respective leader's governments what they expect out of those meetings. We're going to monitor, like we always would. I think with any meeting like this with any type of world leader, meeting whether it be face to face, having calls, there is deepening cooperation, a partnership that develops, but I don't have anything to preview of what's going to come out of those meetings.\n\nQ: And I have one more about Cuba and Russia and the military training down there. Do you -- in the past, Russia has had military training. This is not the first time at Cuba they've had military training down there. But also in the past, you've had other countries that have been involved -- Iran and China. Do you expect another country to come in and also train with Cuba?\n\nMS. SINGH: They do an annual global exercise in the fall. I don't have a list of countries that you would anticipate participating but it could be a broader list. I just don't have anything more for you right now. I don't know -- I'm not aware of any other countries going down there at this time to participate in that exercise, but that's really something for the Russian Navy to speak to.\n\nLiz?\n\nQ: Thanks. According to one of the readouts, the crew that was on the M/V Tutor, they were taken to land for more medical care. Do you have a sense of what the injuries are? Like, is anyone critically injured? Are these minor injuries, or is no one injured and it's just, like, a second medical check?\n\nMS. SINGH: I don't have a better sense. I'd let the ship speak to that, on their own crew members. That's not something that, like I just don't have more details on it. I know that, you know, what I read out at the top is the information that I have, but I wouldn't go into too many specifics on each crew member's medical evaluations, but I am sure the would be able to speak to that or maybe CENTCOM would have more details.\n\nQ: OK. And then last week, the DIA released a new report saying that shipping is down in the Red Sea by upwards of, like, 90 percent. So how has Prosperity Guardian been successful if that's also the case?\n\nMS. SINGH: Well, I think it's been successful in the fact that, to what Lita had asked earlier, you know, we're talking about over 190 attacks from the Houthis since November 19th, of which a few have hit vessels, and we've seen significant damage to one, the Ruby Mar, which did sink in the Red Sea.\n\nAnd then of course you know we have seen loss of life, we have seen these two other ships impacted. But overall, when you're talking about 190 attacks and, you know, a handful getting through on ships and some being able to continue underway, I think that speaks tremendously to our efforts.\n\nIt's up to the shipping companies to make the decision if they want to continue transiting through the Red Sea, the Gulf of Aden. That's really, you know, a decision that each company has to make and weigh.\n\nWe certainly understand the global impact and the effect on global commerce if shipping routes have to be re-routed, you know, through longer sea, you know, pathways. That does have an impact on global shipping, but of course that is up to the carriers to decide what they do.\n\nWe are there in support of maintaining freedom of navigation, upholding international laws, and I think in terms of what the mission has been capable of doing in protecting that navigation, we have been pretty successful in that.\n\nCan I go to Brad and then I'll come back ...\n\nQ: ... Israel dissolved its War Cabinet today. I know it's, like, an internal affair, but does it complicate the U.S. response to Gaza at all?\n\nMS. SINGH: No. That is internal. I would let the Israeli politics speak for itself.\n\nIn terms of our own efforts within Israel, that doesn't complicate what we're doing, which is getting humanitarian aid into Gaza and -- you know, through the temporary pier, but that doesn't complicate (inaudible).\n\nYes? And then I'll come back.\n\nQ: Yeah, thank you. Can we get an update on the drawdown in Niger -- the number of soldier, the number of personnel that are there right now, an estimate?\n\nAnd secondarily, have U.S. forces returned to Chad? And if not, where are those who were relocated from the country earlier this year (inaudible)?\n\nMS. SINGH: Don't have an update on Chad.\n\nOn Niger, the current total of U.S. forces in Niger is approximately around 700. So the withdrawal process continues, and we'll provide updates as that goes. I think AFRICOM did put out a statement. I don't have the exact date of when their statement went out, but they put out a statement on that.\n\nQ: I'm -- I'm just -- I mean, in -- in terms of the mission success in -- in the Red Sea, is it only about how many targets the Houthis are able to hit or the impact on shipping in the region? I guess that the (IAA ?) issued this report last (inaudible) report last week that shows almost 90 percent of major shipping companies are -- are avoiding the Red Sea.\n\nMS. SINGH: I don't think we're sugarcoating the fact that the Houthis have had an impact on shipping lanes within the Red Sea and the Gulf of Aden. I think it's fair to say that that report highlighted that shipping companies are making an assessment to change their routes. Global commerce, you know, what we've seen, the amount that flows in through the Red Sea, I think the average maybe before the conflict started was about, somewhere between 10 to 15 percent.\n\nWe certainly know how that can impact markets like in the United States or all around the world. We're doing the best we can to preserve those shipping lanes. We want to see commerce to continue through there. I think the region does as well, broadly speaking, but it's really up to those shipping companies to make the decisions for, you know, what they feel is safe for them.\n\nI think in terms of success, you know, I don't want to I don't want to necessarily repeat -- I'm sure you don't want me to repeat myself, but you know, I do think there is something to be said of over 190 attacks, and broadly speaking, most of the Houthi attacks have been unsuccessful. The attacks that we saw this past weekend, the attack on the Rubymar -- incredibly destabilizing. I mean, they created their own environmental-ecological problem in her own backyard. What's the payoff for them by doing that? What's the payoff by grain that I think the Tutor was carrying not being able to get where it's supposed to go? So they are upsetting, you know, distribution of food and other goods, and I think -- I think that's important to highlight.\n\nQ: And I just wanted to ask a question about the -- Lebanon-Israel. We've seen an uptick...\n\nMS. SINGH: Yeah.\n\nQ: ... in -- in fighting between Israel and -- and Hezbollah. Are you seeing this as a -- as a shift in the way the war is being conducted between the two parties that could lead to a further escalation? Or is it still contained to a certain degree?\n\nMS. SINGH: We still assess it's contained, but absolutely fair to say that we have seen an increase and an uptick in exchanges in that -- on that northern border. That is exactly, you know, something that we've emphasized from the very beginning, is we don't want to see this spill into a wider regional conflict. It's something that in our -- in the readout that the secretary -- that we posted last week with -- when he did his call with Minister Gallant. That was something that came up.\n\nSo we don't assess that the -- that the war has expanded, but it's something that we continue to urge for de-escalation. As -- you know, that -- that we don't -- we just don't want to see it spill out into -- into a wider regional war.\n\nQ: Thanks. Is there an update on the critically-injured soldier who's at (inaudible)?\n\nMS. SINGH: The latest update that I have is he's still there and same -- same conditions, but I'd refer you to Army if there's any change. I have not received any update on his condition, but that's the latest I have.\n\nQ: Thank you. Is the Pa- -- can you give us -- give us an update on the Patriot that was sent to Ukraine? Is it there yet? And if not, do you have a timeline for that?\n\nMS. SINGH: I don't have any updates to provide or any announcements to make on Patriots. Air defense is something that we know Ukraine needs. You saw the secretary was just in Brussels convening the UDCG. That was something that certainly came up in his meetings, but I just don't have any announcements to make on the Patriot.\n\nQ: Is that something we can get an update on just in terms of...\n\nMS. SINGH: I will keep you updated on anything that has to do with air defense systems or of Patriot.\n\nQ: And the Polish government came out and said that there is a Patriot arriving, if you could also get an update on that. But U.S. Patriots (inaudible)...\n\nMS. SINGH: So we wouldn't -- I don't know that we'd necessarily announce arrival of a certain air defenses. I -- especially, you know, when it comes to things getting into Ukraine, we usually let the Ukrainians speak to that. We're also talking about our own, you know, operational security. I think you've heard the secretary last week when he was in Brussels say that there's no change in our force posture in -- in Poland, but if there are any updates that I can provide, I certainly will.\n\nQ: Yeah, I only ask because the Polish -- the Polish government's announced it, so I thought that would be worth addressing.\n\nOne other thing: There's a GPM briefing today that's off the record, even though that's been historically a topic that's been talked about on the record. Can you help me understand why that briefing is off the record?\n\nMS. SINGH: I don't have many details about the briefing other than that I know it's happening. So can I just take that and come back to you?", "source": {"uri": "defense.gov", "dataType": "news", "title": "U.S. Department of Defense"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

'The vessel is believed to have sunk.'\n\nThe Houthis claimed to have used two different drone boats to hit the vessel from both its side and the stern.\n\nThe ship is reported to have just completed a port call in Russia and was headed for Egypt when it was struck by an uncrewed surface vessel (USV).\n\nJohn Kirby, a White House national security spokesman, said on Monday that the attack killed 'a crew member who hailed from the Philippines.'\n\nThe Philippines has yet to acknowledge the death, but the man who had been aboard the Tutor has been missing for over a week in the Red Sea, which faces intense summertime heat.\n\nThe use of a boat loaded with explosives raised the specter of the attack in 2000 on the USS Cole, a suicide assault by al-Qaida when the warship was at port in the Yemeni city of Aden, killing 17 on board.\n\nThe Cole is now part of a US Navy operation in the Red Sea led by the aircraft carrier USS Dwight D. Eisenhower to try and halt the Houthi attacks, though the rebels continue their assaults.\n\nThe Houthis have launched more than 60 attacks targeting specific vessels and fired off other missiles and drones in their campaign that has killed a total of four sailors. They've seized one vessel and sunk two since November.\n\nThe Houthis claimed to have used two different drone boats to hit the vessel from both its side and the stern\n\nA US-led airstrike campaign has targeted the Houthis since January, with a series of strikes May 30, killing at least 16 people and wounding 42 others, the rebels say.\n\nIn March, the Belize-flagged Rubymar carrying fertilizer cargo sank in the Red Sea after taking on water for days following a rebel attack.\n\nThe Houthis have maintained that their attacks target ships linked to Israel, the United States or Britain.\n\nHowever, many of the ships they've attacked have little or no connection to the ongoing Israel-Hamas war.\n\nThe outline of the bulk carrier can be seen in the distance with smoke rising from an explosion\n\nThe Liberian-flagged, Greek-owned-and-operated Tutor sank in the Red Sea, the British military's United Kingdom Maritime Trade Operations center said\n\n'It is deplorable that innocent seafarers are being attacked while simply performing their jobs, vital jobs which keep the world warm, fed, and clothed,' the shipping industry said in a joint statement Wednesday.\n\n'This is an unacceptable situation, and these attacks must stop now,' it said.\n\nRead MoreEXCLUSIVE Israel is on the brink of 'full-scale war with Hezbollah', warns ex-IDF intelligence officer\n\nThe war in Gaza has killed more than 37,000 Palestinians there, while hundreds of others have been killed in Israeli operations in the West Bank. It began after Hamas-led militants attacked Israel on October 7, killing about 1,200 people and taking around 250 hostage.\n\nA recent report by the US Defense Intelligence Agency said that container shipping through the Red Sea has declined by 90 per cent since December because of the attacks.\n\nAs much as 15 per cent of the world's maritime traffic flows through that corridor.\n\nMeanwhile, the Houthis said on Wednesday that US-led airstrikes targeted Raymah, a province in Yemen under rebel control.\n\nThe Houthi-controlled SABA news agency described a local radio station's building as being 'totally destroyed' in the strikes.\n\nIt would be the second ship sunk as part of the rebels' campaign targeting Red Sea shipping after the Rubymar went down in March\n\nAbout a week earlier, the Houthis said similar strikes killed two people and wounded nine others, without saying if those hurt were fighters or civilians.\n\nLater in the day, SABA also reported US-led strikes targeting the port city of Hodeida.\n\nThe US military's Central Command said in a statement early Thursday it destroyed 'one ground control station and one command and control node in a Houthi-controlled area of Yemen' in the strikes. It also claimed destroying two Houthi drone boats in the Red Sea as well over the last 24 hours.", "source": {"uri": "dailymail.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "Daily Mail Online"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Houthi_movement", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Houthi movement"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red_Sea", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Red Sea"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rocket", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Rocket"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unmanned_aerial_vehicle", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Unmanned aerial vehicle"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Kingdom", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Navy", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "United States Navy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Warship", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Warship"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Missile", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Missile"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yemen", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Yemen"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Yemen"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cargo_ship", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Cargo ship"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stern", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Stern"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fertilizer", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Fertilizer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Port", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Port"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tonne", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Tonne"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coal", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Coal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sailor", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Sailor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_War_II", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "World War II"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gaza_Strip", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Gaza Strip"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Gaza Strip"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Palestine"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philippines", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Philippines"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Philippines"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liberia", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Liberia"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Liberia"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Explosive", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Explosive"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Kirby_(admiral)", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "John Kirby (admiral)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/USS_Cole_(DDG-67)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "USS Cole (DDG-67)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dwight_D._Eisenhower", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Dwight D.

Newsweek has emailed the Russian Foreign Ministry for comment.\n\nMany shipping firms have responded to the assaults by diverting vessels from the Suez Canal to the longer route around Africa, disrupting global trade with delayed deliveries and higher costs.\n\nHowever, Russia is closely aligned with Tehran, and its vessels had been sailing through the area, including tankers carrying Russian oil and container ships bound for Russia's ports.\n\nIn March, it was reported that Russian warships passed the Bab el-Mandab Strait into the Red Sea without incident. In January, Russia condemned the U.S. and the U.K. for strikes against the Houthi militia, for its attack on ships passing through the Red Sea.\n\nHowever, Russian-linked vessels have not come through unscathed. In January, Houthi militants mistakenly targeted a tanker carrying Russian oil some 90 nautical miles southeast of Yemen's port city of Aden, according to British maritime security firm Ambrey, Reuters reported.\n\nIn March, Russia, along with China, agreed a pact with the Houthis that their ships would get safe passage, following talks with Mohammed Abdel Salam, one of the Yemen group's top political figures, Bloomberg reported in March.\n\nThis would be in exchange for Chinese and Russian political support to the Houthis in bodies such as the United Nations Security Council, which could mean blocking resolutions against the group, Bloomberg added.\n\nHowever, this week, maritime authorities said the rebels sank a ship carrying Russian cargo after they fired three anti-ship ballistic missiles at the vessel on June 12, severely damaging the engine.\n\nSources including maritime security companies and the United Kingdom Maritime Trade Operations (UKMTO) said the Greek-owned Tutor coal carrier was struck with missiles and an explosive-laden remote-controlled boat, according to Reuters, which said the 22-person crew were successfully evacuated.\n\nThe ship had just completed a port call in Russia and was bound for Egypt when it was hit 66 nautical miles southwest of the Houthi-controlled Yemeni port of Al Hudaydah, the BBC reported.\n\nUnited States Central Command (CENTCOM) said an uncrewed Houthi surface vehicle struck the Liberian-flagged, Greek-owned and operated merchant vessel Tutor in the Red Sea and caused \"damage to the engine room.\"\n\nThe first ship sunk by the Houthis was the British-owned Rubymar on March 2, some two weeks after it was struck by missiles. Earlier this month, the Houthis also seriously damaged the Palau-flagged Verbena, which was loaded with wood construction materials.\n\nDespite the spate of Houthi attacks, the think tank Oxford Economics said in a report in March shared with Newsweek that the impact on global trade so far \"appears manageable and we expect a gradual recovery in goods trade this year.\"", "source": {"uri":

Our protective effort is failing and flailing,\" David Asher, a senior fellow at Hudson Institute, wrote in a statement, referring to the escalating attacks on commercial vessels by Iran-backed Houthis across the southern Red Sea, critical Bab el-Mandeb maritime chokepoint and the Gulf of Aden.\n\nOur biggest takeaway this week after speaking with several commodity research firms and risk analysts about the evolving situation in the Red Sea is attacks are only increasing from here as there's no immediate end to the Israeli-Hamas war this summer.\n\nMaking headlines in recent days has been the sinking of commodity-hauling bulk carrier \"Tutor.\" The significance of this Houthi attack marked the first time a ship was hit by an uncrewed surface vessel packed with explosives.\n\nOn Wednesday evening, Houthi spokesperson Yahya Saree provided a never-before-seen view of the attack on Tutor, which shows the drone boat slamming into the stern of the vessel, producing a massive explosion.

Largely functioning as an Iranian proxy terrorist organization, the Houthis announced in October that they would declare war on the nation of Israel in solidarity with the Sunni, fellow Iran-backed group Hamas. Hamas invaded Israel on October 7, killing upwards of 1,000 people and engaging in widespread human rights atrocities including infanticide and gang rape.\n\nThe Houthis have mainly participated in the jihadist war on Israel through attacks on commercial ships in the highly trafficked Red Sea. Houthi leaders have insisted that they are only targeting ships with ties to Israel - and, later, expanded their targets to include American and British ships - but in reality they have largely targeted ships at random, launching dozens of attacks on ships with no relevant ties to those nations. On some occasions, the Houthis have targeted ships with links to their allies, including Iran, Russia, and China.\n\nRELATED -- Pentagon: 'Some' Houthi Attacks Are Getting Through Despite Us Damaging 'Some' of Their Capabilities\n\nThe Houthis have launched over 70 attacks on ships in the Red Sea since November, Reuters noted on Wednesday. They have sunk two ships - the Belize-flagged MV Rubymar in February and the Greek-owned MV Tutor, which authorities confirmed had sunk on Wednesday - and killed at least four sailors.\n\nIn response to the Red Sea campaign, the administration of leftist President Joe Biden launched \"Operation Prosperity Guardian\" in December, allegedly a coalition of over 20 countries sending assets to the Red Sea to protect commercial shipping. The Biden administration never named all the members of the coalition and has offered little information on operations related to \"Operation Prosperity Guardian\" since then, though Pentagon officials claimed the project was still ongoing as recently as this week.\n\nWhile not mentioning \"Operation Prosperity Guardian\" specifically, the shipping organizations complained that state powers had done little to use their military might to contain the Houthis.\n\n\"It is deplorable that innocent seafarers are being attacked while simply performing their jobs, vital jobs which keep the world warm, fed, and clothed,\" their statement read. \"This is an unacceptable situation, and these attacks must stop now.\"\n\n\"We call for States with influence in the region to safeguard our innocent seafarers and for the swift de-escalation of the situation in the Red Sea,\" the groups continued. \"We have heard the condemnation and appreciate the words of support, but we urgently seek action to stop the unlawful attacks on these vital workers and this vital industry.\"\n\nThe signatories include representatives of 14 shipping organizations, including the World Shipping Council, the Cruise Lines International Association, the International Association of Ports and Harbors, and the International Maritime Employers' Council, among others.\n\nReuters reported on Wednesday, noting the outraged statement from the shipping organizations, that insurance companies are similarly alarmed at the Houthi attacks and what appears to be their increasing frequency and severity. One point of particularly concern is the growing number of attacks in which the Houthis are using attack drone boats. The Tutor was hit by an unmanned surface vessel (USV), the first time the Houthis had used such a weapon with success in its Red Sea campaign.\n\n\"The first successful use of an unmanned surface vessel represents a new challenge for commercial shipping within an already complex environment,\" Munro Anderson, head of operations at marine war risk and insurance specialist Vessel Protect, told Reuters.\n\n\"Operation Prosperity Guardian\" did not work to protect the Tutor or the MV Verbena, currently on fire after being struck by a Houthi missile. The Pentagon mission was announced on December to much fanfare, claiming over 20 members who would offer patrol ships and other assets to the project. Prosperity Guardian was plagued with controversies from the start: from the Pentagon naming members, such as Spain, who claimed not to have agreed to join the coalition, to the notable absence of the most relevant actors by the Red Sea, Israel, Egypt, and Saudi Arabia.\n\nSome of the coalition members named offered so few resources it was unclear how their participation would make any difference. Greece, for example, sent one frigate, while Australia sent 11 servicemen, but no naval assets.\n\nThe Pentagon has not attributed any major activity to \"Operation Prosperity Guardian\" in months, though Defense Department officials still mention it as an ongoing mission. As recently as June 5, Pentagon officials were thanking members of the coalition for nominally joining the project.\n\nA journalist asked Pentagon Press Secretary Maj. Gen. Pat Ryder about \"Operation Prosperity Guardian\" on Tuesday, calling for a clear \"definition of strategic success.\"\n\n\"Strategic success looks like the ability of the international community to continue to transit the Red Sea. And we're going to keep after it,\" Ryder replied, claiming that, \"it's the Houthis that have failed to deter the United States and the international community from continuing to operate in the Red Sea,\" rather than the other way around.\n\n\"They've conducted over 190 attacks, the vast majority of which have been knocked down, thanks to U. S. and international efforts to help safeguard shipping and the lives of Mariners through operations like Operation Prosperity Guardian,\" Ryder said. He did not identify any of the individual actions that Operation Prosperity Guardian has taken to stop Houthi attacks.", "source": {"uri": "breitbart.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Breitbart"},

The group claimed to have hit the 100,000 tonne vessel - one of 11 \"super carriers\" earlier this month, something the US denied had happened.\n\nThe Houthis have, however, sunk two civilian ships.

deadly blast", "body": "THIS is the dramatic moment a Red Sea ship explodes in a drone attack carried out by Iran-backed Houthis.\n\nFootage released by Yemen's Houthi rebels show their lethal attack against the Greek-owned transport ship after threatening fresh onslaught.\n\nThe first lethal drone hit results in a massive cloud of smoke erupting from the ship.\n\nFootage shows the attack completely disintegrates the right side of the vessel.\n\nA second mortal hit from the Houthis shows the middle of the Red Sea ship engulfed by a massive fireball.\n\nThe vessel was left ravaged by the blast as the West fear more threats to the flashpoint region.\n\nSince the outbreak of the Israel-Gaza war, the Shia militant group have vowed to attack any ships moving to or from Israeli ports.\n\nBrave vessels attempting to navigate the 20 mile-wide gap are forced to sail dangerously close to the coast of Yemen.\n\nThis has put over \u00a31trillion of the world trade at risk - but the Houthis don't seem to plan on stopping their horrific actions anytime soon.\n\nThe US, UK and Israeli Navy have previously all sent warships into the increasingly troubled area in order to try to regain stability in the major shipping route.\n\nSeven months ago 25 sailors of the hijacked British-Israeli Galaxy Leader cargo ship were taken captive by the Houthi pirates.\n\nThe $50million vessel was hijacked by the Iran-sponsored Houthi rebels in the Red Sea on November 19.\n\nIts entire international crew were taken hostage in what the gunmen clinging to the sides of a helicopter screamed was revenge for Israel's war in Gaza.\n\nThe car carrier was pulled back to Hodeidah in the Houthi-controlled north of Yemen as a trophy to taunt the West and supporters of the militants flocked to the site to share in the spoils of war.\n\nBut the fates of the 25 sailors - who mostly hail from the Philippines as well as Romania, Ukraine, Bulgaria and Mexico - remain in the hands of the terror group.\n\nA spokesperson for Yemen's Ministry of Foreign Affairs told The Sun: \"The terrorist militia is still refusing to release any one of them after half a year of captivity as hostages.\n\n\"The Yemeni government has been actively engaged in diplomatic efforts to secure the release of the hostages.\n\n\"Despite international appeals, condemnations from the United Nations Security Council, the terrorist Houthi militia did not respond to any humanitarian calls for their release.\"\n\nTheir identities have been kept from the public.\n\nFollowing the hijacking, a video was released by the Houthis showing its commanders greeting the crew.\n\n\"Anything that you need we are ready to provide it for you,\" one of them is heard telling the hostages in the clip.\n\nNothing has been seen of them since.\n\nFilipino diplomatic sources have said they do not expect the captives to be released until Israel's war in Gaza is over.", "source": {"uri": "the-sun.com", "dataType": "news", "title":

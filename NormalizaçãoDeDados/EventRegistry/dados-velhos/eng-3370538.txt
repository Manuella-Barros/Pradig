Image: Ryan Byrne/INPHO Cork City manager John Caulfield. Image: Ryan Byrne/INPHO\n\nJOHN CAULFIELD EXPECTS to have his future resolved in the coming weeks as his Cork City side close in on the club's first Premier Division title in 12 years.\n\nAfter achieving three consecutive second-place finishes since taking over as manager for the 2014 season, City need just eight points from their nine remaining league games to win the title for the first time since 2005.\n\nIn spite of his team's success so far this year, Caulfield has yet to agree a new contract to remain in charge at Turner's Cross beyond 2017. The former City striker's current deal is due to expire at the end of the campaign.\n\n\"I hope I am,\" Caulfield said, when asked if he expects to be at the helm for a fifth season. \"Everyone knows I have a two-year contract which finishes this year. To be honest with you, I'm totally focused on the club and the league. Hopefully over the next couple of weeks something might happen.\n\n\"But I don't go to bed at night worrying about it. My main concern is totally to win for the club and see can we win the league. I'm totally focused on that, but yeah, we're coming to the stage of the season where maybe something will happen. We'll wait and see.\"\n\nCaulfield, whose side will entertain Athlone Town on Friday week in the second round of their defence of the FAI Cup, is keen to stay with the Leesiders. He believes that although the club has made significant progress in recent years under the ownership of its supporters, there's better still to come.\n\n\"The club is evolving quite a bit in the last couple of years and I believe the club is going from strength to strength, if we can keep it going that way. I believe, and I said it from the first day we came in, we should always be in Europe.\n\n\"There's no excuse for a club of our size, or any of the big clubs in Ireland. You have to be in Europe. Obviously you want to win trophies as well but you have to be in Europe. Thankfully this is our fourth year and it's our fourth year in Europe so we're happy with that, and obviously we're happy that we're competing and winning trophies.\n\n\"But I see that the club needs to keep driving on, so we'll see how it goes. That's my ambition. I'd imagine in the next few weeks something will happen.\"\n\nCaulfield also praised Dundalk's decision to extend Stephen Kenny's contract to 2020. Last week, the Lilywhites boss signed a new contract to remain with the reigning Premier Division champions for a further three years.\n\n\"It's maybe showing that there's common sense applying here; that this guy has done a fantastic job for them,\" Caulfield said. \"While they didn't do as well in Europe this year, the thing is that he's done a great job and he'll continue to do a great job.\"\n\nCork City's imminent Premier Division triumph will certainly increase Caulfield's stock, which may attract interest in his services from clubs elsewhere. When asked if he eventually hopes to manage abroad, the 52-year-old said it's a long-term possibility.\n\nCaulfield: \"I've always said that I'd like to stay in football if I could for the rest of my life. How long that is, we don't know. You have to mind yourself as well. But at the moment I feel that here, probably after coming off a difficult second year, I feel that the groundwork has been done and that the systems are in place.\n\n\"The potential is here to keep driving the club forward. That's the way I feel about it -- obviously within the budgets and all that but you're well aware of it and I understand all that, because obviously I've been working within that and I know what we can do and what we can't do. But I still feel it's there for the club to drive on and keep going. I feel it's a purple patch for the club and we can do that. That's where I'm at.\n\n\"Long term do I think I'd like to coach more and more, and go elsewhere? Yes, I would, when the time comes. But football is volatile because unfortunately it's not like any other job. It's that type of job where unfortunately you can have all the greatest plans in the world but you lose two or three games in a row and people want a change. That's just the way it is.\n\n\"But the bigger picture for myself is that I think things here can go further. I think we can go further, that's what I believe, and hopefully that's the way it'll go. Hopefully I'll be here for that.\"\n\nNo bitterness from Cork City as Maguire finally receives Ireland recognition Shamrock Rovers boost European hopes with win in Limerick", "date": "2017-08-15", "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/UEFA", "wgt": 100, "id": 597, "label": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/UEFA"}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Water_Sports/Swimming_and_Diving", "wgt": 100, "id": 792, "label": "dmoz/Sports/Water Sports/Swimming and Diving"}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Football/Australian_Rules", "wgt": 100, "id": 822, "label": "dmoz/Sports/Football/Australian Rules"}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Organizations/Service_Clubs", "wgt": 100, "id": 823, "label": "dmoz/Society/Organizations/Service Clubs"}], "concepts": [{"location": {"country": null, "type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Ireland"}}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ireland", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Ireland"}, "type": "loc", "id": "112932"}, {"location": {"country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Republic of Ireland"}}, "type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Turners Cross"}}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turners_Cross_(stadium)", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Turners Cross"}, "type": "loc", "id": "298680"}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Association_football", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "id": "302552", "label": {"eng": "Association football"}}, {"location": null, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Europe", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Europe"}, "type": "loc", "id": "303048"}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tottenham_Hotspur_F.C.", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "id": "306207", "label": {"eng": "Tottenham Hotspur F.C."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dundalk_F.C.", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "id": "315915", "label": {"eng": "Dundalk F.C."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stephen_Kenny_(footballer)", "type": "person", "score": 2, "id": "332173", "label": {"eng": "Stephen Kenny (footballer)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FAI_Cup", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "360256", "label": {"eng": "FAI Cup"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cork_City_F.C.", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "id": "362863", "label": {"eng": "Cork City F.C."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Athlone_Town_A.F.C.", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "515685", "label": {"eng": "Athlone Town A.F.C."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Caulfield_(Irish_footballer)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "id": "1306150", "label": {"eng": "John Caulfield (Irish footballer)"}}]}

Let's hope he gets into the final squad.\n\n\"I don't get wound up about when he was called up, whether it was three weeks ago or now, the most important thing is when he is called up that everyone knows where he came from and what he had done for the last 18 months and we've to take pride in that.\"", "date": "2017-08-16", "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer", "wgt": 100, "id": 33, "label": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer"}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/UEFA", "wgt": 100, "id": 597, "label": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/UEFA"}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Football/Australian_Rules", "wgt": 100, "id": 822, "label": "dmoz/Sports/Football/Australian Rules"}], "concepts": [{"location": {"country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}, "type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Scotland"}}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scotland", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Scotland"}, "type": "loc", "id": "84296"}, {"location": {"country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}, "type": "place", "label": {"eng": "England"}}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/England", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "England"}, "type": "loc", "id": "242110"}, {"location": {"country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Republic of Ireland"}}, "type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Turners Cross"}}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turners_Cross_(stadium)", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Turners Cross"}, "type": "loc", "id": "298680"}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Association_football", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "302552", "label": {"eng": "Association football"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dundalk_F.C.", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "id": "315915", "label": {"eng": "Dundalk F.C."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/League_of_Ireland", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "316266", "label": {"eng": "League of Ireland"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oriel_Park", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "id": "332171", "label": {"eng": "Oriel Park"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stephen_Kenny_(footballer)", "type": "person", "score": 2, "id": "332173", "label": {"eng": "Stephen Kenny (footballer)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alan_Bennett", "type": "person", "score": 1, "id": "339093", "label": {"eng": "Alan Bennett"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FAI_Cup", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "360256", "label": {"eng": "FAI Cup"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cork_City_F.C.", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "id": "362863", "label": {"eng": "Cork City F.C."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sean_Maguire", "type": "person", "score": 1, "id": "396487", "label": {"eng": "Sean Maguire"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robbie_Williams", "type": "person", "score": 2, "id": "413535", "label": {"eng": "Robbie Williams"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Caulfield_(Irish_footballer)", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "id": "1306150", "label": {"eng": "John Caulfield (Irish footballer)"}}]}

We had won two FAI Cups up until last year's win. We've been probably specialists in coming second in the history of the club throughout the years. There's nothing from me about being in a great position, or the players,\" says Caulfield.\n\n\"Every team that plays us is raising their gam; we know how difficult it is. We're getting very close, we're focusing all on Sligo. It's our last home game for a long time in the league.\"\n\nCork will be determined to make home comforts count tonight, with Robbie Williams expected to recover from injury to face the Bit O'Red. After tonight, Cork face a run of away league dates, at Finn Harps, Shamrock Rovers, Limerick, and Derry.\n\n\"No-one understands, unless you're from here, the travelling involved,\" says Caulfield. \"Last week was a typical example. Drogheda: Home at 3am in the morning. Shamrock Rovers: Home at 4am in the morning. Bray: 2am in the morning. Three games in a week. Most people from other clubs are home in bed at 11pm.\"\n\nKieran Sadlier will tonight face his old club Sligo for the first time since his \u20ac40,000 move in July. Caulfield was delighted to see the former Ireland U21 man break his duck for City last weekend, scoring the winner in City's FAI Cup win over Bray.\n\n\"Kieran's fitness levels have come up a lot in the last couple of weeks. He got a fantastic goal against Bray. He's one of the few players in our league who could have scored that kind of goal from the position he was in. We're back creating chances and we need that on Friday night.\"\n\nKarl Sheppard agrees that Sadlier is finding his feet.\n\n\"Sadlier was brilliant against Bray,\" says Sheppard.\n\n\"When he came in, John said he had a bit of strength-and-conditioning to do. Kieran said himself he was surprised at how high the intensity of the training here was. I remember when I came into the club first, Colin Healy was here then, and I remember going in for a tackle and thinking, 'this is my ball here', and he comes in through the back of me and just completely cleaned me out. You're flat on your back, your thinking 'Jesus, I'm in for a tough day's training here'. It's like that ever since.\n\n\"No-one really holds back at all. A few times, you can actually come in from a Monday or Tuesday session and it's as tough as a game.\"\n\nSligo drew 0-0 with Bray last Tuesday and remain in the drop zone going into tonight's game. Jamie McDonagh returns from suspension but Daniel Kearns is absent with a hamstring problem.\n\nManager Gerard Lyttle said: \"We played well in parts of the game on Tuesday, but we struggled to create enough chances. Ultimately, wins are what we need.\n\n\"I thought we were very solid and have been in the league for some games now and that gives me hope that we can get out of trouble, but if we don't create more clear-cut opportunities, then we're not going to get three points.\n\n\"One point isn't good enough for the position we're in and this game [against Cork] is like the Dundalk one where we were written off somewhat. We need to find that fighting spirit from that night. We'll take the game in stages and we'll have to take some risks, at times, in the game.\n\n\"It's a place the players have done well in before, we competed well with Cork last time out and were very unfortunate to lose the game in the end, so we go there with belief and with ambition of getting that win we're chasing.\"", "date": "2017-08-18", "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Recreation", "wgt": 100, "id": 51, "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Recreation"}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Browser_Based", "wgt": 100, "id": 52, "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Browser Based"}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Downloads", "wgt": 100, "id": 134, "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Downloads"}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Computer_Platforms", "wgt": 100, "id": 135, "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Computer Platforms"}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Board_Games", "wgt": 100, "id": 138, "label": "dmoz/Games/Board Games"}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Game_Design", "wgt": 100, "id": 205, "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Game Design"}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Board_Games/Abstract", "wgt": 100, "id": 751, "label": "dmoz/Games/Board Games/Abstract"}], "concepts": [{"location": {"country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}, "type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Derry"}}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Derry", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Derry"}, "type": "loc", "id": "86519"}, {"location": {"country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Republic of Ireland"}}, "type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Sligo"}}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sligo", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Sligo"}, "type": "loc", "id": "112586"}, {"location": {"country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Republic of Ireland"}}, "type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Luimneach"}}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Limerick", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Luimneach"}, "type": "loc", "id": "112803"}, {"location": {"country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Republic of Ireland"}}, "type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Drogheda"}}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drogheda", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Drogheda"}, "type": "loc", "id": "113102"}, {"location": {"country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Republic of Ireland"}}, "type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Cork"}}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cork_(city)", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Cork"}, "type": "loc", "id": "113162"}, {"location": {"country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Republic of Ireland"}}, "type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Bray"}}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bray", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Bray"}, "type": "loc", "id": "113308"}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dundalk_F.C.", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "315915", "label": {"eng": "Dundalk F.C."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/League_of_Ireland", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "id": "316266", "label": {"eng": "League of Ireland"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republic_of_Ireland_national_under-21_football_team", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "321833", "label": {"eng": "Republic of Ireland national under-21 football team"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shamrock_Rovers_F.C.", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "id": "332168", "label": {"eng": "Shamrock Rovers F.C."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Derry_City_F.C.", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "334306", "label": {"eng": "Derry City F.C."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Finn_Harps_F.C.", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "id": "355837", "label": {"eng": "Finn Harps F.C."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FAI_Cup", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "360256", "label": {"eng": "FAI Cup"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Football_Association_of_Ireland", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "id": "361194", "label": {"eng": "Football Association of Ireland"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Karl_Sheppard", "type": "person", "score": 2, "id": "392943", "label": {"eng": "Karl Sheppard"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robbie_Williams", "type": "person", "score": 3, "id": "413535", "label": {"eng": "Robbie Williams"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sligo_Rovers_F.C.", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "id": "428952", "label": {"eng": "Sligo Rovers F.C."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daniel_Kearns_(footballer)", "type": "person", "score": 2, "id": "509092", "label": {"eng": "Daniel Kearns (footballer)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colin_Healy", "type": "person", "score": 2, "id": "997008", "label": {"eng": "Colin Healy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kieran_Sadlier", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "1382915", "label": {"eng": "Kieran Sadlier"}}]}

There's not much left to go. If we can push on and keep winning games, we can close in on winning that.\n\n\"Hopefully we can wrap that up soon rather than later, and then concentrate on the FAI Cup.\"\n\nMcNulty revealed that Cork set their sights very high this year - their league ambitions apart, they set a target of getting to the final of all the major domestic tournaments they were involved in.\n\nTheir defeat to Rovers in the EA Sports Cup has scuppered that, but it won't matter if the Leesiders can secure the double.\n\n\"We were obviously unlucky against Shamrock Rovers,\" insisted McNulty. \"But the main two were the league and FAI Cup.\n\n\"We're the holders of the Cup, been in the final the last two years and we want to make than three years in a row.\"\n\nAfter being pitted at home to First Division Athlone Town in the last 16 of the FAI Cup, the Corkman said: \"It's one win at a time in both competitions.\n\n\"But we're getting closer to that aim. Bray are gone now, Derry are out and Bohs are gone, so are Sligo. So you have three of the top six out of the competition already.\"\n\nThe custodian also backed up Caulfield's claim that the best has yet to come from Kieran Sadlier.\n\nThe left winger put in a man of the match performance against Bray and grabbed his first goal for Leesiders since his move last month from tonight's opponents.\n\n\"He may have missed a penalty but Kieran produced a brilliant goal,\" said McNulty. \"He doesn't seem to be a fella to leave things bother him.\n\n\"To be fair, it will take a while for home to settle in. He loves to runs at players and his link play is good.\n\n\"He can only get better, which is great for us as a team\".", "date": "2017-08-18", "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Youth", "wgt": 100, "id": 220, "label": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Youth"}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/Competitions", "wgt": 100, "id": 256, "label": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/Competitions"}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Fantasy", "wgt": 100, "id": 383, "label": "dmoz/Sports/Fantasy"}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Autos/Makes_and_Models", "wgt": 100, "id": 461, "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Autos/Makes and Models"}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/UEFA", "wgt": 100, "id": 597, "label": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/UEFA"}], "concepts": [{"location": {"country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}, "type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Derry"}}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Derry", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Derry"}, "type": "loc", "id": "86519"}, {"location": {"country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Republic of Ireland"}}, "type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Sligo"}}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sligo", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Sligo"}, "type": "loc", "id": "112586"}, {"location": {"country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Republic of Ireland"}}, "type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Cork"}}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cork_(city)", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Cork"}, "type": "loc", "id": "113162"}, {"location": {"country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Republic of Ireland"}}, "type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Bray"}}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bray", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Bray"}, "type": "loc", "id": "113308"}, {"location": {"country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Republic of Ireland"}}, "type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Turners Cross"}}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turners_Cross_(stadium)", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Turners Cross"}, "type": "loc", "id": "298680"}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Double_(association_football)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "id": "307307", "label": {"eng": "Double (association football)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/McNulty", "type": "person", "score": 5, "id": "315845", "label": {"eng": "McNulty"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dundalk_F.C.", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "id": "315915", "label": {"eng": "Dundalk F.C."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/League_of_Ireland", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "316266", "label": {"eng": "League of Ireland"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shamrock_Rovers_F.C.", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "id": "332168", "label": {"eng": "Shamrock Rovers F.C."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bohemian_F.C.", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "id": "355834", "label": {"eng": "Bohemian F.C."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Finn_Harps_F.C.", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "355837", "label": {"eng": "Finn Harps F.C."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FAI_Cup", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "id": "360256", "label": {"eng": "FAI Cup"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cork_City_F.C.", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "362863", "label": {"eng": "Cork City F.C."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mark_McNulty", "type": "person", "score": 3, "id": "392941", "label": {"eng": "Mark McNulty"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sligo_Rovers_F.C.", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "428952", "label": {"eng": "Sligo Rovers F.C."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drogheda_United_F.C.", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "462632", "label": {"eng": "Drogheda United F.C."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/League_of_Ireland_Cup", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "514057", "label": {"eng": "League of Ireland Cup"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Athlone_Town_A.F.C.", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "id": "515685", "label": {"eng": "Athlone Town A.F.C."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Caulfield_(Irish_footballer)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "1306150", "label": {"eng": "John Caulfield (Irish footballer)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bray_Wanderers_F.C.", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "1326453", "label": {"eng": "Bray Wanderers F.C."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kieran_Sadlier", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "id": "1382915", "label": {"eng": "Kieran Sadlier"}}]}

It got me thinking about a lost opportunity for the game in Dublin city.\n\nIt was back in 2002-03 when Shelbourne devised plans to merge with Rivermount, a club in Finglas, and to build a stadium in Tolka Valley.\n\nWhat could have been.\n\nShels actually discussed similar moves with two other famous north Dublin clubs, Tolka Rovers and Home Farm.\n\nThey tried to leverage their stakeholding in Tolka Park with the council with the aim of rehousing the club.\n\nNothing came of any of it but had the Reds pulled it off at the time it would have sent the club down a completely different road - an altogether less painful one.\n\nThe idea was a good one. It was probably ahead of his time. But it wasn't sold well to the schoolboy clubs and the opposition of local councillors finished it off.\n\nLook at how it's turned out for everyone involved.\n\nShels have fallen into a bad - but not fatal - state, Rivermount, Tolka Rovers and Home Farm are not the schoolboy forces that they were.\n\nAside from St Kevin's, who are powerful enough it would seem to be allowed to enter the new FAI under-15s league on their own, the dominance of the traditional schoolboy clubs has been diluted.\n\nThere are several causes for that.\n\nA chunk of Dublin's population has gone to the commuter towns, where football clubs are benefiting, but it has effected the whole football scene in the city.\n\nThe other core clubs are standing still or in regression.\n\nTwenty years ago, football was the number one sport in the capital but the GAA has turned itself around after a bad spell in the Nineties and Rugby is similarly well positioned to capture the hearts and minds of our young.\n\nBut as I watched the game in Tolka Valley, I couldn't help but think how the football community as a whole would have benefited had Shels' ambitious plan worked out, had they been able to tap into an area that would serve Finglas, Blanchardstown and beyond.\n\nHowever politics always gets in the way.\n\nPeople are fearful of change - and when people are in power, they're reluctant to hand it over.\n\nI think it would have worked if it had been sold better by the club.\n\nShels had a lot of leverage back then with the council because they co-owned Tolka Park.\n\nThey went into a downward spiral afterwards.\n\nTolka Park on a Friday night is like a graveyard now compared to how it used to be, when it was the hub of league football. It was electric.\n\nOK, I'm biased, but nothing compared to it on a Friday with the packed crowd.\n\nI hope in the build-up to the FAI Cup clash there between Shels and Shamrock Rovers that it's a reminder to people of how it used to be a special night for both clubs.\n\nWouldn't it be great if the atmosphere was recreated for this game.\n\nRovers, of course, used Tolka as a temporary home once upon a time.\n\nLet's hope the fixture is the beginning of a rebuilding process for Shels now that the club has freed itself from it's financial shackles and is a position to move forward.\n\nCork should breed young blood on Monday to delay league celebrations\n\nWho wants Cork to win the league on Monday? Do Cork even want to win it then?\n\nIf I was John Caulfield I'd throw in a couple of young lads and prolong it a bit more - that home game against Dundalk on September 15 looks like a great night for the title party to get started.\n\nI say that in half in jest because Cork have been going out their business in a very professional manner and this league title success has been so long in the making for them - it's 12 years since the last one - that they'll want to get it done as soon as they can.\n\nTo make it happen on at Finn Park on Monday, they have to beat Sligo Rovers at home tonight and hope that Dundalk win away to Derry City on Sunday.\n\nI say half in jest because from a neutral point of view I think we'd all like to see the inevitable delayed until that Dundalk game at Turner's Cross.\n\nWithout Dundalk hitting the heights they did in the past three years, this Cork outfit believe they would have lifted the league trophy on two or three occasions already and so it would be fitting in a way for it to happen then - and not so much in Ballybofey on a Monday night.\n\nIf it is won on Monday then John faces the challenge of keeping his players hungry for two more months because there is a league and Cup double to be won here.\n\nThat's what they're after and I don't think they'll ever have a better opportunity.\n\nAlthough they've lost Sean Maguire and Kevin O'Connor, they're a better unit than they were when they lifted the FAI Cup last November and they are the best team in the country.\n\nThese chances don't come around that often and they have to realise that.\n\nUnfortunately for them people will pick holes in their achievement by claiming that it hasn't been the most competitive of title races but look, I wouldn't give a damn what people think once I've a winner's medal in my pocket.\n\nBut if Cork were to win the double then that would cement this team's place in the history books.\n\nThe hair dye trend is coming back to the league. But does it boost a player's confidence?\n\nIt's noticeable that blond streaks are coming back into vogue in the SSE Airtricity League.\n\nIt's a bit of throwback to my own playing days - and I couldn't stand them!\n\nIt always amazed me that players would subject themselves to a bit of dye or frosted tips.\n\nI remember when Shels didn't have a good start to the 2005 season, Pat Fenlon went through dyed duo Glen Fitzpatrick and Bobby Ryan for a shortcut - but I think he was just trying to use any excuse!\n\nBut maybe there was method to the madness.\n\nI definitely noticed a difference in players when they got their hair done.\n\nGlen was a perfect example - when he went blond it was as if it filled him full of confidence.\n\nShamrock Rovers fans will remember that his best year was when he was with the Hoops in '03 - he was absolutely on fire.\n\nI recall playing against that Rovers side and it was the guy with the blond locks who stood out - and we probably signed him after that performance.\n\nDessie Baker was another good example. It seemed to transform these guys!\n\nMaybe it was because Glen and Dessie were naturally Gingers and it was like Bruce Wayne turning into Batman.\n\nI won't name names among the current crop in the league who are reaching for the hair dye.\n\nBut it seems to work for Celtic's Scott Sinclair, so maybe they're right after all!", "date": "2017-08-18", "categories": [{"uri":

There's not much left to go. If we can push on and keep winning games, we can close in on winning that.\n\n\"Hopefully we can wrap that up soon rather than later, and then concentrate on the FAI Cup.\"\n\nMcNulty revealed that Cork set their sights very high this year - their league ambitions apart, they set a target of getting to the final of all the major domestic tournaments they were involved in.\n\nTheir defeat to Rovers in the EA Sports Cup has scuppered that, but it won't matter if the Leesiders can secure the double.\n\n\"We were obviously unlucky against Shamrock Rovers,\" insisted McNulty. \"But the main two were the league and FAI Cup.\n\n\"We're the holders of the Cup, been in the final the last two years and we want to make than three years in a row.\"\n\nAfter being pitted at home to First Division Athlone Town in the last 16 of the FAI Cup, the Corkman said: \"It's one win at a time in both competitions.\n\n\"But we're getting closer to that aim. Bray are gone now, Derry are out and Bohs are gone, so are Sligo. So you have three of the top six out of the competition already.\"\n\nThe custodian also backed up Caulfield's claim that the best has yet to come from Kieran Sadlier.\n\nThe left winger put in a man of the match performance against Bray and grabbed his first goal for Leesiders since his move last month from tonight's opponents.\n\n\"He may have missed a penalty but Kieran produced a brilliant goal,\" said McNulty. \"He doesn't seem to be a fella to leave things bother him.\n\n\"To be fair, it will take a while for home to settle in.

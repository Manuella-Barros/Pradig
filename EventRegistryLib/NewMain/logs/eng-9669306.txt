The Oklahoma City Thunder, fresh off earning the West's 1-seed, made a trade to acquire Alex Caruso from the Chicago Bulls, sending former top-10 pick Josh Giddey to Chicago in return.\n\nThis is a considerable on-court upgrade for the Thunder, who continue to load up on strong defenders up and down their roster. Giddey was targeted consistently in the playoffs for Oklahoma City, and his inability to be a shooting threat collapsed the Thunder's spacing and made life difficult on Shai Gilgeous-Alexander and the OKC offense against Dallas, who effectively ignored Giddey on the perimeter. Caruso has had his ups and downs as a shooter over his career, but knocked down 40.3 percent from deep last season on a career high 4.7 attempts per game. Adding another high-level defender (Caruso was second team All-Defense this past season) who is a more willing and capable shooter is a big boost for the Thunder in their quest to get in the conversation as a title contender next season.\n\nPer Woj, the Bulls wanted to get more playmaking, and that is unquestionably the top attribute for Giddey as a player. He is a tremendous passer and Chicago certainly needs more of that, but as noted, the Thunder struggled in the postseason with their spacing when Giddey was on the floor and the Bulls will now have to crack that code themselves.\n\nCaruso is extension eligible, and one would expect OKC to get him locked in long-term soon, while Giddey is entering the final year of his rookie deal.", "source": {"uri": "uproxx.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "UPROXX"}, "authors": [{"uri": "derrick_rossignol@uproxx.com", "name": "Derrick Rossignol", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}, {"uri": "wongo_okon@uproxx.com", "name": "Wongo Okon", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}, {"uri": "grant_sharples@uproxx.com", "name": "Grant Sharples", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Josh_Giddey", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Josh Giddey"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oklahoma_City_Thunder", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Oklahoma City Thunder"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adrian_Wojnarowski", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Adrian Wojnarowski"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chicago_Bulls", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Chicago Bulls"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ESPN", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "ESPN"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Basketball_Association", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "National Basketball Association"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chicago", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Chicago"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Chicago"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alex_Caruso", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Alex Caruso"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_playoffs", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "NBA playoffs"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shai_Gilgeous-Alexander", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Shai Gilgeous-Alexander"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dallas", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Dallas"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Dallas"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oklahoma_City", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Oklahoma City"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Oklahoma City"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Day_Trading", "label": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Day Trading", "wgt": 9}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Music/Trading", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Music/Trading", "wgt": 9}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Locks", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Locks", "wgt": 8}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Rodeo/Services", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Rodeo/Services", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Rodeo/Bullriding", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Rodeo/Bullriding", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 52}], "image": "https://uproxx.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/caruso.jpg?w=640", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9669306", "eventUri": "eng-9669306", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1372549019607843, "wgt": 223, "relevance": 1}

At 30, he can provide some veteran leadership to the youthful roster.\n\nLast year in Chicago, Caruso averaged 10.1 points, 3.8 rebounds and 3.5 assists while shooting at a 40.8% clip from three-point range. He recorded a career best 1.7 steals per game, making the NBA's All-Defensive second team -- the second straight year he's earned All-Defensive honors.\n\nAs for Giddey, the 21-year-old Australian averaged 12.3 points, 6.4 assists and 4.8 rebounds.

Making the first big splash of the summer, the Oklahoma City Thunder traded Josh Giddey to the Chicago Bulls for Alex Caruso, as first reported by ESPN's Adrian Wojnarowski.\n\nThis is a deal that makes sense for both sides. As much upside as Giddey has, he's due for an extension soon and struggled in the recent postseason. Chicago will have the opportunity to develop him into the potential star he has the 21-year-old has the upside to be. Conversely, Caruso (30) is a win-now player who impacts the game on both ends of the floor.\n\nCaruso is on an expiring deal worth roughly $9.9 million for the upcoming season. Exactly six months from the trade becoming official, he'll be eligible for a four-year, $80 million extension. That will be the key domino to fall for the Thunder, as shipping Giddey away for a one-year rental likely isn't the ideal scenario.

Caruso has earned All-Defensive honors in back-to-back seasons, making the 1st Team in the 2022-23 season and the 2nd Team in the 2023-24 season.\n\nAfter spending the first four years of his career with the Los Angeles Lakers where he was a crucial piece of their 2020 NBA championship run, Caruso signed a four-year, $37 million deal with the Bulls.\n\nUnfortunately, the Bulls failed to live up to the hype of their star-studded roster, making just one postseason appearance in the last seven seasons. The Bulls went 39-43 this past season, losing in the second round of the NBA Play-In Tournament to the Miami Heat.\n\nCaruso is likely the first of many players the Bulls will trade this offseason as they look to reset and somewhat start over.\n\nAs for the Thunder, they're coming off a surprise season in which they earned the No. 1 seed in a loaded Western Conference. Their season came to an end in the Western Conference Semifinals to the Dallas Mavericks, but they have a bright future with such a young team.\n\nCaruso will be a great addition to a core of young players that includes MVP runner-up Shai Gilgeous-Alexander, Rookie of the Year runner-up Chet Holmgren, Jalen Williams, and more. Caruso and Lu Dort will make up arguably the toughest backcourt defense in the NBA.\n\nAs for Giddey, he heads to Chicago after another strong season with OKC. The former No. 6 overall pick in the 2021 NBA Draft out of Australia has averaged 13.9 points, 7.3 rebounds, and 5.7 assists in 210 career games. He's a great ball-handler and playmaker, and will reportedly take over that role in Chicago, per Wojnarowski. Giddey dealt with off-the-court issues this season regarding allegations of a relationship with an underage girl, but a police investigation concluded without them pursuing charges against Giddey, and the NBA concluded their investigation in May.\n\nAs for Caruso, the Thunder reportedly want to lock him up, per Wojnarowksi. He's eligible for a four-year, approximately $80 million extension in six months from now.\n\nThe NBA Finals concluded on Monday and the NBA Draft is less than a week away -- but the NBA offseason is already in full swung.", "source": {"uri": "newsweek.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Newsweek"}, "authors": [{"uri": "noah_camras@newsweek.com", "name": "Noah Camras", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JJ_Redick", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "JJ Redick"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los_Angeles_Lakers", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles Lakers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chicago_Bulls", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Chicago Bulls"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Basketball_Association", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "National Basketball Association"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Josh_Giddey", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Josh Giddey"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trae_Young", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Trae Young"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atlanta_Hawks", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Atlanta Hawks"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adrian_Wojnarowski", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Adrian Wojnarowski"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oklahoma_City_Thunder", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Oklahoma City Thunder"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Head_coach", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Head coach"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alex_Caruso", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Alex Caruso"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2023_NBA_playoffs", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "2023 NBA playoffs"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dallas_Mavericks", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Dallas Mavericks"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_Finals", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "NBA Finals"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miami_Heat", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Miami Heat"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_Conference_(NBA)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Western Conference (NBA)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chet_Holmgren", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Chet Holmgren"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luguentz_Dort", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Luguentz Dort"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shai_Gilgeous-Alexander", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Shai Gilgeous-Alexander"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_Rookie_of_the_Year_Award", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "NBA Rookie of the Year Award"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_Most_Valuable_Player_Award", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "NBA Most Valuable Player Award"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assist_(basketball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Assist (basketball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rebound_(basketball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Rebound (basketball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chicago", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Chicago"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Chicago"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Fan_Pages", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Fan Pages", "wgt": 16}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Coaching", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Coaching", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Rodeo/Bullriding", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Rodeo/Bullriding", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/History", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/History", "wgt": 17}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Science", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Science", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://d.newsweek.com/en/full/2413993/alex-caruso-bulls.webp?w=1600&h=900&q=88&f=aa1ceccebdf3c2bd5e6e00e76842709d", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9669306", "eventUri": "eng-9669306", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1294117647058823, "wgt": 206, "relevance": 1}

Caruso's arrival could be seen as an addition comparable to the Golden State Warriors acquisition of Andre Iguodala in 2013. At the time of that deal, Iguodala was also 30 years old.\n\nThe Bulls have been determined to find a playmaker to replace Lonzo Ball, and Giddey, 21, comes with an All-Star potential that would unlikely be realized with the Thunder because of the playmaking star power who surrounded him. Point guard Shai Gilgeous-Alexander was the MVP runner-up and there's an expectation that the franchise wants to give 7-footer Chet Holmgren even more playmaking duties.\n\nGiddey was the sixth overall pick in the 2021 NBA draft and developed into one of the league's most creative young playmakers. The Bulls will offer him an opportunity to have the ball in his hands and more freedom to pass and score. Chicago needed an engine for its offense, and the Bulls land that with Giddey.\n\nGiddey played a career-high 80 games for the Thunder this past season, but eventually started to come off the bench in the Western Conference playoffs. His scoring average dropped from 16.6 points to 12.3 points last season as his role with the Thunder evolved. Giddey has 11 career triple-doubles, fourth most by a player at age 21 or younger all-time, trailing only Luka Doncic, Magic Johnson and Ben Simmons, according to ESPN Stats & Information research.\n\nCaruso shot 41 percent on 3-pointers and ranked fourth in steals in the NBA last season. Caruso was second in defensive half-court matchups against 2024 NBA All-Star players, trailing only his new Thunder teammate, Lu Dortz, according to ESPN Stats & Information.\n\nCaruso's addition gives the Thunder three of the best on-ball defenders on one team among league guards, including Caruso, Dort and Cason Wallace.\n\nCaruso will be eligible for a four-year, $80 million contract extension six months from the date of this trade. He's entering the final year of his contract. The Thunder made the deal with hopes of keeping Caruso as an integral part of their team for the long term, sources said.\n\nGiddey is eligible to negotiate a rookie-scale extension as a member of the draft class of 2021.", "source": {"uri": "espn.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "ESPN.com"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Josh_Giddey", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Josh Giddey"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chicago_Bulls", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Chicago Bulls"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andre_Iguodala", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Andre Iguodala"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lonzo_Ball", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Lonzo Ball"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_All-Star_Game", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "NBA All-Star Game"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sam_Presti", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Sam Presti"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_manager", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "General manager"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golden_State_Warriors", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Golden State Warriors"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chet_Holmgren", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Chet Holmgren"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_draft", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "NBA draft"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_playoffs", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "NBA playoffs"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shai_Gilgeous-Alexander", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Shai Gilgeous-Alexander"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_Most_Valuable_Player_Award", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "NBA Most Valuable Player Award"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Point_guard", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Point guard"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_Conference_(NBA)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Western Conference (NBA)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ESPN", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "ESPN"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chicago", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Chicago"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Chicago"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Double-double", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Double-double"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ben_Simmons", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Ben Simmons"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magic_Johnson", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Magic Johnson"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steal_(basketball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Steal (basketball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Draft_(sports)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Draft (sports)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Three-point_field_goal", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Three-point field goal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Basketball_Association", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "National Basketball Association"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luka_Don\u010di\u0107", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Luka Don\u010di\u0107"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Amateur", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Amateur", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Professional", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Professional", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Cue_Sports/Pool", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Cue Sports/Pool", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Rodeo/Bullriding", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Rodeo/Bullriding", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/History", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/History", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 97}], "image": "https://a1.espncdn.com/combiner/i?img=%2Fphoto%2F2024%2F0620%2Fr1348360_1296x729_16%2D9.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9669306", "eventUri": "eng-9669306", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1294117647058823, "wgt": 202, "relevance": 1}

Mandatory Credit: Kamil Krzaczynski-USA TODAY Sports / Kamil Krzaczynski-USA TODAY Sports\n\nIt was announced on Thursday by ESPN's Adrian Wojnarowski that the Chicago Bulls and OKC Thunder had agreed to a massive trade. Per Wojnarowski, the Bulls are sending All-Defensive guard Alex Caruso to OKC in exchange for Josh Giddey.\n\nIn a series of Tweets, Wojnarowski wrote the following:\n\n\"The trade delivers the Thunder one of the league's most coveted role players, a 30-year old guard who GM Sam Presti has long pursued for the Western Conference's No. 1 seed. Caruso's arrival could be seen as an addition comparable to the Golden State Warriors acquisition of Andre Iguodala in 2013. Both were 30 years old. The Bulls have been determined to find a playmaker to replace Lonzo Ball, and Giddey, 21, comes with an All-Star potential that would unlikely be realized with the Thunder because of the playmaking starpower who surrounded him. The Bulls will offer him an opportunity to have the ball in his hands and so much more freedom pass and score.\"\n\nThis is a massive deal, particularly for OKC, who lands one of the league's best role players to strengthen their already very solid core. The first seed in the Western Conference this past year, OKC often thrived in spite of Giddey, as he was an imperfect fit in their starting lineup.\n\nCaruso will make OKC that much better, while Chicago takes a chance on Giddey.\n\nJJ Redick Fires Back at Former NBA Star Over Viral Michael Jordan Statement", "source": {"uri": "si.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Sports Illustrated"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chicago_Bulls", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Chicago Bulls"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oklahoma_City_Thunder", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Oklahoma City Thunder"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alex_Caruso", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Alex Caruso"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Josh_Giddey", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Josh Giddey"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shai_Gilgeous-Alexander", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Shai Gilgeous-Alexander"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Center", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United Center"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adrian_Wojnarowski", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Adrian Wojnarowski"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ESPN", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "ESPN"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chicago", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Chicago"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Chicago"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sam_Presti", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Sam Presti"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andre_Iguodala", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Andre Iguodala"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_manager", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "General manager"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golden_State_Warriors", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Golden State Warriors"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JJ_Redick", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "JJ Redick"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lonzo_Ball", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Lonzo Ball"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_All-Star_Game", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "NBA All-Star Game"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Jordan", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Michael Jordan"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_Conference_(NBA)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Western Conference (NBA)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Basketball_Association", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "National Basketball Association"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Business/Agriculture_and_Forestry/Field_Crops", "label": "dmoz/Business/Agriculture and Forestry/Field Crops", "wgt": 9}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Business_Services/Barter", "label": "dmoz/Business/Business Services/Barter", "wgt": 8}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Rodeo", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Rodeo", "wgt": 9}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Rodeo/Services", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Rodeo/Services", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Rodeo/Bullriding", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Rodeo/Bullriding", "wgt": 18}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 71}], "image": "https://images2.minutemediacdn.com/image/upload/c_crop,w_2333,h_1312,x_0,y_715/c_fill,w_1440,ar_16:9,f_auto,q_auto,g_auto/images/ImagnImages/mmsport/bulls_news/01j0vr9tf4vkmhgrwp07.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9669306", "eventUri": "eng-9669306", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "date": "2013-01-", "textStart": 0, "textEnd": 6}], "sentiment": 0.2705882352941176, "wgt": 198, "relevance": 1}

Top scorer DeMar DeRozan, talented youngster Patrick Williams, and veteran big man Andre Drummond are all set to hit free agency at the end of the month. Furthermore, there are continuous rumblings that Zach LaVine could be traded in the next few weeks.\n\nAlso Read: Chicago Bulls desperately trying to trade Zach LaVine to multiple playoff contenders\n\nOn Thursday, the first step in that change occurred when the team traded two-time All-Defensive Team player Alex Caruso. ESPN NBA insider Adrian Wojnarowski was the first to break the news when he revealed the guard is headed back to the Oklahoma City Thunder for 2021 sixth overall draft pick Josh Giddey.\n\nThunder head coach Mark Daigneault was Alex Caruso's head coach for the Oklahoma City Blue back in 2016-17, so not only is he returning to the franchise that originally signed him as an undrafted free agent, but he will once again play for his former G-League, but this time on a team with NBA Finals hopes in 2024-25.\n\nJosh Giddey stats (2023-24): 12.3 PPG, 6.4 RPG, 4.8 APG, 34% 3PT\n\nCaruso has been a played linked to various rumors over the last year, however, Chicago chose to hold on to him due to his value as an impact 3-and-D specialist. However, he isn't a player that will help take them to a higher level in 2024-25.\n\nGiddey was expected to be a future star on OKC, and seemed to be heading that way after putting up just under 17 points and nearly eight rebounds a game in his sophomore season. Unfortunately, he regressed this season as players like Chet Holmgren, Cason Wallace, and Lugentz Dort took on bigger roles with the No. 1 seed in the Western Conference Playoffs.\n\nBut at only 21 years old, the swingman could easily look more like he did two years ago under Chicago Bulls head coach Josh Giddey.

Mandatory Credit: David Banks-USA TODAY Sports / David Banks-USA TODAY Sports\n\nWhile it was just rumors and speculation, two-time all defensive guard Alex Caruso had been rumored as a potential trade target for the Atlanta Hawks this offseason. Now, Caruso is being dealt to the Oklahoma City Thunder in the offseason's first blockbuster trade. ESPN's Adrian Wojnarowski dropped a bombshell trade just minutes ago that sends Caruso to the Thunder for Josh Giddey.\n\nHere is what else Wojnarowski had to say about the trade:\n\n\"The trade delivers the Thunder one of the league's most coveted role players, a 30-year old guard who GM Sam Presti has long pursued for the Western Conference's No. 1 seed. Caruso's arrival could be seen as an addition comparable to the Golden State Warriors acquisition of Andre Iguodala in 2013. Both were 30 years old.\n\nThe Bulls have been determined to find a playmaker to replace Lonzo Ball, and Giddey , 21, comes with an All-Star potential that would unlikely be realized with the Thunder because of the playmaking starpower who surrounded him. The Bulls will offer him an opportunity to have the ball in his hands and so much more freedom pass and score.\n\nCaruso is entering the final year of his deal and becomes eligible for a four-year, approximately $80M extension exactly six months from the date of this trade. The Thunder made the trade with the hope to have Caruso as an integral player for the long-term.\"\n\nThis is obviously massive news across the league, as it gives the Thunder a huge piece to try and go win a championship this season while the Bulls get a young player in return. While there were no real reports linking Caruso to the Hawks, it was easy to see him as a potential fit next to Trae Young, as a point-of-attack defender (something Atlanta sorely needs) and a good three-point shooter. Caruso could make a weak defense better, but now he will hope to make a really good defense the best in the league.\n\nBleacher Report analyst Grant Hughes listed Caruso as the top \"ambitious\" trade candidate for the Hawks this offseason:\n\n\"The Atlanta Hawks seem likely to bust up the Trae Young-Dejounte Murray backcourt, but it's unclear which of the two guards is likeliest to go. If it's Murray who winds up leaving via trade, Atlanta should focus on supporting Young with the best defensive running mate possible.\n\nThat sounds like Alex Caruso, an All-Defensive honoree in each of the last two seasons.\n\nCaruso's current team, the Chicago Bulls, already have Coby White in place as their point guard. That means a Murray-for-Caruso swap wouldn't make sense. Atlanta could send Murray to a destination in greater need of his services and reroute some of the assets to the Bulls in a package for the star stopper.\n\nNo guard who logged at least 25 games last season posted a higher Defensive Estimated Plus/Minus than Caruso, who rates as one of the rare backcourt players whose impact approaches that of the typically more valuable paint-protecting big man. His ability to disrupt at the point of attack, blow up screening actions and force opposing ball-handlers away from their spots can change the outcome of entire games.\n\nMurray overlapped more than expected with Young, and the Hawks didn't look nearly different enough after adding him at the 2023 trade deadline. Caruso would bring a more fundamental change to Atlanta's makeup, adding an element of predatory defense that simply hasn't been there.\"\n\nNow that Caruso is off the board, the Hawks will have to look elsewhere.", "source": {"uri": "si.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Sports Illustrated"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basketball_positions", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Basketball positions"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atlanta_Hawks", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Atlanta Hawks"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chicago_Bulls", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Chicago Bulls"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alex_Caruso", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Alex Caruso"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Josh_Giddey", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Josh Giddey"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trae_Young", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Trae Young"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_playoffs", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "NBA playoffs"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Center", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United Center"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adrian_Wojnarowski", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Adrian Wojnarowski"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sam_Presti", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Sam Presti"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_manager", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "General manager"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oklahoma_City_Thunder", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Oklahoma City Thunder"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ESPN", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "ESPN"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chicago", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Chicago"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Chicago"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lonzo_Ball", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Lonzo Ball"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_All-Star_Game", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "NBA All-Star Game"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andre_Iguodala", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Andre Iguodala"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Three-point_field_goal", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Three-point field goal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golden_State_Warriors", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Golden State Warriors"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atlanta", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Atlanta, Georgia"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Atlanta, Georgia"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coby_White", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Coby White"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Draft_(sports)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Draft (sports)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bleacher_Report", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Bleacher Report"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Point_guard", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Point guard"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Day_Trading", "label": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Day Trading", "wgt": 16}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Commodities_and_Futures", "label": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Commodities and Futures", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Music/Trading", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Music/Trading", "wgt": 17}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Business_Services/Barter", "label": "dmoz/Business/Business Services/Barter", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/International_Business_and_Trade/Associations", "label": "dmoz/Business/International Business and Trade/Associations", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 97}], "image": "https://images2.minutemediacdn.com/image/upload/c_crop,w_4343,h_2442,x_0,y_0/c_fill,w_1440,ar_16:9,f_auto,q_auto,g_auto/images/ImagnImages/mmsport/all_hawks/01j0vr1hhk76me6k82rw.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9669306", "eventUri": "eng-9669306", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "date": "2017-04-", "textStart": 0, "textEnd": 6}], "sentiment": 0.2313725490196079, "wgt": 174, "relevance": 1}

Everything to know about the Bulls' new player", "body": "The Bulls traded Alex Caruso on Thursday in exchange for Thunder guard Josh Giddey, a source confirmed to NBC Sports Chicago's K.C. Johnson.\n\nGiddey, 21, is an Australian-born, 6-foot-8 guard going into his fourth year in the NBA. Initially, he was drafted with the No. 6 pick in the 2021 NBA Draft by the Thunder.\n\nHe's a strong floor general and a crafty, pass-first guard with impeccable size for his position. Giddey can fill the stat sheet with ease, as he's averaged 13.9 points, 7.3 rebounds and 5.7 assists over the first three years of his NBA career.\n\nHowever, his shooting needs work. His offensive work is prominent in transition and creatively finishing around the rim. But his outside shooting is grim, as he shot 31% from downtown last season. To his credit, it's improved from the 26.3% he finished with his rookie season.\n\nHow does he fit with the Bulls?\n\nThis is the question Art\u016bras Karni\u0161ovas will have to answer with additional moves this offseason. The Bulls' backcourt remains how it was before they traded Caruso: crowded. With Giddey, Coby White and Lonzo Ball, the Bulls have arguably too much to work with in the backcourt.\n\nCoby White is coming off a career year that saw him finish with the league's third-most minutes played. He finished the season averaging 19.1 points, 4.5 rebounds and 5.1 assists per game on 44.7% shooting from the field and 37.6% shooting from downtown. There's no question he's part of the Bulls' big-picture plan.\n\nAs for Ball, he's hoping to make a historic return to the floor after missing the last 2.5 years with ongoing knee injuries. He's undergone three separate surgeries on his right knee, which have kept him sidelined since January 2022. The Bulls are hoping he can return to the floor this season.\n\nSince Ball's absence, it's felt like the team has needed a half-court organizer who can help players get into a rhythm, collect the floor, handle the ball and manufacture offense in transition. That's largely what Giddey can do on the offensive side of the ball, which begs the question of Ball's presence on the team.\n\nIn trading for Giddey, the Bulls inhale the final year of his rookie deal, which is slated to earn him $8.3 million this season. He's rookie extension eligible until the start of next season. If no extension is reached, he will become a restricted free agent next summer.\n\nIt's worth noting last season Giddey was accused of maintaining an inappropriate relationship with an underage girl. But in January, The Newport Beach, California, Police Department said that it was \"unable to corroborate any criminal activity.\" Giddey never faced any punishment from the league and played through the accusations.\n\nThis is likely just the start of a transformative offseason for the Bulls. Vice President Art\u016bras Karni\u0161ovas admitted in April the core at hand \"hasn't worked\" and \"everything is on the table\" for changes this offseason.", "source": {"uri": "sports.yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo Sports"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Josh_Giddey", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Josh Giddey"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chicago_Bulls", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Chicago Bulls"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Basketball_Association", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "National Basketball Association"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assist_(basketball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Assist (basketball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rebound_(basketball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Rebound (basketball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coby_White", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Coby White"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_draft", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "NBA draft"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBC_Sports_Chicago", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "NBC Sports Chicago"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rookie", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Rookie"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alex_Caruso", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Alex Caruso"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Art\u016bras_Karni\u0161ovas", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Art\u016bras Karni\u0161ovas"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lonzo_Ball", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Lonzo Ball"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Restricted_free_agent", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Restricted free agent"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_salary_cap", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "NBA salary cap"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newport_Beach,_California", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Newport Beach, California"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vice_President_of_the_United_States", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Vice President of the United States"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Amateur", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Amateur", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Guns/Competition_Shooting", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Guns/Competition Shooting", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Rodeo/Services", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Rodeo/Services", "wgt": 20}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Rodeo/Bullriding", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Rodeo/Bullriding", "wgt": 24}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Costumes/By_Type", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Costumes/By Type", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 97}], "image": "https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/htvy3X1fvnyihAaEFl27RQ--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyMDA7aD04MDA7Y2Y9d2VicA--/https://media.zenfs.com/en/csnchicago.com/84b7a524dcc3403e4dcb7c7b7fe2b0ef", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9669306", "eventUri": "eng-9669306", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.01960784313725483, "wgt": 456618985, "relevance": 2}

He was on the all-defense first team in 2023 and the second team in 2024.\n\nThe Thunder also have Cason Wallace, a second-team all-rookie selection this past season, in place at point guard.\n\nAP Sports Writer Cliff Brunt in Oklahoma City contributed to this report.\n\nAP NBA: https://apnews.com/hub/NBA", "source": {"uri": "gazette.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Colorado Springs Gazette"}, "authors": [{"uri": "andrew_seligman@gazette.com", "name": "Andrew Seligman", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Josh_Giddey", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Josh Giddey"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chicago_Bulls", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Chicago Bulls"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alex_Caruso", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Alex Caruso"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rebound_(basketball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Rebound (basketball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Basketball_Association", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "National Basketball Association"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minnesota_Timberwolves", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Minnesota Timberwolves"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assist_(basketball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Assist (basketball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Three-point_field_goal", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Three-point field goal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newport_Beach,_California", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Newport Beach, California"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oklahoma_City_Thunder", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Oklahoma City Thunder"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ESPN", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "ESPN"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basketball", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Basketball"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minneapolis", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Minneapolis"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Minneapolis"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chicago", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Chicago"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Chicago"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gordon_Hayward", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Gordon Hayward"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Point_guard", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Point guard"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oklahoma_City", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Oklahoma City"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Oklahoma City"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_playoffs", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "NBA playoffs"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los_Angeles_Lakers", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles Lakers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shooting_guard", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Shooting guard"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_men's_national_soccer_team", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "United States men's national soccer team"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Associated_Press", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Associated Press"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Professional", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Professional", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Music/Trading", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Music/Trading", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Fan_Pages", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Fan Pages", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/History", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/History", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Science", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Science", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://bloximages.newyork1.vip.townnews.com/gazette.com/content/tncms/assets/v3/editorial/8/70/870ae333-43e6-535a-9c41-8ea4736e0024/6674adbbbc22c.image.jpg?crop=1763%2C926%2C0%2C124&resize=438%2C230&order=crop%2Cresize", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9669306", "eventUri": "eng-9669306", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-07-06", "textStart": 572, "textEnd": 578}], "sentiment": -0.1058823529411764, "wgt": 456619716, "relevance": 2}

Giddey is coming off a career-low season in both points per game (12.3) and rebounds per game (6.4), but at just 21 years old and with a change of scenery, it could lead to the Australian breaking out in Chicago.\n\nWojnarowski also reported that part of the reason for dealing Caruso from a Bulls perspective was because he is in the last year of his contract and the Thunder now have a chance to sign him to an extension in early January, six months from when the trade is made official. Caruso provides a strong defensive presence for the young upstart Thunder while also helping keep the ball in Shai Gilgeous-Alexander's hands as much as possible on offense.\n\nCaruso is coming off a career-best year which saw him average 10.5 points and 1.7 steals per game, tying him for third in the NBA.", "source": {"uri": "thecomeback.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Comeback"}, "authors": [{"uri": "robert_o_neill@thecomeback.com", "name": "Robert O'Neill", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Josh_Giddey", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Josh Giddey"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Basketball_Association", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "National Basketball Association"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_Rookie_of_the_Year_Award", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "NBA Rookie of the Year Award"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adrian_Wojnarowski", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Adrian Wojnarowski"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chicago_Bulls", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Chicago Bulls"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oklahoma_City_Thunder", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Oklahoma City Thunder"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ESPN", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "ESPN"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alex_Caruso", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Alex Caruso"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Points_per_game", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Points per game"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Draft_(sports)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Draft (sports)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rebound_(basketball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Rebound (basketball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chicago", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Chicago"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Chicago"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steal_(basketball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Steal (basketball)"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Day_Trading", "label": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Day Trading", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Music/Trading", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Music/Trading", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Fan_Pages", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Fan Pages", "wgt": 17}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/History", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/History", "wgt": 18}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Science", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Science", "wgt": 17}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 90}], "image": "https://cdn1.thecomeback.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/USATSI_20153215-scaled-e1687984989962.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9669306", "eventUri": "eng-9669306", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1058823529411765, "wgt": 456620167, "relevance": 2}

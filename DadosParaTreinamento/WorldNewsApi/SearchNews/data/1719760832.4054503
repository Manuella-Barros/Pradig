O\u2019Hara will make her production debut with \u201cRipe!\u201d, a short film celebrating the ripening of LGBTQIA+ identities and shedding queer shame. Set in rural Spain against the backdrop of a passionate soccer rivalry, the story follows young protagonists Sophie (Raina Landolfi) and Gloria (Rita Roca) as they navigate their relationship. Ripe!, an 18-minute short film, will premiere on June 8. Juxtapose Studio O\u2019Hara, who will retire from soccer at the end of the ongoing NWSL season, took up the executive producer role in February 2023 after her college friend, Luke Anderson, the co-founder of Juxtapose Studio, reached out to her. Anderson needed another executive producer and found O\u2019Hara to be the right fit, given her strong ties to soccer and the LGBTQIA+ community. The U.S. soccer captain then signed up with her fianc\u00e9e, Kameryn Stanhouse, who runs O\u2019House Productions. Stepping into the role of an executive producer, O\u2019Hara said she drew upon her own life experiences as a queer individual. \u201cEvery queer person has their own unique story in terms of coming to confidence or acceptance in yourself,\u201d O\u2019Hara tells me. \u201cThere were a lot of queer people that worked on this film, and we all contributed in different ways to get it to the best possible version of itself.\u201d MORE FOR YOU Trump Trial Prosecutor Ends Closing Argument After Nearly 5 Hours\u2014Jury Instructions Set For Wednesday Gas Explosion In Downtown Youngstown Ohio Injures At Least 7 Trump Lashes Out At Robert De Niro After Actor Calls Him A \u2018Tyrant\u2019 Outside Courthouse The directors wanted a storyline similar to the dreamlike romance of \u201cBefore Sunrise\u201d or \u201cCall Me By Your Name\u201d, but for lesbians. That\u2019s how they came up with \u201cRipe!\u201d But what was the idea behind the title? \u201cIt is this idea of ripening into who you truly are,\u201d O\u2019Hara explained. \u201cThere are notes of figuring out your sexuality and just like as a relationship grows and ripens into hopefully like a perfect right piece. Like a beautiful ending and exactly how you would want it to be. \u201cIt's the shell from the other side of shame is like is what we like to say.\u201d Importance Of Visibility A still from the short film. Juxtapose Studio Though O\u2019Hara does not have a background in filmmaking, she has always had an interest in media and entertainment, having been part of Just Women\u2019s Sports\u2019 video series \u201cKelley On The Street\u201d. \u201cI know how important it is to produce films with these storylines because it's the way that you can make them the most visible,\u201d the 35-year-old said. \u201cI know the power of film and the entertainment industry and how visibility is so important.\u201d \u201cAnd I think that sport and entertainment are the two things that can really unite people. \u201cWithout knowing, I've always maybe been destined to get into this industry. So I wouldn't say it was from when I was a little kid\u2026 but I'm very excited about the potential of doing more in this world because of the impact that you can have on people.\u201d With the help of directing duo and queer activists Olivia Mitchell and Kerry Furrh from Tusk Creative, the film seeks to explore the intersection between athletics and queer love, as O\u2019Hara was determined to amplify underrepresented voices through creative storytelling. With \u201cRipe!\u201d set to premiere at The Tribeca Festival next week, O\u2019Hara is poised to make a significant impact off the field, championing queer visibility through powerful storytelling. \u201cWe want to get this short film out into the world, into festivals for people to be able to see it, because so many people were excited about just the trailer alone on social media,\u201d O\u2019Hara said. \u201cBut our ultimate goal is getting the feature made and having even more people see this and experience the intersection of sport and queerness.\u201d The Way Ahead The 2024 NWSL season will be Kelley O'Hara's final in soccer.

She made 160 appearances for the USWNT and was one of only 12 players in team history to play in four World Cups when she made the 2023 World Cup roster. Follow me on Twitter or LinkedIn.

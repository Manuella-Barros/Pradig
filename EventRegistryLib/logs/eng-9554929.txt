He also described bouts of 'emotional distress' since he was a child.\n\nHis lawyer Marco Guarino said Johnston had always accepted responsibility for assaulting his wife that night.\n\nBut the judge Lady Drummond refused his plea for bail ahead of sentencing, telling Johnston: 'I have no need to tell you that this is a serious and violent offence.\n\n'You repeatedly strangled her, injured her and put her life in danger in what must have been absolutely terrifying circumstances for her.\n\n'I am afraid, Mr Johnston, that your status has now changed, you have been convicted of a very serious crime and you will be remanded meantime.'\n\nMORE : Man's extreme efforts to get his ex back lands him with a restraining order\n\nMORE : Man jailed for 22 years for making testicle salad then eating it", "source": {"uri": "metro.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "Metro"}, "authors": [{"uri": "sam_corbishley@metro.co.uk", "name": "Sam Corbishley", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Internet"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mac_(computer)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Mac (computer)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/High_Court_of_Justice", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "High Court of Justice"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Viral_phenomenon", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Viral phenomenon"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tumblr", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Tumblr"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kim_Kardashian", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Kim Kardashian"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_media", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Social media"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colonsay", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Colonsay"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Colonsay"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glasgow", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Glasgow"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Glasgow"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inner_Hebrides", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Inner Hebrides"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Ellen_DeGeneres_Show", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "The Ellen DeGeneres Show"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pub", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Pub"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taylor_Swift", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Taylor Swift"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kanye_West", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Kanye West"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domestic_violence", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Domestic violence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Justin_Bieber", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Justin Bieber"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twitter", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Twitter"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grenada", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Grenada"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Grenada"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Woke", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Woke"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Restraining_order", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Restraining order"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Remand_(court_procedure)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Remand (court procedure)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Testicle", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Testicle"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lawyer", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Lawyer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bail", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Bail"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Violent_crime", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Violent crime"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Death/In_Memoriam", "label": "dmoz/Society/Death/In Memoriam", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 94}], "image": "https://metro.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/SEC_203353708-2f42.jpg?quality=90&strip=all&crop=0px%2C0px%2C1200px%2C630px&resize=1200%2C630", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9554929", "eventUri": "eng-9554929", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.1607843137254902, "wgt": 227, "relevance": 1}

The 38-year-old, who will now be remanded in custody until he is sentenced in June, lived on the Isle of Colonsay with wife Grace following their 2015 marriage.\n\nThe couple found fame online after Grace's mother wore a dress to their wedding that sparked a global debate over its true colours - black and blue or white and gold. Nicknamed 'The Dress That Broke the Internet', it became a social media storm when it was first shared on Tumblr by wedding guest Caitlin McNeill.\n\nThe couple found fame online after Grace's mother wore a dress to their wedding that sparked a global debate over its true colours - black and blue or white and gold\n\nCaitlin initially posted to ask for help in deciding what colour the dress really was, and the image went viral. Celebrities including Kim Kardashian and Ellen DeGeneres were caught up in the colour debate, with the latter even inviting the pair on her talk show, where they were handed $10,000 and a trip to Grenada.\n\nBut in their married life, Grace was left fearing for her safety. Johnston turned on his wife at their home on the remote Scottish island on 6 March 2022 and threatened her, saying: \"Someone is going to die.\"\n\nKeir Johnston and Grace on the Ellen Show\n\nJohnston had originally attended the High Court last July where he faced allegations that he had conducted a nearly 11-year campaign of serious domestic violence and coercive control towards his wife - but denied all charges against him at the time. However, today the High Court heard how Johnston had a history of domestic abuse towards his wife.\n\nChris MacIntosh, prosecutor for the Crown, told Lady Drummond and the court how Grace lived in fear of her abusive husband. He said: \"There is no permanent police presence on the island, and she was in a situation where she felt trapped.\"\n\nKeir Johnston appeared with his wife Grace on the Ellen Show after a picture of a dress worn to their wedding went viral\n\nGrace had defied her husband's demands not to attend a job interview on the mainland and just days later found herself in a life-threatening situation. On the day of the attack, Johnston was drinking at a pub quiz and sent several messages to his spouse, with one reading: \"You should support me but you do not.\"\n\nConcerned for her husband, Grace later returned home where Johnston awoke from his sleep and announced he would be leaving her. The pair then headed outside of their cottage before Johnston grabbed Grace and threw her to the ground.\n\nThe pair were married in 2015 but Johnston would go on to leave her in fear of her life\n\nMr Macintosh said: \"Johnston woke up and said that he was going to leave her. She went outside the property to stop him leaving. He followed her and pinned her to the ground.\n\n\"He placed both knees on her arms, so she was unable to move. He then began strangling her with both his hands. She was initially able to scream and feared for her life and believed Johnston intended to kill her as he was very forceful.\"\n\nDespite suffering severe bruising from the attack, Grace didn't require any medical treatment. Defending lawyer Marco Guarino told how Johnston had accepted responsibility for the assault.\n\nHowever, Lady Drummond denied Johnston bail and placed him in custody, telling him: \"I have no need to tell you that this is a serious and violent offence. \"You repeatedly strangled her, injured her and put her life in danger in what must have been absolutely terrifying circumstances for her.\n\n\"I am afraid, Mr. Johnston, that your status has now changed, you have been convicted of a very serious crime and you will be remanded meantime.\"\n\nSentencing will be made on 6 June following reports.\n\nFor confidential support, call the 24-hour National Domestic Abuse Freephone Helpline on 0808 2000 247 or visit womensaid.co.uk.

The victory snapped the Yankees (53-31) season-high four-game losing streak and halted the Blue Jays (37-44) mini two-game win streak before 34,791 at Rogers Centre. Toronto starter Yusei Kikuchi (4-8) cruised through the first five innings, giving up only a run on one hit and striking out seven with a walk.But after Jahmai Jones and Anthony Volpe singled to begin the sixth inning, Soto slammed his longball to right field to provide the Yankees with a 4-3 advantage and end Kikuchi\u2019s outing. Three batters later, after J.D. Davis doubled home Aaron Judge, Torres followed suit with a two-run shot off reliever Nate Pearson. Former Toronto starter Marcus Stroman also was outstanding through four innings. He gave up a first-inning run when George Springer singled home Bo Bichette. It was Springer\u2019s ninth RBI in three games and fourth consecutive hit after smashing two three-run homers and adding a single in the series opener on Thursday. The Blue Jays got to Stroman in the fifth inning for two runs to end his evening. Toronto loaded the bases when Spencer Horwitz was hit by a pitch after singles from Isiah Kiner-Falefa and Bichette. A slow roller to second base from Vladimir Guerrero Jr. forced Horwitz out at second but scored Kiner-Falefa. A Justin Turner walk reloaded the bases and another run scored when Springer was hit by a pitch. He later left the game with a left-hand contusion. Guerrero killed the rally when he attempted to score on a pitch that got by Yankees catcher Jose Trevino. But Trevino recovered in time to catch Guerrero at the plate. Stroman lasted 4 1/3 innings. He surrendered three runs on five hits with three strikeouts and three walks. The Yankees tied the game in the fourth inning. Judge smartly stopped on his way to second base after Horwitz fielded Davis\u2019s grounder in front of Judge. Horwitz threw out Davis, but Soto scored from second base when Guerrero\u2019s throw was to the first-base side. Guerrero smashed his 13th homer of the season off reliever Luke Weaver in the seventh inning for Guerrero\u2019s fifth in seven games.Alex Verdugo and D.J. LeMahieu restored New York\u2019s four-run lead with back-to-back run-scoring doubles in the eighth inning off reliever Trevor Richards. New York piled on with seven more runs in the ninth to increase its hit total to 18. Yankees reliever Michael Tonkin (3-3) registered the win. HIT STREAK Kiner-Falefa extended his hit streak to 12 games with his leadoff single to centre in the fifth inning. He added his seventh homer of the season in the sixth inning. It\u2019s the longest-hitting streak by a Blue Jay in 2024. ON DECK Chris Bassitt (6-6) will start for the Blue Jays in the third game of the four-game series on Saturday.

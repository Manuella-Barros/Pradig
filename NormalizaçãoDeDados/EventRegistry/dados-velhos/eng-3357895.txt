Filmed by one of the witnesses, Lashaunda Malone, the video was posted on Facebook on Saturday morning. It had garnered more than 1 million views and was shared more than 25,000 times at the time of publishing this story.\n\nThe altercation began after the officer pulled Hubbard over a traffic violation, and asked him to come out of the car so that he could be taken into custody, but the driver ignored the commands, according to police. Hubbard was later charged with driving under suspension and resisting arrest, police said.\n\nTwo police officers were involved in the incident that lasted for more than three minutes. The police officer, who engaged in the violent behavior, is currently on paid administrative leave after the video of the violent arrest went viral.\n\nThe incident started around 10:30 a.m. EDT when the officer concerned took note of traffic violation by Hubbard, according to an official statement by Euclid police. In the video, a woman, who was presumably Hubbard's friend, is also seen standing nearby and shouting at the cops to not beat Hubbard.\n\nMalone, who recorded the whole episode, was also heard saying, \"What's going on?\" Another voice of a young girl, probably Malone's daughter, was heard as she asked, \"Mommy, what's going on?\"\n\nAfter few minutes of punching, one of the cops finally got Hubbard on his stomach and handcuffed him. Soon, both the cops are seen handcuffing the girl as well.\n\nThe identity of the arresting officer hasn't yet been released by the police, but in the statement, it said that he was treated at a local hospital and was released soon after. The police are investigating the incident.\n\n\"It's the mission of the Euclid Police Department to provide professional and transparent service to the residents, business owners, and visitors to the City of Euclid. This entire incident will be reviewed, in detail, so that the public can have a full and open understanding of the series of events that eventually led to this violent encounter, the statement read.\n\nThere have been several incidents in the past when a police officer made a violent arrest. In July, a video of a California woman, who was arrested in a similar manner went viral. Juanita Mendez-Medrano, 52, who worked as street side flower vendor, was arrested after she refused to cooperate with the police officer.\n\nPolice were patrolling the area due to a function in a nearby school, an official statement by Riverside County Sheriff's Department said. The video had sparked outrage among people.\n\nIn June, a video emerged where a driver was dragged from his vehicle and punched several times and also kneed by a police officer over a traffic violation in Minnesota. The state ACLU termed the incident as a \"disturbing and completely unnecessary\" example of excessive use of force, according to the Guardian. The officer was also said to have abused the driver.\n\n\"I had no idea what was going on when I was approached and attacked by this officer,\" Anthony Promvongsa, the man being arrested in the 2016 footage, told the ACLU.\n\nIn May, a cellphone video of a teenager's arrest in Texas showed a police officer beating the girl; however, the allegations were dismissed by the police department. The police and the teen's family had their own versions of the incident. While police said it was the girl who assaulted one of their officers, the family insisted the video showed it was the police and not the girl, who punched, CNN reported.", "time": "11:10:00"}

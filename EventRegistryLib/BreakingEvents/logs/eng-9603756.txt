We plan to build right across the UK, from cities and towns to far-flung farms and island communities. Ultimately, we'll reach as many as 30 million premises by the end of the decade if there's a supportive political and regulatory environment.\"\n\n\"Over time, we've learnt to deliver predictably, consistently and at a rapid pace - despite this being a hugely complex national engineering project. That gives us confidence to be even clearer about our build plans, and we want to be as transparent as possible about where and when we're building. Today we're publishing more detail than ever about the places we're building in now, and the communities we'll be upgrading next,\" he advised.\n\nOpenreach is building its next-generation network to more than 78,000 premises every week - the equivalent of a town the size of Wakefield - and that means another home or business could order a new Full Fibre service every six seconds.\n\nOverall, around 3,500 towns, cities, boroughs, villages and hamlets are now included in the company's build programme and, as the network grows, so does the number of people wanting to benefit from this transformational technology.\n\nMore than 4.7 million homes and businesses have already upgraded to Full Fibre via dozens of communications providers using the Openreach network and demand continues to flow, with more than 50,000 orders being placed per week.\n\nOpenreach has also taken the opportunity to refresh its online map and postcode checker to give the public a clearer, regularly updated view of its plans and progress between now and 2026.\n\nThe map now shows the levels of current and future expected Full Fibre coverage as of the current day, taking data from all of its major build programmes, whilst the postcode checker continues to offer the most personalised view of the connectivity available to an individual home or business. Further updates will be provided as any additional locations are added in future.\n\nThe new map data will also continue to show regularly updated exchanges where Openreach has stopped the sale of legacy copper products where Full Fibre is available to the majority of premises (>75 per cent). By summer 2024, these 'stop sell' rules will be active in more than 700 exchanges - covering around six million premises.", "source": {"uri": "advanced-television.com", "dataType": "news", "title":

A major boost has just been confirmed that will bring vastly improved downloads to millions of homes across the UK. The upgrade is all thanks to BT's Openreach switching more locations over to Fibre to the Premises (FTTP) technology.\n\nThese latest fibre cables can offer speeds in excess of 1Gbps - that's compared to just 70Mbps when using ageing copper wires that dangle above Britain's streets. With an FTTP connection installed, you can download a full HD movie in under 40 seconds - that same film would take almost 10 minutes via copper wires.\n\nIt's really easy to see if your home is currently connected to FTTP speeds or is about to get the boost. Openreach has an easy-to-use postcode checker which shows exactly what speeds are available in your street.\n\nThere's also a new map which gives a better picture of how many homes are now connected to faster full fibre.\n\nCHECK YOUR POSTCODE HERE\n\nSome of the added locations for the FTTP boost include Tobermory in Scotland; Haworth in West Yorkshire; Saundersfoot in South Wales; Pinxton in Derbyshire, Harlow in Essex; Southampton in Hampshire; and Roborough in Devon.\n\nIt's worth remembering that although BT owns Openreach, they are not the only firm that uses this network. Other suppliers including Sky, TalkTalk, Plusnet, NOW Broadband, Vodafone and EE also beam the web into homes via Openreach's hardware.\n\nIt's hoped that by the end of 2026, 25 million homes and businesses will have access to gigabit-capable technology.\n\nSpeaking about the latest boost, Clive Selley, CEO, Openreach, said: \"This is a UK infrastructure success story. We're on track and on-budget to make this life-changing broadband technology available to 25 million homes and businesses, and no company is building faster or further in Europe, that we're aware of.\n\n\"We won't be stopping there either. We plan to build right across the UK, from cities and towns to far-flung farms and island communities. Ultimately, we'll reach as many as 30 million premises by the end of the decade if there's a supportive political and regulatory environment.\"", "source": {"uri": "mirror.co.uk", "dataType": "news",

The speed increase is due to Openreach adding more than 500 new locations to its ultrafast network, which will benefit an additional 2.7 million homes and businesses with significantly improved speeds.\n\nIt's worth noting that the existing copper lines, which are a common sight on UK streets, can only provide speeds of around 70Mbps, a far cry from the capabilities of the new fibre technology.\n\nJoin us on WhatsApp to get the latest news straight to your phone\n\nAmong the locations set to benefit from the FTTP upgrade are Tobermory in Scotland; Haworth in West Yorkshire; Saundersfoot in South Wales; Pinxton in Derbyshire, Harlow in Essex; Southampton in Hampshire; and Roborough in Devon, reports the Express.\n\nTo keep the public informed about when they can expect to see these improvements, Openreach has updated its online map and postcode checker, providing a regularly updated overview of its plans and progress up until 2026.\n\nThe updated map now displays the current and anticipated levels of Full Fibre coverage, incorporating data from all significant build programmes, while the postcode checker provides a detailed insight into the connectivity options for specific homes or businesses.\n\nThere is an expectation that by the end of 2026, gigabit-capable technology will be accessible to 25 million homes and businesses.\n\nClive Selley, CEO of Openreach, commented on the progress: \"This is a UK infrastructure success story.

Following the decision to shut down the PSTN, it was agreed to test processes for migrating customers to fibre services, and ultimately withdraw legacy copper services and the wholesale line rental products that rely on them.\n\nOpenreach's \u00a315bn project aims to upgrade the UK's broadband infrastructure, making gigabit-capable technology available to 25 million homes and businesses, including 6.2 million in rural areas. According to research by the Centre for Economic and Business Research (Cebr), full-fibre transformation could give a \u00a372bn boost to the output of the UK economy in 2030. This, said Openreach, would be the equivalent of 294,960 new SMEs being created across the country, or adding 25 new businesses in every local council in the UK.\n\nOpenreach first announced in 2019 that the PSTN will have reached the end of its life by 2025, and that new digital services will be in use by then. At the heart of the programme is the belief by BT's broadband provision division that legacy network skills and parts are increasingly difficult to come by, and that new digital services such as Voice over IP (VoIP), video conferencing and other business applications have become more popular and effective for people communicating with one another. Openreach regards the shift from copper to fibre networks as every bit as significant as the move from analogue to digital, and black and white TV to colour.\n\nIn practical terms, Openreach has been implementing what it calls a Stop Sell process that is triggered when a majority (75%) of premises connected to a particular exchange can get a full-fibre connection. Customers who then want to switch, upgrade or re-grade their broadband or phone service will have to take a new digital service over Openreach's full-fibre network.\n\nThe business is giving communications providers such as BT, Sky, TalkTalk and Vodafone, which all use its network, a year's notice that it will no longer be selling legacy analogue products and services in these circumstances. Openreach calculates that by the summer, the Stop Sell rules will be active in more than 700 exchanges - covering around six million premises.\n\nOpenreach said it's building its next-generation network to more than 78,000 premises every week, and that means another home or business could order a new full-fibre service every six seconds. More than 4.7 million homes and businesses have already upgraded to full-fibre via dozens of communications providers using the Openreach network, and demand continues to flow, with more than 50,000 orders being placed per week.\n\nOverall, around 3,500 towns, cities, boroughs, villages and hamlets are now included in the company's build programme, and, as the network grows, so does the number of people wanting to benefit from this transformational technology.\n\nThe new tranche of locations includes 400,000 premises in the hardest-to-reach, most-rural parts of the UK, including Tobermory in Scotland; Haworth in West Yorkshire; Saundersfoot in South Wales; Pinxton in Derbyshire; Harlow in Essex; Southampton in Hampshire; and Roborough in Devon.\n\nCommenting on the deployment, Openreach CEO Clive Selley said: \"This is a UK infrastructure success story. We're on track and on budget to make this life-changing broadband technology available to 25 million homes and businesses, and no company is building faster or further in Europe, that we're aware of.\n\n\"We plan to build right across the UK, from cities and towns to far-flung farms and island communities,\" he said. \"Ultimately, we'll reach as many as 30 million premises by the end of the decade if there's a supportive political and regulatory environment.\"", "source": {"uri": "computerweekly.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Computer Weekly"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

As of last December, the company had reached the halfway point, having deployed full fibre to 12.5 million premises around the country.\n\n\"We plan to build right across the UK, from cities and towns to far-flung farms and island communities. Ultimately, we'll reach as many as 30 million premises by the end of the decade if there's a supportive political and regulatory environment,\" said Clive Selley, CEO of Openreach in the press release.\n\n\"Over time, we've learnt to deliver predictably, consistently and at a rapid pace - despite this being a hugely complex national engineering project\" he continued.\n\nOpenreach is currently deploying FTTP to 78,000 new premises every week - roughly the equivalent of a town the size of Wakefield. At this build rate, Openreach will build out to the remaining 12.5 million homes in half the time it took to complete the first half of the rollout.\n\nSelley claims this is the fastest of any operator in Europe.\n\nWith the completion of the nearly announced 2.7 million premises, Openreach will have achieved its goal of passing 25 million homes with FTTP by 2026.\n\nThe importance of maintaining this aggressive rollout pace, both in urban and rural areas, is not lost on the government. In December, Minister for Data and Digital Infrastructure, John Whittingdale, said it is \"vital the industry maintains its pace of delivery, and extends if further supported by our \u00a35 billion Project Gigabit, ensuring rural and hard to reach communities do not miss out.\"\n\n\"This marks another important step in our ambition for 85 per cent of properties to have access to Gigabit-capable connections by 2025 delivering a modern digital infrastructure to every corner of the UK,\" he continued.\n\nKeep up to date with the latest international telecoms news by subscribing to the Total Telecom daily newsletter\n\nAlso in the news:\n\nUK government conditionally approves \u00a315bn Vodafone-Three merger\n\nNokia and Vodafone trial Open RAN with Arm and HPE\n\nT-Mobile and Verizon to buy US Cellular, reports say", "source": {"uri": "totaltele.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Total Telecom"}, "authors": [{"uri": "georgia_sweeting@totaltele.com", "name": "Georgia Sweeting", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Openreach", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Openreach"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fiber_to_the_x", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Fiber to the x"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Broadband", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Broadband"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Kingdom", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chief_executive_officer", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Chief executive officer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wakefield", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Wakefield"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Wakefield"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Telecommunications", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Telecommunications"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Whittingdale", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "John Whittingdale"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/U.S._Cellular", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "U.S. Cellular"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/T-Mobile", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "T-Mobile"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Verizon_Communications", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Verizon Communications"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nokia", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Nokia"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vodafone", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Vodafone"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bit", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Bit"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Government_of_the_United_Kingdom", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Government of the United Kingdom"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Europe", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Europe"}, "location": null}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Science/Social_Sciences/Urban_and_Regional_Planning", "label": "dmoz/Science/Social Sciences/Urban and Regional Planning", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Construction_and_Maintenance/Building_Types", "label": "dmoz/Business/Construction and Maintenance/Building Types", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Construction_and_Maintenance/Residential_Housing", "label": "dmoz/Business/Construction and Maintenance/Residential Housing", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Home_and_Garden/Do-It-Yourself", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Home and Garden/Do-It-Yourself", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Software/Build_Management", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Software/Build Management", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "news/Technology", "label": "news/Technology", "wgt": 65}], "image": "https://totaltele.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/qskdorpsnie-768x512.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9603756", "eventUri": "eng-9603756", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.04313725490196085, "wgt": 174, "relevance": 1}

SkyNews\n\nDavid Beckham has signed a deal to be a global ambassador for AliExpress, an online retail platform owned by Chinese technology giant Alibaba. The announcement comes as the Euros football tournament is due to kick off in Germany next month. The company did not reveal how much it is paying the former England captain. In March, AliExpress agreed an exclusive e-commerce platform partnership with European football's governing body UEFA. Under the deal, the football superstar turned entrepreneur will be the face of AliExpress' Score More promotion, which will run during games. BBC\n\nOpenreach has announced plans to build full fibre broadband in more than 500 further locations across the UK, covering an additional 2.7 million homes and businesses. The new locations include 400,000 premises in the hardest to reach, most rural parts of the country, including Tobermory in Argyll and Bute, Haworth in West Yorkshire, Saundersfoot in South Wales, Pinxton in Derbyshire, Harlow in Essex and Roborough in Devon. The work is part of Openreach's \u00a315 billion project to upgrade the UK's broadband infrastructure. ITV\n\nOliver Dowden vowed that Britain would not compromise when it came to protecting government secrets. As he announced a ban on TikTok on government devices, the Deputy Prime Minister said that \"security must always come first\". Parliament's Wi-Fi network blocked the Chinese-owned social media app a few days later. That was 14 months ago. Now, although security fears around TikTok have not disappeared, the political reality appears to have trumped them. On Sunday, Rishi Sunak embraced the video sharing app, appearing in the Conservative party account's first official TikTok to promote his policy of national service for every 18-year-old.

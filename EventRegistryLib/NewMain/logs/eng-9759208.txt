It already knows that PAS has the upper hand, so a lot of them are afraid that PAS will overwhelm Bersatu in the next general election,\" Chin told FMT.\n\nOn July 13, Muhyiddin said he did not expect Bersatu's top posts to be contested in the party elections in October thanks to negotiations at the leadership level.\n\nThe former prime minister also revealed his \"formula\" for the party polls, which would see deputy president Ahmad Faizal Azumu making way for secretary-general Hamzah Zainudin to take over the post.\n\nHamzah's current post will be offered to Selangor opposition leader Azmin Ali, while Faizal will run for one of the three vice-president's posts instead.\n\nWhile party vice-president Ronald Kiandee played this down as a mere suggestion, Bersatu's youth wing and six of its state chapters backed the plan, saying it would promote unity and ensure stability in the party.\n\nAkademi Nusantara's Azmi Hassan agreed that Muhyiddin's plan would ensure stability in Bersatu, but said that the party's leadership issues would remain.\n\nAzmi said Bersatu's main challenge was the lack of inspiring leadership from Muhyiddin, whom he described as having lost the capability to project a vision for his party.\n\n\"Yes, the party's stability would be more intact than it would be if there was competition (for the top posts), but the problem is that the arrangement doesn't change Bersatu's leadership much. Muhyiddin is still there.\n\n\"I think bringing Hamzah in won't significantly change the lack of confidence in the party leadership among members. In fact, I think it will create more dissatisfaction among them despite creating stability,\" he said.\n\nChin however said that Bersatu members had probably found the new pecking order of Muhyiddin, followed by Hamzah and then Azmin, \"acceptable\".\n\n\"It's a more or less acceptable formula in that most people think Hamzah has more support, followed by Azmin,\" he said.\n\nWhile certain factions were likely to be unhappy with Muhyiddin's leadership \"formula\", he said, they would probably lack the support to force open contests for the top posts.\n\nMeanwhile, Azmil Tayeb of Universiti Sains Malaysia said Bersatu should open up its top posts to contest and leave it to party members to vote for their preferred leaders.\n\n\"This will give Bersatu democratic credibility,\" he said. However, he said Muhyiddin's plan was not surprising as Bersatu was a splinter party of Umno's and \"still retained its culture\".\n\nUmno had a similar \"no-contest\" situation after its 2022 general assembly approved a motion for the posts of president and deputy president to go uncontested at the 2023 party elections.", "source": {"uri": "malaysia-today.net", "dataType": "news", "title": "Malaysia Today"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perikatan_Nasional", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Perikatan Nasional"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malaysian_Islamic_Party", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Malaysian Islamic Party"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malaysian_United_Indigenous_Party", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Malaysian United Indigenous Party"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muhyiddin_Yassin", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Muhyiddin Yassin"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_election", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "General election"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anwar_Ibrahim", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Anwar Ibrahim"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_Tasmania", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "University of Tasmania"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Azmin_Ali", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Azmin Ali"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ahmad_Faizal_Azumu", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Ahmad Faizal Azumu"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ronald_Kiandee", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Ronald Kiandee"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Youth_wing", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Youth wing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hamzah_Zainudin", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Hamzah Zainudin"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secretary-General_of_the_United_Nations", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Secretary-General of the United Nations"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prime_minister", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Prime minister"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leader_of_the_Opposition", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Leader of the Opposition"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Selangor", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Selangor"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Selangor"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Malaysia"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_Science,_Malaysia", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "University of Science, Malaysia"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democracy", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Democracy"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Parties", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Parties", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Parties/Planning", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Parties/Planning", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Children/Parties", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Children/Parties", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Home/Entertaining/Party_Planning", "label": "dmoz/Home/Entertaining/Party Planning", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 80}], "image": "https://www.malaysia-today.net/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Bersatu-cant-afford-open-contests-with-PAS-on-the-rise-says-analyst.webp", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9759208", "eventUri": "eng-9759208", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-07-13", "textStart": 1153, "textEnd": 1160}], "sentiment": 0.1058823529411765, "wgt": 178, "relevance": 1}
